Car Masters: Rust to Riches,Yea show seemed fake to me
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,"Yes, cringing on every build, so bad that they remind me of the quality of build of cars from our college car club."
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,Is this a TV sequel to the Tracy Chapman song 'Fast Car'?
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,"Those sound fun. I don't know from cars but enjoyed Fastest Car even though [spoiler](#s ""the accident"") broke my heart. I don't need to eat prestige TV every day; potato chips are good too."
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,[deleted]
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,"No the sequel was the PS1 game ‚ÄúFaster Car‚Äù

Edit for [reference](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JsvPUCNTjVc) "
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,How so?
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,That's exactly what I was referencing!
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,"You can't be serious.  This show is dishonest garbage.  It is painfully obvious that much of it is fake and the finished ""builds"" are not only hideous, the quality is so bad that the work would actually devalue the car in real life"
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,"I can't remember the last ""car show"" I watched. I saw this on Netflix and binge watched two seasons. I loved it. Now I'm watching Hyperdrive and Fastest Car because of it."
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,Yes! My husband & I really enjoyed watching this together! There's a couple more that are kind of like this show but they suck. We couldn't get into them.
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,"it also doesn't hurt that the girl mechanic is extremly talented in fixing cars and is incredibly attractive , constance nunes on instagram"
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,Exactly! As a paint and body guy I cringe at the horrendous garbage they push out the door. You actually have to really try hard to do such bad paint and body work. They must just assume that if they keep the cameras moving fast no one will notice. As what‚Äôs up with them going crazy with their water jet? They feel like they have to bolt on that hideous metal flames and spider webs all over every vehicle they do? They definitely devalue everything they touch. But I‚Äôd still love to put a pearl necklace on Constance üòâ
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,Hyperdrive is a lot of fun.
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,I thought she was a plant at first but she gets a look on her face when she's working on engines thats not fake.  Shes really into engines.  I get the same look when im digging into a PC Case.
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,"Kevin Smith's worked with her before and seems to be a big fan, so that makes sense."
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,Why isn't SMG continuing in the role?
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,I totally thought that the show was over lol
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,"Honestly, I know it got a lot of complaints due to He-Man not being in most of it through the first half...but it was a pretty well-done series.

It held true to the spirit of the 80s show but wasn't, y'know, Filmation crap just made to sell toys. 

I'm happy there's going to be a second season."
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,"Just keep it inside

Learn how to hide

Your feelings"
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,"I know I'm in the minority, but I'm really looking forward to the new Skeletor story arc after his final scene in the previous season. Seems creepy/badass."
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,Jewel of Wilson‚Äôs foul domain
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,"Give me some quality live-action He-Man already, damn!"
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,"Skimmimg through the article, I thought for a second that William Shatner was doing the voice for Skeletor, imagine that."
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,"Seeing as she‚Äôs literally married to He-Man, I‚Äôm not surprised."
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,Didn‚Äôt fans hate the last one of these shows that they made?
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,This show is still on?
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,"Amped they're continuing this! I thought the S2 finale could have been much better paced, but overall I really enjoyed this."
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,I really enjoyed the first season so I'm happy they are making more. Don't really have an opinion on the voice acting change.
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,"I'm going to get downvoted to hell but dear god I loathed both seasons of this show.  And Teelah was the most god awful protagonist.  She had to be coerced and pulled from one scene to the next, was joyless and just uninteresting to watch.  And that's not SMG's fault, the writing was just bad.  

To the show's credit I was interested in Evil Lynn and Orco's episode.  The animation was top notch.  

But He-Man got sidelined even Skeletor got sidelined.  And for the most part the show was a joyless slog that damaged one of my childhood heroes.  But this show wasn't for me as an 80's kid.  It sold itself as being for me, but it was a complete bait and switch."
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,Super
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,"Definitely an upgrade. Though I don‚Äôt think her husband had a great He-Man voice. A good Adam but he lacked that booming bass from the 80s show.

Edit: Melissa Benoist as Wolverine‚Äôs daughter:

https://youtu.be/YJku_F1cXow"
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,She was super girl right?
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,Didn‚Äôt they already ruin this franchise?
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,"Is this a new, new series or a continuation?"
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,I'm honestly surprised this show is getting another season. The first was a monster turd.
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,Awe that sucks! I thought she did a great job! I hope it's just a scheduling conflict
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,How has this not been cancelled yet?
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,"My take is it just needs to be a ‚ÄúHe-Man‚Äù show‚Ä¶ like the original was‚Ä¶ 

And then, at least, all us OG He-Man fans would love it. Because we loved that show. 

You can always make a different show, centered around a different character, and still call it ‚ÄúHe-Man.‚Äù You can do that, it‚Äôs a free country, but then you risk alienating the people that liked and enjoyed the original show. 

Maybe you can have greater success without the original fans‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs possible‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs not the direction I would have gone with the IP."
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,"The actual star of He-Man, Teela is getting an new actor? 

Somehow, some way, we shall be okay."
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,"This is such a lowkey powerhouse piece of IP. New toy line, two animated series and a live action show all in the last ~5 years."
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,‚Ä¶..and it‚Äôs cancelled
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,Idek what another season would be about. Teela is the most powerful being in history and STILL has He-Man for backup
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,this dumpster fire gets a season 2? and yet netflix cancels good shows? what kind of power does kevin smith hold over netflix?
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,Okay but like... give that the first part was awful why even bother.
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,Why won‚Äôt Sarah Michelle Gellar reprise the role? I really love anything that she‚Äôs involved in.
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,I like Melissa and I like the symmetry ofThe Vampire Slayer being replaced by Supergirl
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,"Netflix cancels shows people give a shit about, but greenlights one of the most derided misfires of the last decade? Oof. If even SMG didn't want anything to do with it you know this shit is even more DOA than the first series."
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,Good. She was miscast.
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,"Bruh, Masters Of The Universe series does Netflix have?"
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,"I don‚Äôt think SMG was good in the role, but I also don‚Äôt think the show was very good period."
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,Would anyone even care?
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,"Please don‚Äôt destroy my childhood, I can‚Äôt go through another Footloose situation"
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,I wouldn‚Äôt touch that project with a 50 ft pole either.
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,This show was utter garbage
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,Netflix canceled so much. Why are they making this trash?
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,"That is going to continue?
Bold move from Netflix."
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,Boooo
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,Are we doing another He-Man-less He-Man cartoon again?
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,Why not the show as a multiverse then you can have both women as the character?
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,I always wonder if those actors whom rejects roles still filthy rich or what got on their minds to pass important roles.
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,"That show, it's fans & haters. Lol"
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,"I thought that the season was told out of order. They second half of the season should have been shown first, with minor tweaks to have it flow better, and the second half be second. It'll give us fans some time with the characters before killing them off. Then kill them off in the fifth episode for some shocks value and then continue with how the episodes in the first half but now the second half. It works out wonderfully and the series might have actually been better."
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,"I hated this show and say that with full confidence after watching too many episodes of it. I'm utterly shocked it's getting another season or that Netflix will waste money on it versus other shows like Mindhunters, etc."
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,‚Ä¶ and hosting me too like some brain-dead AOL-er
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,Whatever her projects and films I'm always support her.  She's the greatest super girl.
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,Had no idea this was in the works
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,"Plus the voice actor for He-Man is her husband, they met while working together on Supergirl."
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,"They are friends, and he likes giving his friends work."
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,"She doesn‚Äôt like to work. 

I don‚Äôt mean that in a disparaging way. 

She comes and goes as she pleases within show business, choosing carefully when she works and when she doesn‚Äôt so that she can take care of her family. With her already producing and starring in a show, she likely just doesn‚Äôt want to work on a second one at the same time."
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,They did not say.
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,I‚Äôm assuming she will be busy filming season 2 of her new Paramount+ show.
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,Maybe she watched the first series
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,"if it isn't scheduling conflict or her being too buzy , maybe it's because of the reaction to her character in season 1 as she was mostly the lead instead of He-man and grown men took that personally."
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,You didn't catch the final episode's teaser?
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,"I'm kinda surprised it was renewed.  I have no strong feelings about it (watched the first episode and a half, decided it wasn't for me), but it was an odd choice to try to harness the nostalgia of He-Man fans, and then write He-Man and Skeletor out of the show in the first episode, lol.

People tried to pretend online that the backlash was just about sexism, but like Ghostbusters 2016, the backlash is probably just because you made something that sucks."
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,"Genuinely, compared to Transformers War For Cybertron it was a fucking masterpiece."
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,AND HE PRAYS!
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,I just wanna link [this legendary cover](https://youtube.com/watch?v=C7Q10bfWEMQ&si=EnSIkaIECMiOmarE)
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,A lullaby the breezes whisper..
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,"I didn't hate having Teela be the fous but I DID hate turning Skeletor into Joker and giving him the same exact abusive relationship with Evil Lynn.

We get it Kevin, you love batman and Mark Hamill but come up with something original."
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,I think it was over hated and I loved some aspects of it.  I do kinda question the direction it took though.  Who takes a show called HE-MAN and decides to make it mostly about the female side character?  Its odd.  Like a Barbie reboot that focused entirely on Ken.  But it was still overall enjoyable.
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,I didn't watxh the original  but the show was 80% good but the 20% that was bad really slowed down the show. Like you would have this great story then we would stop and focus on 1 issue or character and pause everything else. Made the show clunky. I am sure there is a version with a little editing it would be really good.
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,I loved it.
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,"No, just noisy Internet people."
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,Yes we did
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,"They wanted to flesh out the side characters so they took away He-man and Skeletor for the first half of the season and ""killed"" them off. Anyone with a half a brain knew they were coming back but half brains complained about wokeness because Teela was the main character. He-man and Skeletor come back in the second half of the season. The whole thing was done really well. Outside of the Fisto jokes that were cringey and get old quick I enjoyed it."
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,They watched it and talked about it. It doesn't matter if they liked it or not.
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,Hard to say. A certain portion of the internet definitely complained the loudest (many after not watching it or only watching the first episode or two) but if it got picked up apparently Netflix was happy with the numbers. So not sure it wasn't more noise than anything.
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,"It's nice to see people can finally dislike the show on this sub without being downvoted to oblivion and called sexist. I'm glad people have chilled out a bit.

I had a more mixed reaction to the show. Teela was a real drag and although Evil Lyn started off great, her character and arc fell apart after she supplanted Skeletor as the main villain. The side characters (including Adam which is weird to say about a He-Man show) were handled well though, so I think the show has some untapped potential if Smith forgets about the culture war and just writes a good show. I am cautiously optimistic about a second (or third? Who even knows with Netflix's release strategy) season."
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,"> nd for the most part the show was a joyless slog that damaged one of my childhood heroes. 

Watching old He-Man cartoons as an adult damaged the show/character for me."
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,The show is utter trash. Just awful.
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,"No one without a paper thin agenda is going to drag you over shitting on a Kevin Smith production

Although, i‚Äôll give credit where it‚Äôs due, the Clerks cartoon was pretty good and probably the last decent thing he worked on."
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,Not sure if I totally agree with it being an upgrade.
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,Yup
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,sounds like a continuation
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,Was also hoping it would start fresh. But no.
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,Maybe her role in Wolf Pack?
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,The new He-Man show was mostly derided by a few weirdos on YouTube and their fans who didn't watch it; it's great.
Car Masters: Rust to Riches,"Huge fan other both MotU and SMG and I have to agree. Not the only one in that series either. I loved how much it celebrated the original toys and show but somehow it all came together as a meh show. Still glad we‚Äôre getting more, though."
Norm Macdonald Has a Show,thank god for the hatchery

Norm Macdonald Has a Show,[deleted]
Norm Macdonald Has a Show,"I'm really not liking Netflix lately.

For a time, it was about premium content and premium shows.

Now, they're trying to just fill every void found in cable, which I think is a fools errand. 

The casual audience already watches Netflix. What are they hoping to accomplish? A 10 year plan to split off Netflix into several products? Netflix daytime, Netflix at the Movies, Netflix MiniSeries? Netflix Standup?

Now that I say that out loud, it seems like it's exactly what they're trying to do."
Norm Macdonald Has a Show,"Great news, but I'm just baffled that this article mentions David Spade in the headline, and not, y'know, someone better."

Norm Macdonald Has a Show,"As long as Norm doesn't fall into the trap of making it yet another ""all Trump, all the time"" political comedy show, he should be fine. His old show was fantastic and this should be too as long as Netflix keeps its hands off it and allows him to do his thing."

a celebrity or entertaining host talks about shit for an hour.. there are often celebrity guests promoting new shows or movies, and sometimes there well be an opening humorous monologue covering current events

Norm Macdonald Has a Show,"I‚Äôve met him in person once and saw him do stand up.

He was much funnier in a bar siting with drew carey than he was on stage.


(When drew carey had his show he gave tons of free tickets to Marines to watch it being tapped so did norm McDonald.  He was hanging out with drew carey and drew carey invited a few of us Marines to a comedy club/bar.

Norm Macdonald Has a Show,They gave Michelle Wolfe and Joel McHale no time
Norm Macdonald Has a Show,"They signed Chelsea Handler to a huge $10m deal not just for the talkshow but also comedy specials. Even with that they still only could do 2 seasons, and cut the show from 3 eps a week to 1. It's a little bit different than Wolf and McHale, who had more conventional series deals and were cancelled pretty quickly. Same with Norm, he right now just has a deal for 10 episodes."
Norm Macdonald Has a Show,Norm has done enough interviews calling Trump jokes weak and low hanging fruit. He‚Äôs definitely not someone who would compromise his values. 
Norm Macdonald Has a Show,"I don't know how Norm feels about Trump specifically. He [claims to wish Trump weren't president](https://twitter.com/normmacdonald/status/926012032268222464?lang=en), but is then critical of those who spend so much time criticizing Trump.

[He claims he's not a conservative](https://twitter.com/normmacdonald/status/841839986680856576?lang=en), but I get the impression that he leans more right-wing than left. Probably he's someone who believes that both sides are the same. 



Either way, I don't think you'll have to worry about him making Trump jokes. 

"
Norm Macdonald Has a Show,What about OJ Simpsons Jokes all the time?
Norm Macdonald Has a Show,"Norm is the kinda guy who beats to his own drum, so I wouldn't be too worried. "
Norm Macdonald Has a Show,"Yeah, I wouldn't worry about that. Netflix gave Larry the Cable Guy and Jeff Foxworthy a comedy special. The continue to renew that 13 Reasons Why show and had no issues putting out Insatiable despite the outcries from Parents groups and screaming about fat-shaming or whatever.

Netflix cares about viewers, and that's it. If Norm brings in eyeballs, they really don't give a shit if he cracks a few jokes that the humorless don't appreciate."
The Dragon Prince,"November 3

All I wanted to know"
The Dragon Prince,"I enjoyed the show, but I've completely forgotten what happened in the past seasons."
The Dragon Prince,Season 4 of 7? I suppose I will watch this. I've heard nothing but good things and at only 9 episodes a season it's a quick binge.
The Dragon Prince,"Welp, pretty much lost all hope for a self-realization/redemption arc for >!Claudia, bet that hair is totally white by the end of this season.!<

...^  I'm not sure if the above needs to be spoilereded, but I did it just to be safe."
The Dragon Prince,The GOAT
The Dragon Prince,"ITS BACK!!!!!!!!
 
One of the best animated shows in recent times. I am so excited."
The Dragon Prince,"I need to watch the previous season at least to remember everything.

I would like to underline that this show is diversity done right, orientation, ethnicity, gender etc fit seamlessly and transparently in the plot, a character is not reduced to a skin color, a gender, an orientation etc. characters are well developed, It's nice to see."
The Dragon Prince,Exciting!  And with a tiny time-skip.
The Dragon Prince,I came here thinking .. Daemon?
The Dragon Prince,Is this any good?
The Dragon Prince,"UUUUUUUUUUuuuuuugh.   
Time jumps. Ticking clock. Amaya has a stupid side cut and is now gay for Janai because of course she does and is.   
I was really excited about this show coming back but this whole trailer screams ""we have no idea how to follow up all that cool shit we set up last season so we gonna spin some wheels for awhile after taking our sweet time to drop this next season."""
The Dragon Prince,4 seasons and the animation is still garbage
The Dragon Prince,"No, not the one that bangs his niece, the other Dragon Prince."
The Dragon Prince,"For all of those who care, here is me, eating my words.

I genuinely thought the show was dead."
The Dragon Prince,"Guys, if you watch the trailer closely you can see that the air elf, that tought callum to use wings, is killed in his fight against claudia, it is so obvious and will probably happened in the 3rd episode or something.

This will truly be the darkest season."
The Dragon Prince,Glad to see a time jump like they've been talking about. I might need to read a recap before starting though.
The Dragon Prince,"This has to be my favourite animated show of all time, and generally one of the best pieces of fiction. I‚Äôm more excited for Season 4, than I am for Christmas, and the fact it‚Äôs dropping in only a few week is literally surreal. 

Between the incredible world-building, colourful cast of characters, intriguing plot, and some of the coolest fantasy lore‚Ä¶ needless to say, I‚Äôm so fucking excited. The return to Xadia CANNOT come any faster."
The Dragon Prince,You‚Äôre doing good work here
The Dragon Prince,Thankfully each season is relatively short so it would be very easy to binge to catch up again.
The Dragon Prince,"Yeah, how long has it been since Season 3 dropped?"
The Dragon Prince,[deleted]
The Dragon Prince,"i mean, i was randomly thinking a few days ago that it was such a shame they had canceled the series after only one season, only to now find out its in the 4th season... üòÖüòÖüòÖ"

Gotta rack up the evil points first."
The Dragon Prince,"I mean they threw in some shots of her like play fighting with what looked like a Moon Elf warrior, so maybe that's a new romantic interest for her to shake things up a bit?"
The Dragon Prince,"There were some scenes released of the new season, did you see those?"
The Dragon Prince,"this will be a show will a cult following in the next decade.  Just like ATLA before it, it has such strong  serialized storytelling and clearly has a complete story to tell"
The Dragon Prince,"I wouldn't exactly call 3 years ""tiny"" lol!."
The Dragon Prince,"I just binged the first 3 seasons (9 episodes each) a few months ago and am very happy I only have to wait a few more weeks for the next season. 

It's very good, but not for everyone. If you're looking for super dark/mature this isn't it but if you're down for a kids show with some adult themes and not afraid to get serious at times, then give it a try.

The head writer from Avatar the Last Airbender is in charge on this show and the voice of Sokka voices the main character. It's definitely in line with Avatar in terms of balancing humor for both kids and adults. 

The animation in the 1st season can be a bit wonky (the framerate is slow in some scenes for some reason) but they smoothed it out after the first 9 episodes. 

I'd give it a recommendation, especially if you're a fan of Avatar or animation in general"
The Dragon Prince,One of my favourite animated shows.
The Dragon Prince,I‚Äôll never understand what people‚Äôs issue is with the animation. I love it.
The Dragon Prince,"Nahh Netflix greenlit all 7 seasons like at least two years ago. I think they had pandemic related issues, as they were a new studio just setting up."
The Dragon Prince,There's 47 new shows every week who has time to rewatch anything!?
The Dragon Prince,It premiered 3 years ago.
The Dragon Prince,"iirc it's been around 2 years which sounds like it's being folded into the storyline as well.

although I think part of it was due to them waiting for Netflix renewals and also COVID-related setbacks."
The Dragon Prince,">  they won't actually show those events on the show. 

they won't but its was referenced. Rayla left on his birthday as in the trailer and GN"
The Dragon Prince,"lmao!. Good time to watch it. They smoothed out the animation after season 1 too, as it was really stiff and the characters moved like they were skipping frames. S1 was pretty rough. It was a decent set up but the animation was very distracting. Whereas 2 and 3 are really good."
The Dragon Prince,Not attacking you but I have no idea who can watch S1 and not notice the poor animation quality.  Gotta be like 15 fps at  some points lmao.
The Dragon Prince,honestly it was bit jarring on in some scenes but rest was decent.
The Dragon Prince,Case in point: **Catra**
The Dragon Prince,10 bucks says the moon elf dies and she snaps.  (hope im wrong though)
The Dragon Prince,"You should check out the released scenes (I think there's at least two), before they released this trailer."
The Dragon Prince,"looks like they were genuinely trying to kill each other in one scene, so I imagine w/e she's planning conflicts with his ideals and they become enemies.

Edit: i was wrong that was a different Elf, and now i've been outed as a racist, dammitt!"
The Dragon Prince,It‚Äôs not super mature but it is thematically much darker than Avatar IMO. (Also not as good of course)
The Dragon Prince,"and here I am trying to find something new to watch lol.

Any good animated recommendations?"
The Dragon Prince,47!?. You trying to keep up with every show from every culture?.
The Dragon Prince,47 new shows? can you list them all out of curiosity that's real specific
The Dragon Prince,Has it really been 3 years?
The Dragon Prince,"Apparently they also wanted to secure netflex to 7 seasons.
Which they succeeded in."
The Dragon Prince,"They use 3D, but want to look 2D so they decided to cut the fps. season 3 looks fine

season 1 is so bad tho lmao, you kinda get used to it but man, it's rough at first"
The Dragon Prince,"Agreed. The janky way of how the characters moved was very distracting. It really felt like they were skipping frames.  The jump in quality (both animation and in writing) is very noticeable. I remember even just from the first scene of season 2 I was like ""wow, this is smooth!""."
The Dragon Prince,"and rakc them up she did, Woman made the cookie monster look generous."
The Dragon Prince,"Hopefully not at the hands of Callum or Rayla, through an accident or misunderstanding. This show has been good about avoiding tropes and that would be a misstep."
The Dragon Prince,"lol it's fine. Elves have shown themselves to be a fairly racist lot on their own. But this does open up an interesting possibility: we know now that there was a time jump between the seasons, a large one, so what if that play fighting scene with that one elf takes place in that jump instead of after? Could be some interesting character fuel for Claudia if she had a romance that went bad."
The Dragon Prince,"To add on to the anime on netflix by the guy below.

Vinland Saga (Viking anime, one of my favorites)

Spriggan (ancient myths + action)

Great Pretender (con-artist stuff)

Violet Evergarden (emotional as hell, beautiful story and visuals)

High-Score Girl (geeky romcom)

And if you wanna see dudes beat the shit out of each other: Baki."
The Dragon Prince,"I've been enjoying:

Harley Quinn, 
Central Park, 
Little Demon, 
Solar Opposites, 
Rick and Morty, 
and Lower Decks"
The Dragon Prince,"There is this art school anime Blue Period that has a lot of heart. A slice of life style anime.

Cyberpunk is a wild ride dripping with blood sex and adrenaline 

If you like Gundam, Iron Blooded Orphans will make you oh and aw, and then nearly cry

Bubble is a beautiful anime, a group of kids play competitive speed parkour in a low gravity, flooded Tokyo 

All on Netflix"
The Dragon Prince,"I'll always try to spread the word of Pantheon, severely underrated and not nearly talked about."
The Dragon Prince,"Arcane. If you haven't watched it... You're in for a treat!
Favourite show of all time for me."
The Dragon Prince,"Fuck I'll just wait til all seven are out.  This is ridiculous, gonna be 10+ years for the series to end."
The Dragon Prince,Are these in English?
The Dragon Prince,Should be a lot faster now. Probs one a year.
The Dragon Prince,"No, the only reason it took so long between S3 and S4 is because of the late renewal. IIRC, the show didn't get renewed until some time after S3 was already released. This means they essentially had to start S4 from scratch (probably needing to rehire people too), when normally a lot of the work would have been done before the previous season even released. 

Now all planned seasons are renewed, the turnaround will be a lot faster."
The Dragon Prince,Pretty sure they all have dubs yeah.
The Dragon Prince,"The multi season shows tend to release every six months with these kinds of deals.

For anyone who wants some good animation; She-Ra, Voltron, Dragon Prince, Kipo and the Age of the Wonderbeasts, Owl House, Gravity Falls (especially), Amphibia, Star Vs the Forces of Evil, Kyou Kara Maru, Gravitation, How to Train your Dragon, Regular Show, Close Enough (perfect for millennial parents), Gargoyles, Lower Decks, Rick and Morty, Solar Opposites, Over the Garden Wall, Hilda, Kung Fu Panda the series, We Bare Bears, both Avatar series, Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated, Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy, Invader Zim, Adventure Time, The Hollow,  the Clone Wars and Rebels, Inside Job, Hilda...

If anyone wants a specific suggestion then let me know. This is only including two anime but I can suggest some of that too."
The Dragon Prince,Thanks.
The Dragon Prince,Didn‚Äôt even know a season four was incoming. Great to hear
The Dragon Prince,"TDP is a great show, however this two year gap has definitely hurt it. Plus getting people to give it a fair shake after the controversial animation style in Season 1 is tricky. The writing is simply top-notch though.   

Keep in mind TDP's creator (Aaron Ehasz) was the head writer on Avatar: TLAB and *not* on Korra. When you watch TDP, TLAB, and Korra back, you can really see what he is bringing to the table in TLAB that was lacking in Korra, and what makes TDP so good. It is why I worry about these animated Avatar spin-offs they're doing, they have some of the original creative team, but not Aaron Ehasz.     

PS - And I'm not hating on Korra, it was absolutely fine, and was hurt a lot creatively by constant cancellations/short-renews. I am just saying that even Korra at its best wasn't TLAB tier."
The Dragon Prince,Finally
The Dragon Prince,I fucking hate this animation style with a vengeance but I've this story and it's ideas so much I put up with it... imagine of it was done avatar style or even clone wars.
The Dragon Prince,"Wow didn't know the new season was premiering so soon, wanted rewatch the show before starting the new season."
The Dragon Prince,Good quality?  Or should I just wait a week for the official release?
The Dragon Prince,"In glorious 12fps, as is tradition for the show.

I *really* hate that animation is purposefully leaning towards this style in in the past 5-10 years. It is fucking everywhere and the only time it fully worked is the lego movie and somewhat worked (and is still not my preference) was spiderverse."
The Dragon Prince,"Is this a continuation of the story or a new story?

Is this the final season?

Why did it take so long to come out?"
The Dragon Prince,Please do not quote me but I believe the team secured 7 seasons. So you're in luck!
The Dragon Prince,I love all 3 series. But if you want to talk about deficits then you should acknowledge what TLAB and TDP are missing in comparison to Korra. They lack consistent maturity and they explore different themes maybe a couple times per season. Whereas Korra was more inclusive across age groups with its maturity. They werent afraid to spend prolonged time exploring themes that you wouldn't normally see in a Nickolodeon sponsored production.
The Dragon Prince,"The three year absence, the two year time jump, and Amaya's just stupid AF new haircut are all really hurting my excitement for this season.   
Plus I'm now hearing that a lot of story was told in some graphic novel and table top game that may or may not be referenced but not explained in this new season."
The Dragon Prince,It also shows what Mike and Bryan brought to the table that TDP was lacking. Mike and Bryan make much more interesting decisions with their world and take more risks to tell original stories imo.
The Dragon Prince,God I really gotta find time to watch this show.
The Dragon Prince,Agreed. Any time I join a fandom I delve into fandom but TDP has almost no fanart or fics or RPs. Which is so strange as the world is ripe for it.
The Dragon Prince,it tells a great story for sure.
The Dragon Prince,"I really hope this show continues to improve. Something about it is off and I can‚Äôt pinpoint what it is.


I wonder if this show ^^^^(and the abuse allegations) will cause the Avatar guys to drop him from future stuff."
The Dragon Prince,I disagree. Korra at its best is better than ATLA imo.
The Dragon Prince,Hot take time: Korra is better than ATLA
The Dragon Prince,Korra way better
The Dragon Prince,"Eh after watching the three seasons I dont think TDP is as good as either avatar shows. Ehasz is a good writer but people are starting to give him more credit than he deserves for ATLA. 

TDP has some very big glaring flaws in its writing that imo holds it back from being as good as either avatar show. I also thought the World building was rather subpar too. 

For all the talk that Bryke needed Ehasz, I think tdp shows Ehasz also needs Bryke."
The Dragon Prince,"""So soon?"" It's been three years since the last season."
The Dragon Prince,"I agree, but it is easier to animate overall from I have heard in other places. Animators can model everything in 3D and then set the models in action with a camera following it. As opposed to 2D when they had to hand draw everything."
The Dragon Prince,I WILL quote you because that's accurate! The whole saga will be 7 seasons total.
The Dragon Prince,yep they announced it back in Comic Con 2019?
The Dragon Prince,"This. I've enjoyed TDP enough, but I've struggled to be enamored with it the way I am with ATLA or Korra."
The Dragon Prince,"I don't think so really. For example, who's idea was Toph? Mike and Bryan originally wanted a stereotypical, cookie-cutter big muscly earthbending guy. Aaron Ehasz wanted it to be a little blind girl. [They resisted the idea at first and took a lot of convincing to come around to his side.](https://youtu.be/DtCsrnQ1Wl4?t=89) Thankfully, the rest is history. So uhh, who was taking the risks with ATLA again?"
The Dragon Prince,"The short 9 episode seasons probably don't help. It doesn't leave a lot of time to develop things, or world build. Info dumps and exposition can help, but that goes against ""show don't tell""."
The Dragon Prince,"> I wonder if this show ^(and the abuse allegations) will cause the Avatar guys to drop him from future stuff.

Holy crap, what did he do? Did he violate someone or--oh.

*According to CBR writer Meagan Damore, in November 2019, a female former employee of Ehasz who never worked at Wonderstorm, alleged him of bringing ""his children to work and leave them with female production staff members without asking"", treating her ""like his own personal assistant (..) transitioning her editorial duties to a group and shut down her ideas.""[7] Freelance writer Samantha Nelson in November 2019 reported that several women claimed ""Ehasz had created an abusive environment for women (..) ignored, belittled, and gaslit his female employees"".*

So he wasn't the ideal boss. He brought his kids to work. He asked his employees to do tasks for him. Also vague allegations of how he made people 'feel' ignored or mislead, that he can't prove or disprove. It sounds to me like she wasn't a great employee, she suggested ideas that didn't gel with him, he delegated some of her workload to a group, and she fostered a grudge over it. The horror.

What a stupid reason to drop someone for anything and what a pointless, clickbait, hit piece article to churn out by Damore."
The Dragon Prince,"That‚Äôs awesome, I gotta see the schedule though because if the delays are this long I might wait a bit. Honestly forgot what happened at this point besides some plot points"
The Dragon Prince,">Aaron Ehasz wanted it to be a little blind girl.

Attributing everything about Toph all because Aaron advocated for her to be a girl is a claim that I don't think can be substantiated. There's no evidence that he designed the character (A little girl) , gave her personality (the episode she debuts in is written by one of the creators), or that she was blind."
The Dragon Prince,"They literally made Korra, the main character, physically crippled and debilitated by trauma induced depression. What is your point, exactly?"
The Dragon Prince,"> So uhh, who was taking the risks with ATLA again?

I like TDP, but it‚Äôs world literally just another bland Eurocentric fantasy to throw on the pile of all the other Eurocentric fantasies. Wow what a risk."
The Dragon Prince,"I can't say the wont be any delays, but the initial delays were to give the staff time to plan, write and storyboard the rest of the seasons. I'd imagine that means the next batches will come much quicker"
The Dragon Prince,"To the point you mentioned about her being blind, the creators say in the video that I already posted that she (or he originally) was planned to be blind from the beginning, so I don't think that point was in contention at all.

I was only addressing the comment I replied to on the subject of *taking risks* in story telling specifically. I wasn't trying to claim that he's responsible for the entirety of her character, and there is nothing in my comment to suggest that. I merely said: making Toph a little girl instead of a stereotypical muscly type was a big risk, and that Ehasz, not Mike and Bryan, was responsible for that. I made no claims in excess of that."
Boca Juniors Confidential,The OA cancelation made me not too happy.
Boca Juniors Confidential,"Lilyhammer, one of the first! Also personal fan of Hemlock grove"
Boca Juniors Confidential,"My top 10

- 1st Dark

- 2nd Russian Doll

- 3rd The Queen's Gambit

- 4th Narcos

- 5th Stranger Things

- 6th Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency (BBC America coproduction)

- 7th The Woman in the House Across the Street from the Girl in the Window

- 8th Sense8

- 9th Unorthodox

- 10th Black Mirror (S1-S2 are from Channel 4, S3-S5 are Netflix Original)

My watchlist (what I'm going to watch next): Ozark, Inside Job, Godless."
Boca Juniors Confidential,No love for the Mike Flanagan shows?
Boca Juniors Confidential,"I think Netflix has really become disappointing in recent years. When they first got into original programming, they would develop these really amazing shows that were unlike anything else on television. But ever since they cancelled Sense8, they have started premiering more average programming. 

My favorite Netflix originals:

1. Bojack Horseman: Became one of my all-time favorite shows rather quickly and really revolutionised for me what adult animation can do. 6 almost flawless seasons and I think it should have gone one for 1-2 more seasons.
2. Orange Is The New Black: I am generally a huge fan of shows with female leads, and this was really one groundbreaking and entertaining show. I feel like its impact and popularity is almost forgotten by now, but I think it was one of the shows that really defined what streaming could do. I also think it found a great ending. 
3. Sense8: This was not a perfect show, but a beautiful concept, connecting people from different backgrounds and promoting international friendships, which few shows do. Additionally, it was pretty amazing to actually see a show shoot in all these different locations all over the world.
4. Glow: Again, I really love female-centred shows and this was no exception. Great performances by a great cast all around.
5. Russian Doll: Same as Orange Is The New Black or Bojack Horseman, I think Russian doll really drives home the fact that streaming services like Netflix can tell different stories from traditional outlets.
6. Tuca and Bertie: It died too sun on Netflix, but thank god it was revived on Adult Swim. Different enough from Bojack Horseman to stand on its own, but sharing a lot of the same sensibilities that made Bojack fun.
7. The OA: Again, this is not a perfect show for me, but what I really loved about this show was how different it was from your usual fare and how different the story was told. It felt more like a good book than a TV series, which many streaming series aspire to, but really actually achieve in doing.
8. Dead to Me: This show is not as great as many of the others, but the chemistry of the two leads is iressistible.
9. Stranger Things: A little bit overhyped, but creative.
10. Jessica Jones: My favorite of the Marvel shows. (Actually the only one I watched more than one season of.)"

Boca Juniors Confidential,Iweather you have or have not watched bojack I urge you to reconsider
Boca Juniors Confidential,">When They See Us

One of the hardest shows to watch. Damn I felt bad for them."
Boca Juniors Confidential,Dark should be top this list
Boca Juniors Confidential,"There are a lot more Netflix originals that I really like that unfortunately didn't make the list: Unorthodox, Mindhunter, The Queen's Gambit, Quicksand (St√∂rst av allt), Unbelievable, Altered Carbon, Sintonia, Bridgerton, Easy etc.  
  
Also, as for other acquired/co-produced content that I chose to not put on the list: Alias Grcae, Kalifat, Parfum, La Casa de Papel, La cocinera de Castamar, Crash Landing on You etc. are all great television.  
  
*But anyways, since this is a pm\_me\_reason\_to\_livx list, ya kno what I gotta do....*

Boca Juniors Confidential,OITNB is great. I watched the first 4 seasons.
Boca Juniors Confidential,[deleted]
Boca Juniors Confidential,I see you haven‚Äôt watched bojack horseman in my opinion that is the best Netflix original
Boca Juniors Confidential,What's going on with that Master of None write up?
Boca Juniors Confidential,[deleted]
Boca Juniors Confidential,"Thanks, cool list! Some shows I havent heard before"
Boca Juniors Confidential,I would say that Babylon Berlin and BoJack Horseman are the best.
Boca Juniors Confidential,"Way late to this post but definitely recommend ‚Äúthe last kingdom‚Äù one of their best shows, just finished its last season and then will end with a movie. Also the show ‚Äúrussian doll‚Äù had a fantastic s1 and returns for s2 in 1 day, highly recommend that one as well, very quick watch too because it‚Äôs 30m episodes and only 8 per season."
Boca Juniors Confidential,"Maid, Unbelievable and Mindhunter."
Boca Juniors Confidential,I loved Hemlock Grove.
Boca Juniors Confidential,"Lilyhammer was so good. But unfortunately it was cancelled too soon, the show does not have an ending :("
Boca Juniors Confidential,I like The Haunting of Hill House a lot.
Boca Juniors Confidential,"I've seen everyone of those besides Between, Helix and Cobra Kai. And I'm almost sure they're not Netflix originals."
Boca Juniors Confidential,Bloodline season 1 was one of the best seasons of television I‚Äôve ever seen. Unfortunately season 2 killed it and 3 buried it in an unmarked grave. Should have been a limited series.
Boca Juniors Confidential,It's the reason why I haven't given it a rewatch yet. I just can't bare all that pain again.
Boca Juniors Confidential,Ah feel ya. *But Desenfrenadas tho*.
Boca Juniors Confidential,[deleted]
Boca Juniors Confidential,"You know, 100+ Netflix series yet I've never actually seen House of Cards. lol. I must acknowledge it though because it's one of the most popular Netflix OGs. But personally, politics? Big *naaaaaaah* for me."
Boca Juniors Confidential,Because it's bad
Boca Juniors Confidential,I've watched Bojack Horseman.
Boca Juniors Confidential,"*I don't know what they want from me, it's like... the more money we come across, the more problems we seeeeee!*"
Boca Juniors Confidential,"lol, this comment. check some out tho."
Boca Juniors Confidential,"One of the first chopping block regrets, but not the last"
Boca Juniors Confidential,Between and Cobra Kai are Netflix originals. Helix is a cancelled Syfy series.
Boca Juniors Confidential,I never plan to rewatch it. Ain't going through that again.
Boca Juniors Confidential,"Yea I've seen Marco Polo. The closest thing to it I guess is Kingdom. Vikings Vanhalla is close to that time period as well, but I think it's *where* Marco Polo is set that makes it unique and not *when*."
Boca Juniors Confidential,Man the first season is peak television
Boca Juniors Confidential,"Great list----there are only six of the shows you listed, including Desafrenadas, that I've never heard of, but they definitely sound worth checking out because of your descriptions of them. Here's a couple of faves of mine on Netflix, some of which I didn't finish before they got taken off, and some I haven't finished yet, along with one I'd like to see, and haven't seen yet:

1.The Protector----a Turkish fantasy-thriller that lasted four seasons, with 10 half-hour episodes for each season. It's about a young guy who runs a shop with his father, who discovers after a tragedy that he's been chosen as the Protector, and that he's part of an ancient people with superpowers who fight the demons, called the Immortals, that are trying to take over the world. I've seen only one season so far, but it was pretty good, and fun to see a fantasy action series with a Turkish take on it.

2. Paranormal--- Netflix's second Middle Eastern series (after their first one, a Jordanian series called Jinn, which lasted one season). It's set in 1960s Egypt (where it was actually shot, because it's based on a popular series of horror books by an Egyptian author, Ahmed Tawfik.) It's about a hemotologist and college professor named Refaat Ismail who finds himself literally haunted by ghosts from his past, even tough he dosen't believe in the supernatural. He also finds himself caught up in a whirlwind of curses and supernatural terror anyway soon after he comes in contact with a mummy that he winds up stealing to de-curse it, along with another man who's trying to stop the mummy from cursing everything else around it. He, the dude trying to do the un-curses, and his crush, another professor named Maggie, wind up going to the desert, being chased by demon creatures and haunted by other things. Really fun and lively old-school show, only six episodes. It's supposed to get a second season later this year---I enjoyed the first season, so looking forward to the second.

Liked three of the Marvel shows----Luke Cage, Jessica Jones, and Daredevil---but my laptop conked out the same week all three shows were leaving Netflix for Disney Plus and I didn't get a chance to finish watching them, lol.

La Reina del Sur---a Mexican drama about a woman who winds up on the run after her drug dealer boyfriend is murdered to another country, where she winds up being too close to some more major drug and trying to keep her head above water. This long-running popular telenovela inspired a reboot of the series back around 2017, I believe, and an American version of the show called Queen of the South. It's very exciting and action-packed all way."
Boca Juniors Confidential,"Cobra Kai wouldnt count for this list because the first season aired on youtube, i think"
Boca Juniors Confidential,"For real-----even though I'm old enough to recall when the real case jumped off back in the day, and even after seeing the Ken Burns documentary that finally told the Central Five's side of their stories---When They See Us, which was very well made, was still difficult as hell for me to watch, knowing that these young boys--which is exactly all they were, no matter how demonized and hatefully stigmatized they were at the time, mainly because they were black---were going to jail and put through literal hell for a crime none of them committed. Yeah, they survived, but some of them still bear the scars of what they went through, and what it took to survive that, even today.

The second youngest of the Exonerated Five, as they now are able to call themselves, Yuself Salaam, wrote a book last year about his experiences called Bitter, Not Better: Living In The Pursuit Of Racial Justice, that's worth reading. Here's a review of it: [One Of The Falsely Accused Five Tells His Story](https://www.npr.org/2021/05/18/997792060/in-better-not-bitter-one-of-the-central-park-five-tells-his-own-story)"
Boca Juniors Confidential,Actually a better comparison is Medici as a historical drama about real life characters and one I notice often gets left out of these discussions
Boca Juniors Confidential,"I'm just saying that Cobra Kai is a Netflix original, I did  not say that Cobra Kai counts for OP list. It doesn't count because OP is excluding Netflix originals that did not start on Netflix, like Black Mirror."
Boca Juniors Confidential,"Sure, just wanted to clarify that you guys seem to be operating under different definitions"
Boca Juniors Confidential,"Not really, he said that those three shows are not Netflix originals, which is incorrect."
The Rise of Phoenixes,Is it currently available in China?

The Rise of Phoenixes,"This probably could have been its own TV show, and it may have even been quite good, but instead they slapped the name ""Grease"" on it so it would sell. The irony of it all is that the constraints of putting this into an already established franchise are probably going to make it a worse show that, by the looks of this comment section, could potentially garner more criticism than viewership. I truly do not understand why networks and studios believe that new IP is somehow not marketable, when by all accounts consumers are ready for something new."
The Rise of Phoenixes,But we still can‚Äôt get a Dredd sequel?
The Rise of Phoenixes,[deleted]
The Rise of Phoenixes,Hard pass.
The Rise of Phoenixes,Goddamn Hollywood sucks these days
The Rise of Phoenixes,"Great! Let's chisel the bottom of that fucking barrel! 

""Three Stooges: Rise of Shemp""

""Roundhay Garden Scene: Return to the Garden"""
The Rise of Phoenixes,"Can anyone come up with anything new anymore? I‚Äôm shocked how commonplace and acceptable it‚Äôs become to just rehash shit over and over again. Especially some of the crap I hear on the radio, just taking a hook from an Elton John hit and babbling over it is top 40 material now?"
The Rise of Phoenixes,"I'm curious what vibe and tone they're going with this: a 1954 Mean Girls, Heathers, or something else entirely?"
The Rise of Phoenixes,Diversity based on reality!!
The Rise of Phoenixes,"This is going to be fucking stupid and will probably have the same level of story telling as *Riverdale* and I'm going to watch it until it gets cancelled.

Admittedly, nothing could be worse than the Fox live version."
The Rise of Phoenixes,"""Oakes was initially skeptical about creating a prequel to Grease for television.""

And then she saw the salary and said ""Lets do this!""

People are baboons, they hate that they love all the sexist stereotypes that the 50's embraced.  

Its going to be a random teen drama with empowered women.       While wearing pink jackets.

it will be boring."
The Rise of Phoenixes,Is nothing sacred anymore? Please stop with the remakes and reboots and revisitings.
The Rise of Phoenixes,"let me see: asian, probably jewish, black, white. Indian and mexican in season 2, if we're lucky. Native Americans? lol get lost once again. White girl is a closeted lesbian in a toxic relationship with the greaser leader, will fall in love with black girl, who is also a closeted lesbian, and both will become strong and empowered ladies who will turn the patriarchal sexist and racist and homophobic society of the 50s upside down. Can't wait, yummy !"
The Rise of Phoenixes,Did we completely run out of original ideas already?
The Rise of Phoenixes,Did anyone ask for Grease to be a franchise?
The Rise of Phoenixes,"More great talent wasted on old, rehashed ideas."
The Rise of Phoenixes,"Nothing can top Grease II's Reproduction

https://youtu.be/Wcpc0uX3nZQ"
The Rise of Phoenixes,This cast is NOWHERE near the originals‚Ä¶
The Rise of Phoenixes,no thanks
The Rise of Phoenixes,NO!!  Grease is sacred.  I will never ever watch this prequel.
The Rise of Phoenixes,This could probably be good but it won't be.
The Rise of Phoenixes,Oh this is going to be an absolute cluster fuck.
The Rise of Phoenixes,What culture death does to a mofo‚Ä¶
The Rise of Phoenixes,What the....
The Rise of Phoenixes,"Broadway Musicals should be self contained.

No sequels or prequels or spin offs. They‚Äôre never good"
The Rise of Phoenixes,This is not needed.
The Rise of Phoenixes,Did literally anyone ask for this?
The Rise of Phoenixes,Derivative
The Rise of Phoenixes,Hilarious they made it multi racial when the school they went to probably was the most segregated ass school in movie history. They were not rocking with the current day liberalism. Shit was set in the fucking 1950's.
The Rise of Phoenixes,Grease sucks
The Rise of Phoenixes,What's the #WOKE score on this one?
The Rise of Phoenixes,"Everyone is mad at the historical accuracy and the lack of need for a sequel, but I‚Äôm just fucking sick of every 80‚Äôs IP being turned into a fucking teen drama show. We‚Äôve got Willow, Wednesday, Chucky, Ash vs Evil Dead(good but young adult drama) Boba Fett had the gang of teenagers, the list goes on. Can‚Äôt something be made for us instead of using our nostalgia to sell shit teen drama to young kids?"
The Rise of Phoenixes,No one under 60 actually gives a fuck
The Rise of Phoenixes,"How much ""revisionist"" history will be forced upon us??"
The Rise of Phoenixes,Another female-focused reboot? What could go wrong?
The Rise of Phoenixes,"As with most of these nostalgia grabs, who wants this?"
The Rise of Phoenixes,Not everything needs an origin story.
The Rise of Phoenixes,If it's centered around 4 girls and made in 2022 it's almost certainly going to be shit
The Rise of Phoenixes,Another reason why I‚Äôm liking streaming services less and less‚Ä¶
The Rise of Phoenixes,Wow. I‚Äôm actually interested in this. Some of y‚Äôall are really cynical. Lol
The Rise of Phoenixes,Why though?
The Rise of Phoenixes,‚ÄúAnd the award for the most anti-Reddit show of 2023 goes to‚Ä¶ *drum roll* ‚Ä¶ Emily in Par‚Ä¶ no! Grease: Rise of the Pink Ladies!‚Äù
The Rise of Phoenixes,"Admit it, everyone complaining that this exists wouldn't want to watch a ""girl show"" anyway.  Not everything is made for the reddit gamer bro demographic."
The Rise of Phoenixes,"At least its on Paramount+, the same network that gave us Yellowstone. Hopefully that means the story telling and character development will be front and center, rather than pushed to the back in favor of some nonsense political agenda."
The Rise of Phoenixes,"Jesus Christ, why?"
The Rise of Phoenixes,Why
The Rise of Phoenixes,"In what way is this a ""look at""?"
The Rise of Phoenixes,"Hollywood is legit running out of franchises to reboot or sequelize.

Still can‚Äôt believe this year we got a sequel to A Christmas Story and Enchanted. From the 70s to 2000s, major films are no longer safe from destroyed legacies."
The Rise of Phoenixes,After seeing the shitshow that was Grease2 I have no interest in revisiting this story accept the original bc Travolta and John made it what it was.
The Rise of Phoenixes,Calling it now. It‚Äôll be cancelled within the first season.
The Rise of Phoenixes,"What‚Äôs next, an origin story on Damone from Fast Times?"
The Rise of Phoenixes,"First of all, this show is totally unnecessary.

Second‚Ä¶

‚ÄúRISE OF THE ____‚Äù SUBTITLES ARE FUCKING LAZY"
The Rise of Phoenixes,"It's amazing how the most offended ""fans"" are the ones who don't know the first thing about the franchise. 

""Grease"" is a *stage musical* that has been running and evolving for decades, with at least one other filmed adaptation besides the famous one. 

And hearing people complain that the new ""Grease"" installment ""isn't realistic to the time period"" is like someone complaining that the new ""Star Trek"" doesn't have realistic science. Yes, this new show should've had the realistic flying cars, 30-year-old high schoolers, and complete lack of a Cold War that the 1978 film had. 

My favorite historically accurate detail of the film in during the race at Thunder Road, when the 48-year-old-looking high school bully's car has a Mad Max spike contraption spinning out of it. My grandpa's 1954 Cadillac has one of those. 

I think this show looks like a vaguely interesting take on a long-runningfranchise. 

These snowflakes freaking out are worse than Ariel stans who shit their pants any time someone besides Disney dares adapt ""the Little Mermaid."""
The Rise of Phoenixes,Look how they massacred my boy
The Rise of Phoenixes,I think I might kill myself
The Rise of Phoenixes,Thought you were referencing The Thing (1982) for a second and was confused
The Rise of Phoenixes,Cannot fucking stand that ‚Äúrise‚Äù is used so damn much in titles. Lazy assholes can‚Äôt come up with anything else.
The Rise of Phoenixes,RISE MOTHERFUCKER RIIIIISE
The Rise of Phoenixes,Return of the Mac
The Rise of Phoenixes,This could be another Addams Family spin off
The Rise of Phoenixes,One of the actresses is Asian. I appreciate trying to be inclusive but a girl gang in 1954 high school would not only be racist as fuck but the school would be probably segregated.
The Rise of Phoenixes,"Then people will vocally complain that it's inaccurate to have the changes, then others will vocally complain that those first people are racist, then there will be 1000 click bait articles and YouTube videos on whatever side they feel will get them more clicks, and that will become the entire discourse about the show."
The Rise of Phoenixes,"1950s style gender and relationship dynamics didn‚Äôt translate well in the 1970s either. **Which is why the musical Grease is a satire of the sort of cultural values expressed by the parents of the contemporary youth and of their hypocrisy.** Sandy changing everything about herself to be a better partner for Danny is meant to be seen by the audience as a sad and self destructive thing to do for a relationship. The way they treat sex and pregnancy scares is a shot at adults in the 70s who were railing against promiscuous teenagers while pretending they weren‚Äôt exactly the same but with worse education about it. We‚Äôre supposed to on some level be disgusted by the characters and their choices by the end of the musical, because it‚Äôs a send up of 50s nostalgia rather than an uncritical celebration of it."
The Rise of Phoenixes,Cuz this original movie was so realistic?
The Rise of Phoenixes,"They known that we don't need this, and on some level they know that it is going to suck. 

It is a well known cinematic universe that is guaranteed to get viewers for at least a season or so. 

It is vastly easier to get viewership for something established than for something new. That is why every old ""hit"" show and movie is being reborn. Most stink it up also, but they make money."
The Rise of Phoenixes,"I don't understand why we can't use aesthetics from a certain period of time and leave out its political issues, as well as not shoehorn in modern day issues."
The Rise of Phoenixes,"It's going to be that kind of historical revisionism where a character makes a speech about how things should be more just and then everyone just kind of goes ""oh, I never thought of that"" and society becomes more just"
The Rise of Phoenixes,"Oh gosh, when watching bits of that League of their own tv show, it's doing this exact same thing, its insane."
The Rise of Phoenixes,Agreed. The whole point of the musical was ‚Äúchange yourself and people will like you.‚Äù It‚Äôs gross.
The Rise of Phoenixes,You're funny if you think they're going to use 1950s gender dynamics in this show.
The Rise of Phoenixes,Grease ends with tow characters flying off in a car. And grease 2 features a teen doing some very unrealistic bike stunts. I‚Äôve never seen this franchise as grounded in reality so them playing fast and loose with 50s ideals and sentiment doesn‚Äôt seem off to me. I still think it‚Äôs a weird idea for a show though
The Rise of Phoenixes,Wait you‚Äôre telling me it‚Äôs not? Lol
The Rise of Phoenixes,She‚Äôs having a moment
The Rise of Phoenixes,"Zero creative or original ideas. Spin offs, reboots and sequels."
The Rise of Phoenixes,Yep.
The Rise of Phoenixes,I only read the comments because of this!
The Rise of Phoenixes,You‚Äôre not looking forward to the Grease Cinematic Universe‚Äôs Phase 1?
The Rise of Phoenixes,Rise of? It's not the goddamn Ottoman Empire.
The Rise of Phoenixes,They should just jump right to Grease: War for the Planet of the Pink Ladies.
The Rise of Phoenixes,100% guaranteed that Saturday Night Fever is next.
The Rise of Phoenixes,"Unpopular opinion: Grease 2 had a better soundtrack, pound for pound. This is my hill to die on."
The Rise of Phoenixes,I'm already more interested in this than whatever is in the article.
The Rise of Phoenixes,I mean I'd watch it.
The Rise of Phoenixes,It‚Äôs coming bro!!! Gonna have Karl Urban back too!
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,I‚Äôm not surprised when I saw how fast they had to turn around that Mario Kart sketch
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,Health insurance isn‚Äôt THAT expensive for 12-20 people. Probably cheaper than the negative PR generated by a Variety article.
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,But that's comedy's birthday!
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,"One of the most recent post production sketch has an interesting tidbit. If you watched live, the mario sketch has different cgi then what they posted on YouTube later next morning. The biggest difference was the goombas, in live they had a more unique last of us look and the one on youtube has more pulled from the actual mario game look. So either they made two version and just decided to post a different version or they keep working on it late even after it aired."
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,"Don't work on this show, but have done cable TV post production in the past. 

You have no idea how underpaid these roles can be, with also zero respect given to the craftsmen. IMO this is linked to the recent calls for the VFX industry to unionize. Technology and expectations combine to create a hostile work environment where people don't have benefits and are underpaid or contract employed with zero job security.

These are jobs that are seen as prestigious, so employers take advantage of the workers. They need a guild to look out for them. Support these efforts pls."
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,Their editors are not local 700?!?!?
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,"SNL doesn‚Äôt take care of their editor crew. They exploit being non union. Just like commercial advertising, yet they are the most demanding on turn around. Speaking from someone who recently did a 20 hr shift but you only get paid your day rate which is based on a 10hr day. Didn‚Äôt even offer to pay me for two days at regular time. They just say well ‚Äúsorry that‚Äôs how it works out‚Äù‚Ä¶‚Äùwe don‚Äôt pay overtime‚Äù, sucker! Not even to a contractor. Completely abusive."
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,April fools!?
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,I‚Äôm more intrigued at what they‚Äôre gonna do for an April 1st show.
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,"It‚Äôs amazing that corporations, stockholders, and billionaires would still rather pinch their pennies instead of making their employees lives better. As if study after study hasn‚Äôt shown that a happy worker is a better and more effective worker.

Want more output? Pay workers more. Want better quality work? Ensure your employees have enough money and benefits so they can have a quality place to live and healthcare. This is all such simple shit, but yeah sure keep on pushing for short term gains.

Keeps worshiping at the altar of capitalism and continue your human sacrifices. We all know it‚Äôs a sustainable model."
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,Good for them. I hope they get every single demand.
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,"A little under a month should be plenty of time for NBCUniversal to squeeze their rather large heads out of their particularly tight asses. And if not, I hope the strike is disruptive and successful."
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,"Editors are as significant creatively as DPs, writers, and I'd go so far as to suggest directors. Fuck NBCUniversal, or anyone else who tries to take advantage of them."
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,"Typically the pre-recorded bits are the highlight of the episode, maybe this will force them to give it 100% for the live bits."
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,Good for them. Fuck NBC.
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,What about the rest of the unionized staff?  They‚Äôre going to cross the picket line to go to work?
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,hell yeah! workers of the world unite!
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,Best SNL news in years
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,I thought it was live? How is there a post production team?
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,Oh no does this mean SNL will be worse?
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,"Couldnt go march 25 or april 8? Just ya know, to be taken seriously."
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,This is gonna be one helluva April fools!!!
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,I read this as they were going to strike the props after each sketch. I was so confused why that was significant
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,I wish more people did this in all companies. Call out the company bullshit and go on strike but people are too afraid to lose their jobs than commit to change.
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,"As a viewer, I plan to continue the strike I‚Äôve upheld for the past 15 years."
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,"‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm confused‚Ä¶ ‚Äúpost‚Äù means after. It‚Äôs a live show. What post production editing is there to do?

Edit: I had not considered that a lot of what happens on SN isn‚Äôt actually live. I rescind my question."
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,I'm glad they're doing this but not sure they picked the best day to do so...
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,"Truly an incredible amount of work goes on preparing and putting on the show. People literally sprinting in between segments and commercials setting things up‚Ä¶ 

The hall leading to the studio has some wonderful pictures of old cast and guests‚Ä¶ really cool."
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,Doesn‚Äôt make sense most people in tv and film are union but fuck the vfx artists or motion graphics artists I guess
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,SNL editors on April 1: ‚ÄúGreat news!  We‚Äôve reached a collective bargaining agreement and will resume work on the season.  April fools!‚Äù
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,based
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,Why hasn‚Äôt Lorne Michaels ever been called out on how gigantic a piece of shit he is?
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,"They deserve a contract.  Its insane how long they have not gotten a contract.  They do incredible work.  As a proud member of local 700, NBC should be ashamed and needs to get them a contact asap."
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,Shoulda done it without notice.
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,"I think SNL is generational. My dad loved Akroyd, Chase, Belushi and Rita Rudner. I loved Sandler, Carvey, Norm, Rob Schneider and Kevin Nealon. My son loved Will Ferrell, Cheri Oteri and Tina Fey. We all are convinced that our era is the best and the last ‚Äúgood‚Äù cast. (Secretly they both know that I‚Äôm right)"
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,Best of luck to them. I hope they come to terms. I love them.
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,And then they show up day if and go APRIL FOOLS
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,Wasn‚Äôt it Tina Fey who said that the schedule was built for people on cocaine?
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,"if you can't make a product without slave labor, we don't need that product"
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,Post-production? I thought it was live.
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,All 6 of SNL's viewers will be devastated
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,"April 1st. So, fool me once shame on them, fool me twice, never get shamed again (bush)."
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,April Fools?
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,‚úä‚úä‚úä
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,Who cares...
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,Just cancel it already.
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,[deleted]
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,Just have Chat GBT write the sketches!? üò¨
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,I can't believe this show is still around.
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,"Wait. Is this an April fools joke? Because it‚Äôs a live show, isn‚Äôt all production pre or live?"
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,It's live. Why do they even have post production.
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,"I genuinely can't tell if this is satire or not.

On the one hand, SNL is broadcast live.  That's the whole point.  Therefore, it doesn't have any ""post-production"" or post-production editors. And the fact that they're targeting a show on April 1 implies that this whole article is just an April Fool's day prank.

But on the other hand, most pranks are announced *on* April 1, not three weeks before.  And the article is so well-written, plausible, and doesn't seem to contain any other jokes.  What it does contain is references to things that people in this industry would realistically be striking over.

Also there are some pre-recorded cutaway scenes that do require some editing and post-production.  Is that what they're talking about?"
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,This show should end
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,SNL sucks‚Ä¶. Sorry but it‚Äôs been mediocre at best for the better part of a decade
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,Doing us all a favor. Their annual 3 year slump started this season.
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,How do you have post production on a live show?
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,Meh.
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,if their actions result in that piece of s**t show not airing then they should be rewarded.
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,"The question is, will anybody notice?"
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,Is this the end of comedy as we know it?
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,Can‚Äôt believe people even still watch this crap
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,[deleted]
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,Who cares?
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,"there is a post production team on a ""live"" show?"
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,"They work 3-4 days a week with a team in 3 shifts, all part time, for 20 weeks a year.

This was covered on the SNL sub. 

NBC knows they can just wait this out. To commit to a long contract is not worth the business and not likely. I understand how it sounds but please be realistic. Compare the demands against the team at Disney, or South Park, or Fox Studios and its night and day. 

Hope they can come to an agreement but the more I see this the more I think they are just trying to get the media to put pressure on SNL with buzz words."
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,Their is a Serious shot that Ortega doesn‚Äôt cross the picket line.
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,"I drink beer with my neighbor on Saturday nights. 

He and his wife watch religiously. 

The show just isn‚Äôt any good anymore. If Trump dies, that show won‚Äôt have any material at all."
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,SNL has post production? Aren't they live?
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,"They could cut half the cast and the writer's.  SNL has not been funny for a while and needs to get an infusion of talent. Otherwise, it's going to tank."
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,"Jokes on them... 

It's called Saturday Night Live! Not Saturday Night Edited. The show doesn't even need them."
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,How does a live show have a post production crew?
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,End SNL
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,*Tumbleweeds*
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,"Oh, how WILL we all go on?"
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,Are they demanding more Trump skits?
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,"I am sure it's an unpopular option but cool, couldd we go back to having SNLIVE be LIVE again? Yes yes, I know they used to make fake commercials that required post. However most of the time they did not include that week's guests to allow them to be made with more time. 
I personally hate all the pre-recorded skits. Know this got big with the Andy Sanburg. Whatever just it definitely steered the show away from its format of being live."
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,Perfect picture to show how shitty SNL is. That Wednesday dance is retarded.
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,"SNL has post production editors?

I would think this might be a job that would be cheaper if contracted our.  The show format means they shouldn't be doing much more than putting together promos and the occasional pre produced skit"
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,Strike as in to not work or [strike in the theatrical sense?](https://www.ucop.edu/safety-and-loss-prevention/environmental/program-resources/performing-arts/strike.html)
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,Good. These ultra-polished cinematic productions take the real magic out of the show.
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,All I read in that headline was ‚ÄúSome Americans are gullible af.‚Äù
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,Editors are one of the most important components of filmmaking. NBCUniversal's abuse of these professionals is unconscionable.
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,Ooooh is this the next advent of reality television??
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,Does anyone watch this show anymore?
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,"Good, it‚Äôs been shit for the past 2 decades"
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,"OK, fine, SNLPOSTPRO has a fiverr account now. Problem solved..."
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,Eew
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,"I‚Äôve been boycotting SNL my whole adult life. Uh, in solidarity."
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,"Is this an out of season April Fools joke?

er wait a second.."
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,"Oh so this isn't a gag, damn"
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,"Oh no!


...anyways..."
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,"I was wondering 'what the hell is post production in a live show' but yeah they have lots of pre-recorded bits these days. They've always had a few. And they probably are some of the strongest parts of the show these days, too."
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,Cant be any worse. See ya!
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,We will only barndoor transitions until our demands are met!
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,That was incredible.  I figured they had to have been working on it for weeks.  Do uou think they really just churned it out turbo mode?
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,"Here is a Behind the Scenes look at the Mario sketch

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNNFUr4wDLM"
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,"I wonder how the director, Mike Diva feels. He was in the VFX/motion graphics/editing world on YouTube before working as a director with SNL so I'm sure he knows how stressful crunch can be."
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,"Often enough, when you see a sketch end, and you see a long shot showing the cast of the just-ended skit starting to leave the stage, you will see one person immediately come on stage and physically grab the guest host to get them offstage to change for the next skit.   While the cast members are used to the fast turnaround, and the same cast members are often not in the next skit, the guest host is not used to it, and so it is one person's job to get them moving right now."
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,Thanks for mentioning it because [this shit is goddamn hilarious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiIRlg4Xr5w)
Daniel Sloss: Live Shows,"That‚Äôs what SNL is though.  The sketch most likely didn‚Äôt exist before the Tuesday night writing session.  And if it did it was likely a very basic concept at that point.  It‚Äôs definitely a big ask for post to turn that around so quickly, but that‚Äôs the nature of the gig.  I don‚Äôt think anyone expects Hollywood grade cgi, just the best they can do on a weekly live show timeline.  They should absolutely be fairly compensated for those expectations and if that means striking then more power to them.  But that won‚Äôt change the job."
First and Last,"Alan Sepinwall is one of the best TV critics around. The concept seemed a little game show-y initially, but the first episode won me over quick. Basically seems like an excuse for him to shoot the shit with famous people about TV, which really works for me.

Plus, Jon Hamm and Alison Brie are great guests."
First and Last,This show is a lot of fun!
First and Last,Well this is worth a listen
First and Last,"I wasn‚Äôt sold on the concept but those guest/show combos are inspired. I‚Äôll have to check this out, I need something to fill the void now that I‚Äôm finally up to date on Blank Check."
First and Last,John Hamm would've been a great Rufus.
First and Last,Video would have been cool. WELCOME TO GoT!
First and Last,I would rather he wrote in depth about tv.
First and Last,So straight up stole the concept Jon Gabrus and Lauren Lapkus were doing on Raised By TV?
First and Last,"Frankly, this premise was dumb when Buzzfeed did it, and having a serious critic do it doesn't make it any better. Watching just the first and last episode of a show doesn't convey any useful information."
First and Last,Sounds like a dumb idea for a podcast but I‚Äôm always in the market for new TV podcasts so I‚Äôll give it a chance to woo me.
First and Last,That man is a hack
First and Last,"Speaking of Sepinwall, he's in a [Triple Feature documentary](https://celebratethesopranos.com) all about the GREATEST SHOW OF ALL TIME.. Alf err The Sopranos!"
First and Last,I've been a fan of Sepinwall since back in The Sopranos days. His recaps and reviews were better than anyone else's.
First and Last,This is a thing I've seen a handful of Youtubers do
First and Last,How do you feel about [ONION RINGS](https://sirkvod.vhx.tv/packages/celebrate-the-sopranos-triple-feature/videos/celebratethesopranostrailerfeb2021) though?
First and Last,"No, they straight-up stole the concept I came up with for manga 15 years ago. 

Almost like it's a totally obvious and basic idea that multiple people can come up with at the same time..."
First and Last,Loved his podcast with Fienberg and now he's doing [docs on The Sopranos with Seitz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwu3rg7AM8A)!

First and Last,"Fringe didn't just alter the world, it actually added a new one."
First and Last,"Rome.  This history of the Roman Republic/Empire is simply awe inspiring. Also, the show kicks ass "
First and Last,"Mad Men honestly, show begins in essentially the 50's era (1960) and ends in 1970. We follow all the characters through 10 years of their lives, see their circumstances change tremendously, and it honestly feels like things are extremely different towards the end of the show than they were at the beginning. "
First and Last,"Game of Thrones starts with a northern suburban white collar family hosting the boss' family for a nice autumn dinner and ends up, well..."
First and Last,"From what I've heard about the show, Moral Orel might qualify.  The Venture Bros absolutely does. "
First and Last,"South Park dynamically changed a few of its characters, everything else was mostly just heightened. Cartman's original character was a lot more like Butters than the monstrosity that he has become.


"
First and Last,"Sons of Anarchy starts with Jax being set up as the future leader and ends up with most of them dead, the entire power struggle dynamic ends up wiped out and so does twu love. Wendy is still standing and has her life relatively together, but they destroy Clay/John and Gemma 1 and 2."
First and Last,"Vampire Diaries Season 5 SPOILERS

Starts with them in their hometown, ends with the entire town encased in magical bubble which over half the main cast can't enter without dying extremely painful deaths."
First and Last,Toyko Ghoul - Shy young adult who would rather read a book to the bridge between man and monster
First and Last,Fringe - completely changed the timeline.
First and Last,"A lot of anime shows rest on this concept. 

They start with just a kid living a normal life, introduce the fantasy element, and by the end of the show they're saving the universe in life-or-death battles with powerful villains.

Especially shows like Gurren Lagann which plays this to the extreme."
First and Last,Doesn't pretty much every serialized show do this?
First and Last,"Aqua Teen Hunger Force. It starts with a giant robot rabbit destroying the city and the Aqua Teens fighting it. It ended with SPOILER


Meatwad becoming a family man. "
First and Last,"**Spartacus** -- Soldier to gladiator to leader of slave rebellion.
"
First and Last,**Lost** - What started as awesome and promising turned into the biggest waste of 6 seasons on TV.
First and Last,"Hannibal, apparently. 



"
First and Last,Cthulu?
First and Last,"Good one! Hard to believe that show started as just the work friendship between a professor and psychiatrist-with-extracurricular-activities.

Like *Fear the Walking Dead*, Hannibal is a semi-prequel structurally conceived around reaching an end point. Too many shows are built around a premise pilot (ex. [naked woman wakes up in Times Square covered in tattoos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindspot_%28TV_series%29)), but have no clear trajectory post-pilot.
"
First and Last,"Definitely the first one that came to my mind (for obvious reasons).  Too bad they probably won't get any more seasons, but it ended in a pretty good place to be a series finale.  I expect things would have changed even more if it went on."
First and Last,"I read it got canceled, so unfortunately no season 4. "
First and Last,"Eh, it's last season pretty jarringly altered the world. That season was unrecognizable from any other season. "
First and Last,"Eh, you know how office politics can get."
First and Last,"Definitely. Just in how it tells stories, it's a completely different show with different stuff on its mind. Also, I think it has developed much more affection for its sprawling cast of characters as it has gone on. Not to mention weird stuff like Kenny dying every episode has since been tied into their increasingly elaborate mythos."
First and Last,I've only seen like the first 3 episodes but it was kinda hard to get into. Should I keep going?
First and Last,"I gotta say, this is 100% true, out of the 4 I have watched, death note, attack on Titan, parasyte and avatar they all follow this procudure."
First and Last,Naruto and bleach are perfect examples of this. Everything gets all clusterfuck-y at the end
First and Last,"SPOILER

no it didn't."
First and Last,I respectfully disagree.
First and Last,"I also disagree. It was good in season 1 and 2, season 3 started it  to dip but after that I generally love it more. I prefer 4,5 & 6 (although I was disappointed that the cave of light was so literal). Personally, Lost is one of my favourite shows ever and I think it's a great show."
First and Last,"If you can't show any nudity, why would your story be about a person found naked in the middle of time square? "
First and Last,"It was still a good season, but you felt like you skipped a few seasons in there.  I think they had a decent plan, but the series was shortened too far and they didn't have enough time to set up the Observer storyline like it should have been.  They just went from ""mysterious guys who watched stuff"" to ""invading force"" in the blink of an eye."
First and Last,"yup, get's a lot more interesting once they start developing the ghoul investigator's characters "
First and Last,"Thank you for being polite and civil. For me, it just got way too convoluted. The original writers all moved on to other projects, and it definitely started to feel like the new ones really weren't sure where they wanted to take it."
First and Last,"The acting and production value were cetainly great, and I loved the show almost the whole way through. My biggest issue is that by the time it's all done, season 6 essentially made seasons 3-5 into fillers between the actual story. Looking at seasons 1, most of 2, and 6, it works fairly well. Everything in between that could have been condensed into 1 season. That's why it feels like for a while the writers were just writing for the sake of writing."
First and Last,"What do you mean? Damon Lindelof was there from episode one, and his co-showrunner for the series joined halfway through the first season. Same core writers throughout."
First and Last,"The reason, as with so many shows, is that writers never got an end date. Writing without knowing that means convolution :)
S6 was at least as good as S1."
First and Last,"He was more of an executive producer. He, Abrams, and I think one other writer are credited with creating the show. Abrams left not long after, and Lindelof did very little actual writing beyond that. They started with an awesome idea with a lot of potential. Watching all the way through though, there's no way the conclusion was thought-up at the same time."
First and Last,"I think you're getting showrunning and writing credits confused. Damon and Carlton had their fingers over every single episode of Lost. In the writers room, whoever first gets sent to write the first draft gets the credit but Damon and Cartlon (along with the room) intensively broke down every episode before getting to the point of the first draft. And once the draft is complete, they'll both likely do rewrites before it eventually touches production. Check out some of their interviews or heck, even their Comic-Con panels. Same thing with a lot of long network shows, such as Buffy. "
First and Last,"Right, but they usually weren't involved until the end of writing sessions. Often the writers would take an idea, such as the smoke-monster or the hatch, and put it in the show. Damon came along after that and, as long as a possible explanation down the line wasn't too far-faetched, decided if it would be written into the show. Plenty of elements were written in without a decisive plan or end-result, especially during the first and second seasons."
First and Last,"Excerpt:

>HBO‚Äôs The Last Of Us hit a milestone this week, notching its first billion-minute week since it debuted in January. With five [actually 4] episodes available, the post-apocalyptic series jumped 36% vs. the last interval to notch 1.2B minutes and fourth place overall. Nielsen streaming measurements only account for viewing on HBO Max, so these numbers don‚Äôt reflect any viewership on HBO‚Äôs linear channel (HBO hasn‚Äôt released updated viewership numbers for the series since Episode 4).  
>  
>Perhaps unsurprisingly, Nielsen asserts that the audience profile for The Last Of Us is virtually identical to The Walking Dead, skewing younger and more male.

Numbers are for US only and counts all episodes across all seasons of a show.

1st week: 223 million minutes (just a few hours availability)

2nd week: 837 million minutes

3rd week: 877 million minutes

4th week: 1190 million minutes"
First and Last,Only a billion? Cancel it.
First and Last,I'm getting more and more concerned that Ellie won't throw a brick at anyone this season
First and Last,"This is the perfect example of, people like well written shows. It‚Äôs not that complicated."
First and Last,"Gonna stream episode 6 tonight.

Such a wonderful, heartbreaking, show."
First and Last,"As a 90s kid who grew up with the Super Mario Bros movie, it's absolutely *wild* that the most popular show on TV is based off of a video game.

It's even more crazy than when Spiderman (and to a lesser extent, the first X-man movie) made comic book movies not suck."
First and Last,I might‚Äôve been the Billionth Minute! I just started watching last week.
First and Last,"I have been enjoying the show and think it has pretty high quality.

But I also think it is doing really well right now because there is really not much competition.   

There just has not been much really great from the last 2 months, IMHO."
First and Last,So far it‚Äôs doing good. The game is always more intimate but the show has a different aspect that I enjoy. Some flaws but I‚Äôll let it slide.
First and Last,"I‚Äôm interested to see what general audiences think of it. I‚Äôm fan of the game and while I like the show it does feel simultaneously rushed while not fleshing things out enough. 

It feels like Joel/Ellie haven‚Äôt had proper scenes apart from episodes 4 and 6 (which was my second favourite episode). Ironically my favourite episode was 3 which was a brand new ‚Äòside story‚Äô.

Episode 7 was great quality but it‚Äôs kind of a shame they spent a ninth of the show on DLC backstory. I have no clue how they will do the next arc in a single episode considering it‚Äôs the best part of the game."
First and Last,"Services need to stop acting like the duration that something is watched matters, tell us how many times an episode was viewed... this could just be a billion people watch 1 minute and stop. That's not the same as somebody actually watching the episode. It needs to be how many accounts watch the full damn episode."
First and Last,"Man, I like this show a lot but I had to leave the HBOshow sub.. they‚Äôre fucking evangelical over there, shits getting crazy! It‚Äôs like a cult!"
First and Last,">	‚Ä™""unsurprisingly, Nielsen asserts that the audience profile for The Last Of Us is virtually identical to The Walking Dead, skewing younger and more male.""‚Ä¨

‚Ä™Lol, I knew the walking dead fans that got sick of the show's shit would come through! Welcome to quality! AMC could never & now, they end up looking like the Wii U window meme. Couldn't have happen to ""better"" company."
First and Last,Deserved. The witcher show could learn a thing or two.
First and Last,"it's good that it took a massively popular, successful, genre defining, and industry standard setting video game for a streaming service to finally get close to netflix. not to mention the constant enriched media blitz that this sub seems to hate for everything else but not last of us, very curious"
First and Last,"Congrats to them. They‚Äôve made a phenomenal show that has stayed true to the much beloved IP while still adding to the world i ways that make intuitive sense. 

Definitely in my top 5 shoes of all time."
First and Last,Hmmmm - old boomer here!  Female!  Not a gamer!  I absolutely love TLOU!  I‚Äôm going to go with I‚Äôm young at heart!
First and Last,"I can't wait to watch this!

I'm waiting until all the episodes are out so i can spend one entire weekend watching it."
First and Last,"My girlfriend doesn‚Äôt want to watch the series because ‚Äúthere are zombies‚Äù, how do I persuade her to watch it?"
First and Last,"Other than the sniper and the museum episodes, this show‚Äôs been kinda stale tbh. Not enough fungi zombies. Feels like they skip over a lot of the anxiety that the game gives you and just try to quick hit the emotional beats‚Äîwhich don‚Äôt really hit because there was no real journey between them. Just my opinion. Found myself browsing my phone the last two episodes, which isn‚Äôt a good sign since I usually stay fully engaged when watching other series. Over hyped at this point and I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôve developed Joel and Ellie‚Äôs relationship well enough for the final two episodes to work as well as they could‚Äôve."
First and Last,This games deserves to have the best video game adaptation of all time. Well done
First and Last,lol you guys are going to be so pissed when they get to the ending of the first game.
First and Last,"Ok a billion minutes, I get it. I mean that's a unit of measurement we're all used to, something everyone uses frequently. But how many swimming pools is that? Because I'm still a little confused, it's difficult to really grasp the scope of it using this unit of measurement.

Like how many giraffes is that? If someone could explain it in terms of bushels of oranges or something that would really help to put it in perspective."
First and Last,Love the show but damn did I hate this latest episode (full rounds of mortal combat‚Ä¶) get to the POINT and cut this cheesy nonsense out
First and Last,"Still waiting for the whole season. Fuck the weekly release model, it sucks."
First and Last,Wakanda forever being the most streamed movie last week should be the headline.
First and Last,Netflix would cancel it after hearing this.
First and Last,Last episode was awfully boring
First and Last,Are we really doing this every time? Most of the people want their minutes back after the last episode
First and Last,It‚Äôs basically the walking dead meets the road but with a girl instead of boy
First and Last,It‚Äôs crazy that we live in a world of so much content that I can entirely ignore one of the biggest shows ever and not feel a thing about it.
First and Last,"They don‚Äôt want to focus on Joel and Ellie. 

You know why and they needed to soften the blow"
First and Last,"I can believe it. HBO Max app wouldn't play it. I had to pirate it. I had to do the same thing for House of the  Dragon. I'm just glad my subscription is free through my ISP. I wouldn't pay for their garbage.

Good show though."
First and Last,"It‚Äôs not a very good show, pretty mediocre popcorn fare"
First and Last,"Woulda been a good show if it was actually about Ellie and Joel and not about literally everyone else around them. Again just put the game onto the screen, but writers can't seem to follow through"
First and Last,"I‚Äôm pretty fucking smart woman, but I have no idea what the fuck this means"
First and Last,"Get woke? Go broke.

The *RATINGS*, that is!"
First and Last,"Thank god good shit still get recognized ! Remeber this before next season and everyone tries to politicize a fictional show . 
Let‚Äôs enjoy"
First and Last,What‚Äôs with the black panther?
First and Last,It helps that the game was kind of a movie.
First and Last,Pretty darn impressive considering how mid the show actually is.
First and Last,[deleted]
Lovesick,"I started to watch it after a post in r/AskReddit about the best unknown shows in Netflix. I love it, it's so different from the usual com-rom series. The writing is on point."
Lovesick,"Watched the first 5 episodes, show hasn't missed a beat. Might actually have gotten better. "
Lovesick,"I had no idea, that is awesome. I will watch it right now."
Lovesick,I love that they started right from where the last one left off. I'm trying very hard not to binge this.
Lovesick,"Such a fantastic show!  Season 1 was great so I'm super excited to start season 2.  For those that haven't seen it, each episode is less than 30 min and there are between 6-8 episodes per season.  Not a huge commitment to get into.  Get on it!

Side note:  For those of you who like fun, English folk music, the lead actor is Johnny Flynn.  Check out his album ""A Larum"".  It's one of my favorites."
Lovesick,"I tried so hard not to binge it but I plowed through all 8 episodes already. Just as good as the first season and a good bit funnier as well, I really loved it. Hoping to see Daniel Ings especially get some more high profile work after this."
Lovesick,"Wha...what? I'd completely forgotten they were making a second series! 

Now to find the time to rewatch season 1. I love surprises like this."
Lovesick,Haven't  started watching it. I know I'm going to binge it and I have to work tomorrow. But I loved the first season and it has been a long time coming. Just hoping this season can make the show gain more popularity so that it doesn't take another 3 years for a new season.
Lovesick,"Two episodes in, really enjoying it. it's more of the first season really, which is exactly what i wanted."
Lovesick,"Love this show , will binge this in the weekend."
Lovesick,"Great show, the opening on S1 with the doctor is one of the strongest comedy openings I've seen."
Lovesick,I loved the show but I could not tell anyone about it because the title was so ridiculous. I thought it would be cancelled. Glad they rebranded it. 
Lovesick,Any reason why the name changed?
Lovesick,"Arrrrgh I've been waiting for this! Thanks!

To Netflix!!!"
Lovesick,"Love this show, can't wait to binge it after grad school finishes in December."
Lovesick,Been waiting for this for weeks! Going to get started tonight!
Lovesick,"I just discovered this show about a month ago and binged the first season. Its a GREAT show, funny and has a great love story to it. Can't wait to watch season 2"
Lovesick,I'm halfway through season 1. It's like how I met your mother if it was written by Richard Curtis. I'd say it's a solid 8/10
Lovesick,This show is amazing. That is all. 
Lovesick,I just rewatched S1 and started watching S2 too. 
Lovesick,"I might have to rewatch S1, I remember liking the show, for the most part. But I was so confused as to why he was revisiting such OLD partners for what seemed to be a simple STD. Unless it's been too long and I forgot the actual premise."
Lovesick,They should have kept the original name. Initially I only watched the show because of its unusual title.  SEason 1 was pretty funny so hopefully season 2 lives up to it.
Lovesick,"I love this show so much. It's like a British ""You're the Worst"", but slighly more laid back and relatable."
Lovesick,"What?! No way! I remember watching season 1 on Netflix last year, not thinking yoo much about it other than I wanted to watch a fun British comedy, and I LOVED it! I'm so glad there is a season 2 and that it's just like the first and better. Thank you for the info!! "
Lovesick,Howled with laughter at some of these episodes. Great stuff again. All three leads and solid but my favourite character is Angus! What a guy.
Lovesick,"you've seen You're the worst right?

also Love"
Lovesick,Ahhh I can't contain my excitement. I love season 1 and have been waiting months for the new season. Thanks for confirming there hasn't been any drop in quality!
Lovesick,Just binged it over a good all-my-time-not-consumed-by-class.  11/10 would do again
Lovesick,"I didn't realize he was a musician until I saw him on The Detectorists. The theme song to that show is one of his, and one scene shows him playing it. Thanks for the album recommendation, I'll check it out!"
Lovesick,... same. What have I done? I waited almost a year and a half for more episodes and now they are all gone.
Lovesick,Suprises like a finger up the arse?
Lovesick,"Well I've had a difficult time convincing some friends to watch the show because of the name. I think when people hear Scrotal Recall, they expect something a bit crasser and sillier than the actual show."
Lovesick,Because Scrotal Recall is a stupid name.
Lovesick,Name is weird
Lovesick,Was gonna watch some of S2 last night....ended up re watching all of S1 and half of S2 with my flatmate who hadn't heard of it before. No regrets.
Lovesick,"I think part of that is explainable with how much of a romantic Dylan is. He heard ""notify your previous partners"" and took it on as a introspective journey rather than just a simple task. He's wondering why it never seems to work out so the chlamydia thing gives him an excuse to look back and figure out what went wrong."
Lovesick,"also the characters aren't *the worst*. Jimmy, gretchen,and lindsey are all awful in YTW, which can sometimes be grating. 

in know thats kind of the point but i feel like even the ""redeemable"" qualities arent actually that. theyre just vulnerabilities that aren't enough to make them any way likable."
Lovesick,"I watched all of Love, but I just couldn't see why so many beautiful women were into Guy. The best episode was the one where he went on a date and the girl wasn't into him."
Lovesick,Scrotal Recall is definitely UK's equivalent of You're the Worst.
Lovesick,It's different from the usual *American/Netflix-friendly* comedy series. It's definitely in tune with the British writing.
Lovesick,"This is my reasoning for never watching it, even after the name change. I figured any team that chose such a terrible name must have wrote a terrible show too. Seemed like something for college frat bros. Maybe I'll need to catch an episode or two and see if it's as good as this thread is saying."
Lovesick,Is it about a guy time traveling before he was snipped?
Lovesick,It's why I watched the show in the first place tho
Lovesick,"Lovesick is even worse, though. Scrotal Recall was at least original. "
Lovesick,"Yeah I almost started from S2, but then i didn't really remember that much of S1 and rewatched it and S2 after that!"
Lovesick,"True, I never looked at it that way, but it makes sense."
Lovesick,"I could not deal with the male lead in that show, I gave up watching halfway through because of him. He was so incredibly annoying and nothing about his storyline was compelling at all. Shame, because I really liked what they were doing with Gillian Jacobs and the Australian roommate was very enjoyable as well."
Lovesick,"Okay, you've sold me"
Lovesick,People keeping saying this. I still can't get into You're the Worst. 
Lovesick,"yeah, same reason i ignored it at first. but it's actually quite warm, subtle and sentimental."
Lovesick,"It's a very different vibe than the name implies. Very British humor but not to the point where you hate the characters. It's lighthearted and witty but also gets deep and very touchingly emotional at times. If you like stuff like You're the Worst, Casual, Love, Man Seeking Woman, etc then you'll probably like this one."
Lovesick,Total Recall isn't about time travelling so why would Scrotal Recall have time traveling.
Lovesick,"Same- It definitely piqued my interest. But it seems like the word ""scrotal"" puts people off in greater numbers than it brings them in."
Lovesick,"It's easy to tell a friend about a show called Scrotal Recall. It's less easy to tell acquaintances, especially work colleagues, since it's so crass. If I want to recommend a show, I'd rather it have a simple, albeit uninspired, name. "
Lovesick,Scrotal Recall made no sense.
Lovesick,Good point. I must have mistook it for another Arnold movie. Either way it sounds like a scifi story about testicles. 
Lovesick,"He has to recall all the people he's nutted in, doesn't he?"
Lovesick,Crashing is more raw than Fleabag  but worth watching if you want a sitcom with hot messes for characters.
Lovesick,"Crashing is way more for the Lovesick/Scrotal Recall fan than it is for the Fleabag fan, though. I love all of it"
Lovesick,Fleabag came out 5 months after Crashing. Fleabag would have been in pre-production when Crashing was being filmed.
Lovesick,Breaking News: Artist's previous work informs their future work.
Lovesick,"Crashing is hilarious and so fast paced. A very different show to Fleabag, but well worth watching."
Lovesick,"I'm currently watching Fleabag for the first time. I have three episodes left. It's amazing.

Also, I only just realized the other day that we don't actually ever hear the main character's name spoken? Or did I just miss it?"
Lovesick,"I honestly didn't enjoyed Crashing and I absolutely love Fleabag.

Both shows have similar tone but something about Crashing felt off."
Lovesick,It took me an awfully long time before realizing that Anthony from Bridgerton was actually in Crashing. That‚Äôs where I knew him from. Realized it upon rewatching Crashing haha
Lovesick,Still waiting for season 2! Need more Sam and Fred in my life
Lovesick,"Crashing was a really fun show but Fleabag is just overall better. Fleabag is some of the best television you'll ever see if you're into this sort of thing, whereas Crashing is a nice funny comedy that you'll get angry about it getting canceled. Good show, but nowhere near the masterpiece that Fleabag is. And I rarely use the word ""masterpiece""."
Lovesick,"I was trying to figure out who she was on Crashing.  

TIL there were two shows called Crashing that came out a year apart"
Lovesick,Or bubble gum
Lovesick,"Oof, is her character insufferable in Crashing, though. I did enjoy the bit where her cute hipster outfit self destructs, that was hilarious, but the rest I'm just wanting someone to slap her."
Lovesick,I like Pete Holmes' Crashing way more.
Lovesick,"Heh, literally started my Fleabag rewatch today. Just felt like she was tugging at the back of my brain, this fictional woman who feels so painfully real...

From the clips I've seen online, I think dlthat Crashing is at a disavantage, if you've watched FB first. Like, it screams PWB, it's really funny, but it's not her magnum opus so it can never measure up."
Lovesick,I hated her and the ending Crashing.
Lovesick,"I wonder if I‚Äôm the only person on earth who isn‚Äôt amazed by Fleabag. I found the writing boring and her character (and PWB herself) too annoying, even beyond the meta device of purposely making her annoying. I get that it‚Äôs subjective, and we were supposed to be challenged in relating to her, but does anyone want to make the case for why it was so incredible?"
Lovesick,the French lady in Crashing is the greatest
Lovesick,Great little show
Lovesick,"I have a theory that Fleabag will come back in a decade or so with a season 3. There‚Äôs still so much to be told about this woman, especially at whatever new stage in her life.

Love Fleabag, such a beautiful and tragic series."
Lovesick,Loved crashing. Hated fleabag
Lovesick,Crashing is better than Fleabag. I said what I said!
Lovesick,If you haven‚Äôt seen one or the other they are ‚Äúmust watches‚Äù.
Lovesick,what a shitty show
Lovesick,Rich white girl looks at the camera and complains life is hard
Lovesick,"I like Shia LaBeouf, but she will make a better Mutt Williams"
Lovesick,Crashing was so good
Lovesick,"As a queer person, Fleabag season 2 resonates so much to the kind of love we have, the forbidden love trope, it is the best."
Lovesick,"What is with Phoebe‚Äôs obsession of forbidden love affairs, in Crashing she wrote characters who have different iterations of forbidden love and on season 2 of Fleabag her character fell in love with a priest."
Lovesick,Hot mess doesn't cover it. All of those characters are awful lol.
Lovesick,"Wait, even MORE of a hotmess than the characters in Fleabag? You just piqued my interest lmao!"
Lovesick,I enjoyed both but fleabag has my heart ‚ù§Ô∏è
Lovesick,A much better show.
Lovesick,"Raw is very polite, it's utter shite."
Lovesick,I think that's a great way to categorize it.
Lovesick,Lovesick is incredibly underrated.
Lovesick,"I'd agree, though Scrotal Recall/Lovesick is a better show, Crashing is pretty enjoyable."
Lovesick,"Agreed, love all 3, but much more like Lovesick"
Lovesick,"The one-woman show that Fleabag is based on came out several year previous, so you're certainly right that Fleabag exists without Crashing in the narrowest possible definition. But presumably Waller-Bridge learned a thing or two running Crashing that she used to improve Fleabag the TV show. 

Either way, the main point is that Crashing is a worthwhile show on its own that shares many themes with Fleabag even though it might look like a generic friends group comedy on the surface."
Lovesick,I stumbled on crashing on Netflix loved it. Then googled phoebe waller-bridge and found fleabag like a week after it came out. Still couldn‚Äôt get people to watch crashing even though they loved fleabag.
Lovesick,You are right. Her name isn't revealed and she is actually credited as 'Fleabag' on the cast. Just another layer of humour.
Lovesick,"True for a lot of the main characters. A lot of them are just credited as something like Godmother, father, priest, bus rodent..."
Lovesick,"I remember when I watched it the first time, after the first episode I wasn‚Äôt sure I liked the approach. But by the end of maybe episode 3 I was totally hooked and can‚Äôt imagine it any other way. SO much cleverness in that show, and Phoebe is incredible."
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,His Dark Materials had terrible writing! Hope he does better on this project...
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,Jesus how many projects does Thorne do lol.
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,I can't wait to see how he manages to fuck up yet another beloved English literature property that was handed to him on a golden platter despite the messes he's left behind
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,Can Jack Thorne stop adapting things and focus on original material so we can all go back to never hearing his name or accidentally watching his trash tier writing again? Would be great.
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,I hope this will be a pretty faithful and historically accurate adaptation. I just recently read the book and really liked it. It's a novel of darkness and light. Hopefully both aspects can be emphasized.
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,He'd better focus on one thing... His Dark Materials' writing is the weakest part of the series.
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,">The series is inspired by Dickens‚Äô original publication of the novel as weekly chapters in a newspaper, and set in London and Paris during the French Revolution.¬†It tells the story of French doctor Manette, his 18-year long imprisonment in the Bastille in Paris and his release to live in London with his daughter Lucie, whom he had never met."
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,Where/ when will we be able to see this?
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,"Rich people fail upwards, and it never ends. Just look at D&D. Fucking Goldman Sachs trust fund asshole"
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,The writing in His Dark Materials was an unbearable slog. I was so hyped for that show and it was a complete mess!
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,It's my favorite Dickens' work (and one of my favorite books of all time) and for its popularity I've always been surprised there are so few adaptions of it (and no really really good definite one). If this is faithful to the original I'll be so hyped.
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,"It's so frustrating how *clumsy* it was. It was really apparent how little respect the guy had for the audience. Had to bash them over the head with literally everything, and have the characters drop everything they were doing to make the points so clear even a boomer half paying attention could get it. That on top of a bunch of just really questionable decisions about how and when to do certain reveals really hurt the show."
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,"The old black-and-white film version is like a fine movie and all, with a really good Sydney Carton. But it's incredibly limited by time and technical constraints. There is so much potential for that novel if it gets the budget and the right adaptation and cast and direction."
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,THE GOBBLERS! DUST! GOBBLERS!
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,Could have been 1 one hour episode.
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,"He wasn't looking for a weaponised plane, he was expecting the fighter jet without the weapons though."
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,"This is just a clickbait headline, the plane was never going to have weapons (except for being a high speed fighter jet itself) and the show IMO leaned towards the kind of over-the-top advertising at the time. 
It was fun and a bit of nostalgia for a person like me who lived through all of that."
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,"I watched it. Lame ending, but it‚Äôs a true story so you can‚Äôt help how it ends. Seeing that Michael Avenatti was involved was an interesting twist, though."
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,I actually didn‚Äôt mind it
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,[Simpsons did it](https://youtu.be/YaYc5UP8PsI) better.
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,"I really  enjoyed it. It was corny af, but had a wholesome 90s vibe I really enjoyed. A little long but I thought it was a lot of fun. And Mike Avenanti showing up under house arrest weeks before getting a decade in prison is hilarious"
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,I watched it and Pepsi 100% owes that man a Jet.
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,"Was a nice fun watch. Definitely overlong but had a good positive vibe so didn't mind it too much. They could have maybe focussed more on the legal side from neutral point of view and asked experts about their views. That could have made the script tighter.

And the coke challenge with the main characters was fun too! Especially the first reaction when Todd said they both taste like shit lol."
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,"Specifically said not weaponized. Otherwise, I thought was interesting in how it became a landmark for legal rhetoric going forward."
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,"Honestly, the story lost some of its magic for me once he realized they can just write a check for the points. I was intrigued by his whole plan to buy all the Pepsi and rent warehouses to store them etc etc. 

But then once they saw you can just send in money, they did exactly that and I started to wonder if he did it as a publicity stunt."
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,"Nobody mentions the problem with protagonist being interviewed as a grown man in front of the jet the entire time, although the story ends nowhere near that spectacular."
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,Everyone that went to law school ever after this case collectively sighed already knowing how it ended.
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,Deweaponised* plane. (Which was legal to own)
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,"The legal landmark moral of this story:  
Don't make an offer if you're not prepared to deliver."
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,"They really could have done the whole thing in like...90 mins.  Clearly they were never gonna give him a jet, but offering him 2 cases of pepsi for his trouble was pretty sad."
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,"I find ""oddly dull"" applies to 99% of streaming content"
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,"Misleading title, he wasnt expecting weapons"
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,"Went to watch, saw it was 4 episodes and went ""nope."" The whole story can be told in 45 minutes... wtf?"
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,"Terrible title.

They never wanted a weaponized version.  Hell they called and asked if it was possible to own one without weapons and the answer was yes."
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,He didn‚Äôt get it and Stormy Daniels lawyer showed up.
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,"I legit don‚Äôt understand why we let companies just blatantly lie and mislead people, but that seems to be an unpopular takeaway from this."
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,Not true. He knew it wasn‚Äôt going to be weaponized. Just operational
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,I actually really enjoyed it. Watched it one sitting with my girlfriend and we didn‚Äôt wanna turn it off lol..some of the editing was really great and there wasn‚Äôt any droning narration to put us to sleep‚Ä¶it was a fun story to watch.
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,"This is another one of those annoyingly edited nostalgia docs on Netflix. There are so many of them and they‚Äôre so annoying and pointless. 

Documentary: Remember when this happened and how this looked like this and how funny that was?

Viewer: Yeah, I remember that!

Documentary: That sure was cool, wasn‚Äôt it?

Viewer: Uh huh"
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,Stop reading after review claimed only one guy noticed lack of fine print.
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,"Yeah I watched the first episode and stopped. I couldn't believe they made a multi episodic show from this.

Most of the first episode was just fillers, fluff, and needless crap interwoven into the story just for the sake of expanding the runtime"
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,Ya it wasn‚Äôt weaponized.
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,If they watched the series they would know it wouldn't have been weaponized.
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,"Just watched this w my girl last night, we like it"
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,"Was good and he didn‚Äôt want a weaponized plane.  

Other than that, good title"
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,The show was good. The guardian is worthless.
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,So did he get the plane or what?!?
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,*oddly* dull? it's not like the subject screams great excitement
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,The sub editor who wrote the headline didn‚Äôt watch the show. The checked about 10 minutes in to the first episode if it was possible to get harrier jump jets with weapons removed.
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,He wanted the jet not the weapons. Calling it weaponized is inaccurate. Fighter jets can be owned and used by the public if they got the money. Of course they strip out a lot of weapons related components.
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,"The guy was just some douche who teamed up with his millionaire friend. Literally had enough money to throw it away on the chance they could pull it off. 

This is the story of rich assholes trying to make more money. I don't care about how they waste their money."
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,"The jet wouldn‚Äôt have been ‚Äúweaponized‚Äù. This title is misleading. It‚Äôs legal to own military equipment as a civilian, but certain things are disabled or taken off first. 

I actually enjoyed this show. I was upset at Pepsi over the Philippines. I will never buy another product again if theirs."
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,"Shit headline. Pepsi promised a fighter jet, and he met the stipulations to earn it, then they reneged."
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,"I really liked it! Did it need to be three or four episodes, no, but it had a cute framing device and I liked the surprise twist that it‚Äôs actually not about the jet, but about the friendship between the college kid and his business partner‚Äù, and ethics between friends. It was cute! I finished in the same evening while doing paperwork. He didn‚Äôt get the jet, but he did find his purpose (became a lawyer,) began a lifelong friendship, a great lift, and always has this really cool story."
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,"Good reminiscences on '90s advertising and sitdowns with industry professionals from a specific campaign, very interesting recounting of a mentorship between the protagonist and his sponsor; a hypothetical multi-part episode from the kind of series you'd almost want CNBC or Bloomberg to screen during off-market hours."
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,I can‚Äôt stand how every Netflix doco needs to do a 40 minute deep dive into the history / founders / childhood life of creator / company or whatever whenever they‚Äôre filming. 90% of the time it‚Äôs completely irrelevant and dead boring.
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,"#1. It‚Äôs not weaponized. 
#2. It‚Äôs not a plane, it is a jet. 
#3. It‚Äôs not dull. It‚Äôs hilarious. 
#4. Fuck Pepsi Co. Evil bastards."
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,"15 min in and turned off. I usually watch documentary stuff, but the main character just came off as dislikable. I don't know if it was the excitement they were trying to inject, but it wasn't appealing to me."
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,Sounds like this show would make a good 10 min youtube video..
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,Why did they not make a documentary about that time [a Pepsi campaign in the Philippines left five dead?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsi_Number_Fever)
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,"To this day I am shocked at the number of people who will try to argue that Pepsi should have had to come up with a plane. Like it's such an absurdly obvious joke. I was 12 when that commercial aired and I never thought it was anything other than a joke and thought these guys were tools at the time for trying to claim it.

What if, instead of a jet, it had been ""You get a moon base"" Would anyone still try to argue the point? That's an equally plausible idea for anyone who isn't a complete idiot."
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,"I was familiar with this case before, and when I saw my wife watching this, I was wondering how they managed to make a full series out of this. You could sum this up in a 20 minutes video and not lose any interesting content.  
Netflix is just spamming content for us to watch now."
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,"I feel they could have trimmed this entire series down to a good ten, fifteen minutes tops."
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,"Show was wayyyy too long. That being said, Pepsi 1000% owes that kid a jet."
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,A six part series about one time getting bad shrimp.
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,"A guy with no legal case whatsoever sued Pepsi, they still offered a settlement which he declined, and then he lost in court as he absolutely should have. End of story."
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,Still think he should have won this
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,"Tv execs need to understand when something is documentary series worthy, and when its 20 minute video essay worthy.

Why the fuck would i pay for a stream service to watch *class action park* when i can just watch the defunctland episode about it"
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,"I watched it the pentagon said yes you may own a demilitarized jet , later in the film they walked back the statement. With that being said normal civilians own WW2 tanks and other forms of heavy equipment. There are heavy rules and regulations and taxes in place on said hardware. None the less Pepsi did drop the ball and thought no one would believe the add campaign. I was one of those kids when this campaign ran back in the day who said no way in hell is anyone getting a new a the time vertical take off jet fighter . Since this debacle we now have 10 minutes long disclaimers that might cause anal leakage or swollen nipples and subject to change."
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,So god damn tired of everything from my childhood being a shitty netflix documentary.
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,The guy who didn't get sarcasm...
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,"He asked the DoD if a civilian could get a harrier they said yes, without the weapons and radars etc. then they the bacon guy said later on a press release ‚ÄúHurr durr no a civilian can‚Äôt cause it‚Äôs a war plane hurr durr‚Äù which does not and did not address a demilitarized version. Which I believe is a valid question to have answered; which I suspect we would find to be yes a civilian can own a demilitarized piece of military hardware."
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,Watched it and felt like I lost a chunk of my life.  It had your hopes up right till the end.  What was the point?
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,"very strange that ever got made, it was like, thank you for wasting my time"
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,Not sure what it says about the Netflix audience that this is a top show. Along with two incredibly privileged foreigners complaining about their family
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,Its about a 30 second wikipedia read
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,"Dude was obsessed after a while, kind of annoying. 

Climbed mountains for a living/hobby? Obviously had money since work was never really talked about. Wanted something that was advertised then got all pissy when it wasn‚Äôt given to him."
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,"The start of this series begins in 1995 and they used Fatboy Slim‚Äôs ‚ÄúPraise You‚Äù as a background track. As a tween/teen of the late 90s, that bothered the shit out of me."
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,"first of all, it‚Äôs Weaponized, not weponised, and second of all, do people not know what a decommissioned jet is? You can buy mig-29s."
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,It was so boring
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,It was boring. I don‚Äôt even remember that commercial. The dumbest part is‚Ä¶the dude didn‚Äôt take $ Pepsi offered him. The McDonald lottery documentary was much better.
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,J a mail p  b
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,It could have been one episode. They repeat themselves so many times.
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,I liked it. I did have the worst hangover in probably the last two years while watching it though. It is good for that.
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,"This series is selling the 90s, shoulda been an hour and done. Still, I appreciate Netflix production on what could be a YouTube video."
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,Huh I‚Äôve had this in my queue - if it‚Äôs dull should I drop it?
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,"wikipedia article:   exists. 

netflix :   let‚Äôs make more crap!"
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,I loved the nostalgia of it.  They should of used the last episode for kool-aid points though.  I saved enough for a Mr Kool-Aid pitcher/jug.
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,"Jesus. What a headline. 

I really enjoyed the light humour of almost all of the 4 45-minute Episodes and had some good lights along the way. 

I recommend it. It won‚Äôt change your life, though, like some of the shows that progressional reviewers privacy wish that you were watching /s"
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,Bart gets an elephant
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,"It felt like a made-for-tv filler piece with how slow the pacing was, really felt like they were trying to eat up as much time as possible"
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,It's so exhaustingly boring. And should have only been one episode.
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,"I thought it was pretty enjoyable. Maybe a tad long, but I remember this happening, so it was a fun watch."
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,I haven't watched it...can't see it being better than the 20 minute youtube video I watched 5 years or so ago
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,I work in marketing for a highly regulated industry (ie a long of fine print) and we often get blasted by executives because of all the fine print we have to put on our ads. This series really demonstrated why its so important
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,Where‚Äôs my elephant?
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,It‚Äôs not dull but this story is like a 10 minute YouTube video not a whole doc
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,"Love how the end is basically, ‚Äúso we didn‚Äôt get the money or the plane‚Äù"
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,drag out way to long
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,A lot of (if not all) the Netflix pop culture docuseries seem to be copies of stuff from YouTube. Only differences being (1)turning a 45~60 minute video into a series of 6 or more episodes and (2)making the content a lot less interesting.
Monster,WHAT'S UP EVERYBODY I THINK DOGS SHOULD VOTE
Monster,What is going on here? Not once did I see anyone wearing a backpack to carry their applesauce!
Monster,Disappointed that this isn't the story of 2 brothers creating hideous but lovable characters using various video game character creators...
Monster,Im glad we will finally get to see the sequel to dogs
Monster,"Monster Factory as in the Pro Wrestling school?

The same Monster Factory that gave us; 

- Punishment Martinez/ Damian Priest.

- Cody Vance/ Number 10/ Presten Vance.

- Nick Comoroto.

- Matt Riddle.

- Karen Q.

- etc etc etc."
Monster,Just like Bart.
Monster,"Monster Factory follows two brothers, Griffin and Justin McElroy as they stream themselves using ingame character creators to build the wildiest, depraved yet hilarious characters possible by mainly sticking to the golden rule of ""Only extreme values no middle ground"".  Often giving characters pencil thing heads with elongated noses and green hair etc.

Can't believe they made a tv show out of it and the trailer confuses me but I'm sure it's just as good."
Monster,I really hoped Ja'am would have made the trailer
Monster,They really should have Googled this title beforehand.
Monster,"I hate wrestling bouts. Hate wrestling fanboys.

But behind-the-scenes stuff has always been interesting to me. And this show looks awesome!"
Monster,Well this came out of nowhere!
Monster,SO MUCH BLOOD!
Monster,Are you referring to **the** backpack where they keep their applesauce?
Monster,"What the hell, I don't see The Final Pam anywhere?!"
Monster,"JACOOOOOOOOOOOOOB

Monster,Is this related to the 90s computer game they used in school to teach us math?
Monster,BABY NEED SNACK

Monster,It clearly is
Monster,METAL HUSBAND
Monster,"I remember the main problem at the time was the setting.  HBO wanted to chance the setting to US instead of Germany to make it more accessible and for their audience which doesn‚Äôt work story wise.   I think today this issue would be moot.  There have been a lot of internationally set dramas that have found a wide audience.

The other issue was Naoki Urasawa (the original author) wanted del Toro and HBO to write the whole series and go intro production before he would sign over rights to make sure it was made to his vision.   That just doesn‚Äôt fly in Hollywood.   Maybe if it became del toros passion project but nobody is putting up that much time and money without the rights."
Monster,"Fucking A man, totally agree with all of this. The anime is incredible, as is the manga. I‚Äôd recommend it for anyone **especially those who don‚Äôt like anime** as it contains none of the usual tropes one associated with anime. It‚Äôs more comparable to a David Fincher film.

The story is just too good to never be adapted, so we‚Äôll get it someday. But yeah, Del Toro would‚Äôve been an ideal person to oversee an adaptation. He said they were shopping it to networks after the HBO deal fell through, but nothing ever came of it, so idk why no one would be interested in a Del Toro written and directed pilot. It hits the exact same demos of something like True Detective."
Monster,"Here is the opening and ending of the anime, to those that are interested.

Opening - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msTB5r8nUHU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msTB5r8nUHU)

Ending - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ughzNttzA78"
Monster,"Monster is one of the, if not *the*, greatest anime of all time. I highly recommend it. It draws you in with the suspense and tension and then you stay for how amazing and layered the characters are."
Monster,"If you've never watched Monster, please, go watch one of the best pieces of media put out. Don't judge it because it's an anime. It's a long discussion about the nature of evil, the impact of genetics versus society on the formation of the individual, the rippling consequences of evil . . . I could go on. Johan Liebert is genuinely a frightening villain, and for a long time in the anime, I was truly debating whether he was the antichrist. An incredible show.

Edit: I just remembered the final scene and I'm haunted."
Monster,"Now that i think about it, the manga/anime reminds me of Zodiac, Mindhunter and the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo from David Fincher.

It explores a lot of darkness within humanity and the ways in which we judge morality."
Monster,This knowledge that you‚Äôve given me that this adaptation was in the works but canned has depressed me. Excellent anime and manga in my top 5. Would‚Äôve made a killer series
Monster,"I just don‚Äôt know that the animated Johan translates into live action, for numerous reasons. There are so many incredible characters that I think *would* work in a live setting, but I‚Äôm just not sure you could adapt the twins in a satisfying way."
Monster,"To be honest, I would prefer if Japan itself made the adaption. It's not like they don't have the talent to do it; all they lack is money, but if they were to work with some big streaming service that would give them enough freedom and a decent budget, then it should be fine. 

HBO and Del Toro would certainly do a good job, but they would also adapt it to the western taste. I'd rather have someone like Kurosawa do it.

Anyway, it will probably never happen, but at least we have a great anime adaption."
Monster,Sounds dumb
Monster,Considering all the other live action adaptations Hollywood has done over the years a Monster  live action series seems like the one with greatest chance of doing well.
Monster,Wish someone could do a live action of any Naoki Urusawa's works.
Monster,"I think now more than ever would be the perfect time to adapt it. Streaming services such as Netflix have proved that international productions work, and so if it were to be a German production (or perhaps Czech co-production) it would still likely find a pretty large audience. But I also wouldn't mind an English-language version so long as it's faithful to the setting (like Fincher's The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo). And whereas in the past you'd likely get a whitewashed version of Tenma's character, I'd think these days studios wouldn't forego an Asian lead."
Monster,"IIRC it was an interview with Del Toro in the past couple years, but I think I remember him saying it‚Äôs still on his list of dream projects. With Pluto getting an anime adaptation (*fucking finally*) I could see him revisiting trying to push Monster given the author is in the limelight again. He‚Äôs at the point in his career where he‚Äôs in his right to approach a studio with an IP or concept with genuine enthusiasm from the studio.  

Also yeah today things could be done in the US given the current political climate, but I also think HBO would be more receptive to having the series in its original setting nowadays."
Monster,"Who in their right mind would want it set in America? The setting, the story is German with literal nazi‚Äôs and eugenics."
Monster,">The other issue was Naoki Urasawa (the original author) wanted del Toro and HBO to write the whole series and go intro production before he would sign over rights to make sure it was made to his vision.

Good for him for having the balls to make that play. Hollywood has a horrible track record for live action anime adaptations, worse than video game adaptations. More mangakas should be way more protective about their IP when Hollywood comes knocking."
Monster,"Yeah, i guess the behind the scenes of this production would be a little more tricker than i expected.

The US setting would be a big No No.

I could see the german couple that did Netflix's Dark making a good adaptation.

Dark had a lot of 1980s Germany scenes in it and there was a lot of good character drama and exploration of the human psyche, alongside some philosophies of what it means to live and die."
Monster,"Honestly, that is also how i tried to convince some of my friends to watch it.

The **anime for those that don't like anime** and that is comparable to a David Fincher film/series, as pretentious as that may possibly sound.

HBO would have been the best network for it, beyond a doubt.

They could probably make 3 seasons of this, 10 episodes each.

The week to week releases as the mystery gets darker and darker would be great to witness in a live-action format."
Monster,"Unfortunately the tv spending spree is coming to an end. That said, Monster would be a much less expensive production than 98% of other anime adapted projects out there. There could be hope if there are people who really want to get it done."
Monster,"
>I‚Äôd recommend it for anyone **especially those who don‚Äôt like anime** as it contains none of the usual tropes one associated with anime.

Haha,  that was me! I wasn't into sci-fi, ninjas, robots, or goofy comedy animes, but my friend showed me the 1st episode of Monster when it came out, and I was hooked. I'm a big Fincher fan too.

That was the gateway for me to get into Urasawa's other works (20th Century Boys, Billy Bat), plus other dark/psychological animes like Satoshi Kon's work (Perfect Blue,  Paranoia Agent)."
Monster,"The character studies in this are incredible. There is this short story told by this old man when he used to be a sniper. He was assigned to kill this businessman. He observes the man from distance, ready to kill him. The man is putting sugar in his coffee and the sniper thinks he'll pull the trigger when the man finishes stirring his coffee and take a sip of it. But the man keeps on adding sugar in his coffee over and over again and the sniper simply can't shoot anymore and quits his job. There is this another story of his man who killed a guy in a park and from that day on birds won't come in the park anyone. Or that story of the old couple going to visit their son.  Even the one-off characters are so layered."
Monster,One of the captured serial killers reminded me a lot of Ed Kemper too.
Monster,">To be honest, I would prefer if Japan itself made the adaption.

I feel like Japan would be one of the worst countries to adapt this given the material. Like the entire cast is white besides Tenma and a few minor characters, and the story being set in Germany is a pretty integral aspect of the series (there‚Äôs a whole subplot in the show about neo-nazi‚Äôs that wouldn‚Äôt make sense if they were played by a bunch of Japanese guys)."
Monster,so do most drama shows when you try to think about them.
Monster,"Good for him making an unreasonable demand? No show will ever get made like that. 

I could see saying that if he simply said ‚Äúno‚Äù to development partners he didn‚Äôt like or trust. But you can‚Äôt just ask people to spend millions of dollars making something before deciding to sign off or not. It‚Äôs unreasonable. At some point you have to have some faith in the people you are choosing to work with."
Monster,For sure.  I‚Äôm torn now - I‚Äôd have loved to see this a decade ago on HBO with.  But these days Netflix is more likely to pick this up - theyve had more success with international shows and the 3 season maximum is a draw for their model - But I feel like a lower budget Netflix version would make me sad when this should get the HBO Last of Us/Westworld/GoT production value.  But I guess these days Warner/Discover is having their own $$ issues‚Ä¶
Monster,"I think 4 seasons would be ideal, just because there are natural season finale endpoints in volume 4 where >!Tenma is tied up in the loading dock by racists and the building is set on fire!< , and in volume 9 where >!Tenma sees Johan at the library and tries to kill him!< 

It would be so cool because although he‚Äôs the protagonist, Tenma goes in and out of the series a lot while you follow other characters. If they did 4 seasons, they‚Äôd likely have to do one season where the lead character is barely in it! 

It‚Äôs funny, because regarding THAT choice >!Tenma!< has to make at the end, I could see what he decided to do being extremely controversial nowadays and massively hated similarly to The Last of us 2 or The Last Jedi. But I thought it was great!"
Monster,Well said. Plus every single minor character has a role to play and some payoff. There isn‚Äôt a single episode of filler.
Monster,"Yep. 5 scoops of sugar, same as the sniper."
Monster,"I was mostly referring to the potential team behind it: the writer, director, composer etc. Japan has a lot of talented artists and it would be great if they took part in a potential global hit.

The best option imo would be a collab between Japan and Germany. That would make the most faithful adaption."
Monster,"yeah, i won't deny that"
Monster,"People make demands like this instead of saying no. There was probably some weird clause in the contract giving them rights based on other contingencies but you can weasel out of it by demanding too much.

It‚Äôs way more common than you think."
Monster,you are bonkers if you think netflix has a lower budget than hbo
Monster,"I don't think the ending would be as controversial as those 2.

The Last of Us Part 2 and The Last Jedi have to deal with the fact that they are dealing and removing past and lovable characters from the story, while the Monster ending would simply end things."
Monster,"I said 10 years ago.  Maybe it‚Äôs closer to 12 now, but yes.

Edit: No a decade was perfect House of Cards was 2013."
Monster,"Isbell:

>When I saw some of the show, it bothered me, especially when I saw myself ‚Äî when I saw my name come across the screen and this lady saying verbatim exactly what I said. 

>If I didn't know any better, I would've thought it was me. Her hair was like mine, she had on the same clothes. That's why it felt like reliving it all over again. It brought back all the emotions I was feeling back then.

>I was never contacted about the show. I feel like Netflix should've asked if we mind or how we felt about making it. They didn't ask me anything. They just did it.

>I could even understand it if they gave some of the money to the victims' children. Not necessarily their families. I mean, I'm old. I'm very, very comfortable. But the victims have children and grandchildren. If the show benefited them in some way, it wouldn't feel so harsh and careless.

>It's sad that they're just making money off of this tragedy. That's just greed."
Monster,"At the very least, the creators or producers could've prepared the victim's families that the show was being made.  It's recent enough where people can be contacted."
Monster,I think it shines a pretty big light on the shitty public service Milwaukee police gave Dahmers neighbor Glenda Cleveland when she expressed grave concern for the 14 year old kid practically unconscious said to be Jeffrey‚Äôs boyfriend
Monster,"I can understand how she feels. All I can say is that before watching this show, Dahmer is the only name I knew from this mess. I'm no less revolted by him now. And going forward I will now remember some of his victims. Who they were before meeting him and at least a sense of who they could have been if they hadn't. As well as poor Glenda and the incompetent police officers."
Monster,I get it but I really do think the series was very important. It finally showed how Dahmer actually got away with it because of racial inequalities and the corrupt police. Not because he was some kind of super genius.
Monster,"It‚Äôs weird when people lump this show in with just true crime porn when the reality is this show highlights the failings of the police that no true crime doc did.  Every single one has Milwaukee police acting like Dahmer is some super smart guy, but the reality that this show correctly points out is Milwaukee doesn‚Äôt give a shit about the black and gay community, which is a very important story to tell.  Sure we can probably use other ways to tell that story, but this drives traffic, tragedy.  And that traffic will now be people who know just how shit the cops were when Dahmer committed those crimes.

Edit-thank you for the additional context friends!  Amended ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt‚Äù to ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt‚Äù"
Monster,"This particular series hits me different.  I can‚Äôt argue that it is not exploitive of the victims and their memories but it feels different than a lot of the other cash ins that we have seen over the years.

I lived in MKE during this time, my father worked with the guy and I‚Äôve still never been able to fully wrap my head around the horrific nature of these crimes.  I‚Äôve known the body count, the conversion, the cannibalism and plans for an altar made out of his victims but nothing ever felt as vivid as when I watched this series.  Having it all played out right in front of you really gave me a sense of who these victims really were, especially Tony Hughes and Konerak.  I know time couldn‚Äôt be given to all 17 victims but my heart definitely feels incredible sadness when I think of all the families.  It went from being something that was a huge historical marker in my hometown to a realization of the depravity of these crimes."
Monster,"thats how I feel about the whole true crime genre, tbh"
Monster,"At the end of the day it‚Äôs an event that happened, you cannot stop anyone from talking about it or even making shows/movies about it just because it upsets you. How many WW2 documentaries have you seen, or documentaries and movies on events that are traumatic?"
Monster,"I'm not saying she's wrong but there's like dozens of series in Bundy, Gacy, mass murderers, 9/11, epstein, drugs, murder, rape and every other horror in the world. 

They make money off all of those tragedies but it's not like Dahmer was presented improperly to be glorified, nor his victims to be shown in a poor light. 

I don't understand why series should stop being made based in true stories, Netflix didn't invent that idea.

Why shouldn't a series be made on Dahmer? He's incredibly interesting. It wouldn't have been made if there wasn't a massive demand for that content, you could argue all the people who demand it are in the wrong but it is what it is. 

I'm sick of shows about 9/11, Diana and the Titanic but they still get made because it's ingrained in peoples minds."
Monster,What about war films? Gangster films? Literally any story ever told about any kind of tragic event? Sometimes Reddit‚Äôs horse is too fucking high and it irks me.
Monster,So every war movie ever made is off limits?
Monster,So basically like every other thing ever made?
Monster,"I don‚Äôt know, I watched it. It (yet again) high lighted a real short coming in America‚Äôs response to policing poor and possibly exploited peoples. 

I grew up in the 90s when there was this mystique that serial killers were intelligent methodical killers that had a message and blah blah blah. (See movies like Seven, Silence of the Lambs, Copy Cat, Kiss the Girls, Bone Collector, etc)

But after watching Dahmer, that movie about Bundy and some other docs/movies/shows these guys were lucky the cops sucked at their jobs. Dahmer should have been caught so many times but nobody wanted to listen, he was a total fuck up. 

I think the Netflix show does a good job of humanizing all of these people that Dahmer killed. I didn‚Äôt think it glorified anything about how he killed any of those people, in fact they barely show any actual violence or the messed up things he did."
Monster,"Man this kind of stuff shits me off.

It reminds me of when NITRAM was being filmed, the movie about spree killer, Martin Bryant. Apparently the residents of Tasmania basically crusaded against the filming of the movie, forcing the movie to be filmed in Geelong, Melbourne. South-Central Victoria is flat and has mainland flora; Hobart is mountainous with a constant view of the lake and ocean and has Jurassic-era ferns. The difference is noticable.

Now, I was 4 when it happened. There were victims younger than I was. It happened 30-ish minutes drive from where I lived. Half of the movie is set 20 minute walk from where I was at the time. Had he not moved to Port Arthur a couple of years prior to the massacre, the spree killing would have happened, likely at the Polish Club on the corner of Clare Street, Augusta Road, and New Town Road, or the Friend's School that was across the road. [Either way, only about a 4-10 minute walk from the house his girlfriend/mother figure that he killed lived at] (https://imgur.com/a/OQL0IRd), or somewhere equally packed. I wasn't a victim but I could have been and pretty much everyone knows someone who is a victim, or knows someone who knows someone. The shadow of Martin Bryant looms over every Tasmanian. 

Every Australian knows who Martin Bryant is because he's the guy responsible for firearms being heavily restricted in Australia. He'll always be infamous for that. In fact, one of the biggest complaints about the movie was that ""it's a true crime about one of the most horrific days in Australian history so as to teach Americans that guns are bad.""

The reason I even said all of that preamble is to say that despite all of that, I think the movie needed to be made. But now, when I watch the movie, I'm constantly distracted by the fact that despite being raised around the STREET that half the movie is set in, and know every location that is supposedly being shown, I don't recognise any of it because it's filmed in Geelong, Victoria. 

The fact that the movie almost never got made because some people thought it was inappropriate subject matter. The victims having a problem with it is one thing but the Tasmanian Leader of the Opposition and the leader of the Police Union? Why?"
Monster,Jokes on them - Netflix doesn‚Äôt make money.
Monster,"Same shit is happening with the gabby petito murder. Lifetime tv is about to release a series on the case with re-enactments. It‚Äôs only been a year. 

It‚Äôs disgusting Hollywood again"
Monster,"This thread is essentially people realizing that true crime as a genre is profiting off the pain of families, but justifying it because they like it.

These ‚Äúcharacters‚Äù were real people. 
Imagine the worst day of your life being used as entertainment again and again for the profit of someone that doesn‚Äôt even know you. 

I‚Äôve had to explain to friends why I didn‚Äôt want to watch certain shows when it was the same way a family member died. Had to explain that I don‚Äôt want to talk about the deaths of friends like they‚Äôre gossip. 

It‚Äôs easy for people to disassociate, but we really need to reassess and understand that this is not fiction."
Monster,"This is absurd. To begin with, anything (film, show, documentary, book) that explores stuff that humans did in the past will cost money to produce and will need to be sold. Nobody works for free. Also, we can't really pretend stuff like this didn't happen and treat it like a taboo."
Monster,So should we never make stories based on history?
Monster,I‚Äôve never understood why there‚Äôs never any complaints like this made about war movies? Isn‚Äôt that glorifying a tragedy that affects way more people?
Monster,If you're affected why would you watch this? That's like watching 9/11 footage when your parent died in the building.
Monster,How do they make money off it when anyone watching it is paying a flat rate to watch anything?
Monster,There was a series called Criminal Minds and not all stories were completely imaginary and it went on tv for over a decade
Monster,"People on social media are so cringe about this show, posting their dumb ass thirst memes about Dahmer who was a huge piece of shit on top of being a murderer, same way they did when Zac Efron made that movie about him years ago, people have rocks for brains"
Monster,I came out of watching that pissed off at the police and the system that let these people down.  Shows like this that highlight everything that went wrong only help to prevent it happening again in the future.
Monster,"Sorry to be an asshole about this, but it worked for the bulk of Zodiac Killer, Charles Manson, Hitler, Stalin, Confederate era, Medieval, Roman era/based on movies&TV Shows. 

Yes, it's dramatically reenacted entertainment first with the intent of making money off of it...but this also can help make more people aware of the tragedy. Also make viewers generally interested in stories related to the discussions about mental health in general. Great, now I wish Mindhunter would get another season soon.

Yes, we understand how awful it all was for those involved. Nobody is denying it, but this is history and entertainment based on the principal 101. Aka Hollywood. Not sure what anybody is expecting at this rate outside of those involved people getting proper adaptations of...which is an entirely different discussion altogether."
Monster,"I don't understand why we feel the need to rehash the same true crime stories over and over and over and over again. Dahmer is one of the ""household name"" killers. Why do we need a fictionalized recreation starring a pretty actor? I felt the same way about the Ted Bundy movie with Zac Efron."
Monster,Well yes.. But isn't every ww2 movie that as well?
Monster,"This happened to my cousin about 6 or 7 years ago. She got involved with a religious sex cult and her husband presumably murdered her but covered it up as a suicide (spoiler alert, he‚Äôs still free). It was high profile enough to get a dedicated segment on 60 minutes and a Lifetime movie based on it. People got paid from this while my uncle, aunt, and remaining cousins were given continuous reminders that their daughter/sister is no longer here."
Monster,"I'm sure she has enjoyed media that made people related to the event feel the same way she feels.

Dahmer's story should be told as a warning of what can happen to marginalized communities, which we seem to never learn and need to be constantly reminded of."
Monster,"‚Ä¶ I mean. I could see that. But, it‚Äôs a way to keep the tragedies relevant, imo. It‚Äôs horrific. And it being loosely based on a true story makes it intriguing. They‚Äôre gunna make they‚Äôre money either way. I‚Äôd rather it be something with layers than filmed in brail. Jmo. And Evan Peters is freakin awesome."
Monster,"It‚Äôs sad that they‚Äôre telling a story about a real-life event?

Is she also pissed at every world war 2 movie? Every 9/11 documentary? Every single god damn atrocity?"
Monster,"Yup, I never understood why people idolized serial killers. Blows my mind"
Monster,What made Dahmer so extra creepy was that he looked so normal in court. This actor LOOKS insane. At least Manson had the courtesy to look like a lunatic.
Monster,Or. They are telling a history and they made money for their work in its representation. It‚Äôs not like all those WW2 movies and documentaries were just out to make a quick buck on the suffering of Jews. Or how Roots was made to make money off slaves.
Monster,"I went to hear Monica Lewinsky speak recently and she talked about being a producer on the Hulu series about the affair. She spoke about how important it was to be involved and control the narrative after the media and so many others distorted her image. Consent is something we don‚Äôt talk about with private citizens being thrust into the public spotlight. I feel for victims of violent crimes and their families, it‚Äôs even more important they be involved and consulted. If they don‚Äôt consent then that should be respected even if cases are public record. my own family was touched by a hate crime and went through public trial and it was very traumatic. The things strangers say about victims, and the victim blaming etc is awful and I can imagine these families have heard it all sadly. Time for us to move on."
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,"When I saw the title I was really hoping Netflix was remaking BeastMaster, I used to love that show"

Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,I would love to see an obstacle course show without the added hours and hours of backstories and shitty commentary like American Ninja Warriror.  
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,"No Dar. No animals. 

WTF kind of Beastmaster is this? "
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,Most Extreme Elimination Challenge is still better.
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,I can't believe i just experienced such a wide gamut of emotions. I really thought this was going to be some sort of SciFi awesomeness... you win again reality. 
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,Looking forward to it! As a Sasuke (Ninja Warrior Japan) fan I'm looking forward to seeing how 2-Time Champion Yuuji Urushihara did! ‚ô•
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,Thought i was back in the 90's again for a second.
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,/r/UltimateBeastmaster
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,I thought there was a xenomorph when I saw the thumbnail
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,"Wow Sylvester, where did you get the crazy idea for an obstacle course show?"
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,That looked fucking stupid.
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,This is like something you'd see on 30 Rock as a parody of a show. 
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,"Beastmaster TV show was my shit. I used to watch it along with Buffy, X-Files, Xena, and Hercules. Campy 90s goodness."
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,"Same here, looks like Marc Singer is out of luck."
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,"didn't know it was a show, just saw the movie."
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,I was likely disappointed when American Ninja Warrior had nothing to do with Michael Dudikoff. 
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,"12 competitors/hour sounds like an obstacle show without all the fluff. I'm in.

*...unless 2 compete at the same time*"
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,"> Ines Sainz

yoooo"
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,I wonder of Silva can run through the course himself. Pretty cool to see the GOAT outside of mma.
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,"so like the Original Ninja Warrior, or American Gladiator, or MXC?"
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,Agreed.  Bonus that ATS built this (the builders of ANW).  Japan's 2-Time Champ competed in Team Japan for season 1!
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,Without Kodo and Podo I am not watching.  
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,Right you are Ken!
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,They don't
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,"Basically, yeah"
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,They were the whole reason I got ferrets. Totally worth it.
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,At least they dont devote too much time on backstories no one cares about.
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,I just wish they would let us listen to the foreign commentary since I'm outside the US and they only give you the local audio track 
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,"I enjoyed watching the course, but I was a bit too distracted with the different announcers screaming as their countrymen performed.  I get that they're probably trying to build it up as some sort of international competition, but it just seemed a bit cheesy to me.  Maybe I'll watch the rest on mute."
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,"I just started watching this show last night and was really irritated that they were skipping parts of the course and contestant's runs not even 15 minutes into the show.  

Cool course though."
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,"Do they ever change the course.  I only watched the first episode, but I saw that it was the same course for the second episode, and I wondered if maybe that's why they skipped so much.  How many times can a person running up a ramp be entertaining?

Still, yeah, it's crap.  So many rules.  Ninja Warrior is simple, either win or don't move on.  None of this ""You didn't get as far as this other guy but you hit a switch that he didn't, so you move on and he doesn't"" nonsense."
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,Your exact complaints are why I couldn't keep watching this show after the first episode.
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,"I get leading the audience to a false sense of ""This is the person who is going to make it to the end"" but holy hell we don't need 5 minutes of someone's life just to fill in because he fell off the second obstacle. "
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,I'd love to watch the Korean version I love the presenters when they're shown.
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,"You should search on netflix, there should be at least your local one plus the American version (it's just called Ultimate beastmaster, no country behind the title)"
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,"The course changes a couple of times. Like, minor course changes back and forth."
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,"Past the third episode iirc it's your local presenters if you have them. I'm watching in Brazil and now it's just Rafinha and Anderson, with sometimes the others showing up "
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,"Yeah I found it. Thanks.

WTF is this? This is some amazon prime type of shit"
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,Wait so no talking to animals or loincloth. Also Stone Cold Steve Austin already has a show that is just like this on CMT.
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,There is only one beastmaster and he doesn't run obstacle courses.
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,"Man, a reality competition show about finding someone who has the most magical power over other animals would've been really cool to watch. I don't know what they'd do for challenges and stuff, but it sounds more interesting to me than ""a bunch of athletic people run a a difficult obstacle course."" I like that they all compete in the end, but I was expecting a show about finding the best person to tame eagles or something."
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,"If Marc Singer isn't involved, I'm not interested."
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,">  I don't know what they'd do for challenges and stuff

Lions den, give each person a wolf pack and try to kill off the others. Put an owl and a hare in a place and have the competitors try and talk the owl down for the night. "
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,"Well, I know what cheesy sword-and-sorcery movie series I'm queuing up tonight."
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,The lack of Terry Crews is disappointing.
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,Agreed on the imbalances!!  
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,"Huh, title made me think I'd missed some type of reboot of the 80's movies about a guy that can talk to animals."
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,I hate the US announcers this season.
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,"The other hosts, especially the Korean ones, make the show. "
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,"Crews is a terrible commentator. He keeps saying the most generic, nothing patter. And he cheers for USA! USA! all the time.

I don't think it's a good fit for netflix -- you'd be bored senseless if you tried to binge watch it."
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,"I checked out a few episodes, it was silly fun. And looked hard as shit."
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,I was pretty sure the male host was going to commit a ritual sacrafice at one point.
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,Bring in Yuuji Urushihara is awesome. 
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,Didn't know anything about this show and when I saw the title I though about the how awesome a series about the 80s beastmaster would be. I am severely disappointed.
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,So Ninja Warrior upped it's game or is this a legit new thing?
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,"It's brand new.  Same course builders, different everything else. "
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,"I like it too, they did have some sob stories. But it didn't take up that much focus. 
They have also already shot season 2. "
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,"I watched the first episode, then realized I can save so much time by skipping directly to the final. I don't feel like I missed anything."
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,"Hey man I appreciate you for this post.

I didn‚Äôt even know it was coming back so thank you so much"
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,"Just commenting to show my appreciation for such a detailed post.

My tomorrow morning is gonna be great and I can't wait for that OP."
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,Can you explain why the first arc of season 3 is considered controversial Please? Even as a fan I am out of the loop.
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,Woah I guess I'm the lucky one. I just finished season 2 this week. I thought season 3 would be so far away I would forget about this. This never happens to me. 
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,TIL there was second season of Attack on Titan
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,Really appreciate the post man. Didn't know this was coming so soon.
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,"Hopefully this post works now. Not sure why this sub dislikes Twitter links. Hmm.

If you have any further questions, feel free to ask!"
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,This post is impressive! I'm stoked about the new season. And I'm also kind of glad they may divert from the manga as I was slightly disappointed as well
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,This is way sooner than I expected! Thanks for the heads up.
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,Prepare for a bunch of politics... 
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,"Is there a subreddit for Anime-only watchers? I don't want to read the manga since I really enjoy the anime adaptation. 

Edit: Grammar"
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,"I guess i watch season 2.

Have they found out what is in the basement yet?"
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,"Season one was so shockingly good that it stayed with me for quite some time. My friend recommended that the anime was easier to follow compared to a manga, which I started with and was having a hard time trying to comprehend all the flashbacks and long dialogues. The anime was, to my standard, the best anime I have ever watched. And similar to others who have posted here, I did not realize Season 2 had already been completed! Just trying to figure out how I can milk this as slowly as I can. (I'm sure I'll finish it in one sitting)"
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,"Whats ""2 cours""?"
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,"So Hulu will have the sub later today? Am I understanding this right?
"
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,"""Please also consider using Wikipedia and/or the Attack on Titan Wiki as well."" 

I advise strong caution with this, else you will likely come across manga spoilers!"
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,I thought we had another year. Feeling blessed. 
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,[deleted]
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,Tbh I'm hyped for the OP! I heard it was gonna be Yoshiki and Hyde!
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,Thanks for the update man. Appreciate it. 
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,"Wait, theres a season 2?!?!?

Oh well got something to watch now at least."
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,I forgot about this lol. One of the only reasons I have Crunchyroll still 
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,Thank you Hulu. Their anime game is on point
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,"My 13 yo daughter is a HUGE fan of this show, especially someone named Levi. She got in trouble last weekend, and won't be able to watch the new season until next week. For you other fans, what's something I could say to her about Levi that would freak her out? Nothing too spoilerish, but just something to mess with her... thanks in advance"
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,[removed]
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,Bummer that the dub is so delayed again
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,"Wow, thanks for the post. 

 I didn't even realize that s02 had come out. I got some catching up to do. Might as well rewatch 1 while I'm at it. "
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,ITS COMING OUT TONIGHT?!?!?! SO HYPED
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,"Cool! I thought season 3 was a year away... Oh god, it's already been a year since season 2"
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,"I just learned there's a season two. I think I was checking on updates regularly up until 2017, too."
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,Still waiting on Cory in the House.
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,Ooooh boy gonna watch that guy bite into his hand a few more times
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,"Hk my dude, gj."
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,"Thanks for the recap, I cannot for the life of me remember most of season 2."
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,Wait season 3? I've been waiting for season 2 to drop on Netflix for years...
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,"Does the show get better in season 2? Watched the first season and thought it was okay, it had some good elements, but I felt annoyed by the awful pace during certain parts. Because there was entire episodes that felt incredibly cumbersome and sluggish, were the momentum came to a halt, and it just felt like a waste of time. And if the rest of the show is like that then I don't think I wanna waste any more time on it. "
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,[deleted]
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,"This is how you handle a new episode release. You give a date and a a rough time scale. Not just ""oh we will put it up on the app when we get around to it"""
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,Could somebody explain why the second season took like 5 damn years to come out but this one is already coming out so soon?
Ultimate Beastmaster Australia,Anyone else think season 2 missed the amazing wow factor that season 1 has?       Didn‚Äôt feel like the same anime to me.

Ultimate Beastmaster Great Britain,"It's brand new.  Same course builders, different everything else. "
Ultimate Beastmaster Great Britain,"I like it too, they did have some sob stories. But it didn't take up that much focus. 
They have also already shot season 2. "
Ultimate Beastmaster Great Britain,"I watched the first episode, then realized I can save so much time by skipping directly to the final. I don't feel like I missed anything."
Ultimate Beastmaster Great Britain,"TV was cheaper, they had less time to prep, they pumped out 20+ episodes a year. It was more disposable and less lucrative for the actors. All that means it's going to be viewed as lesser."
Ultimate Beastmaster Great Britain,[deleted]
Ultimate Beastmaster Great Britain,"I‚Äôm not going to read all that, but the primary reason tv work once hindered an actor‚Äôs ability to work in movies is that tv requires the actor working specifically on that job for 8-9 months. That‚Äôs still the case for regulars in these high budget fantasy shows. It‚Äôs kind of hard to get into movies when you‚Äôve got 2-3 months available to shoot and films take anywhere between 2-6 months to shoot on average."
Ultimate Beastmaster Great Britain,"I‚Äôm not going to read your whole post, because you wrote an essay instead of asking a question, but here you go:

Tom Hanks was a television star, even though the show he had a lead role in only lasted two seasons.

Bruce Willis was a massive television star.

Michael J. Fox was a television star.

There were a bunch of television stars who made the jump to movies because when movies were star driven, the money in movies was much better.

The people who stayed in television had no movie star power, which back then was defined by the ability to get people in the theatre in the first extended weekend.

So the answer is simple, many television stars became movie stars, and did not go back to television because back then, movies paid better."
Ultimate Beastmaster Great Britain,"As a rule, the US didn't just treat TV acting as lesser, but the whole medium of television. It's kind of what Newton T. Minow was getting at with *Television and the Public Interest*; he had the belief that television had the *potential* to be brilliant, but that it was rarely exercised in the US, particularly after the death of the television play.

Meanwhile, as mentioned in one of the replies in your original post, in places with less commercial pressure, television could and often was treated with more seriousness and respect. For example, in the UK, the television play format persisted well into the 1980s, with some pretty big names involved such as Ken Loach, Dennis Potter, Nigel Kneale and No√´l Coward, but US audiences of the time might have found a formula where they were adapting scripts by Jean-Paul Sartre to be a bit stuffy.

Further afield, other European countries gave a certain amount of credence to highbrow directing on television; Germany had Rainer Werner Fassbinder with *Berlin Alexanderplatz*, Poland had Krzysztof Kie≈õlowski with *Dekalog* and Sweden had Ingmar Bergman with, among others, *Scenes from a Marriage* and *Fanny and Alexander*. As a result, I get the impression that there would have been less of a stigma around transitioning from television acting to the big screen.

I kind of feel that the perspective that *The Sopranos* invented quality television comes with a certain amount of cultural myopia when other countries were straight-up putting art cinema in a television form onto their screens, but it did have a big enough budget that it was hard to ignore. That said, one could assert that David Lynch was there first from a US perspective, transitioning from an already pretty notable cinematic directorial career into television."
Ultimate Beastmaster Great Britain,Times change.
Ultimate Beastmaster Great Britain,[deleted]
Ultimate Beastmaster Great Britain,"In the US. When you sign up for a show you sign up for 7 seasons of a show. Because the TV studios own you for this period of time, it can definitely effect the career of a rising star or a movie star would be reluctant to go back to being shackled to a such a long contract.

Michael J Fox is one such example, the producers wanted him but they couldn‚Äôt get him because he was contractually obligated to Family Ties. It wasn‚Äôt until later they could get him. 

Pierce Bronson was offered Dalton‚Äôs James Bond but also couldn‚Äôt take the role because he was on Remington Steele at the time.

Even with these limitations there are a plenty of people that went on the great success after being on TV back in the 80s. 

Will Smith is probably the biggest example of someone that got super star fame and awards. 

The difference you are seeing now is that an actor can go to television and back because the contracts of many cable or streaming series doesn‚Äôt require the massive 7 year contracts that are required of older network shows."
Ultimate Beastmaster Great Britain,I love when I come across Robert Redford or Clint Eastwood in their early days.  Redford was the best Angel of Death Ever (Twilight Zone).
Ultimate Beastmaster Great Britain,"> I kind of feel that the perspective that The Sopranos invented quality television comes with a certain amount of cultural myopia when other countries were straight-up putting art cinema in a television form onto their screens

100%. It irks me every time I hear it."
Ultimate Beastmaster Great Britain,Great move. It would be a crying shame for any disabled young person to miss out on seeing the event which uplifts them more than any other.
Ultimate Beastmaster Great Britain,In the United States the Paralympics are completely ignored.
Ultimate Beastmaster Great Britain,[deleted]
Ultimate Beastmaster Great Britain,"Easy to add things to the protected list that no other broadcaster wants to show... Sky, BT *et al* get the football, the rugby, the cricket... with the greatest of respect to the Paralympics and the Paralympians, it's not like anyone is lining up to bid billions for the rights."
Ultimate Beastmaster Great Britain,Is the fa cup still on there?
Ultimate Beastmaster Great Britain,"Come on Reddit, you've got to find a way to blame Boris or BREXIT for something, in relation to this."
Ultimate Beastmaster Great Britain,"A shame the popular sports are pretty much all on Sky/BT except Football/Rugby World Cups, 6 Nations and the Olympics.

Ah well"
Ultimate Beastmaster Great Britain,"Is it really ""Free-to-air"" if every household (Edit: That watches it) is required to pay a yearly TV license?

I mean I'm glad they're broadcast and I think the BBC does a good job, but it's not ""free"" if you're being forced to pay for it just because it's a government subscription fee and not a private one."
Ultimate Beastmaster Great Britain,"‚ÄúFree to air‚Äù being that thing you have to pay an annual TV license tax for, yeah?"
Ultimate Beastmaster Great Britain,Does that mean the BBC vows to buy the broadcasting rights before it goes to pay-tv or that paytv is not allowed to buy the rights for broadcast in the UK?
Ultimate Beastmaster Great Britain,"Nothing against the athletes o the games, but... does anyone watch the Paralympics?"
Ultimate Beastmaster Great Britain,Would anyone really ever pay to watch
Ultimate Beastmaster Great Britain,because no one would watch it anyway if it wasn't free? nice stunt.
Ultimate Beastmaster Great Britain,[deleted]
Ultimate Beastmaster Great Britain,"Part of what hurts the Paralympics is that it's *after* the regular Olympics. It's made in to a literal after-thought. If it was before, treated as a primer to the (no disrespect) main event then there'd be more eye-balls."
Ultimate Beastmaster Great Britain,Now if only the US could get better coverage of everything.
Ultimate Beastmaster Great Britain,"Heh, the UK government does something nice for disabled people? Its not healthcare, but I guess this is nice enough."
Ultimate Beastmaster Great Britain,"Lol, 'free to air' with your compulsory ¬£150 a year that you pay regardless of whether you want to watch the BBC.

I'd rather they concentrated on taking my bins on time."
Ultimate Beastmaster Great Britain,Sure glad they don‚Äôt have anything important going on in the UK right now so they can concentrate on the real issues
Ultimate Beastmaster Great Britain,"I hate to be the cynic here but, how many commercial broadcasters were clammering over themselves to secure these rights?"
Ultimate Beastmaster Great Britain,"Part of what hurts the Paralympics is that it's *after* the regular Olympics. It's treated as a literal after-thought. If it was before, treated as a primer to the (no disrespect) main event then there'd be more eye balls."
Ultimate Beastmaster Great Britain,"Can't claim the moral high ground in the UK because it largely is here too. Airing & reporting on it doesn't mean many people are listening.

Only difference is that people have the option of easy access I guess."
Ultimate Beastmaster Great Britain,"I mean, I'm not going to lie - I'm a sports fan and I couldn't care less about the ""paralympics,"" I didn't even know it was a thing."
Ultimate Beastmaster Great Britain,"in 2016, NBC had over 100 hours of broadcast coverage of the paralympic games.  

I think what you meant to say was YOU ignored them."
Ultimate Beastmaster Great Britain,Well duh. Americans ain't exactly known for their compassion for their fellow man.
Ultimate Beastmaster Great Britain,But what about this post can we connect to America? I was getting worried for a moment.
Ultimate Beastmaster Great Britain,"In the United States disabled people are completely ignored, bit rich to expect them to care about the Paralympics"
Ultimate Beastmaster Great Britain,The PL just needs its own streaming service. It worked brilliantly on Amazon Prime in December.
Ultimate Beastmaster Great Britain,If the Premier League was on that list the standard would drop through the floor.
Ultimate Beastmaster Great Britain,"With the Cricket World Cup were, too. At least the home nation games and the final."
Ultimate Beastmaster Great Britain,"> The Women‚Äôs World Cup i think has earned its place on that list though.

lol jesus let's get the sunday league on it too"
Inside the Criminal Mind,Criminals have evolved. Not just murder‚Ä¶ Super murder!
Inside the Criminal Mind,"So what I‚Äôm hearing is that Paget Brewster is free to do the Community movie, right?"
Inside the Criminal Mind,"I gave up on this show a decade ago, but a self contained season long arc actually sounds really fucking good"
Inside the Criminal Mind,"> In ‚ÄúCriminal Minds: Evolution,‚Äù the FBI‚Äôs elite team of criminal profilers come up against their greatest threat yet, an UnSub who has used the pandemic to build a network of other serial killers. As the world opens back up and the network goes operational, the team must hunt them down, one murder at a time.

Sounds very plausible...."
Inside the Criminal Mind,"I once kind of liked that show, but it became so formulaic that it was ridiculous. I found the scene where they give their profile extremely grating. Where they basically finish each others sentences. In real life where do 5 or more people present information like that? One person would explain what the group has learned. The rest might answer questions if needed. It is just so weird."
Inside the Criminal Mind,"I liked this show so much back in the day. For me all the horror of supernatural villains has never been that scary, because I simply don't believe in them. Like sure, I get jump scared by jump scares, but that's just being a human, but otherwise they're pretty much ""i could not give less fucks"". But when it's about real world murderers (naturally Criminal Minds went insanely overboard with it), it gets way scarier. Because there are way too many of them actually around. While some demons, ghosts etc... everyone knows they're a joke."
Inside the Criminal Mind,"Criminal Minds is so unintentionally funny there have been times that I have been borderline convinced that it's a parody. The little quotes they give at the end of each episode are always bizarre and hilarious. My favorite episode is when they have to free hostages from a Waco-style compound run by Luke Perry as Totally-Not David Koresh and Paget Brewster gets the ever-loving shit beat out of her for like, an absurdly long time, all shot like that scene in Taken when Liam Neeson climbs a fence."
Inside the Criminal Mind,The season finale is the Scopes Monkey Trial
Inside the Criminal Mind,So which serial killer will be a Kingdom Hearts boss?
Inside the Criminal Mind,When criminals don‚Äôt play by the rules‚Ä¶
Inside the Criminal Mind,gonna be fun watching Mantegna's embalmed remains pretend to rush from desk to door after some emergency
Inside the Criminal Mind,"Why not show it on ION, aka the 24-hour Criminal Minds channel."
Inside the Criminal Mind,Rossi is lookin real rough these days
Inside the Criminal Mind,"Yeah, I don't think the ""highly anticipated series"" part is accurate."
Inside the Criminal Mind,I would be a lot better with the original cast. I stopped watching because I didn't care for the new cast members. I miss Thomas Gibson. His acting career seems to be over.
Inside the Criminal Mind,"CBS murder shows really paint a bleak picture of America. Naval officers are killed by the dozens every year (according to NCIS), and there are apparently 20+ serial killers actively hunting people on Criminal Minds."
Inside the Criminal Mind,[deleted]
Inside the Criminal Mind,Now even the title is stupid.
Inside the Criminal Mind,So Disney+ in Canada but not in the US? Yeah I‚Äôm not going to sign up for another streaming service to watch this.
Inside the Criminal Mind,No thanks.
Inside the Criminal Mind,I've had enough can we come up with newer ideas
Inside the Criminal Mind,I‚Äôm pretty sure the premise of Evolution is just ripped from the Following with Kevin Bacon
Inside the Criminal Mind,"I know it‚Äôs likely just a joke, but for anyone out there that might be interested ‚Äî it looks like the show is taking the opportunity (lack of network ‚Äúmake it tamer so we can put it on national TV‚Äù) to actually make the show ‚Äúdarker.‚Äù

That‚Äôs the thought I got from the trailer. Might be wrong"
Inside the Criminal Mind,No more undulating high-pitched whistles that makes her nose bleed.
Inside the Criminal Mind,"This was my wife's ""turn brain off"" show for awhile and even she gave up after 8 seasons. There is only so many times you can watch the same type of formula.

1. Murderer kills someone
2. Group investigates crime scene
3. Murderer kidnaps or nearly kills someone else
4. Group finds that one clue that leads them to the killer
5. One of the good guys almost gets killed
6. Murderer gets shot by good guys

Rinse and repeat."
Inside the Criminal Mind,‚ÄúWhat if Reddit but serial killers.‚Äù Network TV writers have the easiest job in Hollywood I STG
Inside the Criminal Mind,It was so jarring. I have to imagine each cast member had a ‚Äúlines per episode‚Äù quota the writers had to meet.
Inside the Criminal Mind,[NEVER FORGET](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJQZst2mEQw)
Inside the Criminal Mind,Unfortunately the restrictions of network tv ensure that none of the ‚Äúunsubs‚Äù reflect anything resembling a real life monster.
Inside the Criminal Mind,"It was rare, but whenever the monster of the week turned out to be just people on Supernatural, those were the freakiest."
Inside the Criminal Mind,"If you like unintentionally hilarious network dramas, I highly recommend the 911 shows. The writers painfully attempt to add pathos to their schlock writing every episode as rural Texas becomes the site of a once-in-a-millennium volcanic eruption. Again, in Texas."
Inside the Criminal Mind,"Oh come on, dude looks perfectly fine for being 75 years old."
Inside the Criminal Mind,Criminal Minds was constantly among the Top 10 streamed shows in the US on Nielsen's Streaming charts while it was still on Netflix. It clearly has a fanbase. Oh and the guy who writes all these articles for the linked website is a middle-aged man who constantly hypes up these older shows so ig he's also writing about himself as well.
Inside the Criminal Mind,And he never followed up on his boxing career either.
Inside the Criminal Mind,"I am watching it the first time, and  I reached the episode where he left and honestly I have been struggling for a month to continue. It felt like a chore. So I finally accepted to stop watching and it wasn't the same anymore without Shemar and Thomas."
Inside the Criminal Mind,You know there are stupid shows like that in almost every country.
Inside the Criminal Mind,"Canada doesn't have Hulu, but D+ has Star which has most of the Hulu stuff."
Inside the Criminal Mind,It is on Paramount+ in the US. Disney just seem to have the international rights to the show.
Inside the Criminal Mind,Because Paramount owns the show in the US. Disney has only international distribution rights. It was the same for the original series as well.
Inside the Criminal Mind,The original series was dark as hell tbh. I mean you had a guy abducting people and stealing their spinal fluid ffs.
Inside the Criminal Mind,"Did they turn one of the characters into a killer? I have not been able to make myself check, but it is my assumption."
Inside the Criminal Mind,Certainly seems like it.  I like that it's gonna be a season long arc as well rather than mostly self-contained episodes with a few multi-episode long arcs here and there.
Inside the Criminal Mind,"Basically every Law and Order episode since the reboot has been ripped straight off of news headlines and just slightly modified.  Like last season, there was a carbon copy of the Gabby Petito story."
Inside the Criminal Mind,"Holy shit, how is that not a parody? ü§£"
Inside the Criminal Mind,Ah.
Inside the Criminal Mind,"The first few seasons, then criminal minds became a parody of itself when that idiotic character of the computer genius / deus ex machina took over the whole fucking show."
Inside the Criminal Mind,Yeah isn't that why the original lead dude left the series? I seem to remember reading that he thought it was too dark or something.
Inside the Criminal Mind,"No, but Reid did spend half a season in prison"
Inside the Criminal Mind,"The ending was kinda bad though

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs you, you‚Äôre the criminal minds!‚Äù"
Inside the Criminal Mind,"Wow, what a truly bad take, good job."
Inside the Criminal Mind,"Yeah Mandy Patinkin left as he found the material difficult week after week. Interestingly he went on to work on Homeland though which is pretty fucking dark too (far darker in many ways). 

I guess it wasn't constant week after week though, while a major character on Homeland he didn't have huge amounts of screen time so I suspect he got most of his scenes filmed in a short amount of time then had a nice break between seasons."
Inside the Criminal Mind,Yup.
Inside the Criminal Mind,"In the end, our friendship was the true criminal mind."
Inside the Criminal Mind,"Mandy is just difficult to work with and has a stuck up diva attitude.  He has a track record of doing that sort of shit on other productions.  For Chicago Hope, he once said:

> ""I never let directors talk to me, because I was so spoiled. ... I was saying, 'Don't talk to me, I don't want your opinion.' 

(Source: https://www.looper.com/28627/actors-everyone-hates-working/)

Anyways, back to Criminal Minds and Mandy.  The material was dark, yet it took him 3 seasons to quit the show. it's like dude, you're doing a procedural of a fictional FBI team jetting around the country catching the most depraved human beings to ever walk this earth, you have some weird expectations or you're an awful actor if you can't piece together that the formula wasn't gonna change after 20+ episodes.  Dunno what he was expecting, and he could've manned up, be a mature professional given his stature in the industry, set a good example, and told the cast and crew that he's burnt out instead of just peacing out one day because he decided the job wasn't for him.  There was a reason his career kinda died out after quitting CM until the Homeland gig came along."
Inside the Criminal Mind,Yeah Homeland the show where every muslim is a bad person.  Really Mandy.
Inside the Criminal Mind,Tbh i am really loving this show. Glad its renewed
Inside the Criminal Mind,Not shocked it‚Äôs probably one of their most watched shows. I‚Äôm stroked for more!
Inside the Criminal Mind,It's not the same without Reid.
Inside the Criminal Mind,"The transition to streaming makes the show SO much better. They go after serial killers. Being able to curse and use more realistic language overall makes the show so much more watchable then when it was on CBS and they had to be like ‚Äúoh darn it! This evil person killed again!‚Äù  

It‚Äôs a shame that Reid didn‚Äôt want to come back, they didn‚Äôt try to replace him so maybe they are still hoping he will come back. 

It‚Äôs also nice to see them focus on their private lives and how the job affects them. 

Lastly, has anyone noticed that the person who plays Zach Gilford‚Äôs wife is his real life wife? She‚Äôs so pretty. He‚Äôs a scary AF villain."
Inside the Criminal Mind,"This format is so great, having just ""one"" big bad for a season-long arc.  Episodic procedurals have their appeal, but I do like having more time to flesh out the characters."
Inside the Criminal Mind,Do I have to watch the original series?
Inside the Criminal Mind,I think that this was one of the fastest revivals ever. For now I don't intent to watch it. S15 ended nicely.
Inside the Criminal Mind,So does this mean more hope for a certain pairing slow-burning
Inside the Criminal Mind,I'm glad it's renewed since they never finished the first season.
Inside the Criminal Mind,So glad they renewed it more Emily more Dave please xxx
Inside the Criminal Mind,"Same.  While I did enjoy the original network version of the show, I feel like its quality was just OK and it had some serious dips in quality and leaps in logic to get the team to the right place to catch the killer.

This new season, however has really been FANTASTIC.  Hearing Rossi dropping the f-bomb was great and really makes his character complete.

I love the longer story arc and I can't wait to see what the second half brings."
Inside the Criminal Mind,"> I‚Äôm stroked for more

It's that good eh?"
Inside the Criminal Mind,"Don't blame him for wanting to move on tbh, he's the only member of the main cast that's been on the entire original run for like 16 seasons or whatever, probably wanted to do something else."
Inside the Criminal Mind,"Reid‚Äôs not in it!? Damn I was waiting to watch it til the season finished, he was my favorite other than Mandy Patinkin, plus he was the one who delivered a lot of exposition and profiling jargon/strategy quickly and clearly. Won‚Äôt be the same without him"
Inside the Criminal Mind,"Lol whenever their private lives came up in the old show, you just knew it‚Äôs because their family was about to be kidnapped or something. Every character is that show had someone close to them murdered or kidnapped at some point lol."
Inside the Criminal Mind,"Been meaning to check out the reboot. Is it still case of the week styled? 

Or did the switch to streaming allow them to switch to a more continuous story as well? Instead of just reserving that to premieres/finale and a few min at end of each epsiode"
Inside the Criminal Mind,">Lastly, has anyone noticed that the person who plays Zach Gilford‚Äôs wife is his real life wife? She‚Äôs so pretty. He‚Äôs a scary AF villain.

Didn't they play husband and wife in that one Purge movie too? It's neat to see they like working together"
Inside the Criminal Mind,"Yeah the mix up from the killer of the week to this season long arc is so much better. 

Also the language is massively improved. Before it was just painful to watch a show about serial killers but nobody was allowed to say fuck üòÇ Crazy shit. So much better with more real world language. 

They're still playing it safe but have taken some good steps forward in modernising the show as it was very dated when it finished back in 2020. 

I hope with the success of Evolution we see them push things forward a bit more. Drop the over done ""we're shutting down the BAU"" storylines and go with some more hardcore, highly intelligent season long absolute psychos. The best thing about Elias Voit this season is he is smart and they can show us that rather than wrap it up in 45 minutes."
Inside the Criminal Mind,It‚Äôs better than a lot of the later seasons. I would recommend jumping back in!
Inside the Criminal Mind,"I'm confused, who's ""they""?"
Inside the Criminal Mind,"Reid had one background role before landing Criminal Minds. 

That dude needs to play the lottery if he‚Äôs this lucky."
Inside the Criminal Mind,"plus i feel like of that original cast, hes someone that seems to be looking for doing something other than more of a CBS procedural."
Inside the Criminal Mind,It's pretty good so far honestly
Inside the Criminal Mind,"It‚Äôs a season long serial killer. Which is far more realistic, I mean, one small group of trained gov‚Äôt officials catch 20+ SERIAL KILLERS per year? It‚Äôs much better in every way other than it being on a semi-niche streaming service. I love seeing how they deal with the trauma of what they see in their personal lives, and how we get to learn more about the bad guy..his history, his present ‚Äúreal life‚Äù etc.  We get the opportunity to become  more invested in the characters. It‚Äôs now a bit closer in quality to Bosch than network procedurals I think."
Inside the Criminal Mind,"Both. There's an overarching case that's discussed every week, but they also do cases that only last an episode."
Inside the Criminal Mind,Paramount
Inside the Criminal Mind,I'm guessing you haven't watched it yet.  I'm pretty sure they are still catching one serial killer per episode.  Inside of a more constrained limited time frame
Inside the Criminal Mind,"Yes I‚Äôve watched every episode so far. 

*spoilers to follow*


Everyone they caught works for the big bad. It‚Äôs all connected. It‚Äôs not completely different killers/storyline each episode, it‚Äôs one 10? episode story about one serial killer network."
Inside the Criminal Mind,"Would've loved to see another Community season with Frankie. She was a great character and fit right in, which is difficult for any show that late in its run."
Inside the Criminal Mind,Didn‚Äôt criminal minds end like four or five years ago how are we already getting a revival
Inside the Criminal Mind,BIRD GIRL!
Inside the Criminal Mind,She's such a cool person
Inside the Criminal Mind,"After just two years I'd call it just another season, not a ""revival""

I've been waiting far longer than that for the next season of Taboo. And no, it isn't over until Tom Hardy actually says so"
Inside the Criminal Mind,"Wait, I thought they decided against the revival?"
Inside the Criminal Mind,I'm surprised Paget and AJ wanted to come back considering how they were turfed during Season 6 as series regulars for budget reasons.
Inside the Criminal Mind,Hotch kicking air right now.
Inside the Criminal Mind,Still can't get over how dirty they did Gideon.
Inside the Criminal Mind,Her monologue with Dean Pelton over his Honda obsession is one of the funniest scenes in the entire series. She and Keith David were phenomenal that last season. And I hope they are brought back for the movie.
Inside the Criminal Mind,"I‚Äôm ok with it, it was a fun show if it did get kind of soap opera-y"
Inside the Criminal Mind,"> Didn‚Äôt criminal minds end like four or five years ago

The ""series finale"" aired February 19th, 2020. So we're at about two and a half years.

> how are we already getting a revival

I think they were already talking about a ""revival"" less than a year after it ended. Might have been just a couple months, probably would have already happened if COVID hadn't."
Inside the Criminal Mind,"There was talk about it coming back for shortened seasons, since it ended. But then Covid hit, and....."
Inside the Criminal Mind,He does enjoy reflexively kicking people on set.
Inside the Criminal Mind,Eh...Mandy Patinkin kind of did the show dirty when he left in Season 3. Apparently it was a very last minute decision he made.
Inside the Criminal Mind,"Patinkin hated doing the show, and spread the misery around with a massive shovel."
Inside the Criminal Mind,"It took Mandy until Season fucking THREE to realize the show was ""destructive"" to his soul.  Did he honestly expect a procedural crime show about an elite FBI team chasing down serial killers and some of the most deranged human beings on planet earth was going to be bunnies and rainbows at some point?  He should've just manned up and quit like a proper adult instead of going AWOL on the production."

Paradise PD,The obsession with feces got way out of control the more the series went on. I'm no prude but whoever wrote this show is seriously disturbed. It's basically a feces fetish dressed up as an animated comedy. Disgusting.
Paradise PD,"The showrunners also created *Brickleberry* and *Farzar,* which are all the same show.

Netflix saw what Brickleberry was, and wanted that for themselves. Then, after Paradise P.D, they wanted it again."
Paradise PD,"There is a youtuber who did a video on this show, and it's similar contemporaries, Farzar and Brickleberry. I suggest giving it a watch.

The point is essentially these dudes have the ability and audience to make the EXACT SAME SHOW over and over again, with barely any deviation, and they continue to get funding to make more of this same show. The shows themselves are derivative drivel meant to be, like you said, the most basic, inane, ""Heeeeeere's the punchline!"" type of humor that is self-aware in how bad it is, but LITERALLY DOESN'T NEED TO CHANGE BECAUSE PEOPLE KEEP WATCHING IT."
Paradise PD,First season was tolerable. This most recent season is the fucking worst
Paradise PD,"If it means anything OP, hoops was awful too.

Oh the coach is on the screen, he‚Äôs gunna yell and be upset again"
Paradise PD,"Paradise PD is horrible.

Hoops is also horrible.

I would say that they‚Äôre identical levels of horrible for the exact same reasons."
Paradise PD,"I enjoy lowbrow crude adult animation, I really do.  But Paradise PD really is bad.

it's like the show is written by a bot"
Paradise PD,"ah, but you've seen it


they won"
Paradise PD,"I agree with everybody, first season was great, but the following ones just got worse and worse and all of the poop, sex and drugs jokes started to get out of hand.

Watched 2 episodes from the new season and it was unbearable. No witty or clever jokes, just a machine gun of gross and unfunny remarks constantly where there‚Äôs no logic to any of the stories or plot.

Just a big mess of inappropriate jokes that most times doesn‚Äôt even make sense.

Hoops was so much better that it hurts"
Paradise PD,My 15 year old loves it. That says everything.
Paradise PD,"It‚Äôs Yucko the Clown, what do you expect?"
Paradise PD,Everything by that team is claw-your-eyes-out awful. I'm *embarassed* for them. I hope they all made millions because it would take that much cash for me to be associated with that excrement.
Paradise PD,"I use it to help me get to sleep, I've been doing it for a year on and off and still haven't managed to watch all episodes. Cartoons help me fall asleep but if I'm too invested in the story I don't like to miss it so Paraside PD is perfect because it's so simply shit."
Paradise PD,"I absolutely loved this show when it first dropped. Season 1 was hilarious! That episode bit where dude was trying to solve a case with ""*just an ass*"" at the crime scene had be on the floor rolling. lol. 

But after season 1 the show just started doing way too much and got way too out of control for me."
Paradise PD,"the 3 shows by him are all the same show in different settings.  


Brickleberry is in a national park  
Farzar is in space  
Paradise PD is police force  


That being said the characters are all the exact same characters in different bodies, in different places. it's the same damn show with different themes. they even spoil the other shows in the other shows."
Paradise PD,"An absolutely loathsome show with lazy writing, ludicrous characters and fewer laughs per minute than a Disney film. I tried. Maybe I'm not broadminded enough. We watched three episodes and gave up."
Paradise PD,"Welcome to most newer adult animation. 

Every ""sitcom"" style adult animation I've seen recently is horrible. Overused jokes hidden behind a veneer of meta humor or just stupid jokes that aren't funny at all.

The only recent one I've been able to finish was Inside Job."
Paradise PD,In their episodes they also make fun of other Comedy shows such as Brooklyn 99 for being unfunny. And the worst episode of B99 Is still funnier than the entirety of Paradise PD. This show Is on the bottom of the uncanny valley
Paradise PD,It‚Äôs dumb but I like it.
Paradise PD,"Ye i gotta say this is one of the most generic and boring cartoons of this type out there, couldn't last 3 episodes."
Paradise PD,"I liked the first season. Then I found out Brickleberry existed and enjoyed it. I was happy to see season two of paradise. But, season 2 felt like a drag. I started season 3, and I just couldn‚Äôt: dick dick dick, poop poop poop; i just couldn‚Äôt any more."
Paradise PD,"The female cop was pretty much the only reason I watched the show (and not for reasons some might think). After watching the voice actress on Rosanne (when she played the second Becky) and on Scrubs, I enjoyed watching her play an extreme character. I like it when actors switch it up, even if the show/movie is bad. For every other aspect of the show, I heartily agree with the opinions on how bad the show is. Talented writers can make the low brow humor entertaining, the writers of this show aren't talented enough to do that."
Paradise PD,"[Jay Exci](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md75krfN3RI) has several great videos about it (and the show it's a [clone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oz04mSryFFo&t=0s) of). Terrible, but interesting in how it became a money factory for the creators."
Paradise PD,"You like the hoops but don‚Äôt like this? Interesting.  Reddit has some crazy opinions on tv shows, I can‚Äôt get enough of paradise PD.  It‚Äôs more of a guy humor thing but hoops is more dry than that old man‚Äôs balls"
Paradise PD,"It is horrible, but I did laugh at the Higher Hair joke.   I don't know why I finished the whole series."
Paradise PD,"Lmao it‚Äôs funny that you ended your post with the implication that Hoops is better and deserved more seasons when this is literally the exact same complaints I heard when Hoops came out. So many people said all the humor is dumb, crude ‚Äújokes‚Äù that aren‚Äôt even funny.

I‚Äôve never seen either show but they both look and sound terrible to me"
Paradise PD,This show has some of the most famous voice actors ever so I'm pretty sure it's just an excuse for them to say fuck and shit.
Paradise PD, I feel this way about big mouth
Paradise PD,It‚Äôs also just fucking disgusting. No entertainment value at all. Just trying to be as vulgar as possible.
Paradise PD,"Well it was co-creatwd by basically a ""whack-packer."""
Paradise PD,"I enjoyed it, and obviously a lot of other people did too since it got 4 seasons and a new show out of it."
Paradise PD,"I laughed at the first season.  It felt like the sort of natural extension of ""they put that on tv"" from The Simpsons to Family Guy to Archer or Squidbillies, or whatever.  When I started the second season, it was over.  It was nothing but trying to one-up itself to see how low it could go and it stopped being funny at all."
Paradise PD,"I qm not going to sit and pretend Paradise PD is great, and alive more than once said outloud ""Who is watching this?"", but come on......Hoops was dog water. It wasn't funny, and I'm not sure if it was even supposed to be. It's better than Brickleberry but in space, but not by much."
Paradise PD,"This is how I feel about most ""adult animation"" shows. It's always a race to the most juvenile, repetitive, and edgy humour imaginable."
Paradise PD,"See I love the show.
It speaks mto my sense of humor
Trash lol."
Paradise PD,The META jokes are pretty good... but yeah there is some seriously lazy writing with the characters.
Paradise PD,"I honestly thought it was me because that show has been trending and several people recommended it to me. I watched the first two episodes and simply though, ‚ÄúWhat the actual f‚Ä¶?‚Äù"
Paradise PD,"It's a shit show.

No redeeming qualities imo."
Paradise PD,"Dunno but Mark Zuckerberg saying ""Higher Hair"" makes me laugh every time.

Clappers is fantastic. 

Same with Elon saying Pedo."
Paradise PD,Someone needs to stop giving Waco O'Guin money
Paradise PD,fuck man. i LOVE hoops. that show is hilarious
Paradise PD,This is how I felt about Farzar after watching the first episode
Paradise PD,I Enjoyed it why you expecting a stoner comedy to be a masterpiece just go into them expecting them to being a shitshow of things thrown at you.
Paradise PD,"Just watched the trailer. The show has four seasons, wow."
Paradise PD,"Paradise PD, Brickleberry, and Farzar are all the same show made by the same people that tell the same jokes. They're all horrible and extremely predictable, because each character has about 2 reoccurring jokes attached to them.  


Hoops was also an awful show lol."
Paradise PD,Fuck that this shows awesome
Paradise PD,"Is that‚Äôs cause it‚Äôs not woke ?

The episode with the black cop shooting himself was the best commentary on U.S. media in recent years"
Paradise PD,"I tried with this a couple times. Just found myself groaning constantly at any joke, and gave up on the second episode."
Paradise PD,If you haven't already done it try it with some weed (if you smoke weed)
Paradise PD,correction it has 4 seasons and a sci fi spin off
Paradise PD,Yeah I watched two episodes and never went back to it.
Paradise PD,Dana Snyder‚Äôs voice is in too much stuff
Paradise PD,"The only truly great police show was Blotter. It aired for 7 minutes, super late on TBS to kill time."
Paradise PD,"It has the same problems brickleberry has, which is not surprising I think they are made by the same creators."
Paradise PD,if it helps. after seeing a trailer for Hoops i didn't even bother to give it a shot.
Paradise PD,">Like it‚Äôs not funny at all- I feel like it just tries to hav this extreme humour but none of it is funny. Literally every joke is so predictable.

Not only this, at least season 1 & 2 had a story going behind the scenes to keep it somewhat interesting. Season 3 was like straight trash, I haven't bothered watching the fourth installment."
Paradise PD,"Does any one else use cartoons as white noise I don‚Äôt even watch it tbh, it‚Äôs like whatever local news channel they have on at the doctors office"
Paradise PD,They trying too unnecessarily hard
Paradise PD,teens
Paradise PD,"There are a few random really funny jokes in the show, but like 50% of it is shit, and as you watch more it becomes more and more literal."
Paradise PD,I just hope Kyle Kinane gets on a better show now that this one is over
Paradise PD,it was a dumpster fire for sure
Paradise PD,"It's like a Walmart-brand Family Guy, written by 12 year olds."
Paradise PD,There a great video about the greatness that is ‚Äúsmiling friends‚Äù and it does a great job showcasing why every new ‚Äúadult‚Äù cartoon show is just terrible and how smiling friends does everything right.
Paradise PD,Idk. I watched years ago. I probably thought it was funny when high. Atleast the first watch through. I might watch it again.
Paradise PD,You dare disparage the work of Yucko the Clown?
Paradise PD,"2023 will have AI that can write and illustrate better show with the prompt: ""reno 911 but family guy"""
Paradise PD,It's literally just Brickleberry but cops
Paradise PD,I didn‚Äôt get through the first episode of Hoops but Paradise PD isn‚Äôt good either. I do however like Brickleberry
Paradise PD,Dusty has me rolling all the time he‚Äôs funny as fuck!
Paradise PD,Nah this shit is great
Paradise PD,its the biggest piece of dog shit i've ever seen
Paradise PD,"I can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs one of the worst tv shows I‚Äôve ever seen, but I agree the humour side of things has no development. The episodes have absolutely zero direction whatsoever and I find it extremely difficult to sit and watch an episode without spending the whole time on my phone. The storylines go absolutely nowhere and it jumps between one fucking weird scene to another with no relevance to anything whatsoever.

Still, I‚Äôd be lying if I said I hadn‚Äôt ‚Äòseen‚Äô every episode. The latest episodes are definitely the worst by far. It‚Äôs almost as if the writers got absolutely fucking mashed on pills and let their children write a script instead."
Paradise PD,"It's because, as the show's gone on, the two creators have written more and more of the episodes. And there's no one to slap their hands away from the keyboard. They have a very distinct way of writing and you can tell it's them by how crude the humor is. They seem to rely solely on shock value. I actually liked Brickleberry, and I tolerated the first season of Paradise PD; but Paradise PD and Farzar are both awful overall. Brickleberry had similar-ish humor, but they were on a network, so they couldn't rely on just putting the grossest stuff imaginable on screen."
Paradise PD,I also don‚Äôt appreciate toilet humour ngl- like I‚Äôm not offended by it I just think it‚Äôs- well- shit. Like surely you have to have some creativity and more than 3 jokes to be a writer of a comedy show. I don‚Äôt think laughed once- if anything i feel angry after watching it rather than chilled out
Paradise PD,"Remarkably, a feces fetish is the least disturbing thing about creator Roger Black"
Paradise PD,It's created by the insult clown dude
Paradise PD,"Yucko the Clown/Roger Black is one of the creators. He is vile

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdybnTzMoD4"
Paradise PD,You could say it's a shit show...
Paradise PD,Dan Schneider vibes...
Paradise PD,Brickleberry is dope as fuck imo
Paradise PD,Jay Exci? At least the shows gave us his content.
Paradise PD,That LS Mark video is quality
Paradise PD,I‚Äôve never watched it and yet it always seems to be at the top of my Netflix suggestions: perpetually for years.
Paradise PD,what youtuber?
Paradise PD,"no wonder Paradise PD looks familiar. I think I watched a couple episodes of Brickleberry and it wasn't terrible. I googled Paradise PD and I swear I watched it before but it was probably BB. 

Doesn't help that when you Google both the[ same 2 white dudes](https://imgur.com/a/mJuZofB) show up in the same order"
Paradise PD,"I couldn‚Äôt get past the first episode of the new season- I like forced myself to watch the first one cos I‚Äôm the past I‚Äôve started a shoe and not liked it then give it another try and really liked it.

Like detroiters took me a couple episodes to get the atmosphere and then I was laughing out loud at very episode. 

And pentaverate I had to readjust to the old school Mike myers type of comedy.

Like I understand some shows u have to sort of get into. But this for me is a brick wall. It‚Äôs all just the same one Shit low hanging joke again and again.

But no chance for me and this one if I was on the focal group or whatever if they even did them I‚Äôd absolutely refuse it."
Paradise PD,Hoops was fucking awful. Wanted it to be good because it has Jake Johnson but the show is just terrible and easily grouped with all the terrible ‚ÄúAdult Animation‚Äù getting churned out.
Paradise PD,"Farzar was horrific.

Now that I know the showrunners aslo did paradise pd there is no way I am going near it."
Paradise PD,"Out if curiousity, I had chatGPT write me a paradise PD scene. I have no idea if it's accurate, as I have never seen the show. Enjoy.

It's a beautiful day in Paradise, and the sun is shining brightly in the sky. The Paradise PD officers are all gathered in the conference room, eager to hear what their captain has to say.

""Good morning, officers,"" Captain Dwayne says, standing at the front of the room. ""I have some important news to share with you all. We've received a tip that a group of thieves are planning to rob the local bank this afternoon. And, just to add some excitement to the mix, we've also been told that one of the thieves is a former adult film star.""

The officers all let out a collective gasp, and Officer Kevin can't help but let out a wolf whistle.

""Oh man, this is going to be a good one,"" he says, grinning from ear to ear.

""Kevin, focus,"" Captain Dwayne says sternly. ""I want you to be on high alert and make sure to keep an eye out for any suspicious activity.""

The officers nod, trying to compose themselves and focus on the task at hand.

""We'll also be setting up a sting operation to catch these thieves in the act,"" Captain Dwayne continues. ""Officer Debbie, I want you to lead the operation and coordinate with the rest of the team. Make sure to keep me updated on your progress.""

Officer Debbie nods confidently, ready to take on the challenge.

""Alright, let's go out there and make Paradise a safer place,"" Captain Dwayne says, clapping his hands together. ""And if we're lucky, we might even get an autograph from the adult film star thief.""

The officers all chuckle and stand up, heading out to their patrol cars with a renewed sense of determination."
Paradise PD,"I honestly think i could knock a script for a show of a similar quality by myself in less than a day, and im not a writer or anything"
Paradise PD,Haha very good. This interaction is the funniest thing to have come from that show imo
Paradise PD,"I was shocked to find hoops was cancelled, apparently it was too expensive for the amount of people that watched it- I wonder if it‚Äôs cos people think it‚Äôs just a cartoon about basketball"
Paradise PD,"Out of interest, what does he think of shows like American dad, family guy etc and what does he think of the Simpson a"
Paradise PD,My thoughts too
Paradise PD,"What the actual fuck

So do I 

I can‚Äôt sleep to silence, so I have to have something on, but if it‚Äôs something interesting I get distracted, the last three nights I‚Äôve left paradise pd on cos it‚Äôs genuinely so uninteresting and shit that there‚Äôs noise but I fall asleep so quick

I wonder if there‚Äôs more is us and it‚Äôs messing with netflixes algorithm cos they think I‚Äôve watched an entire season a night three nights in a row but I‚Äôm actually just sleeping"
Paradise PD,The only somewhat entertaining concept I thought was when the black guy shot himself and had to represent both sides or something
Paradise PD,"I‚Äôve given it several tries cos there‚Äôs been times before I watched a show hated it watched it again and really enjoyed it. 

Like detroiters I didn‚Äôt really get it till the third episode and then I watched every single episode in one night both season 1 and 2 laughing out loud at several points in every episode despite being completely sober.

Pentaverate I hated the first two times, but u have to readjust to that sort of space balls, Austin powers comedy and then it‚Äôs funny. 

But this show I actually use to fall asleep cos I need noise to sleep and I‚Äôm so uninterested in it and the storyline is so poor/non existent that u don‚Äôt really get sucked in watching it and stay awake"
Paradise PD,"I couldn't even finish the second episode. There are far cleverer shows out there, it makes me wonder who the audience is that is keeping this steaming turd alive."
The Innocents,"2 episodes in. Here‚Äôs my take. There are some women who are basically werewolves, but instead of wolves they turn into Zach Galifianakis. Neat concept!"
The Innocents,Watched it from start to finish in one night. The ending...omg. Heartbreaking. Is there going to be more seasons?!
The Innocents,On the third episode so far and i'm not sure i know anything more than i did after the first one. Hopefully it picks up soon.
The Innocents,"Well if anything, it's a beautifully shot show. "
The Innocents,"I love it! Yes, the development is slow. It'll take like 2-3 episodes for the momentum to build up. What I really like about this show is how most of the characters' development and cornerstones are well explored and reflective of the human nature's ugliness and beauty."
The Innocents,"Seems promising, also my best friend is actually has a role in this series!"
The Innocents,Any good??
The Innocents,"I just finished watching the whole season. Beautiful development, Characters are well put together, and a unique story. A masterpiece. It will definitely be one of Netflix's top shows for 2018. "
The Innocents,5 episodes in...  interesting concept that hasn't gone anywhere so far.  
The Innocents,"Most of the conflict evolve around character stupidity and unnecessary secrets.
It's the main problem of ""teens drama"" these days. 
"
The Innocents,I really hope there's a second season and it's not like the OA where they decided 3 years later to do it. 
The Innocents,"Hi there everyone, this is somewhat related to the innocents series, which in my opinion I think has been exceptional thus far! 

I'm currently 6 episodes in and I'm a huge fan of the cinematics and the soundtrack that it possesses.

 I must say though that I'm unsure where to find a song that is used at the very end of episode 6 when the credits are being shown? I've already tried Shazam and I've had no luck and I was wondering if this may be the place to see if anyone knows the name of the song because it's absolutely mesmerising although I don't know the name of it and can't seem to find it anywhere, any help would be extremely appreciated!

Also if I've posted this in the wrong place may I be pointed in the right direction in terms of posting? Thanks in advance. "
The Innocents,"Best thing netflix has offered for a while, reminds me of the OA. Fucking sick! On the last episode now, shouts out the lead roles harry and june great actors
Everyone watch!"
The Innocents,These kids are as dumb as a bag of rocks.  Running away means running away and you keep running.  If June was open and honest with Harry about how creepy her dad is they would be in France by the next day and off of the grid.  Instead they arse around and well you know how that goes....
The Innocents,Just finished the season... the biggest takeaway I have is don't fucking touch anyone
The Innocents,"That shapeshifting thing is amazing. In episode 2 and the show is great, the development is slow."
The Innocents,"I really loved this show - I'm a sucker for slow burners like this, even though it turns a lot of people off.

The sincerity of Harry and June's relationship was great. Both of them coming to understand the motivations of their parents was great. Soundtrack and cinematography and set design were phenomenal.

I have one major plot gripe. The two teenagers definitely make some bad choices that can be explained by... being teenagers. But the one that I don't get is why did June lie to Harry about shifting into his body? To protect Kam? She already hated Kam at that point, I don't get it at all. Was it just so he would leave and she could go find her mother?"
The Innocents,"This show is really good. I'm on epeisode 7 and i'm buying what they are selling

The Innocents,"Two subs. I feel like a proverbial donkey

Also: please be good. I need something fresh to binge this weekend to get a well deserved rest from work. Otherwise I will just login, again, and that completely destroys the therapeutic value of weekend. 

So, in short, please be good."
The Innocents,"How does the show fare for the adult audience? I'm 29 yrs old (male) and wondering whether I can enjoy/relate to the show in any meaningful way.

The trailer did make it look interesting but its hard to judge."
The Innocents,"I'm 6 episodes in and am enjoying it. I have a question that I don't think was explained. How come some of the people that they shift into end up in comas, i.e., the penine 5, the party girl and the nurse briefly, while others, Steiner, Andrew, etc., can recover fine."
The Innocents,Cloak and Dagger Vol. 2 British adaptation?
The Innocents,"After The OA earlier this week, this is the second weird sci-fi show on Netflix I'm giving up before the first episode is even over. "
The Innocents,what is the name of the green truck in episode 1?
The Innocents,I liked the last 2 episodes but the rest was a bit slow and tedious. Not that bothered if there isn't another season. 
The Innocents,"I finished in less than 2 days. It took a while to pick up, but hopefully in future seasons they can use the powers in more interesting ways, as it's a good concept."
The Innocents,I just finished it and I enjoyed it. That ending has me wanting more!
The Innocents,"I‚Äôve finished it. On the whole I liked it, though it did take a while to get going. But it does all come together pretty well. "
The Innocents,[deleted]
The Innocents,"Finished it last night and had one question that I had that I probably missed in the show 

Early season spoilers

[spoiler](#s ""So what exactly is John's relationshiop to June, Ryan, and their mom? I know he's not June and Ryan's dad. Is he just their step Dad or a family friend? "") "
The Innocents,"I liked it, start was slow but it was good. Little predictable but SPOILER - didn't expect the twist, but I sensed it before it happened.

"
The Innocents,Did they ever explain why you are able to see the real person in reflections when shapeshifting?
The Innocents,So boring!
The Innocents,It's okay but definitely pretty slow going.  I'm 5 episodes in going on 6 and wondering how many times the main characters are going to meet up with a couple that turns out to be into swinging and drugs & the female tries to manipulate naive June into a sexual situation. And what was up with June not answering Harry when he asked her who shifted into him against his will?  Talk about being passive aggressive. 
The Innocents,"So my wife walks in whilst Steiner is on T.V and whispers ""I'm a one man wolf pack"""
The Innocents,Hated it 
The Innocents,It's eerie how similar it feels to cloak & dagger 
The Innocents,[removed]
The Innocents,Just finished the series. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised with the depth of the shape-shifting concept. they even throw in some interesting lore to back it up.
The Innocents,"My husband walked in on me watching it & said, ‚Äúman, Zach Galifinakis is lookin rough‚Äù üòÇüòÇ"
The Innocents,"The end is pretty fucked up but I think it opens up to ""what's next"" in the mastery of shapeshifting"
The Innocents,"I read an article about Socha Groundsell (June) that said that she had been contracted/signed up to play June for 6 seasons.  Can't wait for the next season, that ending was mental."
The Innocents,"I'm on the fourth episode and kind of want to retitle the show ""All The Bad Decisions"""
The Innocents,That's how I felt for the first six and a half episodes of Sharp Objects.  
The Innocents,Yay. Another slow Netflix series. Do they have more than a few that don't have pacing issues? 
The Innocents,That sounds promising. I am a sucker for cinematography. Remember Les Revenants? 
The Innocents,Is the show set in the UK?
The Innocents,Which character 
The Innocents,"I am not sure. Nothing is happening much in the first third of the first episode. I am a bit annoyed by the way everyone talks, every word wishing to be profound."
The Innocents,Any nudity or sex scenes?
The Innocents,[deleted]
The Innocents,"Yes!  I wanted to smack Harry a few times, especially at the end."
The Innocents,"What do you mean? The second OA season just got delayed, right? I will come"
The Innocents,"I'm only up to episode 4, so far the closing credits theme has been this: https://m.soundcloud.com/carlyparadiscomposer

It's really awesome, but maybe not what you're looking for.

This site helped me track it down: https://www.tunefind.com/show/the-innocents/season-1/"
The Innocents,The song is To Build a Home by Cinematic Orchestra! I really loved the soundtrack in this show. I love hearing songs I know in really intense or pivotal scenes. It makes it so much better! 
The Innocents,If you love shape shifting you should check out Legion
The Innocents,I just watched that ep there and what I took away from it was that what Kam did was actually pretty rapey for Harry and almost for June. If June had shifted into Harry he probably would have thought it was accidental whereas if he‚Äôd known what Kam had done he might have been traumatised and so she lied about it. 
The Innocents,That location is well known around these parts. There was a murder there back in the 70s were the son killed his mother with an axe. 
The Innocents,"I‚Äôm honestly in just because of the ‚Äúteens runaway from home and experience how dark and dangerous the world truly is‚Äù vibe. 


I honestly feel like the draw of the series is that specific aspect and if you go into it expecting a bunch of other epic stuff then you might be disappointed. A good show though."
The Innocents,It's interesting to see that it's basically an hour drive from Bergen and you don't need a ferry *and* a little boat to get there.
The Innocents,"I am usually wary of shows with teen actors, but the leads on this are good. It's slow AF until episode three, but then it gets interesting-- I ended up binge-watching the last few.   

I didn't expect to have these emotions and I thought the show was good at letting the viewer into other character's perspectives.  

I'd definitely recommend it to someone who enjoys shows that are a little messed up. People who want a straightforward storyline and don't like not knowing everything right away may not enjoy this. It's billed as Sci-Fi so suspending your disbelief is a given."
The Innocents,"I'm 35 and I loved this show, it's starts slow and yes there are aspects that might appeal more to teen audience but overall the story is nicely build up and I got emotionally invested, the finale was great, can't wait for the next season."
The Innocents,"26 yo male here. I liked it, it has some teen vibes, but it also has some mystery."
The Innocents,"Cinematography and soundtrack are good. Decent cast and concept, but let down by poor writing IMO. Some of the dialogue is a bit juvenile (and I don't just mean for the teenage characters, rather, in general). Harry's decisions just don't make much sense to me. I don't know how much of it is poor writing or possibly that it's not acted convincingly? That goes for some of the other characters. There's one guy who keeps trying to syringe the protagonist and brutalise everyone around him, despite the fact he's clearly got her best interests at heart. I put it down to poor/lazy writing, and it's too hard for me to suspend the nagging voices in my head trying to rationalise what's going on for me to really enjoy the show.

Given the gratuitous amount of lesbian kissing, teen sex scenes, etc, this is clearly aimed at a teen audience; but for me, it doesn't quite manage to broaden its appeal to the old age groups (I'm late twenties and watch 6 episodes cos my girlfriend got into it on a hungover binge)."
The Innocents,"It's a chain thing. If you shift in person A and then back, they are okay. If you shift in person A and then B and then back, person A is FUCKED but person B is OK. But I wonder what will happen if you shift in the fucked up person a second time and then come back."
The Innocents,"I don't think we learn that this season, probably because they also don't know why. Hopefully it gets answered in future seasons"
The Innocents,I mean no? Not at all
The Innocents,Please do not be that. That show was oddly off the mark and not in an entertaining way. I can't put my finger on it now. 
The Innocents,"Be glad, The OA gets fucking infuriating in the end"
The Innocents,"The problem with the OA is that a great many people go in thinking they are watching whats at face value.  Then they casually watch, miss important clues, and then the ending ends up just being a bunch of people saving the day with interpretive dance.  I can see that as frustrating, but if you actually caught all the clues, things get really odd, and you end up rewatching it to see if you can find more hidden gems.  [Hint](#s ""Look closely at the books found in the bedroom"")"
The Innocents,Land Rover Defender
The Innocents,I wouldn't be surprised if that explains June's brother's disability.
The Innocents,Probably step dad.
The Innocents,No
The Innocents,[removed]
The Innocents,"Thanks man, I‚Äôve actually really enjoyed it. I just cracked myself up while watching the first couple episodes and felt the need to share my joke, so of course I had to post it to reddit. "
The Innocents,OMG RIGHT?! I just finished it at 4am and there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm sleeping tonight. So glad I‚Äôm not working tomorrow. 
The Innocents,So then they are going to break the rules? Thats dumb
The Innocents,that's how i have felt and currently feel about Hulu's CASTLE ROCK. 
The Innocents,"Wait, I'm like half way through episode 3, you're saying it doesn't pick up from here? The whole season is a slow burn and not in the nice rectify slow burn way? "
The Innocents,jesus christ....6 episodes?

The Innocents,"Quite a few ""Netflix Originals"" are well shot and directed, the show just may not be good though lol."
The Innocents,Yea. N some scandinavian lands
The Innocents,"He played Harry‚Äôs best friend, Az! "
The Innocents,Finished the first episode and it's safe to say it's weird 
The Innocents,">I am not sure. Nothing is happening much in the first third of the first episode. I am a bit annoyed by the way everyone talks, every word wishing to be profound.

You're serious?   I went back and re-watched that first third about 5 times after later episodes...."
The Innocents,"3-4 nudity scenes, and 1-2 sex scenes. "
The Innocents,why do u want to know pervert
The Innocents,"Just finished the series and it was definitely worth the watch!
I also recommend The Dark on netflix

The Innocents,"That's it! The 'skip to next episode' button on Netflix meant that I didn't really give the song much time until the 6th episode, I really appreciate the reply because SoundCloud just didn't cross my mind either. "
The Innocents,"Although legion=absofuckinlutely yes.. but it's much more then shapes gifting .. it's reality, time, mind wtf shifting.. Guaranteed you will exclaim WTF! at one time or another during the show.."
The Innocents,"Amazing, TIL. It's gorgeous country"
The Innocents,"I didn't go in expecting anything. I think pre judging something you haven't seen to be pointless.

&#x200B;

I just watched the finale and i think it's wonderful. The running away part is a means to an end for the main characters to figure out who and what she is."
The Innocents,I want it. How much? I need an evil lair
The Innocents,Thanks for the honest opinion. Will see if any others offer alternative opinions. 
The Innocents,"Yeah, the writing was my main frustration too. Too many contrived, overly dramatic moments, that would be easily resolved if people just spoke instead of staying mute or storming off before getting any answer. Overall I did enjoy the show, despite a few eye-rolling moments. Especially in the last half of the last episode, when I thought my eyes would roll right out of my head... I think this show could've been shortened by 2 espisodes to pick up the pace a bit, and not have so many teenage-angst moments as filler.

&#x200B;"
The Innocents,"Finished the season and I think they do explain it. If you switch into person A and then back, they are fine. But if you switch into person A and then person B, person A is stuck. That is why from the Penine 5, the old lady, the last one shifted into, was fine, but the rest weren't.
And without giving anything away, that also explains the last scene."
The Innocents,"1Michael when the mother asked the father if it was true that the people never woke up, the father told her that the last person she shifted into woke up but the others before never did. that was the giveaway. So at the end, when she shifts into harry and then the mother comes and touches the her while she is Harry, the mother wakes up but Harry is fucked. If the mother never touched her then Harry would have woke up and been ok. "
The Innocents,I Ioved it personally.
GHOUL,Didn't she leak the fact that Method Man's wife had cancer? Good riddance.
GHOUL,13 years of damage done.
GHOUL,Thank god. She‚Äôs a miserable hateful person
GHOUL,I remember listening to her on the morning radio for a bit and I quit when she was telling people they didn't need to tell their dating partners they had STDs.
GHOUL,r/upliftingnews
GHOUL,*everyone liked that*
GHOUL,Good. Her and James Corden can both leave the air and go live on an island with no cameras.
GHOUL,Where's Joel McHale when you need him?
GHOUL,Better late than never I guess. I just with they took out this trash before it started to stink.
GHOUL,"I remember her getting an entire audience to applaud the idea of tricking a man into fathering a child. She lost all of my respect in that instant. I hope she gets better from her illness, but she doesn‚Äôt deserve a national forum imo.

edit: grammar"
GHOUL,A turd so big it took 13 years to flush
GHOUL,"Good, she's an awful human being"
GHOUL,"Her, Corden and Ellen leaving in the same time frame is a real bastion of positivity!"
GHOUL,I can't believe there was enough of an audience to keep her on air for 13 years
GHOUL,[removed]
GHOUL,Good riddance.
GHOUL,dula peep
GHOUL,"Never liked her after what she did to Method Man's wife in 2006 after she let slip on her radio show that his wife, Tamika Smith, had been battling breast cancer. They were to trying to keep it private."
GHOUL,Just a trash human through and through.
GHOUL,13 years of cultural pollution.

GHOUL,I'd cheer but she will be replaced with another garbage daytime talk show I am sure.

This does put a smile on my face."
GHOUL,"Remember the bullshit alliyah movie she produced? alliyahs family specifically told her they can‚Äôt use her music and disapproved of her making the movie, so they had to use songs she didn‚Äôt even sing"
GHOUL,13 years too late.
GHOUL,Bitch needed to fuck off since year one but thats how unfair life is
GHOUL,I just feel like anyone who watches her show doesn‚Äôt tip their server.
GHOUL,Didnt she also make fun of drew carrey after his wife died? Good riddance.
GHOUL,"It‚Äôs my favorite game. Dunk on Wendy

Just to refresh your memories:

‚Ä¢	‚Å†She publicized the private healthcare information of Method Man's wife, broadcasting that she had cancer and that Method Man was having an affair with his wife's physician. (which was a lie).
‚Ä¢	‚Å†She's the one that spread the rumours that Tupac was raped in jail and had one testicle
‚Ä¢	‚Å†She's proudly claimed that she doesn't let her teenage son close his bedroom door, ever.  And that when her son walked in on her giving a blowjob to her husband, it was her son's fault for not walking loud enough to notify her ahead of time, and when he walked in, she just continued like there was nothing wrong there.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†After Kesha was ruled by a judge to complete her recording contract after alleging Dr. Luke sexually assaulted her, Wendy Williams said she questioned the validity of Kesha‚Äôs accusations because ‚Äúshe‚Äôs like, 30 years old or something‚Äù and because she didn‚Äôt have recorded proof of abuse. That‚Äôs right ‚Äî Williams basically told the world that sexual assault isn‚Äôt sexual assault unless you have it on video. ‚ÄúWhen the sexual abuse ‚Äî alleged sexual abuse ‚Äî started, why weren‚Äôt they rolling camera on it?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúI mean, it‚Äôs so easy. Like, men are so stupid that if you‚Äôre sexually abusing us it‚Äôs so easy to catch you.‚Äù
‚Ä¢	‚Å†She got into it with Alyssa Milano on her show. Milano frequently posts photos of herself breastfeeding on social media, and has been outspoken about allowing mothers to breastfeed in public. Wendy Williams said to Alyssa Milano on her show: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need to see that. Because I just don‚Äôt want to‚Äù , and said that, for her, breasts are ‚Äúmore sexual than a feeding thing,‚Äù adding, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why I feel this way. ‚Ä¶Breastfeeding is only a particular amount of time. The rest of your life, your breasts are sexual things.‚Äù
‚Ä¢	‚Å†About Ariana Grande, Wendy Williams once stated that she could never ‚Äúthink of [Ariana] Grande as a woman‚Äù because she looked too young. Williams went on to say that Grande would ‚Äúforever look 12.‚Äù Most of the time, if someone tells a woman that they appear younger than they are, it‚Äôs taken as a compliment, but Williams made clear that she did not intend to flatter Grande in any way. ‚ÄúAnd I don‚Äôt mean that in a good way. It‚Äôs nice to look younger than you are, but when you look too young and then you‚Äôre short‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs only like 4‚Äô11,‚Äù
‚Ä¢	‚Å†About Nicole Scherzinger breaking up with Lewis Hamilton, she said it was sad to see Scherzinger spend ‚Äúseven years of her life breaking up and getting back together.‚Äù Specifically, Williams noted Scherzinger‚Äôs age ‚Äî she was 37 at the time ‚Äî and very bluntly added, ‚ÄúThey [men] can have babies whenever they want. You know what I mean? Those are seven years you can never get back.‚Äù
‚Ä¢	‚Å†About Jennifer Lawrence's nude photo's from The Fappening, she told Vanity Fair,  ‚ÄúJennifer Lawrence, you know what? Don‚Äôt sweat this young lady,‚Äù Williams started. ‚ÄúI mean, you‚Äôre the one who took the pictures‚Ä¶ You don‚Äôt look bad under your clothes, and I think the [hack] has actually made your career even hotter.‚Äù
‚Ä¢	‚Å†About Paris Jackson saying she considers herself Black b/c that's what her father told her, and told her to be proud of her heritage, regardless of what she looked like.  Williams mocked the teenager‚Äôs statement, since Paris, whose mother, Debbie Rowe, is Caucasian, appears to have light skin. ‚ÄúBy the way, she considers herself black, period. She‚Äôs not going to address this again. She was raised black. Her father would constantly remind her of what it means to be black and proud and so don‚Äôt ask her again,‚Äù William recapped. ""I get that she considers herself black and everything, but I'm just talking about the visual because you know ‚Ä¶ black is not what you call yourself, it‚Äôs what the cops see you when they got steel to your neck on the turnpike. It‚Äôs what they see.‚Äù She added, ‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs cute, and good for her.‚Äù
‚Ä¢	‚Å†About Selena Gomez and The Weeknd dating: ""First of all, they were spotted kissing outside of a restaurant in L.A... the restaurant they were at... it‚Äôs where you go when you want to be photographed. They just stand there all day with their cameras waiting to photograph somebody. Selena, you just got out of rehab for the umpteenth time. The Weeknd has admitted to being a substance abuser‚Ä¶If you‚Äôre trying to stay sober, and you‚Äôve got Lupus and you‚Äôre trying to be well and take care of yourself... the only reason why I could see that you would be with The Weeknd is because maybe he‚Äôs writing music for you. Maybe you want to seem cool, or edgy.""
‚Ä¢	‚Å†She tried to get Lil Wayne's music banned from the radio b/c she didn't like it.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†She went ahead and made that Lifetime movie about Aaliyah without the permission of her producers at the time, Timbaland and Missy Elliott, and without the permission of Aaliyah's family, stating: ""The family doesn't want the story to be told but we're doing it anyway. It's not told in a seedy tasteless way,"" Williams said.  Also, she stated ""In my opinion, we did a great job telling the story that the family was scared to put out there,"" Williams said of the final project.   Like Timbaland, many fans of the singer have expressed their disappointment with the film on social media, accusing Lifetime of romanticizing Aaliyah's relationship with R. Kelly, whom she illegally married when she was 15 and Kelly was 27.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†She invited Whitney Houston for a radio interview, then point blank asked her if she was currently smoking crack.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†She's publicly called Tyrese, Usher, LL Cool J, and Tyler Perry gay, without any proof.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†She's said that Beyonce ""sounds like she has a fifth grade education"""
GHOUL,"Remember when she burped and farted on air

GHOUL,That shit was on air for 13 YEARS?!?!?!   Who the fuck is watching that garbage?
GHOUL,"Never watched her show , still glad it's over"
GHOUL,Made a whole career off of being a mean spirited gossipy hurtful bag of shit.
GHOUL,13 years to late.
GHOUL,Finally! So tired of her bullying celebreties
GHOUL,"Good, nobody deserves this as much as her."
GHOUL,"Good riddance, dude always creeped me out anyway üòÇ"
GHOUL,Who the fuck was watching this show? Do they vote?
GHOUL,"Nice. Never watched her show, but I've seen clips of her and she seems like an extremely hateful and shallow person. I hate there are so many people like that with platforms and large audiences"
GHOUL,"It's ending because Wells Fargo has conservatorship over her.

She's a horrible person, but A FUCKING BANK shouldn't have conservatorship over a human being.

We should be worried about that."
GHOUL,Good riddance to bad rubbish.
GHOUL,Holy crap‚ÄîWendy Williams and James Corden? The world is healing
GHOUL,"First Ellen, then James Corden, now Wendy Williams. Which terrible person who has a talk show is gonna be next? 

Does Dr Oz have a show anymore? I know he's running for Senate in a state he's never lived in but don't know if his snake oil show is still on the air."
GHOUL,"Jesus, finally. 

That woman is an irredeemable cunt through and through. I hope she manages to lose every dollar she‚Äôs ever earned. She doesn‚Äôt deserve a cent of it."
GHOUL,"Uh, what does ""In Syndication"" mean in this context if they are still making new episodes?"
GHOUL,Is this possibly related to the whole Wells Fargo conservatorship stuff?
GHOUL,Thank Christ this wingbat is gone.

GHOUL,‚ÄúSo raise your hand if you know her‚Äù
GHOUL,Good.
GHOUL,Thank god. They named a street after her in home town of Asbury park and then a few months later a child was grazed by a stray bullet.
GHOUL,"Good, fuck that cunt"
GHOUL,13 years too late.
GHOUL,Fuck anyone who watches this show and helped give her all this power.
GHOUL,And I have never seen one show. I don‚Äôt feel like I missed anything.
GHOUL,It's a miracle it lasted this long. One less piece of trash on tv.
GHOUL,It is INSANE that she's been able to stay on TV for 13 years. The bullshit she's said and people still give her a platform and at the same time support her? man fuck her.
GHOUL,Good riddance
GHOUL,FUCK YES!!!!!!!!
GHOUL,Good.
GHOUL,"Thank God the only shit worse is watching the Kardashians! I should say seeing them I have never watched one second  any of their shows
and my IQ is better for it!"
GHOUL,"Thank god, she‚Äôs such a monster"
GHOUL,13 is pretty long for a gossip show with rarely any guests... I don't know she kept it up when half of hollywood hates her.
GHOUL,"Thank You!    
Enough with the damn afternoon talk shows.  Put some old soap opera reruns, or What's Happening? The Jeffersons, Barney Miller,  back on!"
GHOUL,The fact that she had her show for the better part of two decades shows how toxic femininity is not only allowed but encouraged.
GHOUL,We have been blessed
GHOUL,"am I the only one who thought she was a man?  I knew nothing of her before she got a show and when I first saw her and her exaggerated figure and boobs, I really thought she was a drag queen who got a show."
GHOUL,Goodbye and Good Riddance
GHOUL,"Please, God... Please let her just go away after this.... please.... 

&#x200B;

Society needs a win here..."
GHOUL,Oh please let this be the last I hear or see her forever.

GHOUL,‚ÄúDeath to all of them‚Äù - wendy williams 2021
GHOUL,Fuck her.
GHOUL,I remember her putting down Rhonda Rousey for being on Sports Illustrated saying that she essentially wasn‚Äôt pretty enough and who was she to be on the mag. Good riddance troll.
GHOUL,"For the longest time, I thought Wendy was Trans. Just something different about her appearance..."
GHOUL,"Few more face lifts and she can be a Michael Jackson impersonator.

EDIT oh yeah, it's MY fault she paid to look like that, pfft."
GHOUL,"Thank fuck, now go back under the bridge you crawled out from you creepy frozen face asshole."
GHOUL,This is awesome news. Good frogging riddance.

Take My Brother Away,They look happy in that photo. I feel horrible for everybody. Too young. Rest in peace
Take My Brother Away,"My heart is with the family, I truly hope they give Hayden the space and grace of healing if she needs to skip the press tour for the new Scream, can't imagine juggling both."
Take My Brother Away,[removed]
Take My Brother Away,I can't even imagine.
Take My Brother Away,"Sad news. No idea if this is the cause but recently anytime an otherwise healthy young person passes away unexpectedly, I wonder if they got some fentanyl-laced counterfeit pills. Fentanyl is getting into all kinds of pills, even those not masquerading as opioids (like counterfeit Adderall). Not saying that this was the case here, but people should be aware of this danger."
Take My Brother Away,"My wife‚Äôs cousin was randomly good friends with this guy since they were probably 15 or so. Father in law sent us this news yesterday, super sad stuff"

Take My Brother Away,Damn. Hopefully the family gets the space they need to get through this.
Take My Brother Away,"28, just a kid"
Take My Brother Away,Most people I know who died so young died from overdoses. It saddens me to no end.
Take My Brother Away,"This sucks, and it's so very sad for Hayden.  I'm currently watching both Heroes and Nashville and in both her character is this  tragic kid, unable to deal with what life has served up to her.  Worse, I just found out today that the plotline in Nashville SPOILER ALERT  tracks her real life struggles with her pregnancy and post partum depression.
And apparently she has issues with substance abuse IRL.

Poor kid.  To lose her brother.  She's my daughter's age and I just want to hug her.  I hope she gets through this."
Take My Brother Away,Jesus that‚Äôs young. Rest in peace and much love to his family.

Take My Brother Away,Calling it now. Fentanyl.
Take My Brother Away,"It‚Äôs absolutely dumbfounding all of the comments here talking about ‚Äúyoung people‚Äù dying from all these random things. Trying to avoid the most obvious reason for his death. Even the tabloid news sources claiming he was popping pain pills ‚Äúlike gumballs.‚Äù 

Guess what? If you got the shot, it doesn‚Äôt matter how many lies and excuses you people make up. You can‚Äôt avoid what is already in your bloodstream. 

So you can try to spread disinformation all that you want. You can try and make yourself feel better all that you want. You can flag all the comments that you don‚Äôt like. 

There is no escaping it though. Have fun trying to reason it away. Judgment is at hand."

A great idea from a 20th Cen philosopher & lead singer with The Doors: ‚ÄúNobody gets out of here alive.‚Äù  Life is ‚Äòprecious‚Äô and that‚Äôs a word that describes and embraces that next moment where a color or the daylight surprises and delights you, melting in a welcoming kiss with your beloved - warm, familiar, yet always thrilling, or the delightful expressions of a child and their joy as you play with them.

Take My Brother Away,"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rest_in_power

This phrase came about to try to call special attention to the *struggle for equal power* by groups of marginalized and oppressed people that the deceased person represented, either through activist struggles or through martyrdom or other victimhood. 

It isn't really supposed to just be some interchangeable phrase with rest in peace. When non-oppressed groups use this term it strips this history from it and begins turning into just another interchangeable term. It robs it of its purpose.

But liberals say pointing this out is gatekeeping. Do whatever you want, white liberals. You always have."

Great News,I‚Äôve really enjoyed Mr. Mayor so far.
Great News,"I've enjoyed it, too. That said, a pretty common trend for great sitcoms seems to be that it takes a while -- sometimes a whole season -- to really come into their own and figure out what works. The Office, Parks and Rec, Schitt's Creek, and Seinfeld all followed this pattern. Mr. Mayor has the pieces, and you catch glimpses of its potential, and I think it has a great future if it can last that long."
Great News,Great News was so good. In my opinion it might be the best NBC comedy since Community and Parks and Rec ended outside of The Good Place and about half of Brooklyn Nine-Nine's run on NBC
Great News,"I disliked Great News and I'm not feeling Mr Mayor yet, but hopefully it turns around.

I think part of the issue is knowing this was supposed to be a Jack Donaghy spinoff."
Great News,"I've enjoyed everything about Mr. Mayor outside of Holly Hunter. 

Great News took a lot of time to hit its stride too. It wasn't until right near the end of season 1 that the jokes started really clicking."
Great News,"Same. It feels like Tina Fey was at her absolute best with 30Rock. Then she used all her crazy ideas and extreme absurdity on Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. Then anything leftover went to Great News, which felt like it tried and failed to be 30Rock 2.0.

But now with Mr Mayor, it feels like the tank is empty. Which is too bad, I want more 30Rock-like content!"
Great News,Feels like the same show. But I am liking Mr. Mayor. The recent episode really nailed modern office sexual harrasment issues.
Great News,"Parks or The Office would have left there be a sweet moment where Jayden enjoyed his lunch knowing his co-workers cares. Fey and Carlock had to have Jayden‚Äôs eyes bandaged and have him eat like a dog. They seem allergic to a sweet sincere moment not punctuated with absurdity. 

Great News had a little bit more heart than a typical Fey/Carlock show but then again they only produced. It wasn‚Äôt fully theirs."
Great News,Isn't Mr. Mayor like 5 episodes in? Parks and Rec hadn't nailed the sincerity of Parks and Rec 5 episodes in.
Great News,"Y'all need to give it time. I love how it's being compared to Parks and Rec, but how quickly some forget the train wreck that was its first season. The fifth episode just barely came out."
Great News,"Great News starts off well but was just okay. Sometimes I feel like Tina Fey tries too hard and her jokes are predictable. Of course 30 Rock, Mean Girls were genius and the first season was UKS was wonderful too, but everything else that followed has been a fun watch but not amazing. 

That said I‚Äôm still going to check out Mr.Mayor because I have a Veep shaped hole that needs filling"
Great News,"Disagree!

My Mayor is a much better show already. Great news was a cringe fest where they talked too fast. Mr Mayor has the rapid fire jokes, but they are delivered by people with decent comedic timing and not some washed up loud mouth and her daughter.

OK Higgins was OK in News, but he is a treasure. And he is no Danson, that's for sure!

The short lady on Mr Mayor has funny lines, the mom on News was an annoying trope.

I could go on and on, but I hated Great News so much that I purged it from memory."
Great News,"Great News was okay, a mostly unsuccessful attempt to mimic the comedy of 30 Rock. Certainly didn't nail it.

Not bad, but not something I have any interest in ever rewatching. The main character in particular sucked."
Great News,"Great News was only worth a season, they ran out of ideas... If Mr Mayor isn't even that good. Wow."
Great News,Me too. I live in LA so it‚Äôs more familiar joke-wise than  30Rock for me.
Great News,"Tina Fey‚Äôs original concept for 30 Rock centered around a news program instead of a variety comedy show. Knowing that, Great News always felt like a lesser or half formed concept to me, kind of like the novel like Go Set a Watchman."
Great News,"I agree about Great News feeling like a failed attempt at 30 Rock 2.0. I think a large part of that is due to casting mistakes. 

* Briga Heelan is a good actor, but Liz Lemon she ain't in a strictly visual sense. 
* Nicole Richie is limited. They seemed to want her to be like an amalgam of Jenna Maroney and Jacqueline White - but Richie is nowhere near as talented as Jane Krakowski. 
* The guy who played Greg was - fine? 
* John Michael Higgins plays big and bold well, but not stupid - not as well as Tracy Morgan and Tituss Burgess, at least. 
* Andrea Martin was well cast, but I found her character to be annoying.

The rest is due to inferior writing. Tracey Wigfield may have worked with Tina Fey, but she doesn't have Fey's writing instincts or abilities. The show was like watching an Uncanny Valley version of 30 Rock. It largely looked like it should, but it didn't live in the skin very well."
Great News,"I enjoyed it, Jayden really stole that episode imo."
Great News,"Ya really good update to the Diversity Day episode of The Office.

Still not exactly sure what the shows overall goal is. It's very confusing as Ted Danson has way too many parallels to Trump for it to be a coincidence. I originally thought that the writers were going to use the lower stakes as Mayor of Los Angeles to make it easier to poke fun at the Trump scandals. Like Trump is funny but it's hard to joke about kids in cages or war crimes and the mayor of los angeles doesn't have to do that 

Alternatively I thought their goal might have been to write a fantasy about how a Trump like character could grow and become a good person, but that doesn't seem to be the case either. He seems to be getting better at being mayor, but not really becoming a better person.

Or is Mr. Mayor supposed to be reconciling how leftier Democrats feel about Biden being old and out of touch? This also doesn't quite make sense as Biden isn't really zany or inexperienced. 

It seems like they are trying to do all of these things at once."
Great News,[deleted]
Great News,"I get that in comparison to 30 Rock, one of the best live action comedies ever, but imo Great News was a really good show on its own merits. It was consistently very funny, with a great ensemble cast. I think that unlike other Fey shows, there‚Äôs lots of people who could be the protagonist - John Michael Higgins‚Äô character as an out of touch newsreader trying to adapt, Nicole Ritchie‚Äôs bimbo-y anchor, Horatio Sanz‚Äô as a slacker editor, the setting is so ripe for stories and the characters so much more grounded than 30 Rock that it would work."
Great News,Fey didn‚Äôt create Great News.
Great News,I disagree that he's based off Trump since he apparently is a self made millionaire. He's a limousine liberal who's out of touch with the average American. His heart is in the right place.
Great News,"I can agree with the latter, but disagree with the former."
Great News,She executive produced it but her protege created it.
Great News,Well ya his backstory sounds like Ted Turner who also got started in billboards.
Great News,"That's not Great News 

"
Great News,"TIL that Tina Fey had a show on NBC, and a show that wasn't Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.

Damn, if I knew this existed I would have watched it. But no one talked about it so I had no idea it existed."
Great News,I'm sad but not shocked. The Season 2 finale served as a decent series finale and gave you the feeling the characters' lives would continue on as usual at MMN.
Great News,"Goddamn, there are just so many good shows being cancelled. "
Great News,"Well damn, that sucks. You can‚Äôt really say that NBC didn‚Äôt try to make this show work though. They kept giving it their best timeslots. 

Season 1 aired after The Voice and it flopped. They still gave Season 2 the prime timeslot after Will & Grace and it flopped again. Shame it never really found an audience, it was a great show. "
Great News,"Damn, this week is like the red wedding for TV shows. "
Great News,"Oof, this one hurts.  Fantastic cast, hilarious writing, found its comedic groove almost right away.  Really really disappointed about this."
Great News,I didn't even know she had a show.
Great News,"fuck that, andrea martin is amazing"
Great News,"Not really surprised.  Considering the second season aired most of its episodes over December and January when shows typically take a hiatus, it seemed like they were just trying to burn off what they had.  Shame, it was a good show and a spiritual successor to *30 Rock*, but it was lucky to get even get a second season with as much as it struggled to find an audience."
Great News,Tina Fey had a comedy series? I would have watched that.
Great News,"Fuck me. First B99, Mick, and LMOE, now Great News. Only comedies left that I like are Superstore, Trial and Error, and Good Place."
Great News,"Fuck. 

I knew this was going to happen, but still. I loved this show. "
Great News,Awww man. That was such a great show. Hope they try to find another home for it. Briga Heelan is hilarious in it (and also very pretty) 
Great News,Andrea Martin loses this and Difficult People. Damn
Great News,Aww man season two was really fun. 
Great News,Never even knew this was a show. Great advertising by NBC.
Great News,Lmao this reads like its a The Onion article
Great News,"""Great news everyone;  terrible news"""
Great News,"Man, that sucks."
Great News,I read the title and thought ‚Äúhow is that great news‚Äù
Great News,"I liked the show but I‚Äôm not surprised. Too be honest, I expected this and Santa Clarita Diet (which I love, btw) to get cancelled before The Mick and I‚Äôm fucking devastated that The Mick got cancelled. 

Sidenote: I love Santa Clarita Diet but I just didn‚Äôt expect it to get renewed because it‚Äôs one of Netflix‚Äôs most under rated show. "
Great News,"They should really take into account season pass buyers/money from sub services/DVR numbers into account. The way the industry is now we‚Äôre going to end up with jack shit on TV. The golden age of TV is over I believe.

This is a general comment to all the stuff being cancelled not just this show."
Great News,"It's not funny like an Asian man slipping on a banana peel; it's offensive, like a white man slipping in a banana peel. "
Great News,Too bad. This was one of the funniest shows on TV. Briga Heelan had perfect comedic timing. 
Great News,"Tina Fey had a series on NBC?
"
Great News,"You can‚Äôt fault NBC. They put this on after their biggest comedy (Will and Grace), but nobody watched."
Great News,"Wow, good job on your marketing, NBC, this is the first I'm even hearing of this show."
Great News,Disappointing but not surprising 
Great News,Dread it. Run from it. Destiny still arrives. 
Great News,A Tina Fey show and it stars Briga Heelan what?? I have to watch this now.
Great News,"Awww man :( This show is so densely funny that I could rewatch episodes over and over. My bf and I still sing ""You Better Wash Dish"" all the time, and the whole cast was hilarious. This makes me sad."
Great News,"Though I like both, I'd rather see this renewed than *Brooklyn Nine-Nine*."
Great News,"I binged this show last month and loved it.  It really found its footing in season 2. I've never heard of the main actress, Briga Heelan before but she was awesome in this show.  Great comedic timing and a lot of charisma.  

I bet if this show got a third season it would be just as good or better than Kimmy Schmidt."
Great News,She had a show? I've been out of the loop since I only have Netflix
Great News,Honestly never heard of it.
Great News,"Caught this show on Hulu, it just... wasn‚Äôt that great. Wasn‚Äôt aware a second season was made. Sucks, because I always give shows a second season."
Great News,"I enjoyed this series; however, it didn't seem to be marketed/promoted well. I think under different circumstances it would have been a hit. "
Great News,"You just don't disrespect Dave Letterman when he's a guest on your show.

Ever."
Great News,I loved the show and this cast but the writing was on the wall when bringing on Tina Fey to start the second season didn't move the ratings at all.
Great News,"After the way NBC treated this second season, and given that I never heard anyone talking about it, I expected this, but it's still disappointing."
Great News,She had a TV series?
Great News,###I miss this show. üò¢
Great News,"Just finished watching ‚ÄòGreat News‚Äô, and I was devastated when I found out it got cancelled. The show had so much potential, especially Greg and Katie‚Äôs relationship. But at least the ending of season 2 felt pretty complete."
Great News,"Agreed. That‚Äôs... Bad News?

Edit: I am actually sad to see this absurd comedy go away. I thought it was great."
Great News,"This. It must have been poorly promoted, because I have never even heard of it, and I'd definitely have given it a try if I was aware of it."
Great News,"I had zero knowledge that this existed.
Edit. Ah, I see, the first season isn't on Netflix, where I would've watched it, and then likely watched the second season on NBC."
Great News,"IMHO, this show was OK, and I watched every episode, hoping for some 30 Rock/Kimmy Schmidt magic but it never lived up the magic of those two shows."
Great News,"It's not that excellent TBH. It tries to be smart like the new comedies, tackling issues of gender and ageism etc but the acting is too fake "
Great News,"If you‚Äôre the type of person that goes ridiculously out of their way to never see any ads or commercials, is it really fair to get mad at a company because you didn‚Äôt see their ads?"
Great News,"Yeah, it was hardly promoted or advertised. I randomly came across it on Hulu one day. "
Great News,I watched it. All the characters were unlikable. Some of the plots were outright stupid. [*There's Johnny*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20xg_mZV1rk) is a better version of what *Great News* was trying to do.
Great News,She was only in like three episodes in season two. She was awesome I wish she didn‚Äôt leave plus she was looking fineeeeeeeee in that corporate skirt. 
Great News,"Yeah, I liked this show, but I also feel like I'm the only person who watched it."
Great News,[deleted]
Great News,And they showed S1 reruns last summer with those SNL summer episodes. 
Great News,"FOX wiped out its entire live action comedy line-up, ABC purged a good amount of dramas and comedies- the only network that seems to be mostly intact is CBS."
Great News,This and 'unbreakable kimmy schmidt'.
Great News,"the headline is a bit misleading, this wasn't really Tina Fey's show.  The showrunner was Tracey Wigfield, who was a former 30 rock writer/director.    
Tina Fey starred in about half of the season 2 episodes, and got the writing credit for one episode lol "
Great News,I usually love tina fey's stuff but I could not get in to this show.
Great News,"I'm really surprised that Trial and Error even got a second season, to be honest."
Great News,"If I can take away the sting slightly, B99 was just revived at NBC!"
Great News,Difficult People was awesome. I guess it was a little too niche for people 
Great News,"I loved her Jewish mother role in Difficult People, and I was always so puzzled at her heavily...Catholic character in Great News. "
Great News,At least she still has a recurring role on the good fight
Great News,Difficult People was awesome. I guess it was a little too niche for people 
Great News,"We don't know the ratings or Netflix, SCD probably gets enough viewers for its budget. "
Great News,One of the writers of 30 rock in fact
Great News,"How sad is it that the Will and Grace reboot is their biggest comedy? I mean, as a child I discovered my gay self through that show, but damn"
Great News,"Right? Brooklyn had 5 wonderful, long seasons. This show had 2 short, beautiful seasons."
Great News,"They should have go wacky earlier, I enjoyed more the last half of S2"
Great News,"I was aware and did watch it. And I didn't like it so I didn't watch it anymore. I love Tina Fey and 30 Rock, but this one? Not so great. "
Great News,"I saw it advertised right before Season 1 started like once. I with in news, so I checked it out. I enjoyed it and will miss it. So wacky humor, and it was fun. "
Great News,Season 1 was on Hulu before Season 2 premiered. 
Deadwind,"The one with Gunnar Gunnarsson and his missing son, Gunnar Gunnarssonsson."
Deadwind,Forbrydelsen (The Killing).
Deadwind,"I liked The Chestnut Man on Netflix.

Fits your description, though I have not seen the movies or shows you referenced.

Also, Europe must not have a minimum fee for a spoken role,  because lots of the extras were talking. Made the film feel much more immerssive."
Deadwind,The bridge is the best for me over a complete Series but season 1 of Forbrydelsen (The Killing) takes some beating as one of the best series of television of all time.
Deadwind,The Bridge. And it‚Äôs not close. One of the best shows I‚Äôve ever seen.
Deadwind,I don't know if it counts but Before We Die.
Deadwind,"My favorite is probably **Bordertown (Sorjonen)**. I really loved that show when it aired. There's also a TV movie which is really good too

In your list, you're missing:

\- The Chestnut Man

\- The Tunnel (This one is excellent)

\- River

\- The Fall

\- Shetland

\- Pagan Peak

For movies, The Department Q movies series (there are 4 movies I think) are all good, especially the first ones)"
Deadwind,[deleted]
Deadwind,Trapped and The Bridge (although I *hated* there was no more Kim Bodnia after a while)
Deadwind,"While it's not Nordic Noir, you should consider watching Dag, Jordbrukerne and Maxitaxi Driver. The atmosphere is similar to what you're describing, although they're more dark comedies than anything. All Norwegian-made if that's worth anything."
Deadwind,"I really liked chestnut man on netflix. And the bridge ( bron), of course."
Deadwind,"The Bridge
Pagan‚Äôs Peak
Wallander(Henning Mankell)
Trapped
Border Town
Dark Woods"
Deadwind,Forbrydelsen and it's not even close.  The Bridge is very shallow and often badly acted IMO.
Deadwind,"The Loft (2008) was recently suggested to me.

Not sure how well that fits with what you're asking for (pretty sure it's not very close), but oh well. Reddit is great for coreecting poeple, and random tangents."
Deadwind,"*Miserabel*  it's just fantastic

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiM0JyTHNnw"
Deadwind,The Missing ! Julien Baptiste is one of my favorite characters. I think that Northern France counts for Nordic Noir.
Deadwind,The crime in the first series of The Bridge was overly convoluted. What skills and timing were needed to commit the crime and the dramatic presentation of the body?
Deadwind,"For danish crime shows, its ‚ÄúRejseholdet‚Äù. 

The killing, bridge all those shows are standing on the shoulders of that show. It‚Äôs not even close."
Deadwind,Trapped.
Deadwind,"I literally just found out about this genre by watching Bordertown which isn‚Äôt getting a lot of mentions so it might be mid, and I‚Äôm enjoying it! Can‚Äôt wait to dive into the rest."
Deadwind,"The whole thing is free on YouTube too!

https://youtu.be/I-OOpZitfd0"
Deadwind,We're not close.
Deadwind,It's hard to recommend people watch season 1 of the bridge when season 4 was just so good.
Deadwind,"The other versions of the Bridge are also quite good. I have seen two, and there are three more."
Deadwind,This is absolutely the right answer. Easily one of the greatest pieces of television ever. It‚Äôs a shame so many people will not consider even watching it cos of subtitles.
Deadwind,"When Kim Bodnia left the show, was disappointed, he had a great laugh (and was fun seeing him in Killing Eve), but I liked his replacement. Thought the show ended on a good note.

More recently, the miniseries, The Investigation, which you can watch on HBO in the US was good."
Deadwind,This one never gets mentioned....I thought it was excellent.
Deadwind,"Loved Shetland too. Not the exact same but pretty much identical feel, same as Pagan Peak. A German version but very similar too."
Deadwind,The lead actor from *Bordertown* is also the villain in the first season of *Jordskott* a kind of folk horror version of a Scandinavian Noir
Deadwind,Have you noticed that Ellie's boss in Season 1 of Pagan Peak is also the killer in Dark Woods?
Deadwind,"not the American one, right?"
Deadwind,"I have that on my wishlist for years. I really should watch it since I love everything horror!

Thanks!"
Deadwind,"I thought Diane Kruger and Demi√°n Bichir were fantastic. Now, I am watching the French-English version. I have the German one, too. Can't find the Malaysian-Singapore one, unfortunately. There is a Russian-Estonia, also."
Deadwind,i enjoyed the American one. felt like a good remake that took the Mexian-American circumstances with nuance and respectability
Deadwind,"Bron/Bridge, by a long shot."
Deadwind,"All others have been mentioned already so I'll just say The Chestnut Man which is the latest I've watched, was very good!"
Deadwind,Bordertown.
Deadwind,"Jordskott, a folk horror take on ScandiNoir.  

Genuinely creepy imagery and no handholding or exposition at all until like the 5th or 6th episode.  If you don't have some basic familiarity with Scandinavian folklore/monsters you might be lost.  Also S1 you might get super annoyed with the lead calling out her daughter's name all the time

2 seasons used to be on Shudder, now gone I'm afraid :(  There's a dvd release though."
Deadwind,Has The Killing been forgotten already? Fantastic show.
Deadwind,"Trapped, The Rain, Borgen, The Sandhamn Murders.  (There are probably more but these come to mind.)"
Deadwind,"I mean this in good faith, but Mare of Easttown absolutely felt like a Scandi/Nordic Noir minus the fact that it took place in Pennsylvania, USA."
Deadwind,[Nordic Noir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-OOpZitfd0)
Deadwind,Wisting
Deadwind,"The Bridge for me, followed by The Killing (although the ending was a bit odd)  I like Trapped S01 too.

If you want a good film that's funny/dark try Riders of Justice."
Deadwind,"Department Q movies, starring Nikolaj Lie Kaas."

Deadwind,"Not Scandinavian but I'll throw down a mention for Zone Blanche (Black Spot).

French murder of the week with an underlying Stephen King style mystery."
Deadwind,Bron. Bordertown. Trapped. I‚Äôll throw in Der Pass/Pagans Peak although it‚Äôs Austria/Germany but similar feel for sure
Deadwind,There‚Äôs a fairly good Swedish comedy series on Netflix called Fallet (The Case) which parodies a lot of Nordic noir (and a couple of other things).
Deadwind,"I enjoyed [Thin Ice](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11721492/) a lot. Quite political and exiting.

Although it's not Scandinavian I can also recommend the Welsh series [Hinterland](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2575968/). It has some great scandi-noir vibes."
Deadwind,Broen. Probably one of the best shows I‚Äôve ever watched. Every time I hear that theme music I get chills.
Deadwind,"Trapped, Case, and The Valhalla Murders"
Deadwind,">I loved Deadwind

FYI, season 3 got released today in Finland so you can expect it to likely hit Netflix at some point in the near future. Seems like S2 got released in Finland in April 2020 and then NF release in July 2020.

And in case you started watching Bordertown after couple people mentioned it, there was a movie recently released so I'd assume it also makes it way to Netflix at some point."
Deadwind,"If you still love Deadwind, seems like S3 got released on Netflix."
Deadwind,man that show is very intense
Deadwind,Borgen is great! But a noir? It's a series about politics with almost no crime/death/etc.
Deadwind,Glad to see Trapped getting mentioned!
Deadwind,"I forgot about Trapped as well. Only saw the first season but loved it, can't wait to watch season 2 when I get the time. So moody and dark."
Deadwind,"I forgot to mention this one, I really enjoyed it, plot, characters and scenery."
Deadwind,Agreed. To bad the book author decided to fuck up the series by not letting the film people do their work.
Deadwind,Loved Der Pass. Season two is coming.
Deadwind,"Just watched the trailer for Pagan's Peak, looks pretty good. Hopefully I'll find somewhere to watch it with English subtitles."
Deadwind,[deleted]
Deadwind,"Well... politics can be ""noir.""  :)"
Deadwind,"I keep hoping for season 3!!  It's really, really good.  And the fantastic scenery just makes it all the better.

Of course... Wallander.  

I left out one of my favorites:  Katla.  That will have you on the edge of your seat and thinking deep thoughts!  :)"
Deadwind,"Still haven't seen the latest one, but I'm honestly no so interested now the cast has changed."
Deadwind,What happened?
Deadwind,It‚Äôs on Topic. The villain personally is one of my favorites.
Deadwind,Correct it is one of the many ‚Äúremakes‚Äù of Bron but really just takes the idea of a body on a border and so a cop from both sides investigate the crime. Amazing show.
Deadwind,"> politics can be ""noir.""  
   
True. A noir is defined by crime, darkness and a bleak mood and these things can obviously appear in a political setting as well. But Borgen does not fit that description unless you reach extremely hard."
Deadwind,Best scandinavian political series is Occupied
Deadwind,"Season 3 (or sequel) of Trapped is definitely happening and it's going to be on Netflix.

I loved Katla but I'm not sure if it counts as a Nordic Noir so that's why I didn't mention it.

Haven't watched Wallander but might check it out!"
Deadwind,"Jussi Adler-Olsen, the author of the book disagreed with the direction and casting, so when the deal of the first 4 books ran out, he basically demanded a new direction, including replacing the entire cast."
Deadwind,"The first season of Occupied was really well done, and very eerie to watch here in the USA when Putin/Trump was president. The premise was too close for comfort."
Deadwind,"Well, Katla is Icelandic so it's ""nordic"" and it's certainly ""noir!""  

Wallander is a classic.  Don't miss it!  (The UK version is just the difference between great porridge with blueberries and walnuts and watery oatmeal.  lol.)

Yay for S3 of Trapped!  I will be looking for it."
Deadwind,"First season was great , unfortunately the level dropped drastically in the following seasons.

For me the best part about it are the characters which start out as the usual cliches, slimy no backbone politician, always do the right thing cop , power small business woman, by the book police chief, find the truth and big story journalist , lone psycho gunman .

But throughout the first season these cliche characters are gradually completely turned around in a really believable way and you don't really know who is the good guy or who to root for.
Makes you really think how you would behave during an occupation and how really not so clean cut  the line is between collaborator and resistance.


Absolutely masterfully done , it's brilliant when you completely accept the completely unrealistic and fictional premise which just serves to present the characters in a unique situation.

Sadly the sophistication massively dropped in the following seasons and it just became one dimensional."
Deadwind,Only Gunnar Gunnarsonson knows
Deadwind,"I love Shetland too.  Are the Nordic noirs in English, subbed or dubbed?"
Deadwind,"Scandi-noir is just great

The bridge, the killing, wallander, and Borgen are some of the best"
Deadwind,Chestnut Man that just came out on Netflix is probably the best thing I've seen for the year
Deadwind,"its the realism. the cops look like real people, and the job like a real job."
Deadwind,"I got addicted by following this blog-

Deadwind,"> I'm watching the Bridge and love it

After you're done with that you'd probably like the Tunnel if you haven't already seen that."
Deadwind,"If you are willing to include Shetland in your list of Nordic Noirs, then you should absolutely watch Mare of Easttown if you haven't."
Deadwind,"You might like Hinterland as well.  I often confuse episode plots on this with Shetland eps, it's very similar."
Deadwind,"It seems like they started churning out them murder mysteries once The Girls with the Dragon Tattoo became a massive hit, both in the region and worldwide."
Deadwind,Mesmerizing music and locales
Deadwind,Hey check out r/Europeancrimedrama
Deadwind,He wasn't the same after he lost his kid :(
Deadwind,tugtemeister too
Deadwind,Subbed.
Deadwind,Isn't Borgen a political drama?
Deadwind,Poor Gunnar Gunnarsonsonson
Deadwind,But I didn't think they were close?
Deadwind,He ran out of Nordic noir on google
Deadwind,Yeah I realized that after I posted. Still one of the best shows to come out of Scandinavia
Deadwind,my printer also switches colours when that happens

Both publications predominantly used inverted pyramid news format, and journalists' opinions were absent from the majority of articles of both.**

This is like that 4chan [spiderposting meme](https://memestatic.fjcdn.com/pictures/Critters+posting+on+4chan+comp_21a56e_6492629.jpg)


Apologies it is 4chan so there's usage of the other f word in there "
Follow This,"The issue isn't that BuzzFeed produces quality content. They absolutely do. The issue is that their good content is hidden behind a Great Wall of such utter terrible tripe. Their main page is mostly clickbait with news articles unceremoniously shoved in between ""Find out which *KC Undercover* character is your crush!"" and ""See what the Jonas brothers look like today!"". They do have a dedicated news page, but it's *very* sensationalized and so liberal it can sometimes make HuffPo look like NY Po. Their top story right now that *isn't* a human interest story is that Trump may or may not have said the n-word at some point in time, making sure to fill up half the article with accusations that Trump is extra mean to women of color. Real journalism right there."
Follow This,"Lol. BuzzFeed sucks balls, and the New York Times is also on a very steep decline. Giving each other awards and praise doesn't change much about that."
Follow This,"This is a joke. BuzzFeed nearly coined the concept of ""clickbait"" and just because a few years later they want to pretend to be serious, it doesn't erase that their foundation and history are based on the most superficial of opeds disguised as journalism."

Follow This,Buzzfeed did not invent clickbait. What a stupid statement 
Follow This,"It doesn't need to erase anything. How ludicrous. 

**Are they or are they not doing good journalism?** That's the only metric that matters when you evaluate a journalist, especially when you're not paying them for their journalism. 

If they need to publish entertainment to bring in revenue to support the journalism, why should that have *any* bearing on the judged quality of the journalism? 

It's like the entire point of my comment was entirely lost on you. "

Follow This,OK
Follow This,"Syndicated daytime TV in the 90's was a meme factory. Not everyone watched it (because they worked or went to school) but everyone could reference it (because the one day they were home sick they saw it). 

This was back when the internet was a dial-up novelty and the only media the entire country had universal access to was prime time sitcoms, late night talk shows and daytime syndication. So shows like Jerry Springer's weren't watched by everyone but everyone was exposed to it at least once.

The Jerry Springer Show was widely considered the trashiest show during the trashiest television hours of the day. People talked about watching it in terms of mental health; either avoiding it to maintain one's self-esteem or tuning in to feel better about one's own poor life choices. To be compared to the guests or audience of the Jerry Springer Show was one of the worst character insults you could throw at someone. Declaring it the cultural shame of the nation was a clich√©.

It was both infamous and widely discussed across a range of society current atomized media couldn't reach, and probably never will."
Follow This,"At the height of the shows popularity they released multiple pay per view /vhs specials dubbed ""too hot for tv"" and a movie loosely based on the show called Ringmaster. There were other daytime talk shows at the time but Springer was the only one with an established enough name to release a movie and pay per view special."
Follow This,"He was big. I mean I was just a wee one in the 90s, but I knew about him and his trashy show just from watching stuff that was appropriate for my age group. There's a reason he's still on TV today (him being so popular, and also those shows being so inexpensive to film)"
Follow This,[deleted]
Follow This,"Springer was pretty huge, big enough that he was in the Austin Powers movie. It certainly was iconic at the time often being referenced in film, TV, and standup comedy. Never was it like GoT, Friends, Seinfeld, ect but it certainly had a presence. "
Follow This,"I was in high-school and then college at the height of Jerry Springer. 

Let me tell a bit about talk-shows before Springer though. There was Donahue and Sally Jesse-Raphael, and of course - Oprah. These were your garden variety talk shows that yes, would have some tense moments on some of their episodes, and Jerry Springer was no different... but the need for ratings escalated the raunchy shows and topics that later became the norm, and worked.

People were tuning in to see the bizarre and the fights. IIRC, the height of it was between 1994 - 1998-ish until the eventual Austin Powers cameo.

People had seen the format for talk shows before, but this one really seemed to buck that trend into something trashier and more engaging for those seeking it out."
Follow This,"it brought ""ratchet"" to the mainstream
daytime t.v.

"
Follow This,"At the time I was at my first year of college (1997-1998).

At my dorm, on my floor, two things would consistently be played when they were on, such that you could leave your room, walk down the hall to the bathroom, and come back while still being able to hear everything said : Jerry Springer and South Park.

It was on one night and my roommate actually recognized one of the guests as someone he knew from his hometown."
Follow This,It used to beat Oprah in the ratings.
Follow This,"very big show in the late 80 to the 90's. I had a friend from work go on the show, and we got to watch the airing on lunch break in 1998."
Follow This,Where I live it people considered you to be lower class trash if you watched shows like that. It had sorta the reputation of soap operas for trailer trash. Though pro wrestling was the same way. I knew of springers existant as a kid but basically everyone shunned it in the suburb I grew up in. Im sure some watched it in private though.
Follow This,It was huge. People outside of the U.S. loved it too. 
Follow This,"Ahh, there was a tme when even Oprah was part of this bizarre landscape of daytime tv. The the Jenny Jones thing happened and it started to go away. 

For those to young, the now pretty normal ambush daytime tv set up was a gay guy came out on national tv to profess his love to a straight guy who he only sort of knew. Unheard of at the time. The straight guy murdered the friend a few weeks after the show, because he was embarrassed. The menatlity of daytime TV shows was like this. lets bring out person A and person B (wife, GF, Friend, neighbor etc) will reveal some horrible thing on national TV. 

Springer was the most honest of the bunch. He knew who he was and he knew what a trash tire fire his show was and he fully embraced it. Other shows tried to act like Dr Phil does now, but you gotta put it all in context of the era. All of it pretty tame by todays Kardashfuckwitsticks types of TV shows.

TV was a fucking zoo during the day. 

"
Follow This,"It was a massive worldwide phenomenon, I can't even think of anything on today to compare it to."
Follow This,Was reality tv before we really had reality tv!
Follow This,">  either avoiding it to maintain one's self-esteem or tuning in to feel better about one's own poor life choices

So basically r/incels or /r9k/ now"
Follow This,"I think it was bigger because it was on basic tv, so everyone had the channel. And there was nothing else on at that time of day, we were stuck with what we could get. "
Follow This,"[holding up globe]

Dr. Evil: *""The world is mine! The world is mine you moth**fuc**ers!""*"
Follow This,"Like Modern Family, they just used the same style but got rid of it actually happening and just treat it like an inside the head of the person"
Follow This,"There is one instance, maybe in the first season wherein  Ron asks the cameraman if they got a grant or something."
Follow This,"I was gonna say The Office and What We Do in the Shadows are the only ones that acknowledge the documentary part instead of just using the format, but I just remembered that Abbot Elementary does too.

Most of the others though, it‚Äôs just a fun format. Modern Family and Parks and Rec ignore the logic of the documentary entirely, and The Muppets have one meta joke where Gonzo complains about how overused the format is but otherwise ignore it."
Follow This,It makes sense by parks and rec the public got the idea it's just a way to frame the story
Follow This,Trailer park boys was really good at this. The camera crew where allways getting in the way or injured from the crews hijinks. Ricky constantly threatens them not to say anything about their crimes and sometimes gets them to hold stuff or participate in the crime he is doing.
Follow This,"I think this might have just been in one of their ""producers cuts"" they'd put on Hulu that were a few minutes longer than the broadcast versions, but there's an episode where Tom has a positive moment with... Wendy(? I think her name was Wendy? His ex wife.) And he turns to the camera and goes ""You got that!"" Then he turns to the other camera and points and goes ""You got that too!"" And I remember thinking it was weird because, as you said, they never mentioned they were in a documentary. And then it never came up again. This was in the third or fourth season."
Follow This,You know originally Modern Family was going to be shot by Claire‚Äôs ex-boyfriend who was an exchange student she knew as a teenager and then the writers realised that might be really distracting.
Follow This,"I think because it was so inconsistently used in the US Office, and there are shots that make no sense for a documentary crew to be getting, so they just decided to use the style for Parks and Rec."
Follow This,"They also don‚Äôt acknowledge the cameras accept when they do their spine takes.  Abbott turns hard into the Jim Halbert camera looks and I actually find it off putting. 

*Edit

I actually take that back. I think April rolls her eyes at the camera occasionally. I don‚Äôt remember the other characters doing it though."
Follow This,I‚Äôll have to look for that one.
Follow This,How does Abbott acknowledge the documentary crew? Is it just looks or do they mention it?
Follow This,I just think the way The Office incorporated the doc crew at times in subtle ways was pretty good. Like the camera crew tipping Pam off about the candy bar Angela gave Dwight.
Follow This,Yeah that sounds familiar.
Follow This,For real?
Follow This,"I kind of like when they just make the meta references how they‚Äôre doing things that you would never want captured by a camera crew. Like when Dwight meets with his hitman played by Chris Gethard: ‚ÄúWell we‚Äôve been followed by a documentary crew for 8 years, but I don‚Äôt see them around.‚Äù"
Follow This,"also the doc styling was something intentional with the office, its sort of core to the pitch in ways it kinda isnt for the shows that followed its lead. stephen merchant was on conans podcast semi recently and he talked about how the thing they wanted to do was as if this was just some lost VHS tape lying on a shelf somewhere at the BBC, its central to what defines the shows rather dry tone and bland visual styling."
Follow This,"Ron also looks at the camera when he wants to make a point about his privacy or libertarianism. Actually, now that I think about it, Ron even agreeing to be in the documentary is totally out of character."
Follow This,"There an episode where they accidentally let another film crew in to film a commercial about how terrible a school they are, because they assumed it was the same documentary crew. And once when Ava sexually harasses Gregory he says something like ‚Äúyou are recording all of this, right?‚Äù"
Follow This,The first episode also mentions Ava specifically signed them up to be filmed as well.
Follow This,"Yeah. I read this article at the time. And frankly the writers were right because it distracted me while watching even just being an idea.

https://www.nj.com/entertainment/tv/2010/01/modern_family_co-creator_steve.html"
Follow This,">Ron even agreeing to be in the documentary is totally out of character. 

Not anymore than being in charge of a government office.  Maybe his character wants to be a part of showing how useless and inept the government is."
Follow This,Ah thanks. That is a good example of the kind of thing I‚Äôm talking about. I think the occasional reference to it adds to the humor and the aesthetic.
Follow This,Forgot about that. That‚Äôs very her
Follow This,Yeah that was definitely the right decision.
Follow This,Oh that‚Äôs the other thing: his brothers don‚Äôt even know he works for the government and he‚Äôs putting that fact on blast.
Follow This,"Yellowstone is the most watched scripted show on TV right now. It's not particularly great at anything, but its good at being entertaining in a b-movie kinda way so it gets a ton of eyeballs, without much deeper discussions."
Follow This,"*Yellowstone* is one of the dumbest shows on television.  I like it a lot but it's really dumb.  And every season is basically just a repeat of the last, with a richer and more powerful businessperson trying to take the Dutton's land.

*1883* however was absolutely amazing in just about every regard.  It's like an ode to the classic Western.  Isabel May was a revelation and I was incredibly impressed with Tim McGraw."
Follow This,"I was really, really impressed watching 1883. Loved it. I think it stands completely on its own too. 

1923 has been harder to get into, but has also had some really great parts. The issue for me has been there's been too many threads. I think part of what kept 1883 so good was it concentrated on one story. I think 1923 would be better if it was two full series, each concentrating on their individual stories. Split by location, I find my self not wanting to see the other story. Then it switches, and I don't want it to go back.

EDIT: There's *so much* tension in these series though, they're not easy to watch. I have to leave ""Yellowstone"" until I forget how tense it can be, then watch some, then leave it."
Follow This,"They have that Discovery channel demo locked in. There's plenty of exposure for those shows and they get air time on multiple channels as well as streaming. People who aren't in that demo aren't likely to be into them. Not sure who you think you're trying to lure with that shilling but it's kind of on the nose, which is fitting for Sheridan I guess."
Follow This,"people were talking about yellowstone more during season 1/2 when it was still new. then the writing nosedived noticeably (from a starting level of ""passable"" and now it's just a show that you still kind of like because of the premise/cinematography and the memory of the previous seasons but it's obvious they don't really know what they're doing and it's just disappointing. kind of like ""for all mankind"""
Follow This,"I haven't watch these yet, but anything talked about besides netflix hbo amazon is always welcome to me."
Follow This,I'd sooner get kicked in the head by a mule than watch one more contrived shitty Yellowstone episode.
Follow This,Yellowstone I feel is on it's way out. This season hasn't been that good and there's too much filler in it that's boring. (country music an cowboys with nothing happening)  if I wanted to watch country music videos I'd just hop on YouTube.
Follow This,Do I have to pay for paramount app to watch?  Bc I have a limit of 3 streaming apps currently Netflix HBO and prime
Follow This,"‚ÄúThe English‚Äù (Amazon Prime/BBC) is better than Yellowstone, 1993 and 1883 combined. It will blow you away."
Follow This,Feels like I poked a beenest on this sub lol
Follow This,"I on the other hand love the 2-3 threads, and with the newest epi they start to make more and more sense in the combined story:)"
Follow This,Have you given 1923 a shot?
Follow This,technically no
Follow This,Yep. Blew me right out the door and away from my TV...
Follow This,"From what I‚Äôve read this sub thinks Yellowstone watchers are only uneducated conservative boomers. As educated liberal millennials, my gf and I both enjoy it. It‚Äôs insane and sometimes makes no sense but I‚Äôd be lying if I said it wasn‚Äôt entertaining and enjoyable. I just started season 4 and it‚Äôs gone off the rails and so much fun"
Follow This,"Not yet, I did enjoy 1883, plan on checking 1923 out eventually."
Follow This,Doesn‚Äôt the governor like ‚Ä¶ punch people ?
Follow This,Try ‚ÄúThe English‚Äù. An amazing western with Emily Blunt. I‚Äôve never experienced anything like it.
Follow This,I feel like 1923 is even better
Follow This,I feel it's worse. Just not holding my interest.
Follow This,It's shocking how little this has been advertised
Follow This,"Really fun comedy, felt like an Aussie version of Wrecked. Emily Browning is one of my favourite actors so it's great to see her nail this role."
Stay Here,It originated from real life when people used to help each other out and actually let strangers stay for a night
Stay Here,Before the middle ages and before people started writing things down.  You can find elements of it in the Reeve's Tale by Chaucer and The Decameron by Boccaccio.  Both of which were early authors of the 1300s.  Odds are the idea goes back even further.
Stay Here,It's a very old joke... I'm not sure there is any example of it's origin. I was first told it when I was a kid a very long time ago... like 40 years ago.
Stay Here,"I don't think it's a trope that is referencing one incident of its usage in particular when it is used, but it is instead lampooning and referencing how our culture still has the after echoes of how it used to be of the utmost importance for daughters to maintain their virginity so they can be pure for their husbands in order to secure financial well being for the family."

Stay Here,"Question for Cameron, Ruby, and Ali: what was your favorite line of dialogue to deliver in season 1?"
Stay Here,Were you allowed to write on or make additions to the thinking cloth?
Stay Here,"Question for Joe, I don't suppose there's any chance we ever get a proper release of the complete The Adam and Joe Show on Blu-ray is there?"
Stay Here,To all: is there any footage of the milk gate? It‚Äôs been described as the funniest moment on set and fans (me) are curious to see
Stay Here,"Hi!! Thank you so much for taking time to talk and share with us!! What an incredible adaptation you've gifted us.

For Joe: What was the most difficult and/or rewarding part of the development/pre-pro process for this series?

For Ruby: I saw that you‚Äôve done trapeze! (I‚Äôm an aerialist too, with a preference for trapeze/lyra). Have you trained in any other apparatuses? Non-spoiler thoughts on *That* scene in The Empty Grave?

For Ali: Your George has earned such a special place in my heart, thank you for taking such great care of him! What are some of your favorite qualities of George? Any you can relate to?

For Cameron: It's like you walked off straight from the pages as Anthony Lockwood, and we're so grateful. What is your process like for getting into character?

General: Cast birthdays? (For astrological sign reasons üëÄ)"
Stay Here,"To the cast & Joe: I've rewatched the show more than 5 times already, if you don't get the greenlight from Netflix for a second season what's the possibility of you switching streaming services? Just asking on behalf of the fandom, we're desperate for more from our absolute favourite cast ever <3"
Stay Here,"Question for Cameron: Having just come out of drama school what were you expecting when it came to getting actual roles? Were you confident in your ability to get a role in this industry or were you like so many other actors unsure of your success?  

Note : You're incredibly talented thank you for gracing our screen with your presence we will forever be in your debt"
Stay Here,"Brilliant adaptation of an excellent series of books. My Q is directed at Cameron, Ruby and Ali:

Q - what do you imagine Lockwood, Lucy and George would do for a living/hobbies when they hit 20 ish and their ability to see ghosts starts to fade?"
Stay Here,For Cameron: the books often mention Lockwood's iconic coat being too long and getting in the way. Did you ever have any problems like that on set?
Stay Here,"As someone who is very conscious of sharp metal objects in close proximity, I get mini heart attacks whenever I see Lockwood or Lucy draw swords within inches of someone standing nearby, or when one of your rapiers stick out behind looking ready to trip someone. 

I'm curious, did anyone ever got hurt on set by the rapiers? Or accidentally poked by your fellow mates?"
Stay Here,"Hey Joe! Was it written in the script to change Lockwood‚Äôs usual pink socks to blue during the party scene to match with Lucy, or was that just an unhinged (in an amazing way) decision by the costume designers?

Show is amazing!!"
Stay Here,"If the problem finally went away or gifts faded and Lockwood and Co couldn‚Äôt be agents, what do you think each character would do for a job?"
Stay Here,"My question is for whoever wants to answer it, maybe Cameron! I just wanted to know if Lockwood's dark eyebags were all natural or done with makeup? ;)"
Stay Here,"for Ruby! - 

your northern accent slayed, were you confident going in or did you have a voice coach?"
Stay Here,"Have you guys read the books and if so what was your favorite? If we get another season are there any particular scenes you are looking forward to filming? Thanks so much for the great adaption, me and my brother loved it."
Stay Here,Why hasn't Netflix been promoting the show at all? It is truly a hidden gem and deserves more promotion and recognition.
Stay Here,"This is a wonderful opportunity! Can't thank you enough for it!!

For Joe; How is the process of getting books adapted into a show? I really want to get into the field as a screenwriter/director hopefully, so I was wondering if you also had any advice for someone who has no idea what they're doing üòÇ

For Ali; I'm so so excited about your character!! I'm Persian myself, so the second I saw your name I was like...can it be? And then you mention ghormeh sabzi and nan khameii and I instantly felt at home. I absolutely love the changes to your character because I've always wanted to see my own culture in a character. And my question is; will there be more cultural exploration for George? Maybe even a nod to kolah Ghermezi (I hope you do know what I'm talking about üòÇ) 

For Cameron; What's something you love about playing your character? And what's the most challenging part about it? Absolutely love your performance btw!

For Ruby; What are some aspects of your character that you're excited to explore and try to act out? Lucy is such a complex character so mad respect for nailing her character!!"
Stay Here,Question for Ali: are we going to be seeing more Franklin in future seasons?
Stay Here,"Question for Cameron. 
Do you see any similarities with you and Lockwood?"
Stay Here,"Hi!! Thank you for the amazing work that you've done in bringing some of my favorite characters and stories to life. Question for Joe: Is there a scene from the books that you really wish you'd have kept in the series, but weren't able to? For Cameron, Ruby, and Ali: What was the most difficult scene(s) to shoot?"
Stay Here,"This is amazing!

Question for Cameron, Ruby & Ali: which scene you cherish the most shooting?"
Stay Here,"to all three of you, how have your friends reacted to your breakthroughs as these iconic characters in a Netflix show that is sure to go down as iconic?"
Stay Here,Question for everyone: what do you think is the musical taste of each of the main three?  And how do you think the Problem affected the musical industry?
Stay Here,"Not show related, but for Ali: being that you're a lit student, do you have a favorite book and/or author?!?!"
Stay Here,"for ruby, cameron and ali: any behind the scenes stories/pranks played/moments?"
Stay Here,"Which of the trio would win an intense game of Monopoly- Lucy, Lockwood or George? üòÇüëÄ"
Stay Here,for joe! what's a scene from one of the other 3 books do you look forward  to adapting
Stay Here,[deleted]
Stay Here,"Hey Joe!

Love this show, 2 questions if you don't mind:

&#x200B;

1. What is your creative process when it comes to building characters and a story? Lockwood and Co was so brilliantly well done and I'd love to learn about your process. Hopefully, the script get's released one day as well :) 
2. How did this show come to be? Were you approached by the author or were you a fan of the books?  It's so rare to find a book-to-show adaptation that was done so well. Would love to hear the story.

&#x200B;

Looking forward to Season 2!"
Stay Here,"for everyone - There was a lot of iconic london filming locations this season, what other ones would you want to film at in another season?"
Stay Here,"Hello! This show definitely has a special place in my heart!

My first question is, what can we do on our part to help and ensure the show gets renewed for a second season (besides (re) watching) ?

Second of all, is there some kind of significance to Lockwood's pink socks? What made you make that decision?"
Stay Here,"Not a question, just a comment, Cam, Ruby and Ali's voices are so soothing. They could honestly record an audiobook and I would buy it.  Lovely trio!"
Stay Here,"Lockwood and Lucy's relationship is more obvious to the viewer than it is to the reader since the book is from Lucy's point of view, so now we get to see Lockwood's side as well.

My question is, when do you think was the moment Lockwood started to have feelings for Lucy?"
Stay Here,"To Ruby, Cameron and Ali: 

You guys have mentioned you've seen a few fan-made edits on the show with songs the fandom associates with the characters playing in the background, what songs/music/genres/artists would YOU guys associate with your characters (after all, you know them better than we could ever!)"
Stay Here,To Cameron: How does it feel to be a heartthrob??
Stay Here,"If the characters at Portland Row were to get a house pet, what kind of pet would it be?"
Stay Here,"To Cameron, Ali and Ruby: Assuming all three of you have read all the books, how do you feel about the character of Holly and are you (if at all) anticipating the introduction of this new member of your little family?"
Stay Here,"I just finished watching the show yesterday.  I absolutely loved it.  I think my favorite thing about the show was that the young adults acted like mature young adults rather than immature/soap opera-esque teenagers.  The three lead actors were incredible, and I never felt like I was watching a ‚Äúshow for kids‚Äù.  


As the show creator can you talk about creating this more mature/serious tone? 


For the actors (you guys were amazing-truly blown away), can you talk about your approach to the characters and finding the balance between portraying teenagers but keeping with the more mature tone?  

(Bonus question was it fun using/carrying the swords?  Did you do any training?)"
Stay Here,"hello, my name is mel, i'm 19, i was a HUGE fan of the book series when i was younger and the netflix show means a great deal to me. thanks so much for taking the time to do this!!

joe: are there any scenes you wish you could've put in the show, but were unable to for any reason? and were there any scenes that you instantly knew you couldn't wait to film?

cameron: as this is your first role, how was your first experience as an actor in a big netflix show like this? and do you have any advice for someone like me who'd like to go into the film industry?

ruby: do you have any of your own little 'headcanons' about lucy - like, any little extra traits that you've given her along the course of you playing her?

ali: how easy was it for you to connect to george as a character, and do you see any similarities and differences between you and him? p.s. i am autistic and i see a lot of myself in george, so thank you so much for bringing this wonderful portrayal of him to the screen!!

all of the characters are so perfect and i genuinely think this is my favourite book to screen adaptation i've ever seen. it stays true to the books, and still manages to put its own special little twist on it, and i really couldn't imagine a better adaptation! thank you so much ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Stay Here,Kinda curious what prop/costume/set piece etc from the show are you all most attached to? And may perhaps take home? Lol
Stay Here,When will season 2 be announced? We're on the edge of our seats! Just give us a hint or something
Stay Here,"for cameron and ruby: did you expect there to be a separate fanbase for ‚Äòlocklyle‚Äô shippers while you were filming, or has it caught you by surprise?"
Stay Here,"Question for Cameron, Ruby & Ali: Which scene was the most emotional to film?"
Stay Here,"Hello everyone! Thank you for taking your time to answer some of our burning questions! The show was absolutely amazing. It gave me chills, smiles, and tears, and it certainly was true to the books! Every detail was immeasurably impressive and the writing and acting was marvelous! Really hoping for a season two! It‚Äôd make my year!

Now, for questions!

* There were some tough and emotional scenes throughout the series. In what ways did you prepare and what was your thought process when it came to these scenes? ( Did you consider the character‚Äôs past? Did you think of something sad? Etc.) In this instance for Joe, what made you decide to write these scenes?
* What moment from the books do you wish would have made it on screen?
* Which of the characters do you relate to the most?
* Which episode did you enjoy filming / writing the most and why? Your least favorite episode writing / filming?
* If the trio weren‚Äôt having to deal with cyclical missions and ghosts and were to live a normal life, what would do you think they‚Äôd be doing?"
Stay Here,"For Ruby, Cameron and Ali are there certain techniques of acting you used to prepare yourself? And is it different reading the books when preparing to a role, do you pay attention to certain details?

And thank you so so much for portraying this characters so perfectly! Must have been hard work also which is much appreciated."
Stay Here,Question for everyone: how does it feel bring the leads in such a great show?
Stay Here,"Loved the show. 
How is it filming with different directors? The show felt consistent, but with different people at the helm it would be easy to see how things could get complicated. Unlike with a movie where usually there's one director leading."
Stay Here,"I loved the show, and genuinely believe it‚Äôs one of the best book to screen adaptations out there. The character-focused storytelling is brilliantly written and acted wonderfully. Here‚Äôs my questions: 

For Joe Cornish: When writing this script, since it‚Äôs based on books, were there any challenges in adapting the source material, and any really fun aspects? 
 
For the cast: How did you prepare to take on these roles? Is there anything you do to help get into character?"
Stay Here,"thank you for bringing the series to life in such a beautiful way! this is a question for everyone: if *you* (the actors and joe) were in Stroud's London, do you think you'd be agents? relic men? or something else?"
Stay Here,for ruby and cameron: how would you describe locklyle?
Stay Here,for everyone: what career or path do you think your characters would follow in a world without The Problem?
Stay Here,"Question for Ruby: What was it like stepping into this relatively unheard of and new franchise, having no idea as to where it would head (its popularity etc) from something as big as Bridgerton, and what about the Lockwood and Co world appealed to you?"
Stay Here,For Ruby: What do you think of Lucy's shades of blue wardrobe color? Do you think it matches her character?
Stay Here,question for ruby: whats a trait about lucy that you can relate to?
Stay Here,"Hi Joe! Huge fan of your work, love love love the Kid Who Would Be King and am really enjoying Lockwood & Co. 

I love how your work always balances a fantastical element with a grounded universe, while still doing a fair bit of world building. I'm wondering how you approach that kind of world building and how you find that balance?

An optional second question! I deeply admire your ability to write stories about kids that don't talk down to them, and are appealing to adults as well. I'd love to know what drives you to write such engaging stories about kids - is that a conscious choice? And how do you approach creating engaging kid characters?

......and will we ever see another Tintin movie?!?!!?"
Stay Here,"Love this, love the show! It was wonderful to see Lucy, Lockwood and George come to life in this amazing book adaptation. I would really love a season 2!  
Question for Ruby, Cameron and Ali: What personality trait of your character did you struggle with the most during rehearsal/filming?"
Stay Here,"Do Joe: Did you have a say in the soundtrack of the show because the songs picked were perfect for the show, a big thank you to whoever selected the soundtrack!"
Stay Here,"Joe! I've been such an admirer of your work and am a young producer who also loves this genre and space! Thank you for this incredible adaptation and for the thoughtfulness and love that so clearly went into every detail of this show!

You're often known for discovering and working with young talent and I was wondering if you could talk more about how you foster and support them on set/throughout production. What are some things thoughtful producers and creators should think about that help create an environment for young or newer talent to grow and offer their best work?

And secondly I really appreciated how much you involved Jonathan in an adaptation like this, down to what I read somewhere was having him and Ali consult on George's new last name or even some of the details on set or the Thinking Cloth. I find it unfortunately rare that creators are so collaborative with authors of IP being adapted and wondered how you figured out how to strike the right balance?"
Stay Here,"Hello everyone! Being especially fond of the swordfights, I want to ask to Ruby, Cameron and Ali: did you enjoy learning to use your rapiers? Was it physically demanding?

Thank you everyone for your time!"
Stay Here,"question for ali,ruby and cameron:what was the moment when you laugh the most while you were filming the scene?"
Stay Here,"Hello, by any chance, do you take interns?"
Stay Here,Do you guys have nicknames for each other?
Stay Here,"hii! what would be on lockwood, lucy and george's shared playlist for their ghosthunting trips?"
Stay Here,"for the cast - what's one actor that you didn't share many scenes with in the show, but that you wish your character would've interacted with more?"
Stay Here,what were first and last shootings?
Stay Here,"were there any scenes that got cut out of final versions of episodes? if yes, could you tell more?"
Stay Here,question for all of you: which book is your favourite out of L&Co series? (if spoilers are not allowed just say which one out of 5)
Stay Here,"I just want to show my appreciation for such a wonderful adaptation of one of my favourite book series! I binged all the episodes in a day which shows how much I enjoyed it.

Okay, maybe a quick question for our rising young stars. How do you see yourselves in 5 years time and if there's anything you wish to challenge yourself in other than acting (for example directing, writing, producing etc... Maybe Joe could be your mentor? Haha)? And also if there's any other or specific film genres you wish to play a role in the future?"
Stay Here,"Question for Ali, Ruby, and Cameron: in the case that Netflix does approve for more seasons, what book are you looking forward to adapting?"
Stay Here,"on some of bts photos there were dogs on sets, what are their names and how did they end up stealing all the spotlight on those pics?"
Stay Here,what was your favourite location to film?
Stay Here,"The netflix adaption of Lockwood & Co was so visually stunning and still did the book series justice! 

What scene was most fun to film? Because of the scene itself, or on-set antics?"
Stay Here,"For Ali, Ruby, and Cameron: what talent would you prefer to have? Touch, Sight or Listening?"
Stay Here,"Thank you to everyone involved in this project! It is a pitch perfect adaptation of one of my favorite series of books. Love the cast, the settings, and the whole vibe of the show! Hoping for more seasons as I would love to see Aickmere‚Äôs Department Store and the Fittes‚Äô headquarters scenes on screen. 

Question for the cast: what was the most challenging scene to film?"
Stay Here,choose my lockwood and co themed tattoo PLEASE
Stay Here,"For Cameron, Ruby, and Ali: What is your favorite song from the soundtrack? 

I love the show so much! I had never read the books, but after one watch, I was inspired to read the books! That's how great the show was! Perfect adaptation! After reading the books, i can appreciate the work that everyone put into the show that much more to bring Jonathon Stroud's masterpiece to life. Best show I've seen in years! And the acting was on point! I'm super impressed with Lockwood's character! He was literally copied and pasted from the books to TV lol. Lucy is a badass and George is hilarious and so lovable. Y'all are awesome! :)"
Stay Here,"To all four of you - 

The show's had a chokehold on me ever since I watched it (as soon as it came out) and I haven't been able to eat/sleep/watch anything else because it's always on my mind! I'm not even exaggerating 

So first of all, thank you so so so so so much for this opportunity, my brain is finally at peace.

As for the question, how does it feel to be a part of something as big as this? You guys have put in your absolute 100% and trust me it shows! Not only have you catalysed the spreading of this fandom, but every single person who has watched the show has only had positive stuff to say about it!"
Stay Here,Why does Lockwood wear pink socks? And are they the same ones or does he have multiple pairs lol?
Stay Here,Is Lockwood jealous of Lucy initially that she can speak to type threes?
Stay Here,"What was it like filming the scene when Lucy is ""possessed"" by Annabelle?"
Stay Here,"Greetings from Ukraine! Thanks for the opportunity to ask you a question! After watching the adaptation, I really wanted to read the books, so I have a lot of respect for the painstaking work on the series.  
Before I ask the question, I just want to express my endless love to the actors who played their roles incredibly. This is the best adaptation from netflix in the last year, if not two : ºD  
Questions for Ruby: did you prepare in any way for the role, I mean maybe read books to soak up the atmosphere, or maybe listen to some playlists like Ali. Maybe you were looking for something on tiktok or aesthetics on pinterest? and did you enjoy the fencing lessons before filming?  
Questions for Ali: (George is my favorite character and the way you played him is just amazing). Do you like George as a character? Do you have any similarities? maybe you found some minuses or pluses in your character?  
Questions for Cameron: When I found out that this was your debut role, it was a pleasant surprise for me, because you completely got into the character of Lockwood and his charisma. Did you read the books or maybe some excerpts? Plus you are very good at using a rapier. If you had the chance, would fencing become your hobby? Is it possible that fencing is already one of the hobbies?  
And a question for all three of you: if you had the opportunity to take a vacation as characters from the show, where would you go/fly and what would you do there?"
Stay Here,"THANK YOU FOR THIS CHANCE! The show is incredible! I love it! Everyday I‚Äôm watching it twice! 
Q to Joe: Did you saved all sets, costumes and stuff for maybe a second season or has everything been dismantled?"
Stay Here,"For Joe: Any deleted scenes that had to be cut due to time that could be shared?

And also, could you by chance go into detail on how the red room scene was done with the blood dripping from the walls? What had to be done to get that specific effect? 

For Cameron: What's a specific character dynamic between Lockwood and any other character that you wish we got to see more of? 

For Ruby: What was your favorite part about playing Lucy? She's such a developed character with a pretty big depth of emotions as we saw. Was it difficult to get that range of emotions without it seeming forced at all?"
Stay Here,"Thank you for doing this! I have a lot of questions but I'll try to keep it to a minimum

For Joe:  Why did you decide to have Norrie get ghostlocked instead of ghosttouched?

For Ali, Ruby, and Cameron: What do you think your character's favorite movie is?

For Ruby: What was the transition like going from something like ""Bridgerton"" to a show like ""Lockwood & Co?""

For Ali, Ruby, and Cameron: In what way do you think you are similar from and different from your characters?

For Joe: Who was your favorite character outside of the main trio to write and why?

For all of you: Do you like to watch fan edits or read fanfiction? If so, what's been your favorite edit or fanfic?

For Ali: What do you think George's favorite dish to cook is?

For Joe: What made you want to adapt these books specifically into a TV show?"
Stay Here,"For anyone: Which scene was the most difficult and/or took the longest to film? 

Bonus random question: what‚Äôs your favorite ghost movie?"
Stay Here,"Question for everyone: what‚Äôs something that you could see the characters doing together that we don‚Äôt see in the books or on screen? Ex: dance parties to relieve stress, everyone piling into the library for a book club, etc"
Stay Here,"To Ruby and Cameron,

Q: How would you guys describe Lucy and Lockwood's relationship?"
Stay Here,"How do I audition for your show? They say to be bold and ask, so I'm trying!"
Stay Here,For Cameron and Ali: Can you guys confirm your birthdays? The internet is going crazy trying to find them out haha
Stay Here,"Hey Joe and the others!!!!
Season 1 was amazing. Can't wait for more.
So do you guys have an idea about how many seasons you want to do to wrap up the story? 
Also, episode 7 was amazing!!! Bit shoutout to the cast and crew. Loved the show."
Stay Here,Favorite book in the series?
Stay Here,"Thank you guys for making the PERFECT adaptation of my favourite books. I can‚Äôt believe how lucky we are to have received such an incredible adaptation ü•∞‚ù§Ô∏è

I‚Äôd like to ask Cameron, Ruby and Ali- what is your favourite book in the series?
And is there a particular moment across the five books that stood out to you? 

Thank you guys for doing such an incredible job!! You honestly feel like the characters jumped from the books! ü•π‚ù§Ô∏è"
Stay Here,What did you all do to get yourself into your character?
Magic for Humans,[Oh look its the same actor from the invisible man trick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kcXergLG1Q&feature=youtu.be)
Magic for Humans,"Hey there, Justin Willman here. Appreciate you watching the show. I figured I might chime in real quick just to set any misconceptions straight. There are no ""actors"" in the show paid to act a certain way or say a certain thing. No stooges, just random people in LA (and often weird/awkward ones at that). No one is told to fake anything or act amazed if they're not. I've been honing my craft as a magician for 25 years (and it sounds like you might be a magician as well) and I take the presentation of the art very seriously. Everything you see on the show was beta tested for months live on stage in LA for real audiences before filming. Worked hard to make a great show that would do magic proud. :) Hope that helps you enjoy the show. Any questions let me know. "
Magic for Humans,"There's no part of Magic that isn't fake, fabricated or some kind of trick. This show is a lot more than magic tricks though. I love the presentation and how each episode is themed. It's also pretty funny to me. 

It's strange in this world with the difference of acceptable real. A magician on the streets can be called fake because his effects aren't what they seem, but I was first in line to see a CGI fest that was Infinity War. 

I don't think he's using actors except for things like the invisible man where they probably put out some casting call to get a crowd.

I dunno I like it and not everything is for everyone. To each their own."
Magic for Humans,Yeah I really didn't like how clearly fake some of it was.  I kept watching for the humor though.
Magic for Humans,"I felt much the same way as you. There were some bits that were downright entertaining and I didn't care that it was clearly staged and using edits/cuts/camera tricks (mostly the stuff with kids because it was endearing), but some stuff was pretty hard to swallow when it's clearly not something that could be pulled off in front of a live audience with no cuts (the backpack full of coffee makers, etc).

Magic for Susan's was great. Overall I enjoyed the show and thought it was nice and refreshing PG content that anyone can enjoy, but it strayed a little too far from magic, imo, and into the realm of just staged TV illusions."
Magic for Humans,"I have a similar issue with the show as well. Not because I don't enjoy it, it is entertaining, but most of the people don't have genuine reactions to most acts. It does feel like most people are actors which is a huge issue. 

If you want real genuine reactions please go to youtube and search for magic acts in the street or public pranks, stuff like that feels real. The reactions just don't feel real at all, except maybe the kids but otherwise it feels very staged.

Sorry is just the way it comes across and it seems a lot of people feel that way too.

Like the invisible act is cool in concept but the reactions showed in this show made it seem they were actors, or at least that's how I felt watching it. 

Hopefully it relies less on editing and camera work and more on genuine reactions if it gets picked up for a 2nd season. "
Magic for Humans,"It feels as though you‚Äôre drawing seemingly arbitrary lines as to where you‚Äôll suspend your disbelief, which is your prerogative. At the end of the day it‚Äôs a show about magic; to enjoy magic at all you have to give into the fact that it‚Äôs not real (or is it???!) and just let it fool you. It‚Äôs a goofy show with some charm to spare and clever tricks that are pretty dang neat regardless of how ‚Äúreal‚Äù they are. That invisible man trick for instance was a wonderful concept to see even if it was all fake. I say all that to say, I sincerely hope someone will make a magic show that‚Äôs more to your taste ‚Äòcause I‚Äôd watch it and probably love it, too."
Magic for Humans,Yeah I kinda got the same vibe.
Magic for Humans,"Same here, so many obvious plants. And when he pulls that woman out of the backpack, you can tell there is greenscreen or something involved. "
Magic for Humans,"I was disappointed it wasn't a sitcom about an alien who becomes a stage magician in order to blend in to human society.  In that instant between reading the title and description I had already pictured 3rd Rock, but with magic instead of academia."
Magic for Humans,The trick with his wife in the bag is clearly CGI (and bad CGI at that). I could get behind every other trick except that one.
Magic for Humans,"In the first episode, at the middle school, the girl in the front, seems oddly familiar. Isn't that actor gracelyn awad rinke?

I recognized her from Resident Alien show."
Magic for Humans,‚ÄùDaddy issues‚Äù episode in Netflix 8:30 timestamp punks curse a lot and empty glass jar turns full of paper money. Watch his shoulder line when jar gets filled. It is so badly edited (cut) I almost cried. Whole guy goes a few inches up.
Magic for Humans,[Oh look its the same actor from the invisible man trick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kcXergLG1Q&feature=youtu.be)
Magic for Humans,"I think a lot of the criticism came from the ""Guy Thinks He's Invisible"" video that went viral recently. The concept is great, and it's really clever. I've actually seen a few videos of parents or family members doing it to kids, and the results are hilarious and very well done, because the kids are gullible and think they're actually invisible and show truly real reactions, even to the point of some of them crying. The main complaints with your version were that the people that ""turned invisible"" had very questionable reactions and seemed not truly genuine... specifically [at this point in the video.](https://youtu.be/fu3TFib-JK4?t=195) I'm not saying it's not possible to convince two seemingly intelligent adults in Los Angeles that they are invisible, but their actions and how they reacted didn't seem realistic to me and to a lot of other people. Whether or not they're paid actors or volunteers who chose to milk it for the camera, they just seemed to act like they were in on it the whole time."
Magic for Humans,"Just want to chime in. 

One humble dudes opinion... you have the presence and charisma. I loved the show. It truly had me in stitches. The UCLA guys and Magic for Susan was awesome. 

That said how the hell did you get that phone in the bottle?! Lol I know a magician doesn‚Äôt reveal his secrets and clearly you are a master of your craft. But man it‚Äôs so hard to figure how you did some of that without actors, cuts or tv tricks. 

Either way it was fun as hell watching and I burned through it in a night. Congrats on the Netflix show and hope to see more! "
Magic for Humans,"Wow! Thanks for the response! I didn't mean to insult your show and I'm aware of your act, I didn't mean to insult that either. You are a good magician.

That being said, I still have doubts about the show. I offer a challenge. Make a YouTube video of either the marshmallow trick from the view of the child or the balloon trick from a side view and have whichever trick be exactly as it is in the show.

Stipulations:

- No cuts, edits, or zooms whatsoever. Raw stationary video. Zooming to focus, or adjusting the focus is fine, but not during the trick. The main reason I don't want more than that is because I want to see what the candid viewer saw.

- The camera must stay stationary. No handheld or guerrilla-style filming and you must be visible the entire time. No part of executing the trick should take place off camera (I understand some tricks have set up, that's not what I'm talking about, I mean specifically the execution).

- if you choose the balloon trick, the person can in no way know you or anyone associated with you, beyond a casual introduction, before the trick starts (if it is a candid trick, they'll be on camera the whole time from your first meeting anyway). Beyond that, the person's *face* must stay reasonably visible to the camera throughout and you must both be on camera the whole time.

- The trick must progress and end the exact same way, and either trick must have a candid viewer who is unknown to you or anyone connected with you.

I don't want to know any of your secrets. Your methods are your own. My joy comes from trying to figure out the trick, as I said in another comment. I just want to see the trick as it is in real life as best I can.

Now I don't risk anything by you doing this, so I'll put my money where my mouth is. If you are able to accomplish this and it is entirely legitimate, I will publicly concede on this sub, say I was wrong, tell people to watch the show, and donate $100 to whichever charity you would like.

All you have to do is post the video on YouTube, toss me a link, and the link of the charity. Challenge accepted?"
Magic for Humans,Your show is great and we were disappointed there weren't more episodes! You have great charisma and humor.
Magic for Humans,Great show Justin. My favourite bit was your reaction to the guy who gave you his PIN number and told you what bank he was with. 
Magic for Humans,You seriously want us to believe you made that first person invisible and all the other people in there didn't realize it? Would have been fine if it's just the victim but making the first person invisible via camera tricks is exactly the kind of example OP was talking about.
Magic for Humans,"The reason you think it works so often on stage is because people KNOW its fake. They play along because they want to be part of the act. They want to be 'in' on this secret with the magician. They don't want to ruin the show for the others. I am honestly amazed that you think people actually fall for it 70% of the time.

And there is no way that there weren't any actors in that invisible man bit. When Jonathan has his cover pulled off and starts hyperventilating, that is some cringy over-acting. And of course the black guy is shown stealing the wine bottle. Yeah, I'm sure that wasn't scripted to try and get laughs...

I'll believe that YOU didn't know they were stooges or actors, but your producers definitely did. Be honest, even you had to have been surprised at how well some of the tricks worked on the marks. Now you know why."
Magic for Humans,[deleted]
Magic for Humans,"Love your show, biggest disappointment is that there are only 6 eps on Netflix!! "
Magic for Humans,You‚Äôre amazing 
Magic for Humans,"Just an FYI, I loved the show! I tried not to think much during each episode and had a lot of fun the the way everything was presented.

Do you know if you've been greenlit for a second season? Looking forward to seeing more of you!"
Magic for Humans,"Hey that's cool you came here and said this. I think the show needs some message stating this fact, either it doesn't or I missed it. It comes off as being fake (the reactions) for some reason which would turn a lot of people off. I guess we see too many fake YouTube stunts these days, and read about magicians who have faked reactions on their shows."
Magic for Humans,Hey Justin! I've been really interested in starting to learn how to perform magic tricks to show off and teach my daughter when she grows up. Love your show!
Magic for Humans,Fianc√© and I loved the show. Hope more are being made. How did that get in the apple in class? :p
Magic for Humans,"I downloaded Reddit just to comment on your show and they gave me this stupid user name!

Can you make it disappear!?!

But seriously, love your show! Every episode has a theme that plays on society idocracies.
You use so many different silly and stupid situations and make it hilarious (I‚Äôm watching face yoga episode now haha).

Your humor, life stories, interactions with random people, and charisma is on point!

The whole show concept is great But YOU make the show!

Youre a funny dude and down to earth! You seem like a guy is totally hang out with you!"
Magic for Humans,*sus*
Magic for Humans,"I found it very enjoyable and funny, even if I doubt a lot of it. The chip implanted into people's arms was horrifying (that they bought it, apparently), but otherwise really liked the show. It's light and fun."
Magic for Humans,">	I don't think he's using actors except for things like the invisible man where they probably put out some casting call to get a crowd.

Its clearly stated in the episode that the crowd was generated by a craigslist ad, and iirc you watch them get coached."
Magic for Humans,TL;DR Magic is inherently deceit.
Magic for Humans,I do want to put out that I never heard back from him
Magic for Humans,"Dude, it‚Äôs LA throw a stone hit a wannabe actor, doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs a plant! "
Magic for Humans,Why is this comment not being commented on more?
Magic for Humans,I hear you. I do the invisible man experiment live on stage in my touring show every night with men from the audience. And I'd say that with about a 70% success rate we convince that dude that he's invisible. It can sometimes be hit and miss cause humans are weird and some have more of a guard up than others. (as you can see in the video) But I can assure you though that neither Jonathan nor Brandon were in on it or hamming it up. Thanks for the thoughtful comment.
Magic for Humans,Magic for Susan‚Äôs is my fav!! The Susan dog... I was in tears! 
Magic for Humans,"wow, you are feisty! Personally I think if your joy comes from 'trying to figure out the trick' then I think you're missing out on the best parts of magic. However since you say you want to see the trick as it is in real life as best you can, I cordially invite you to one of my live shows...pair of tickets on me and you can see a bunch of the bits from the show right up close...I'll even use your phone for the trick.

I occasionally post cell phone rehearsal vids on my instagram you might enjoy. Here's my favorite marshmallow vanish that didn't make the show: [https://www.instagram.com/p/Bmu1pXnlbvz/](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bmu1pXnlbvz/) "
Magic for Humans,You'd have a better chance if you upped the donation amount. A hundred bucks is nothing and frankly offensive for the amount of extra time and effort you're asking a presumably already very busy person to put into proving something they have no need to prove. 
Magic for Humans,"The first person is made ""invisible"" as a convincer so that the actual victim will think he is also invisible.  everyone except for the victim sees the guy walking off.  But they should have shown that in the clip to make it more obvious.
"
Magic for Humans,"> Be honest, even you had to have been surprised at how well some of the tricks worked on the marks. Now you know why.

....because those dont make it to air so even if it only works 1/4 times  thats all you will see"
Magic for Humans,Dad is that you?
Magic for Humans,None of them? Literally like 90% of them could be tho. Just cause you don't know how it's done doesn't mean it's impossible 
Magic for Humans,"I say it in the opening titles and in the trailer, but it flies by fast I know..."
Magic for Humans,"Sorry I finished writing too early.

I agree with you to a point. Magic is inherently deceitful, but  magic has nothing to do with suspension of disbelief. No one suspends their disbelief as to whether or not the magician has powers. The whole point of magic is to get a thrill off the skill of manipulation. Whether its object manipulation or mind manipulation the skill of the manipulation is the point. When it's just Hollywood Magic the amazement of it is gone. The reason magic is amazing is because you're trying to *maintain* your disbelief but it's very difficult. 

Also the more you know about magic, the more you appreciate how hard some stuff is and it becomes even more amazing. Like Shawn Farquhar's [Shape of My Heart routine](https://youtu.be/ZgVwJek-fXY). I know every step of how that flourish is done, and knowing that, it's even more amazing."
Magic for Humans,"If he was randomly picked off the street, the chances he ends up on this Netflix special are nil to none ."
Magic for Humans,">And I'd say that with about a 70% success rate we convince that dude that he's invisible. It can sometimes be hit and miss cause humans are weird and some have more of a guard up than others.

Dude, you can't tell me that 70% of people think they can actually be turned invisible and that those who don't believe it are ""weird"" or ""have their guard up"". I understand you'd never admit to hiring people or if the people in your TV show actually hammed it up, because that would be the end of your show.  I'm just saying that there have been so many fake pranks on the internet over the years, that it's really easy to spot the fake reactions, and those two guys in your video sent up numerous red flags. I'm happy for your success, and I hope your show does well, but I'm just not buying it."
Magic for Humans,"This is so awesome that you came in and replied. My gf and I binged the whole series in 2 nights. Hi from Australia. We hope you get another series or even better tour Australia.

She's a massive skeptic and watching you go the extra mile with every trick not only blew both our minds but had her shrieking ""But HOW?! ACTUALLY HOW! FUCKING HOW. Stop laughing at me. Fucking How!"" And me just slowly turning to her and saying ""It's just Magic for Humans"".

We both think that you have honed your craft so perfectly and you're one of very few magicians who are professional (as in take the craft professionally and seriously) but also charismatic and hilarious. We love Penn and Teller Fool Us but our faves are always the ones who are a bit more loose and play with the audience but never to mislead them. 

You have a new fan for infinite. Thanks for being awesome. "

I'm quite enjoying your show Justin.... though I know nothing about Magic so that's probably an easy feat. Currently watching it with my 2 year old who is amazed! Thanks for the great show. "

Magic for Humans,"Thank you Justin, I‚Äôve completely enjoyed every episode and have binge watched it more than once. I truly believe you‚Äôre one of the best out there. Thanks for keeping the magic alive!"
Magic for Humans,Yeah. What I meant was that because they used tv magic to literally made the first guy invisible it kinda makes the impression that they used effects on the other tricks making the show less convincing.
Magic for Humans,"The ones that made it onto the show *are* the ones I'm talking about. The reactions were *too* perfect, obviously because the marks were in on it. In the invisible man bit, when he holds the can in front of Mike, its very clearly dangling from a string AND SWAYING IN THE WIND lol. But Jonathan's mind is blown and he thinks its all real... yeah right. "
Magic for Humans,"This is so awesome that you came in and replied. My gf and I binged the whole series in 2 nights. Hi from Australia. We hope you get another series or even better tour Australia.

She's a massive skeptic and watching you go the extra mile with every trick not only blew both our minds but had her shrieking ""But HOW?! ACTUALLY HOW! FUCKING HOW. Stop laughing at me. Fucking How!"" And me just slowly turning to her and saying ""It's just Magic for Humans"".

We both think that you have honed your craft so perfectly and you're one of very few magicians who are professional (as in take the craft professionally and seriously) but also charismatic and hilarious. We love Penn and Teller Fool Us but our faves are always the ones who are a bit more loose and play with the audience but never to mislead them. 

You have a new fan for infinite. Thanks for being awesome. "

Magic for Humans,"You‚Äôre wrong. 

Do you do magic? Do you do magic well? You would be amazed at what people can be convinced of. "
Magic for Humans,"My 2 yr old loves it too. Not even sure if he completely understands what's going on, but he loves it.lol"
Magic for Humans,What happened?
Magic for Humans,"you should take a look at how many people believe in ghosts or that they have won the spanish lottery despite having never been there or entered.

people literally give away their lifes savings on the most absurd pretext, check out /r/legaladvice to see how dumb people are"
Magic for Humans,"True. Some people are just susceptible that those kind of tricks and some aren‚Äôt, like hypnotism. A friend of mine went up on stage and he got hypnotized. He‚Äôs smart and with it, but he‚Äôs also the type of person who‚Äôs not fighting to be amazed by things and those are likely the people we see most on this show.

Edit. Wow this is from 3 years ago. Whoops."
Magic for Humans,"Nothing, he ghosted me."
Magic for Humans,"You‚Äôre being incredibly naive bro. Notice how the marks are in perfect make up and wearing brandless clothing so nothing needs to be censored.

And here is aspiring actor John from the invisible act bit on a cooking show... https://youtu.be/0kcXergLG1Q"
Magic for Humans,Haha I also just started watching this and came to check out some comments. Guess we're both late to the party.
Magic for Humans,"I watched S1, but thoroughly enjoying S3. Check out this vid! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwY5\_c4jnTo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwY5_c4jnTo) The blonde's face at the end...."
Magic for Humans,"/u/Justin_Willman 

Why did you ghost him?"
Magic for Humans,Aw what a disappointing conclusion :(
Magic for Humans,"Aye same here, been watching this all night and some of the tricks just seemed too good to be true, but all of the reactions seem genuine (especially the ones who don't seem super impressed/are awkward about it), to my knowledge camera editing *is* involved with producing the show, but the tricks still work irl. Just they have to edit things to make the tricks work for the *viewer*."
Magic for Humans,"Actually that is a pretty classic magic trick. The angle they are looking at him from (and that the camera shows), doesn't show his wife running up from across the street to crouch behind him and enter then exit the bag. 

Most of these are spins on classic illusions. I'm not saying there was actually no camera tricks but a lot can be done without any. Then again I could be wrong.

They probably could've helped themselves with doing some of the tricks in a single take though I suppose some of the problem is, it is usually easier to do magic for a single perspective than multiple perspectives. "
Magic for Humans,The tricks are real.  What‚Äôs fake is the setup.  Being able to pull a coffee maker out of a floppy backpack requires something to be nearby (it has to come from somewhere).  90% of the people on that show are in on it.
Magic for Humans,"Agree! Was loving this show until THAT trick. In fact I immediately googled it and that‚Äôs how I ended up here :)

Such a shame cause he is really funny, and I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs a great magician too. 

I guess there is a lot of pressure for a ‚Äúwow‚Äù trick each episode and that‚Äôs what drives this stuff. I feel let down tho ... "
Magic for Humans,"I never noticed it said that, but I guess I don't really mind cause it was still a funny show"
Magic for Humans,"Oh absolutely, this is the exact reaction of mine, was enjoying the show and first episode thought it was silly and funny but that trick threw me right off, especially as you said it states ‚Äòno camera tricks‚Äô and you get that crappy cgi girlfriend out the bag. "
Magic for Humans,Still enjoying the show but I also saw this. None of the other six people watching noticed it and that blew my mind. It was so obvious. 
Magic for Humans,"This thread (or at least some in it) seems to agree it uses CGI:

"
Magic for Humans,In that case it‚Äòs not ‚Äúreal people‚Äù in the sense of natural reactions ...
Magic for Humans,"I was about to ask how the fuck The Last Dance wasn‚Äôt on your list, but I guess it‚Äôs not on Netflix in the US haha

I really have to wonder, though, about some of these shows. Netflix obviously tries to push certain content (how are Tiger King and Epstein shows related content to Meet the Parents and Schindler‚Äôs List?). But just how many of these shows only appear on this list (or to what degree are the numbers inflated) because Netflix sort of pushes specific shows they want the viewer to watch."

Magic for Humans,Interesting to see containment show up.
Magic for Humans,Those CW shows man. The ratings on tv really don‚Äôt matter for them at all.
Magic for Humans,I love this! Any chance we can get Rotten Tomatoes ratings in the chart?
Magic for Humans,"That's great, but most of the ""status"" looks likes a small square."
Magic for Humans,correction... supernatural hasnt finished airing yet.
Magic for Humans,I was a bit skeptical about this idea when it debuted but it‚Äôs clear that this was a master stroke by Netflix.
Magic for Humans,"What do the different status symbols mean? What's the different between the ""end"" emoji and the ""check""."
Magic for Humans,Damn didn‚Äôt realize Ozark hadn‚Äôt been renewed yet
Magic for Humans,How about movies??
Magic for Humans,No Witcher? Wasnt it reported to be like one of the most watched shows?
Magic for Humans,"I guess I've never found it in me to care which shows are popular on Netflix? But upvote for dedication and effort.

My assumption has always been that, in general, shows on any network are cancelled because no longer profitable."
Magic for Humans,You got linked in [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2020/06/13/netflixs-top-10-most-popular-shows-since-the-top-10-list-was-introduced/#78de986432c3)
Magic for Humans,"It literally took over my tiktok page. The videos made under outer banks hashtag have 1.9Billion views collectively

For comparison mandalorian has 400 Million views"
Disenchantment,Not ever as amusing as I'd like it to be but I always find myself watching it out when it drops.
Disenchantment,"This is the most ""Good but not great"" show I've ever watched."
Disenchantment,"‚ÄúWe‚Äôve heard your complaints, the later seasons of Simpsons and Futurama are disappointing when compared to the brilliance of the early seasons, which is why this time we skipped right over the brilliance part and made a perfectly fine but in no way amazing show from the very beginning.‚Äù"
Disenchantment,"Synopsis for Part 4:

>The mystery of Dreamland‚Äôs origins‚Äîand the stakes for its future‚Äîbecome ever clearer as our trio‚Äîand King Z√∏g‚Äîfind themselves on personal journeys that will ultimately tie in to the kingdom‚Äôs fate. Separated at the end of Part III, our heroes race to reunite in this sweeping series of ten episodes. They‚Äôll find themselves everywhere from the depths of Hell to the clouds of Heaven and everywhere in between, including Ogreland, Steamland, underwater, monasteries, insane asylums, the Enchanted Forest, the Dreamscape and more. All the while, puzzle pieces both canonical and personal will reveal themselves to eager fans."
Disenchantment,"Wow, I saw the first season, thought it was okay, but I completely forget it exists until I see it pop up in my feed.."
Disenchantment,You know what? This is a perfectly decent show that isn't blowing anyone away but it's solid and I like being surprised by its return every now and then but wouldn't be mega disappointed if it just never returned.
Disenchantment,"I see people complaining how it's not as good as early seasons simpsons and futurama, but it really seems like Groening was going for something different here.  It's often dramatic and sometimes sad.

Futurama and The Simpsons never attempted a continuous narrative beyond  a few threads.  Disenchanted has room for improvement, but I think it is good.

3.2/5 stars"
Disenchantment,"I feel like they really want frontal nudity, but they don't have the stones to do it."
Disenchantment,"I will say that the guy that just sits in a barrel of water selling ‚ÄúMe flavoured water‚Äù will never not be funny. 

I like Disenchantment. It‚Äôs consistently funny."
Disenchantment,FINALLY! I have been waiting for the new season for so long
Disenchantment,Wasn't he on Epstein's plane?
Disenchantment,"Ah yes, the Disenchantment cycle begins anew, now we're back to ""maybe it will be funny this season"". It probably won't, but I'll still end up watching it for some reason. The show has so much potential but just seems like it never even gets close to where it could be."
Disenchantment,"I wanted to like this show, but the show makes it so hard. It's a comedy and a drama and an adventure series and it never seems to know which it wants to be, even within a single scene.

An example in the last season is the sequence where [Elfo massages Queen Dagmar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HObY717tHM). (The YouTube video is a minute long, but the full sequence is about double that, with multiple cuts back and forth with other scenes).

So there's a lot of screentime dedicated to this. But *what is the purpose of this scene*?

**Is it meant to be funny?** There's some very mild potential for humour in the awkwardness of the situation and in the sight gag of Elfo skating on her back, but nothing that justifies the time spent. Maybe the writer thought the director could make more from the scenario.

**Is it meant to be tense?** Dagmar is dangerous. Elfo is afraid. But I'm not sure if we're meant to be laughing or worried.

**Is it meant to advance the plot?** At the end of the sequence it's revealed that Dagmar knew all along it was Elfo giving the massage. But this goes nowhere. She doesn't capture or harm Elfo -- she just lets him run ahead to join his friends as if the scene never happened.

**Is it meant to be titillating?** God, I hope not."
Disenchantment,"Hopefully this season was better

Part 3 was kinda boring"
Disenchantment,[deleted]
Disenchantment,"Not sure why theres so much dislike for this series.. I personally love it. I think too many people are trying to compare it to other animated shows like Futurama or The Simpsons. Some are episodic in nature, some are purely humorous, while some others are more serious, but with humor added on top. Disenchantment seems a little different in that it has an overall more serious tone of a continually progressing story, but is told through humor. Imagine if the three stooges did Saving Private Ryan.

The show has lots of likable characters, funny moments, a story that always leaves you wanting to see whats next.. I cant wait for this season and Im hoping for many more."
Disenchantment,[deleted]
Disenchantment,Can‚Äôt wait till season 27
Disenchantment,"Eh. 
It really felt like S2 and S3 didn't really progress the story, and both seasons ended with similar resolutions."
Disenchantment,Only watched the first two seasons. Have they improved the weird sound design?
Disenchantment,Gee everything is coming out next month when the service raises its price by another dollar. How very interesting.
Disenchantment,Super underappreciated show...
Disenchantment,Speak no more of leave-o Speak-o
Disenchantment,"Decent show but I think I'd like it more if it were less serialized. More one-off stories like Futurama. When new episodes come out I always wind up having to remember what happened last. I don't think the main plot is that memorable either, but I do enjoy the characters"
Disenchantment,Finally I was waiting for this announcement!!! Let‚Äôs gooooo
Disenchantment,Finally. News I can use.
Disenchantment,"Whenever I'm sleepy and just want something to watch and barely pay attention to, this is usually it"
Disenchantment,Yes yeeeeeeeeeeeeees!!!!!!!
Disenchantment,I actually liked this show a lot
Disenchantment,"Each season has been better than the last imo.

Season 1 was pretty average but by season 3 my girlfriend and I were laughing a few times a minute. We think it‚Äôs quite good."
Disenchantment,"I gave up halfway thru season 2. The series seems to be *almost* funny and engaging enough. If I had to rate it a 1 out of 10, I would give it a 4.7"
Disenchantment,Say what you want. I enjoy this show. It is fun and interesting.
Disenchantment,Just finished Season 3. It's enjoyable in small doses.
Disenchantment,I like this show fine but I've completely lost the plot at this point.  I'm mostly watching for Elfo and Luci shenanigans
Disenchantment,"PART 4!?  


I remember Season 1, I had no idea 2 and 3 were already out!"
Disenchantment,Can‚Äôt wait
Disenchantment,"Honest question, did this show get good enough for a fourth season? I couldn‚Äôt get through the first."
Disenchantment,I can‚Äôt tell you how boring & ugly adultswim cartoons are compared to younger viewer shows.
Disenchantment,I am so excited I love this show
Disenchantment,cant wait!
Disenchantment,"I like it, it makes my wife and I laugh. Nothing to write home about, but I do enjoy it for what it is."
Disenchantment,I love this show
Disenchantment,"Wow, I had no idea they were still making this.  I watched a bit of the first part and quickly lost interest.  I thought it would be more like Futurama set in a fantasy world, but the humour just wasn't there.  Does it get any better?"
Disenchantment,"Who the F is elfos mom? 

Troll?

Human?"
Disenchantment,Ah yes the time travelers other show
Disenchantment,"Fuck yeah, love this gem of a show"
Disenchantment,Yeahh boyy
Disenchantment,Yaaas
Disenchantment,"The king in the show looked similar af to Polish king Boles≈Çaw Chrobry. Both had same moustache, hair and both were fat."
Disenchantment,Let's goooooo!
Disenchantment,"I know a lot of people think this show is just ok, and I would agree when it comes to the first two season, but I actually thought Season 3 was great and found an appropriate balance between overarching story and humor. I liked that there wasn't really a status quo and the characters were in new scenarios every episode. There were still definitely some flaws (Zog going insane went on for FAR too long), but by this point in the show I might actually be more invested in these characters than I was in those of Futurama."
Disenchantment,"Ah fuck yeah!

(I enjoy it and don't care about everyone else's lackluster critiques...)"
Disenchantment,There was a season 3?
Disenchantment,"This show is extremely forgettable, so much so I can‚Äôt recall if I watched all of last season and I‚Äôm looking forward to forgetting this new one as well"
Disenchantment,"I was pretty disenchanted with the first season, didn‚Äôt realize it had more."
Disenchantment,How does this show keep getting renewed but Glow cancelled?
Disenchantment,I wonder if they'll remember to finish the sound design this time.
Disenchantment,I watched the entire first season without so much as a chuckle. Cant believe this is still going. So weird that I love many of the talented people involved with this show but it just doesn't work for me.
Disenchantment,I have been waiting so eagerly for this. I cannot wait to watch
Disenchantment,"I really enjoy this show and was super excited to see this announcement. I didn‚Äôt realize how unpopular it is until reading through the comments.

I think where this show might not connect with some has a lot to do with the unique character dynamic of the three leads. The Homer/Fry is a young single woman who doesn‚Äôt have a partner character to balance her strengths and weaknesses like the other two do (I know Fry and Leela aren‚Äôt always a romantic couple, I‚Äôm just talking dynamics in general), she‚Äôs followed around by a Millhouse who loves her, and a cat-sized Bender. I think her lack of a more logical support person to fall back on has been propelling her character growth, but it also makes the show feel a little messy or unresolved at times."
Disenchantment,"Christ I had no idea the consensus was 'meh', I love this show"
Disenchantment,"this is a good ""second monitor"" show when you watch on PC."
Disenchantment,I‚Äôd rather have more futurama
Disenchantment,I greatly wish this show was enjoyable.
Disenchantment,"Oh boy, I can‚Äôt wait for part 4 to end on another cliffhanger while answering few things and only raising more questions throughout the series!

Yes I am still annoyed by Part 3. 

No, I do like the show a lot and will keep watching it. I‚Äôm pretty sure the cliffhanger shit is part of the joke. It‚Äôs just with how Netflix treats shows it gets my antsy."
Disenchantment,I dropped off during the second season (thoroughly enjoyed the first). Is it worth pushing on?
Disenchantment,"Big fan of Nat Faxon since seeing him in Beerfest, and Elfo is the best part of this show too in my opinion."
Disenchantment,"I often use this show to fall asleep to.  Put it on, then set the sleep timer."
Disenchantment,"One reason why I love this show is because the story has continuation. It's not like simpsons, family guy and such. The characters grow. there's continual jokes that get better later on."
Disenchantment,"The problem with this show is that they keep creating mysteries without solving the ones they already created. It just keeps piling up without an explanation. I really hope this season would be better, because this show has a lot of potential."
Disenchantment,Has the show gotten better over time? Didn't enjoy the first season all that much.
Disenchantment,Last season was like one big adventure. I know a lot of people were expecting it to be more funny but I honestly enjoy the show for what it is. Can't wait to binge this again!
Disenchantment,Is part 3 worth it? I thought the first two parts were ok and then kinda dropped it
Disenchantment,I have to learn to not binge these shows when they come out.  So depressed after I'm done watching them for so long.
Disenchantment,"*lucy voice* DO IT
DO IT DO IT DO IT"
Disenchantment,There was a Part 3? Nice!
Disenchantment,Resident alien disenchantment and severance this will be an amazing month
Disenchantment,"I have mixed feelings about this show. It's not very funny and incredibly weird. But I always want to see what happens next.

The background art is absolutely gorgeous."
Disenchantment,"""Ohhhh no"""
Disenchantment,Woot!
Disenchantment,Is it any good?
Disenchantment,Noice!
Disenchantment,It‚Äôs good it‚Äôs just not futurama good‚Ä¶ either way I‚Äôll watch it when it come out
Disenchantment,"I like this show a lot. I don't love it. But I think Matt Groening is trying to do something really new, but feels pressured to keep familiar style. I believe that's why it feels so uneven. I find I like it more with repeated viewing. This show doesn't focus on humor as much a Simpsons or Futurama, but it has a lot of heart, and that's why I keep watching it. And I think it's getting better with every new season. 

Lucy's line, ""I don't why you always bring out the good half in me?"" was gut wrenching."
Disenchantment,I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm in the minority here but this is absolutely one of my favorite shows currently going
Disenchantment,Yessss I love this show!
Disenchantment,"Sweet! I like this show and Netflix has been shit lately, I‚Äôm surprised I haven‚Äôt deleted it yet."
Disenchantment,"Im happy about it. Its a feel good series, perfect to relax.

And while not all the normal jokes land, the sudden slapstick ""physical"" jokes are hilarious. Like Bean fighting the revolving door or Odval faceplanting when he puts his weight on something thats not there anymore."
Disenchantment,YES OMG finally. i can‚Äôt believe i find this out on reddit and not even on their official accounts. I‚Äôve been waiting for Part 4
Disenchantment,Love this show. Watched it so many times already
Disenchantment,"Nice! I know it's nobody's favorite but I like the majority of the characters and the world they reside in.  


It's easy to watch and melt away in. And that's definitely something that's needed."
Disenchantment,LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Disenchantment,"The world and art style and music and voice over keeps me watching it. The story however and the jokes don't. Like others say, it's a 6 out of 10 but a 6 that I have no problem watching. Whereas other 6 ratings I stop"
Disenchantment,Dude I can‚Äôt wait for this!!!
Disenchantment,"Yay, I love to binge this."
Disenchantment,"People hating on the averageness of this show are forgetting about the fact that a lot of the recent cartoons being released are complete trash. It takes a lot for me to get into one as an adult, especially non-nostalgic ones, and this show is one I happily put on and enjoy. Actually it deserves more credit because a lot of new shows not just cartoons are trash."
Disenchantment,want more of the steampunk storyline.
Disenchantment,Anything goes!!
Disenchantment,"I am not arguing this is better than Futurama, but I... guess I like Disenchantment more, maybe because of its quirks? I was slow to warm up to Futurama and still have the be in the right mood for sci-fi settings, but I think I enjoy Disenchantment more because it's like this weird experiment with a bizarre and wonderful voice cast. The humor doesn't always land, but when it does it makes me quite happy.

I think my favorite laugh is still from the beginning, when Elfo encounters the warring gnomes. ""I like war, but I wouldn't say I love it."" That shit gets me every time!"
Disenchantment,I honestly forgot about this show. I guess it‚Äôs time for me to catch up.
Ultraviolet,Back when I bought dvds and accessed their digital content I detested Ultraviolet.
Ultraviolet,"I initially was sad when i saw the headline. I had a moment of ""What about my movies?"". Then I realized I haven't used the service in years and never would again anyway. "
Ultraviolet,Movies Anywhere is better in every single way. Hopefully this convinces Fox and Paramount to get on board with them.
Ultraviolet,Ultraviolet was confusing and half-assed from the beginning. Movies Anywhere is how to do it right.
Ultraviolet,That‚Äôs what‚Äôs happens when people stupidly place their faith and their money in non-physical copies. You eventually lose what you claim you ‚Äúown‚Äù. 
Ultraviolet,"Sounds like non-Americans are screwed over. Movies Anywhere, Fandango, Vudu etc. are all US only, only Ultraviolet had a (limited) international presence."
Ultraviolet,"Doesn't help that the only UV-linked APP available on my old smart TV was CinemaNow that shuttered almost 2 years ago...

I still have Flixter for my phone but no option for my TV."
Ultraviolet,Trying to access the 4K digital editions for movies from this service was a literal nightmare. I'm still salty from when I tried to redeem my code for Blade Runner 2049 and they just couldn't handle it. I'm glad they're shutting down forever because good riddance.
Ultraviolet,There ARRR ways to get the movies you own from Ultraviolet.
Ultraviolet,It was a terrible service based on my experiences.
Ultraviolet,And these companies wonder why people pirate so much.
Ultraviolet,Exact same reaction. I was like ‚Äúoh no! I think I have the dark knight on there.......but I do have the Trilogy Blu-ray box set....ok Im over it‚Äù
Ultraviolet,You can still access them through linked services like Movies Anywhere. 
Ultraviolet,Link your Vudu
Ultraviolet,Except television shows. 
Ultraviolet,Fox is already apart of it. Maybe you meant Lionsgate.
Ultraviolet,And physical media is better in every single way over Movies Anywhere.  Not that they can't both co-exist. :)
Ultraviolet,Not in every way. UltraViolet allowed you to combine libraries with other users. We aren't sure what will happen now my library that was shared with a family member. UV also had TV shows which MA doesn't have. 
Ultraviolet,"It‚Äôs inferior.  All the major studios except Disney were part of UV, plus many smaller studios.   You could share your. UV library with six separate users each with their own separate log in.   In addition you could link 6 accounts within Vudu.  MA does not support TV Shows like UV did. MA app is terrible, and not useful for a large libraries.  Vudu supported disc 2 digital or d2d with uv enabled titles which made it easy to,grow your library cheaply.

Also Fox is part of MA.  Paramount, MGM, and Lionsgate are not. So obviously you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about."
Ultraviolet,We aren't losing them though. They're still there on Vudu/MoviesAnywhere.
Ultraviolet,Vudu is the shit. Glad this shut down doesn't affect it.
Ultraviolet,Flixster shut down a while back. At least in the US.
Ultraviolet,I have flixter too. IIRC they support chrome cast 
Ultraviolet,This is the problem with apps built into main hardware like televisions and why they're a bad idea. A $30 Roku stick or FireTV stick would be a big improvement. 
Ultraviolet,"I have no room for physical media, and I want portability and choice. Looks like it's back the ship maties."
Ultraviolet,"Sort of. If you have an Ultraviolet account linked to Vudu, you'll still have everything even after the shutdown. Ultraviolet titles get pushed into a Movies Anywhere account via Vudu, if eligible. Paramount and Lionsgate however are not Movies Anywhere member studios."
Ultraviolet,It was one of those. Couldn't remember which one.
Ultraviolet,"Not every single way, digital is more convenient and doesn‚Äôt take up any storage space."
Ultraviolet,"Nothing wrong with a lot of digital formats, other than the storage.  By that I mean, your access to them.  Like anything, this will become a bigger and bigger issue until lawsuits are constant over the loss of access to things consumers bought.  So, a NAS or physical copies are my go to.  In a world motivated purely by profit, I don't trust corporations for anything.  Let alone paying their taxes or working for my benefit for reasonable pay."
Ultraviolet,Movies Anywhere and Vudu are US-only. 95% of the world doesn't have access to them.
Ultraviolet,"And if/when that goes away, what‚Äôs gonna happen to them then?"
Ultraviolet,"All your movies linked to all your accounts Vudu, FandangoNow , google play, will stay in your respective library."
Ultraviolet,"Flixster in the US has shut down now if I believe. I think they ask you to merge with another service. 
(Flixster in Canada still works)"
Ultraviolet,"Point taken.  I should have said ""in many ways"".  Sorry :)"
Ultraviolet,Plus you don't even own it
Ultraviolet,"Except it takes up storage space on your device, especially if you want to watch offline."
Ultraviolet,"Its convenient until a company decides to take it away, then its the exact opposite of convenient."
Ultraviolet,To hell with ‚Äúconvenience‚Äù. Quality trumps that every day of the week. 
Ultraviolet,[deleted]
Ultraviolet,"Here in the UK there is another site that you get directed to by UV.

Can‚Äôt remember what it‚Äôs called, but it has your entire library"
Ultraviolet,"Hopefully with MoviesAnywhere being owned by Disney that won't be a problem, but you're right, we never know. "
Ultraviolet,"Nah, you were right the first time."
Ultraviolet,"Technically we don‚Äôt own the movie that‚Äôs on the disc either, just the disc."
Ultraviolet,"*Only if you want to watch offline

Aside from the app data, there's no required storage for movies streamed. "
Ultraviolet,"Not on the days I have to travel for work and don't want to fill up my carry-on with disc cases when I can just access my entire collection online. Also I'm watching on my laptop, so the 14 inch screen wont change much if I'm watching 1080 or 4K."
Ultraviolet,"Physical discs technically have the same TOS, it's only a license to the content and they can notify you of its revocation. Anyone who has possession of libdvdcss (that's anyone who has installed VLC Media Player) is in violation of it. It's just almost impossible to enforce. It's almost impossible to enforce it with digital copies too once they're in your possession."
Ultraviolet,Flixter. And they just shutdown in the US. 
Ultraviolet,"And Vudu is owned by Walmart which doesn't seem to be shutting down soon. By the time I might have to worry about losing my library on those services I'm certain there will be another library that I can integrate those films into, and then on and on. "
Ultraviolet,What are they going to do? Hire the police to come take your discs away? No. But they sure as hell can remove content from your account
Ultraviolet,"If a digital service shuts down, its not like you keep the movie. Although popular services probably have no end, you never know so its a sort of gamble. At least with a physical copy you can keep watching a movie. "
Ultraviolet,Disc wallet. 15‚Äù laptop w/ blu-ray drive. üòÅ
Ultraviolet,">It's almost impossible to enforce it with digital copies too once they're in your possession.

Except they are basically never in your possession"
Ultraviolet,"> And Vudu is owned by Walmart which doesn't seem to be shutting down soon

Ultraviolet was owned by Sony, Samsung, Intel, Fox, Toshiba, Verizon, Warner Bros, HP, NBC, and IBM. That didn't help it. They'll shut it down if the service isn't doing well, it doesn't matter how successful the company is."
Ultraviolet,There is that FBI warning on the physical copies however. 
Ultraviolet,"I'm sure he understands the distinction, he was just making a legal clarification."
Ultraviolet,That's a lot to add to luggage for a frequent flyer. An iPad is orders of magnitude easier to deal with.
Ultraviolet,"Virtually no laptops have BD drives these days, so you're either paying extra for a fatter, heavier, more power-hungry laptop from a very limited range or lugging around a motored plug-in device so you can play your box of discs, all for the benefit of that quality jump on a 15"" screen? That's way more hassle than it's worth to 99.999% of people."
Ultraviolet,Movies Anywhere is booming 
Ultraviolet,I don't think you understood my point
Ultraviolet,Correct. 
Ultraviolet,"Blueray drives? Laptops don't even have CD/DVD drives any more, never mind the BR drive that never became a standard"
Ultraviolet,"No, I‚Äôm using a 9 year old Sony VAIO. "
Ultraviolet,"It should have, but no, people had to ruin a good thing. "
Ultraviolet,I miss those 
Ultraviolet,"There was also a study from the beginning of this year that said 8% of people would cancel if Netflix increased their prices.

https://www.multichannel.com/news/netflix-could-lose-8-percent-of-subscribers

That turned out to not be true."
Ultraviolet,"I don't buy this kind of predictive study. People ""set it and forget it"" with their subscriptions and it usually takes a lot more than some content loss to get them to take action to unsubscribe."
Ultraviolet,Those people should just buy the show and save themselves some money
Ultraviolet,Yeah but 63% of young people are full of shit.
Ultraviolet,49% of young viewers using their Parents Netflix account.*
Ultraviolet,Watch some new shit people.
Ultraviolet,"LOL who pays 13 bux a month to watch Friends and the Office on repeat? Go buy a box set, son."
Ultraviolet,UK netflix doesn't have any of those things anyway....
Ultraviolet,"I wish they‚Äôd add more movies. It‚Äôs called Netflix, not Nettube. I was promised a movie-streaming service!"
Ultraviolet,"I honestly don't get why Netflix hasn't made a sitcom like those yet. Fuller House is the closest thing they've done to it. But they should see non serialized sitcoms are the best kind of background shows which would attract more people and get repeat viewings. A lot of their current stuff isn't as non serialized like Parks and Rec, the Office and 30Rock. Yes these shows had plot threads but each episode was made to stand on it's own for syndication."
Ultraviolet,"everyone was talking about that blindfold movie and haunting on hill house.  If they lose these Disney shows, they have money to spend on other things."
Ultraviolet,"""Also 99% of young viewers are using Mark's account anyway"""
Ultraviolet,This is interesting because here in Australia Netflix has none of those shows/movies and is still incredibly popular. I think they are all on another streaming service called Stan that isn't as popular as Netflix. Go figure.
Ultraviolet,You know what we need? One big monolithic company that owns all media and provides it all in the same place. They could have a friendly animal as a mascot! /S
Ultraviolet,"I went with Netflix to no longer have the hassle of pirating shows.

But if Netflix no longer has my shows and i'd have to subscribe to a bunch other services, then i'm gonna go right back to pirating."
Ultraviolet,Who did they poll? I wouldn't care.
Ultraviolet,"I wouldn't care. The only Marvel they have now are the movies I see in theaters anyway. The office is good, I've seen it. But I don't jizz all over myself about it like everyone else."
Ultraviolet,"There is an important distinction here though - just because I would cancel one service does not mean I would buy another. 

At present I have Netflix and Amazon and I will not be purchasing another service such as hulu, Disney, etc. If content is locked behind a new subscription service I will either just not watch entirely or pirate it."
Ultraviolet,"Yeah, not a chance this is true."
Ultraviolet,I wouldn‚Äôt even notice.
Ultraviolet,People report what they would do doesn‚Äôt mean they will do. Plus young people probably share accounts.
Ultraviolet,I canceled mine after they lost Fox; they were 80% of the things I watched on Netflix.
Ultraviolet,"I always try and find something new, but nothing grabs me, and then i return to old favorites. it was nice watching the 5th element for the 100th time though."
Ultraviolet,49% of young viewers aren‚Äôt even paying for their subscription
Ultraviolet,\*disclaimer - 85% of the 49% who responded don't actually pay for a subscription
Ultraviolet,"Who funded this study? Lemme guess. Disney, Warner and NBC?"
Ultraviolet,73% of the 49% then realize they are leaching off their parents main account.
Ultraviolet,I‚Äôm one of those young people and I joined Netflix because of their original programs. I don‚Äôt give a rat‚Äôs ass about Friends or Office or Marvel there. So I am not sure where this research comes from.
Ultraviolet,I find it hard to believe that ‚Äúfriends‚Äù is on that list.
Ultraviolet,Not me. Stranger Things and Chilling Adventures of Sabrina are good shit
Ultraviolet,I immediately don't trust the polling method.
Ultraviolet,I wonder what's the percentage of people who forget they have a Netflix account until they get charged each month but never do anything about it
Ultraviolet,"Friends is boring,unfunny and over-hyped."
Ultraviolet,"This fixation on the mediocrity that was ""Friends"" baffles me."
Ultraviolet,Get rid of The Office. So tired of seeing it everywhere. Reddit made me hate it.

Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"Finished Season 3 of Barry. Very funny, had the balls to do what Dexter should have."
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,Found Schitt's Creek on Amazon/Freevee. I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs really good
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,Currently wrapping up Banshee. What a fantastic show.
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"Got here to thanks the recommendation and praise **Halt and Catch Fire**, such underrated show!"
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,I‚Äôm a couple years late but I‚Äôm just about finished with Dopesick on Hulu. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been more enraged at some characters in a series before. Very powerful stuff. Michael Keaton is fantastic.
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,2nd season of **Perry Mason** Great show.
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"About half in **Class of '07** on Amazon Prime and seriously, I love it so much. The all women cast is great, and it's humor is exactly my cup of tea. 100% recommend!"
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"Ted lasso season 3- loved the first episode of the new season 

Perry Mason season 2- Why is nobody talking about this show?? It is so good and I'm finding season 2 to be really good so far 

The Mandalorian season 3- loving this show 

Star trek Picard season 3- 5 episodes in and this is the best Picard season by far, so engaging with a fascinating plot"
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,**Swarm**... Oh this show *crazy* crazy
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"I watched and loved The Expanse, though the ending was (understandably, given the shortened final season) jarringly abrupt.  Highly recommend it‚Ä¶ great sci fi and political intrigue.

I‚Äôm just getting to the end of the first season of The Leftovers‚Ä¶ Great show but an absolutely torturous watch, if that makes sense.  I feel like I need to chase every episode with something funny or light."
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"Oh man, Bosch is so freakin‚Äô good. On Season 4 episode 8. I advise anyone who judged the show off season 1, to continue. So good.

RIP Lance."
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"So what are we all supposed to do this Sunday with no **The Last of Us** and **Succession** still a week away? Interact with our families? Smh

Finished season one of the video game zombie show, almost done with **Poker Face**, keeping up with **Top Chef** (shout-out the two Canadians on this season, both looking strong so far) and **Abbott Elementary**."
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"Bit late to the party, but I just discovered how great The Americans is. I decided to give it a go after watching the first season of Perry Mason and being very impressed with Matthew Rhys, glad I did."
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"Highly recommend Swarm on Prime. It‚Äôs crazy, unnerving, and has plenty of twists. I can‚Äôt remember the last time a show sucked me in this fast"
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,Wait when did Star Trek Picard get so good? Last 2 episodes have been 10/10.
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"This is an anti-recommendation. I randomly stumbled over a dance choreography reality tv show on Netflix (""Dance 100"") and this show must have some of the most awfully edited performances of all time. Random zooms and close ups, weird and frantic pans and idiotic crowd reaction shots awkwardly put together. The actual dancing seems to have been secondary to whoever edited this thing. 

Add a stage production that at times completely floods the zone with fire balls or flood lights. 

Don't get me started on the rest of the show. What an utter failure lol."
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"Watching  shadow and bone.

The writing is still ok but this is a huge letdown from the first season.

The first season actually gave you this brand new universe type feel.......

The second doesnt. Even worse they're plotting out some battle of the ages shit with an extremely more limited cast than the first season.

Idk if it was shot during the pandemic or it was budget cuts or what..

But you cant emphasize some big conflict that is about to occur while never showing more than 15 or 20 ppl on screen at a time.

The first season had literally fields and cities of actors and extras.. you got the feeling you were in  this massive other world which is always part of the appeal to fantasy shows.

This season it's just a large sound stage that can hold 30 to 40 ppl at best. And once you realize how downsized the show is you cant get it out of your mind 

The writing isn't that bad. Tho it does play on some heavily used tropes..the actual story isn't bad. But the show is not even close to what it was the first season"
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"Swarm - 2 episodes in, utterly bizarre and I have no idea what I‚Äôm watching but I know I‚Äôll be watching the rest as fast as possible"
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"Just binged Yellowjackets s1 in time for season 2 in a few days. It's so bat shit crazy. I loved it. The whole cast is incredible. 

I started The Wire for the first time last week. I'm only a few episodes in and liking it. Not loving it yet.

Doing a catch up on Chicago Fire with s8.  Always have and always will love this show. >!I miss Otis though.!<

Also think I'm going to start Perry Mason. With s3 three starting soon, seems like a good idea.

And watching my weekly shows. The Mandalorian, The Bad Batch, Superman & Lois (s3 started this week), Daisy Jones,  Chicago PD and Vanderpump Rules for my reality fix."
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,Lucky Hank was decent. Not jaw dropping or anything but looked like a quality show that I expect to watch every week.
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"Just finished first episode of Extrapolations. Some thoughts.

Plot is not that interesting or exciting. A little preachy. 

Matthew Rhys and Heather Graham kill it in this episode. So fun to watch both of them ! 

I really do not recognize Kit Harington. Are we sure he is the same guy who plays Jon snow? Ok this is a joke but really he look so different.

I am guessing they paid BIG bucks for so many people to come on to the show.

I will continue watching."
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,Star Trek Picard Season 3 is great so far!
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"Pretty Mason S1. 

Shadow & Bone S2. 

Warrior S1. 

His Dark Materials S3. 

A Spy Among Friends. 

The Bureau. 

12 monkeys. 

Dark. 

Just finished all the seasons to The Boys,  The Last of Us, and both seasons of Slow Horses.  All great shows"
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"The first episode of **Class of '07** was hilarious. An apocalypse hits an aussie girls' school reunion. Great cast, super witty writing, it's on Prime, watch it!"
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"Some of these weekly TV shows have become my main coping mechanism for such a stressful few weeks in the rest of life. It‚Äôs nice to escape to both new and familiar worlds. I‚Äôm overly positive on these shows because, well, life is tough right now and these help me through it.

**Star Trek Picard** continues to be fantastic. It gets better each and every episode - and last week‚Äôs was a banger! No spoilers - but if you loved TNG this season is wonderful.

**The Mandalorian** felt a lot like Andor this week. I really enjoyed the whole middle of the episode - it was some great, new world building - but I missed seeing Mando during it. The beginning scenes were some of the best I‚Äôve seen!

**The Bad Batch** was a really nice feel good episode. I‚Äôm enjoying our heroes learning about what life should be like. And completely expecting that to be ripped away.

**Ted Lasso** is back! And I can‚Äôt wait to see where this season takes Richmond and Ted. Up the Greyhounds!

Binged the last 5 episodes of **The Last of Us**. Some of these episodes could have been a whole season for The Walking Dead. I‚Äôm impressed with how much they‚Äôre able to focus on moving the plot forward while creating a compelling apocalyptic world - and building these character‚Äôs relationship. The jump between episodes 8 & 9 was a little abrupt but overall a great new show!

**Shadow & Bone** took a while for me to remember the first season. But this is a great show that my wife and I can enjoy watching together. I need a good recap of season 1 though."
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"Binged Swarm, and it gave me nightmares üòÖ"
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,I assumed Succession S4 was premiering tonight since TLoU ended‚Ä¶ F Me!
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,Pretty excited about lucky hank.  New party down is great.
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"Rewatching **House M.D**, after so many years it still holds up amazingly. Hugh Laurie is an incredible actor. Even though it has 20+ episodes a season, I'm not tired of it(into season 4). One of my favourite shows of all time.

I have also been watching alot of Korean Shows(The Glory, My Name, HellBound, All of Us Are Dead etc). I tried to watch  **Vincenzo** and could not get into it, reminded me of a cheesy CW show. The most off putting and annoying thing was that main character constantly had his face brightened by 1000%? I don't understand that."
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"**Poker Face**--  I'm 6 episodes in, and it is okay.  I don't mind knowing the killer in the beginning a la Columbo and Law and Order: Criminal Intent.  But I do wish there was more detective work to get there.  It's hard to put my finger on it but I just don't think Natasha Lyonne carries it.  

**Perry Mason**-- I loved the first season and so far the second season is good too.  I love watching period pieces."
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"About to start **Shirking** because I've been reading a lot of good things about the show here. Better nor disappoint!

At the third episode of **Alice in Borderland**. It's okay, a tad bit over the top with action sequence, too exaggerated and sometimes the scenes and dialogues are way too long for the context.

Excited to watch **Shadow and Bones**, waited on this show for a long time.

Discontinued **Carnival Row** after first episode (Season one) due to many mixed reviews for season two. Amazon has done a unique job ruining three fantasy shows. I have a feeling that **Warhammer** could be a change that Amazon needs now that Henry Cavill is on it.

*TLOU*, I LOVED IT!"
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"Another late one this week. Hopefully will get back on track next week.

Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,Just gonna say RIP Lance Reddick. Just finished binging **BOSCH**. Weekend ruined. Fucking po-lice
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"RIP to Lance Reddick üôèüèº

Broyles from Fringe, if you don‚Äôt know him by name"
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"I'll watch the final episode of The Last Of Us with my family this weekend. Excited to see it!

I also plan on binging the second season of Shadow and Bone on Netflix. The series is based on the Shadow and Bone trilogy by Leigh Bardugo. It is part-fantasy, part-drama, and part-adventure.

It's been a while since I've read the trilogy, which is a part of a whole fantasy universe called the Grishaverse (besides the S&B trilogy, it also covers two duologies). But both the book and TV series really remind me of Avatar: The Last Airbender (elemental magic), Game of Thrones (different nations and political intrigue), and Ocean's 11 (heists). So if you like any of these things, consider giving Shadow and Bone a try. Note that it is an adaptation of a young adult novel, so expect a little bit of romance and awkward (sometimes cringe-worthy) fantasy dialogue."
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"*Class of ‚Äò07*

Really fun and entertaining ensemble comedy with an interesting premise and a great cast"
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,_Shrinking_ might have the most likeable characters of any show I've seen. There is no B-plot. Each character is funny and charming in their own way.
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"**Poker Face** \- up to Ep 8 - I really like it - an episode every few days.  Lots of great guest stars. 

**Clarkson's Farm** S2 - Jeremy and Kaleb are hilarious Frick and Frack.  I love the cast of side characters.  Cows!

**Pretty Hard Cases** S3 - it can be a little cringey, but I've loved the character development between Kelly and Sam.  And I like how they unfold the police investigations over the season.

Hate-watching **Inventing Anna** because I needed something purely trashy that I had downloaded when there was a 5 hour internet outage here.  I'll likely finish it out.  I'm intrigued by some of the supporting cast.  I didn't realize it was a Shonda show until I started into it.

Finishing up **All Creatures Great and Small** S3.  Not my favourite of the seasons with TB and WW2 both at play - but still wonderful characters and scenery.  

Next up - **Shrinking**."
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"Binged all of Swarm tonight, I loved the first 5 episodes, not sure on the last two at the moment. Really good soundtrack."
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"Started Star Trek: Strange New Worlds on a whim after not really watching any trek since TNG and I‚Äôm absolutely blown away so far. It weirdly reminds me a lot of The Orville, which I always loved for feeling like classic trek but with a modern look, which is exactly what Strange New Worlds is but better and more serious."
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"It's a bit confusing that with The Swarm and Swarm we have two (very different) shows out right now.

Anyways, while Glover's Swarm got lukewarm reviews, stylistically the first episode has me intrigued."
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"**Ted Lasso**- season 3 - So glad its back, don't see what all the griping is about, solid episode I don't see any fall off in quality. 

OK - one gripe, Keeley and Roy breakup seems pretty transparently there because its likely an easy way to create drama for them to ultimately get back together. But the scene with his niece was still beautifully done.

Nathan is such a great foil for Ted - am really interested to see how this all plays out.

**Picard** add me to the pile of those who say this show is really really good this season and each episode seems to get even better.(SPOILERISH)  Was great to see Michelle Forbes again - really missed her character when she was written out of TNG

**Abbott Elementary** - Gold star to them for doing gods work and taking on the whole issue of Charter Schools - something rarely addressed in the media in anything but glowing terms."
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,Finishing up the last season of **Atypical** while I wait for Yellowjackets and Succession to return.
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"I caught up on Trying. This show surprised me. It's quirky and I really like the relationship between the main characters. 

I am working on finishing up the final season of The Mosquito Coast -- I can see why this show was canceled."
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"**Star Trek: Picard** has been so good so far this season. I know people were burned by the first two seasons, and I get it, but hear me out. There's a new showrunner that actually knows how to do proper TV sci fi (Terry Matalas), the balance between fan service and actually telling a good story is great, they're taking the lore and the characters seriously and everyone seems to be having so much fun. The last 3 eps especially have been incredible Star Trek and incredible sci fi, you can really feel the stakes and what the characters are going through. 

And, without spoiling anything, it's going places that are really surprising and interesting. I saw someone on twitter call this season Star Trek >!Among Us but with changelings!< and that stuck with me, spot on description lol.

And the way they've actually held back on a lot of the fan service is impressive. We're halfway through the season and only now did >!Picard and Riker get a hold of Worf. No Geordi yet either, or whomever Spiner's going to be portraying this time.!<

They could still bungle it, but if the second half of the season keeps up this pace I say give Matalas the keys to the franchise, let him do whatever he wants in this era of Trek. A USS Titan series with Shaw as the Captain and Seven as the first officer, maybe?"
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"**Swarm** has been a *very* pleasant treat! 4 episodes in and im absolutely in love with the show‚Äôs vibe

The story is dark and can be pretty intense at times, and i love how it just keeps getting more deranged, hope it keeps that up to the end!

Whatever film or lighting they‚Äôre using gives every shot a very nostalgic feel for me. The cinematography is great, and i really like the odd ratio it‚Äôs filmed in. Never seen it before.

Also it‚Äôs one of those shows that has the logo in a different texture every episode, and that‚Äôs something that always puts a stupid grin on my face

EDIT: Just finished the show. Oh my *god*, what an ending!!! One of the better shows ive seen in the past year. They stretched the show‚Äôs concept in ways i wouldnt have ever expected and it was incredible. Definitely give this one a watch if the trailer interests you at all"
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"These two new
Amazon series are legit bingeworthy.

**Swarm** - some twisted, fever dream like show. Good and different.

**Class of 07** - Endearing with an ensemble cast that worked quite well. Laid back, entertaining watch that produced quite a few laughs."
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"My Name (Netflix) - Just finished this great and criminally overlooked series yesterday! Nearly perfect action and mystery series. 

FROM (MGM+... formerly Epix) - Cool puzzle box of a series that will have you looking up Norse Runes and mythical creatures trying to figure out what the hell is going on. It's great for inspiring audience engagement and the subreddit is fun for looking at theories.

Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"You could argue that it has its flaws but I have been absolutely loving the new season of Party Down. 

The most recent episode with >!Henry tripping out on mai tais and peoples shirts had me cracking up!< 

I can't believe there's only two episodes left. Please watch it. I can't handle this show being cancelled again."
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,swarm might not be amazing but it‚Äôs so unique and different i love it
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"Watching second season of Slow Horses, so good!"
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,Class of 07. Is fucking great
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"**The Last of Us** S1 - great drama set in a horror / dystopian setting. Maizin is amazing. Pascual & Ramsey are gonna get the emmys for this, and hopefully Nick Offerman for guest star. 

**Only Murders in the Building** S1 & S2 - delightful binge. It has that movie magic twinkle, excited for S3 with Meryl Streep. This is a really brilliant move for Selena's career, as she plays a voice of a (true crime) generation character. 

**Alaska Daily** - bold opening. Hillary Swank headlines this but the rest of the cast hold their own and are quite charming. It's a decent newsroom drama in a time where trust on the media is contentious."
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"Almost done re-watching **The Peripheral** and finding it really rewarding. The writing is so tight, every scene and the dialogue is all there for a reason and ties together even if some of it connects much later on. I know the show has gotten pushback from fans of the book bc they changed much of the plot, but as someone who‚Äôs favorite writer is Gibson and favorite book is Neuromancer I‚Äôm telling you try giving it another shot with an open mind. They stay so true to the core characters (the Flynn-Burton dynamic is right out the book) and they pull off the world-building so well. The ideas are all there too. 

I also think they do a good job mirroring his writing style, one hallmark of which is to just drop you in running with no handholding whatsover. Fast paced with so much happening it can take time to understand how the threads fit, but all there for a reason. I suspect they knew that wouldn‚Äôt be for everyone and I think it‚Äôs pretty cool they did it anyway."
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"Well I finished the Last of Us. Never played the game but I more or less know the story and decided to give the show a shot and I loved it. Especially Joel and Ellie‚Äôs relationship in the series. 


After finishing that show, I decided to watch the first two Creed movies on HBO since I just watched the 3rd film two weeks ago and I loved both films."
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"Currently binging Regular show damn i miss the show.

I'm loving Perry Mason s2 so much i think its better than s1. Are you guys watching ?

Also unfortunately dropped Hello tomorrow, i wanted  it to be good but it lost me. Dropping Mando s3 until the season is done it has lost me ngl."
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"Watching **The Old Man**.

Only two episodes in, but I‚Äôm finding it a surprisingly refreshing take on the ‚Äúold guy has to return to his life of violence‚Äù genre. More nuanced than I expected, with good performances from the cast."
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"I have a busy weekend ahead! Watching The White Lotus for the first time. Almost done with season 1.

I'm intrigued by Swarm on Amazon Prime, so I'll watch that this weekend too.

Then Shadow and Bone and the latest two episodes of Abbott Elementary for something light!

(I'm also behind on The Good Doctor...but that's because I'm a completionist and I have to see the series through)"
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"Does anyone have recommendations for shows like Daisy Jones and The Six?

I like the whole drama / romance going between Daisy and Billy . Doesn't necessarily have to be about musicians just the drama."
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"The Other Two.
There‚Äôs two seasons with the third coming out in May and am mad I‚Äôm just hearing about it but glad it‚Äôs still going"
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"Oh man‚Ä¶ missing a Good Friday night premiere‚Ä¶ got spoiled by Sundays **The Last of Us**, Mondays **Perry Mason**, Tuesdays **Ted Lasso**, Wednesdays **Mandalorian**, Thursday‚Äôs **Shrinking**. Any Good Friday night must watch? 

Looking forward to **Happiness** and **Succession** on Sunday."
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"I have been re watching Fringe for the past month, felt like not too long ago I finished up Vox Machina, and my older brother just beat Horizon. So Lance Reddick has been brought up a lot. Really sad to hear, though I know I won't forget about him anytime soon"
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"Watching Extrapolations. Without spoiling anything, I'd rate it either 6 or 7 out of 10 so far. And its message about climate chane is roughly as subtle as a sledgehammer to the face, so if you find heavy handed morals off-putting it may not be the show for you. Though for this case there's a good argument the heavy handedness is justified."
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"5 episodes into S2 of Justified and I'm loving it! Highly recommend this show! 

I somehow gotta complete this before City Primeval arrives."
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"despite all the uncertainty that I feel about Swarm, it's very bingeable. 7.5/10"
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"**Swarm**

It took about two episodes to really hit with me it once it did I was all in. There‚Äôs  a tricky balancing act at play here considering the protagonist is so ‚Ä¶ complicated I guess would be the right word. It‚Äôs a revenge story where the audience is not on board with the revenge and yet we still( at least I did) have at least some sympathy for the main character.

It‚Äôs an interesting take on the para-social relationships that are becoming more and more common and how easy it is to obsess over seemingly disposable social media posts. An offhand remark becomes much bigger when the person reading it doesn‚Äôt have much else in terms of social interaction. Also, I just love how the celebrity was meant to be Beyonc√©, with barely any attempt to hide it. In fact, they just at kept adding details to make it even more obvious. 

Sure there‚Äôs some hand-wavy things and maybe there is some fat to cut but the performances are top notch and I think the touches of the surreal add a lot to dreamy vibe of the show."
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,Hey guys I finished banshee and person of interest as well as reached. All super good for my tastes. What should I watch next.
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"I finished season 2 of Shadow And Bone and sadly I didn't enjoy it as much as season 1. The production quality is still top notch, but the story really felt like it suffered from being split into so many POVs that didn't necessarily mesh"
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"**Watching**: *Daisy Jones and the Six* S.L, *Extrapolations* S.L, *The Mandalorian* S.3, *Party Down* S.3, *Perry Mason* S.2, *Rain Dogs* S.1, *Shrinking* S.1, & *Snowfall* S.6 

**Finished**: *The Last of Us* S.1 (**A**) & *Servant* S.4 (**B-**) 

**Dropped** (for now; will finish when I've got more time): *Dear Edward*, *Hello Tomorrow!*, *History of the World: Part II*, *Liasion*, & *Truth Be Told*"
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"I really enjoyed **Swarm.**  Darkly comedic and creepy, and really nails the obsessive stan behavior I've seen on social media."
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,I started watching Barry the other day. Just finished S2 E5 already. This show is legit incredible. A really dark comedy for those interested
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,**School Spirits** is a lot better than I expected. Mystery show where the detective is a murdered high school student. I was hooked right at the ending of episode 1.
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,Shadow and Bone season 2
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"Watched the new show on The CW, 'Gotham Knights'... it sucks. The network won't be the same this time next year.  I'm genuinely surprised they renewed 'All American'.

'Gotham Knights', 'Kung Fu', 'Walker: Independence', 'All American: Homecoming', 'Superman & Lois' and 'The Winchesters' are definitely getting canned.

'Riverdale', 'The Flash' and 'Nancy Drew' are ending after their next seasons.

The only other thing that might survive the death of scripted programming on The CW is 'Walker'."
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"What was that German/International scifi show that had some sort of aquatic alien intelligence and crab pandemic? The trailer was posted here awhile ago, but I forgot the title."
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"Would you all recommend Sucession or Ozark first?? I'm probably going to start one thus week, and I'm a bit indecisive on which one, lol"
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"Watching s2 of Ted Lasso and I love it. While watching the Emmys last year, without having seen s2 of Ted Lasso, I thought it was sacrilegious that Barry s3 lost to it. However, now that I've seen most of it, I can see why it won. I still think s3 of Barry is better, but this show/season is great without a doubt."
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"Just watched **The Last of Us** finale and there isn't really that much to say other than I loved it all. I guess the only downside is that some of the episodes are so incredibly good that the not-quite-as-good episodes feel bad in comparison, when they're really not. I thought episode three was emotionally devastating in the best way possible and I love when a show or movie has that much effect on me. For me it's worthy to be on the short list of 10 out of 10 shows. It does enough for me.

I also finally got around to watching all of **Ted Lasso**, which I had been putting off for a bit because I was ""saving it"". Like... I knew it was going to be good so I didn't want to rush it. I'm a bit weird that way. I'd put it alongside all of the other (fairly) recent feel-good comedies like Parks and Rec, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, The Good Place, Schitt's Creek, and Superstore. It's like 95% good vibes. I had only seen clips of it and I was a bit concerned the humor wasn't going to land for me. That was partially true. I didn't find it uproariously funny, but I found it humorous and had some good laughs. I found the ratio of story/drama to comedy similar to The Good Place, which totally works for me. On a personal note, I never really like Jason Sudeikis all that much, but I enjoy him much more as a relatable character than his normal kind-of-a-dick roles."
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,Absolutely loving Daisy Jones & The Six atm
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,Finished **The Americans** Season 1 and I understand the hype now. The quality already feels like Breaking Bad/The Sopranos tier. Just great writing/directing/acting across the board.

Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,Someone tell me how Extrapolations is
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"Currently watching

The Leftovers- having seen this recommended many times on here I finally gave it a shot. Through episode 3 so far with the last episode being the best. Honestly if I hadn‚Äôt read so many comments about how good this show is I‚Äôd give up. So far it‚Äôs extremely bleak and all the characters I could care less about. I‚Äôm hopeful that will change.

Abbot Elementary - up to date on the show. I find episodes hit or miss. It‚Äôs a quick show however and a nice cleanse after a leftovers episode.

Welcome to Wrexham- just generally enjoyable to watch. Reynolds and McElHenney are just comedy together.

Derry Girls - 2 episodes left and I‚Äôll be caught up. Love this show! Great comedy and cast. Definitely a recommend for anyone looking for a good short comedy.

Finished

Last of Us - loved this series. Felt at times it was rushed and could have really benefited from going to 10 epsiodes and building more with Joel and Ellie especially after episode 8. And was surprised how few scenes included Infected, especially in the back half.  Episode 1 and 3 are probably 2 of my favorite episodes of television ever.

Mad Men S6 - while still a great show I found season 6 to be not as enjoyable as previous seasons with less highs than the others.¬†

What We Do in the Shadows - every episode is good for some great laughs. Nandor is my MVP of the latest episode"
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"Droppin a show in surprised I've never seen mentioned here before. 

Mr. Mercedes.. has many things in common with a lot of the shows ppl mention here.

Its based on Stephen king material.

First season is very much a very good crime drama but as it goes on shit gets very weird.  It is king after all.. but very good crime / thriller with sci fi elements that play our later.

Think it was originally on peacock and no idea where to find if now other than the skull and crossbones route.

Either way pretty interesting show. Great cast . With enough wtf weird shit to keep you interested.

A bit like You + mr robot + any good detective show.

Cast is kinda low key but some excellent work gets done. Especially Brendan Gleeson"
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"Ok so I haven't seen any new 2023 series yet, but the releases so far are looking very promising. **These are what I have on my to-watch list**:

Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"The Stand 1994 or 2020, which one to watch?"
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"Just finished **The Consultant** on Amazon Prime.  Was very honestly sincerely surprised to see that it was based on a Bentley Little book; tried to get into him when he first started out and his writing was such an obvious and transparent aping of Stephen King's style that I gave up after two books:  ""The Town"" which had a boy jerking off in his sister's panties, and ""The Store"" which had a father fucking his daughter, and both with abrupt shitty endings, just like King.  I was so sure that by episode 3 we'd discover that Mama Sang while her Baby Yodeled down there, but fortunately the source material didn't seem to go that direction -- but the ending still sucked and was abrupt.  I honestly don't know why I voluntarily finished a show adapted from a third-tier King wannabe, but I'm glad to confirm and validate my previous criticisms of the author.

Also, in episode 4, the soundtrack that played during the timelapse of Waltz in the waiting area sounded so very suspiciously similar to [this bop by 9 Lazy 9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jrn-kwtEhUg) that I had to pause and look up the music credits.  Didn't see them listed, so it's either an oversight or the ""original music composer"" thought they could get away with a little motif plagiarism."
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"This week I have watched:

**Dark Winds** - what brought me to this series was, of course, Zahn McClarnon and I did enjoy his acting and a detective story on ass end of nowhere in Indian reservation seemed like a fascinating idea, but overall the series was all over the place. It seems like they had concepts for 5 seasons but decided to smash it all into one series of 6 episodes. Overall it was very cluttered and increasingly ridiculous. It also had some themes that seemed important, like native beliefs - especially around witchcraft, that went completely nowhere. Most egregious example of this is the character of the witch who, for no clear reason, was aligned with the bandits and she did not even have a single sentence to speak. Overall, at best it was mediocre. If it returns in S2 I will give it a chance, but if writers don't improve I will drop it.

**The Devil's Hour** - fascinating, weird and really fucking dark mini series with Peter Capaldi as a serial killer. It really stuck my vibe. Definitely recommend.

**The Consultant** - after learning that the show has Christoph Waltz as one of main characters I expected much more from it. I don't know the book it adapts so cannot comment on how faithful it is, but the show seemed very confused about its own story and did not seem to know what to do. They set up the mystery of Regus Patoff but did not really pursue it in any meaningful way and did not resolve it, they set up the theme of his corrupting influence and ruthless corporate politics but barely showed anything, they went for some themes of company doing illegal shit but never went anywhere with it or showed any consequences for those actions. Overall, I was disappointed."
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,Started OUTLAST on Netflix and wound up cranking through it in one day. A survival competition where people need to survive each other. Kind of shows the best and worst of human nature.
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,I haven't seen it mentioned on Reddit at all but there is a new Canadian series called *Shelved*. It's a bit like Superstore but it's the employees at a Library. It's only 2 episodes in so far but I've enjoyed them and think it has a lot of potential.
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"Just finished **The Legend of Korra** and it was pretty good. It had higher highs than the original **Avatar** but lower lows and lower mediums. Of all the widely beloved shows this more than most lends itself to a relaunch and adding more seasons. Simply a new Avatar is born and take it from there. Wonder why there are no new seasons given how popular the show is and how obsessed studios are with relaunching very popular ip.

Watched season one of **Vinland Saga** and it was great. Season two is so much worse. I feel cheated."
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"Any recs for a new show for my wife and I?

Most recently we‚Äôve watched:
The Morning Show
Curb Your Enthusiasm
Shameless (a rewatch for her)
Barry
Ozark (final season, watched all basically as it would get released.)

She watches way more TV than I do, it‚Äôs less my go-to medium, but I do like having something in rotation for us to share. She enjoys a lot of reality TV and the dramas or thrillers on Netflix. I‚Äôm open to those shows, but typically don‚Äôt gravitate towards them on my own. She prefers live action and contemporary, nothing really sci-fi or fantasy.

EDIT: Also looking to avoid anything with significant cancer storylines right now.

We have Netflix, Apple TV+, HBO Max, and Disney+ currently.

Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"While I like the new Quantum Leap, we've absolutely loved a similar show that was just put up on Amazon Prime:   The Pretender.   

It's an older 90s show, and super formulaic.  But man is it FUN and uplifting to watch.    Very similar to Quantum Leap in that it's a brand new situation every week, but still has a continuing background origin story.  It's really well done, and good seeing bad people brought to justice for once :P"
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,"Struggling to finish season 2 of Shadow and Bone. 

Don‚Äôt really remember the first season that well, but it didn‚Äôt seem so cheap back then. The plot is all over the place, the side romance stories are skipworthy, and edge lord vibe from some of the characters is making it hard to watch."
Are You Ready? Hey You Girl!,Swarm on Amazon is WILD & so good.
All Out!!,">Some of its most egregious plot points are even ignored whole cloth in Season 2, which stands as an improvement in almost every conceivable way ‚Äî the fact that Picard‚Äôs consciousness was transferred into a golem body, so as to save his life, at the end of that initial run is never once mentioned. With the precision of Chief O‚ÄôBrien locking onto a particularly tricky transporter pattern, new showrunners Akiva Goldsman and Terry Matalas have isolated what worked about Season 1 and what didn‚Äôt.

It sounds like they really listened to the criticism if they're straight up ignoring much of the bullshit from Season 1. Which sounds good. Generally this review sounds like its the most ""Trek"" show of all the stuff they put out in recent years. 

But I gotta be honest with you, burn me once, shame on you, burn me twice, shame on me. Meaning I'm actually reluctant to go all in again, only to have that rug pulled out from under me. 

I guess I'll wait for a bit. I've been burned with literally every Trek show they put out so far and I'm not in the mood for more nostalgia depression."

Man, I love Lower Decks. It's close to classic Trek. But also, Discovery has gotten leagues better than it used to be. The current season is actually halfway decent, although it's still not ""good"" by any stretch of the imagination. But that's almost entirely due to the amount of melodrama in the show. Every single episode someone has to cry and Michael is constantly whispering.....it's tiring. But it's still better than it used to be."
All Out!!,TNG and Voyager in particular are so episodic that to ignore a major point of character development almost feels like an homage.
All Out!!,"On the flip side, theres always a YouTube Channel that always claims the show is being canceled.  0 for 5 in their predictions."
All Out!!,What YOU want is not necessarily representative of what EVERYONE ELSE wants.
All Out!!,The more these shows change the more they stay the same.
All Out!!,[deleted]
All Out!!,">  That first season I don‚Äôt think there was a single shot where the camera was on him for more than two seconds at a time. 

I have to wonder who is upvoting this patently false nonsense."
All Out!!,commodore Oh
All Out!!,"It was so funny that they put Picard into an identical old man body, I mean shit if you're just making him a robot can't you at least make him forty years younger and in perfect health?"
All Out!!,"Or when Worf becomes disabled by some falling barrels.  They literally remove his spine, run a scan and re-insert it back into his back, done & done, no physical rehab needed, ""Hey wernt you crying to have the doctor take your life yesterday?"", ""BE GONE!!""."
All Out!!,Data and Yar same thing without the lizard babies.
All Out!!,"Show comes to an end after season 7.

""SEE, CANCELED!!!!!"""
All Out!!,"Shut up Admiral. It‚Äôs Jean-Luc Picard, you desk chair warmer! 

(If she had said it to Kirk he‚Äôd fire at Will) (Wheaton too)"
All Out!!,The same people who upvote all the other patently false nonsense about Trek.
All Out!!,You know they just wanted to make him Chris Pratt.
All Out!!,They already [did that](https://youtu.be/Yrst8gmd9Cw)
All Out!!,Effects and deep fake cost credits I guess.
All Out!!,"Hey, those barrels were enemies of the empire, and probably filled with murderous tribbles. They were WITHOUT honor."
All Out!!,Advances in medicine and bad script writers.
All Out!!,"And if you happen to live outside the US, where you can't get an HBO subscription?"
All Out!!,"Yeah, that'll work. "
All Out!!,"If HBO Now was available in Canada I would happily pay $15/mo, but I absolutely refuse to give in to the cable cartels that hold HBO hostage by bundling it with a cable package.  
"
All Out!!,"I live in Saigon, come at me bro!"
All Out!!,"I would get an HBO subscription but they don't offer it in my country without paying for a whole cable package. I'd like to give you money HBO, just give me a way!!"
All Out!!,"Nice try HBO. A complete waste of time, but nice try anyway. You can't stop the pirates (and no, I'm not one. I pay for my HBO subscription). 

I can't help but think this time and money could be better used in avenues that pursue or work towards global licensing. That is the only real solution to this problem. And that is besides the fact that some people just want shit for free and will not pay, regardless of how cheap it is or how easy to obtain."
All Out!!,Global licensing with one service for all content is the only way to efficiently combat piracy. There's no way I'm going to pay for 4+ different services to be able to watch the ~10 shows I want to watch. 
All Out!!,these scare tactics don't work
All Out!!,"Would love to...but not available in Australia.

So..until it is...

Hoist the black flag! 

"
All Out!!,HBO produces the most pirated shows in the world because they produce quality content that world wants to see. Why haven't they gone global like Netflix and started raking in the billions? Seems like a better way to combat piracy than this ineffective bullshit.
All Out!!,LOL good luck HBO!  It worked out for Metallica right?
All Out!!,Just allow me to pay for HBO Now and not have to spend a MINIMUM of $45 a month for fucking Foxtel Play (on which I would only watch GoT anyway since you can't watch new episodes of Silicon Valley on the Foxtel version of HBO) which is not even in HD  and lags like hell and I'll be happy to do it.
All Out!!,Psh. Comcast warns me all the time. They don't want the downloaders. 
All Out!!,"Putting an end to piracy is like trying to elastic band together water. You're never going to get it. 

Offering HBO GO in more countries will decrease the amount of piracy far more than empty threats like this will."
All Out!!,"Canada would like HBO Now please, okay thanks."
All Out!!,"I'd love to get an HBO Now subscription, HBO, except you signed a fucking exclusivity deal with Bell Media so we can't get nothing but jack and shit.

Like seriously. You want to curb piracy? Increase accessibility."
All Out!!,"I am in canada and do not have cable, you do not allow me to watch your shows in canada unless I have cable. So screw you."
All Out!!,HBO Now is 15 dollars a month. It's worth it. 
All Out!!,[deleted]
All Out!!,"Isp's are now analyzing data...and sending people emails saying ""not saying you did this but someone connected to your network downloaded this specific file"" so i dont know how piracy is still a problem in the USA. "
All Out!!,"I swear it was a few years ago that the producers were proudly saying that GoT was the most pirated show, indicating how popular it was.  It sounds like they've only just realized that that's actually bad for business."
All Out!!,HBO get a Netflix subscription! 
All Out!!,"Well it looks like it's working, at least for ""After the Thrones"" latest episode. A European friend told me he can't find it anywhere."
All Out!!,"lol, they make amazing shows but they can not figure out why so many people outside the US pirate.  "
All Out!!,"Based on the comments, I think HBO needs to figure out a way to internationally offer HBO Now.  "
All Out!!,Give us a way to watch and access your content then!
All Out!!,"[Yeah, that'll stop them HBO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27mB8verLK8)"
All Out!!,"I actually have access to HBOGo, but it always lags, so I torrent it because I want the highest quality when I watch Game of Thrones."
All Out!!,"I hope they won't go after streaming sites because being away from home for a few weeks on business, I couldn't get to watch last week's on Sky Atlantic and won't watch next Monday's on there either, plus I had to cancel the On Demand service on Sky+ due to high billing costs, meaning streaming sites are my only way to catch up."
All Out!!,Those are wasted money and effords. They could make a better use of their time if they tried to improve the quality and destribution of their services.
All Out!!,But what if you don't get home from work until a little after 9 and don't want to wait for it to be on demand until the next day and want to watch 15 mins late and don't have a dvr? And can just download it and watch it right then? With having an HBO sub
All Out!!,"I received a couple of these recently, and Charter came out with a $20 package with 16 channels plus HBO on a roku, so I jumped at it. "
All Out!!,"HBO encounters Pirate!

HBO uses Copyright Infringement Warning.

It was not very effective...."
All Out!!,"Great, sue the people who actually want to watch your product. Make the current season available to buy on iTunes and other services and the piracy numbers will drop."
All Out!!,Start prosecuting. It's the only way. Game of thrones costs a lot of money to produce. If you are not going to contribute by purchasing a subscription then don't watch. 
All Out!!,"Yeah, got my letter the other day "
All Out!!,Jokes on you that is why I route my server through a VPN.
All Out!!,So...what about people streaming it? Any way to track them down?
All Out!!,"lmao there aint shit you can do, sorry, if we want to keep pirating you can go stick it"
All Out!!,"Comcast offered me cable bundled with my internet after three years of no cable.  I told them no until they said, ""We'll give you HBO HD on  Demand and lower your monthly bill.""

When I got the box, I hooked it up and noticed I only had ABC, FOX, NBC, CBS, and HBO.  When I called they told me, ""Yes, that's our basic starter package.""  I said, ""No, that's just broadcast with HBO.""
I was told the rest of the cable channels would be extra and I honestly laughed at them and said, ""You gave me HBO.  That's all I really wanted, I'm fine with just having that.  I'd never watch the other channels anyways.""

It feels good to be able to legally watch Thrones.  Up until now I've simply purchased the season Blu Rays on release day every year to make up for torrenting, but now I don't even have to worry about feeling bad.

Now as for the 748 OTHER series that I stream via various means, I feel a LITTLE bad."
All Out!!,"Have a subscription, still download the show. Plex has a much more friendly interface on the roku than HBO."
All Out!!,"How much is an HBO subscription? If it's reasonably-priced (less than $10/month), I may sign up."
All Out!!,If only all the people who steal HBO would just pay a nominal amount. 
All Out!!,They are going to announce to the world how to get it for free. Good luck. 
All Out!!,"I have an HBO subscription at the moment, got the free first month introductory offer and I still pirate the show because the image quality on HBO's streaming system is so completely shitty compared to the way superior offering of crisp 1080p rips. I don't plan on renewing my subscription."
All Out!!,"lol torrents. Get a newsgroup provider that doesn't keep records and switch to NZBs.

/r/cordcutters has some great guides."
All Out!!,[deleted]
All Out!!,Otherwise the would-be pirates will discover just how boring this season is so far.
All Out!!,"IF THEY COULD AFFORD YOUR BULLSHIT SERVICES THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO PIRATE, HBO!  God the sheer stupidity of these asshats is mind-bending o.O "
All Out!!,Damn it feels good to be on a private tracker. 
All Out!!,I have an HBO now subscription and was thoroughly annoyed I couldn't access it traveling abroad in Europe this week. Faults on them really.
All Out!!,"I have HBO Nordic in Norway. their UI is shit compared to Netflix, but I get the new GoT episode at the same time as it airs.(3am)"
All Out!!,In Canada it's either get cable and pay 20 more dollars for the channel or nothing (legally speaking). 
All Out!!,For real. I live in Japan and would happily pay for HBOGo if I could. I have no choice but to pirate. It really silly. Netflix is here and they don't even need to slap on subtitles at the outset or localize. In a digital age it's money left on the table.
All Out!!,[removed]
All Out!!,I live in canada and i still got the piracy warning telling me to get the HBO subscription...so i dont know if that was their way of telling me to move to the states or just a slap in the face 
All Out!!,"To be fair, most countries have Game of Thrones airing simultanouesly with US and/or the day after since a few years. It may be on overpriced services but it exists."
All Out!!,Vpn or usenet
All Out!!,hbo isn't only available in the us.
All Out!!,*Finger wagging intesifies.*
All Out!!,"Repeat ultimatum in an even firmer tone of voice.  Add the words ""or else."""
All Out!!,"How does it work with cable in Canada? I don't even bother with cable so I have no idea, but can't you just add HBO now since they aren't allowed to do bundles any more?"
All Out!!,"Yeah, like what are they going do? Send you to Vietnam?!?!"
All Out!!,"Saigon isn't part of the seven kingdoms, it's a free city, where slavery is allowed."
All Out!!,HBO Now doesn't work?
All Out!!,"> I'd like to give you money HBO, just give me a way!

They have. You just don't like it."
All Out!!,It's the war on drugs all over again tbh.
All Out!!,"Combatting piracy isn't actually very useful if it involves giving up 90% of your revenue which is more than piracy costs.

If you're not going to subscribe to multiple services you might have to accept that you're not a very good customer and therefore services aren't going to aim stuff at you."
All Out!!,"Because the money they make off of regional licensing is probably greater than the income from global subscriptions.

[They already make $1.6 billion a year in international licensing fees. ](http://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2014/07/01/sustained-demand-for-hbos-original-programming-drives-subscription-fee-growth-to-benefit-tw/)

[HBO Now has been a disappointment for the company](https://www.yahoo.com/tech/hbo-now-big-disappointment-why-004036213.html). There's probably not a whole lot of evidence to show that transitioning from their current model would make a ton of sense. "
All Out!!,"Because Sky in Europe offered them a massive wodge of cash for multiple territories for multiple years. And they signed it. 

It might have looked like a great deal at the time as they didn't have the resource to roll out web platforms globally, but in 3 years time everyone will be well established with their platforms and HBO will be greatly behind.

TL:DR - Europe is balls up cos of a big deal they signed."
All Out!!,"But I can actually buy Metallica's products on day one. Many, many countries have no options bar to download GoT."
Marriage Contract,Could be one of his other Scientology girlfriends like Nazanin Boniadi.
Marriage Contract,Many [interviewers have brought this up already](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PwE1QNjHZA&t=0m56s). They just like to joke that it's related but everyone know's it is
Marriage Contract,"Yea this is definitely  a Scientology gimmick show, and surprisingly not as trashy as i expected for a show on E!.  I dont watch it when it live but its worth hitting up for some drama during the week.  "
Marriage Contract,Why is OP advertising it like a new show? It's on it's second season.
Marriage Contract,"I love that that's plural. Like, he has so many Scientology girlfriends that it's impractical to list them all right now."
Marriage Contract,I just discovered it. I work the night shift. It was a commercial. I got curious. I never indicated it was new. I indicated that it made me think about Scientology and those in the limelight. @ me next time and ask me directly. 
Marriage Contract,"Ah that makes sense, I didn't really see more than a summary in your post.

I watched the first few episodes of the first season, it seemed interesting enough. What I hear from the second season it's getting deeper into the institute. It's one of the shows on my list that I definitely need to finish though."
Marriage Contract,[deleted]
Marriage Contract,It's complicated.
Marriage Contract,"So basically, Get Shorty (the TV series)

Or Ray Donovan (to a degree)"
Marriage Contract,"While I def would want more with these characters, I just don't see a TV show having this kind of flair for 8 episodes while retaining its glee, production value, star power."
Marriage Contract,I wouldn't change a frame of that film. It's perfection.
Marriage Contract,If you enjoyed this or at least wanted to then I definitely recommend the graphic novel ‚ÄúThe Fade Out‚Äù.
Marriage Contract,I would‚Äôve preferred a different tone and for the stories to feel less like it were an anthology series. I had in mind a Thick of It/In the Loop tone with a Malcolm Tucker like character trying to keep a troubled production together and on schedule/budget.
Marriage Contract,"Tonally, it's not the same thing at all, but have you watched Amazon Studios' The Last Tycoon? Set a few decades before ""Hail, Caesar"" and considerably more sombre, but still an interesting series.

There was also a 1976 movie, famously the only film to feature Robert De Niro and Jack Nicholson onscreen together."
Marriage Contract,I would've worked much better had it been funny.
Marriage Contract,Every film would work better as a television series.
Marriage Contract,Excellent idea.  I have always thought that at it‚Äôs current length it is a slog. And i am a devote Coenite.  It needed to trimmed or lengthened.
Marriage Contract,"I really love this movie but yeah, a serie would be even better. Would it weeeeeere so simple"
Marriage Contract,Would that it T'WERE so simple.
Marriage Contract,but good.       ^^^^^^^^^/s
Marriage Contract,I remember when it came out the discussion thread was very very luke warm and I stand by my belief that with a bit of time that movie will stand as one of the Comes best.
Marriage Contract,The Fade Out is phenomenal.
Marriage Contract,Yep saw the movie in the theater and only remember one scene. It's the top comment so it's the only scene anyone else remembers too.
Marriage Contract,"You‚Äôre getting downvoted, but I tend to agree. I‚Äôll always take a few episodes of filler in exchange for getting a better picture of who the characters are."
Marriage Contract,"Trippingly, trippingly!"
Marriage Contract,Shut that whore mouth of yours.  Let people think you have some sense.
Marriage Contract,Yeah I was surprised by how much people hated it because I loved it out of the gate and scenes like *Would that it were so simple* and the priests/rabbi seem like instant classic moments.
Marriage Contract,"It's demonstrably false lol, no one would say the Black Narcissus TV series is better than the Powell and Pressburger movie."
Marriage Contract,Would that it were so simple trippingly.
Marriage Contract,"God has no son! He's a bachelor, and very angry."
Marriage Contract,"Originally Joey's character was written as much more of a horndog who was going to constantly hit on all three women. LeBlanc thought it was a mistake as none of them would be friends with a guy who is always being a creep. It's why he never dated ""in the circle"" until the Rachel crush towards the end of the series. 

It also led to one of my favourite jokes when [they're drunk in Vegas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jW6v9OzWq34)."
Marriage Contract,I loved the scene when Phoebe tells Joey the futures of all the friends based on her psychic powers and according to her Ross will go out in a murder/suicide.
Marriage Contract,"Ross gets a bad wrap because we, the audience, are told repeatedly and not shown that Ross is sweet and caring. To be blunt, he was written as insecure and paranoid and there is no surprise they broke up.

It's not until after they break up that you see some of what they are saying (e.g. the time he stays to help Rachel rather than appear on a tv spot).

He suffers because a lot of the humour around his character is based around his nerdiness and social awkwardness. 

Plus, we were on a break / three divorces etc are not very sympathetic plot points to hang his character on.

Finally, in the last few seasons, when he is able joke about his serial divorcing, does he feel like a sympathetic character.

Also, by this point, all the girls have somewhat flanderized (the episode where Monica thinks the cleaner has stolen her clothes is just dumb), so I think any of the guys look great by comparison."
Marriage Contract,Pretty much every relationship in that show is healthier than Ross and Rachel's.
Marriage Contract,"I read somewhere that Friends was originally supposed to be a show about Ross and Rachael, with the other 4 as background characters.  Yawn. IMO, it would have been a failure. The 6 work perfectly as an ensemble. I think Joey and Phoebe deliver the most laughs."
Marriage Contract,"Lisa Kudrow is such a fantastic actress. If anyone hasn't seen it, you should definitely check out her HBO series 'The Comeback'. Her performance is absolutely brilliant. It's one of my all-time favorite shows."
Marriage Contract,"THIS IS WHAT I'M HERE FOR üëè

honestly i'm glad it's not cannon (joey/phoebe) because then it's like the whole group would have hooked up at some point, and I like that they were a great example of platonic friendships being intimate. supportive, and truly caring. 

however, yes, the show is def more interesting when you consider them actually having hooked up. maybs they could have thrown some teasers in there, and laid off rachel/Ross for a bit, but hey, that's how it goes. excellent discussion topic! I think I could easily write an essay on this üòÖ"
Marriage Contract,"even though Ross & Rachel were my least favorite characters of the group, i liked them when they were NOT together as a couple. when they had the baby, they (especially Rachel) became completely insufferable/unwatchable.  

Phoebe & Joey were my top faves followed by Monica & Chandler. Ross in the first 3 or 4 seasons was such a douche yet in the seasons where he moved into the ""fat neighbor's"" apartment Ross was really really funny (it helps that he was single during that part of the show)."
Marriage Contract,"My favorite relation was Chandler and Monica. It was the most realistic show on the show. Two slightly older people who have been friends for a long time, decide instead of hitting their heads againist the wall at this point, to give themselves a shot. That happens a lot."
Marriage Contract,"I still think it was lame that Rachel gave up an amazing career opportunity in Paris right before she took off just to be with Ross. Like after all that drama, he should have picked his ass up and moved to Paris to be with her if he was really serious about being with her."
Marriage Contract,I'm a very casual watcher of Friends but I've seen a ton of syndication episodes. I always thought that the short relationship between Joey and Rachel seemed cute and genuine and was surprised when I went online and saw that pretty much everyone hated it. Ross and Rachel seemed way too forced to me.
Marriage Contract,Ross and Rachael should have pretty much been done after that first break up. Everything else was trying to playoff something that was popular. The ending where they just kinda randomally decided they wanted to be together again to end the show felt tacked on to give the fan service ending
Marriage Contract,Show's been off the air 15 years and people are only now realizing Ross and Rachel relationship is ridiculous. Couple therapists have nice days ahead
Marriage Contract,20 year old take
Marriage Contract,"For me the best relationship was Monica and Chandler. They clicked so well once together and yet, even on repeat viewings the idea still seems like it wouldn't work out. But it was gold for both characters and saved them keeping down the path of being one note and caricatures.

Plus it gave me [one of my all time fav episodes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDISf8Rurv0). 

However I do admit, in later seasons, with all the baggage, Ross and Rachel became quite funny sniping back and forth at one and other lol. 

As for Joey and Phoebe, they are just the casual/quirky/fun friends of the group and yet ironically are actually more emotionally mature than the other 4, despite their often child-like simplicity."
Marriage Contract,"In one of the first episodes Ross and Phoebe almost hook up at the coffee place, before it was a coffee place and was a bar. Now that would have been a hilarious couple. OCD Hyperchrondiac Ross with Hippie masseuse Phoebe."
Marriage Contract,">honestly the show is more satisfying if you believe Joey and Phoebe were secretly hooking up

God I hate this so much. Why are we so fixated on relationships needing to be romantic or sexual in order to be validated? Phoebe and Joey have a beautiful, healthy, entertaining friendship. That stands on its own. It's perfectly ok, normal, and wonderful for two people to have a great platonic relationship and nothing more. 

Joey and Phoebe do not need to be secretly sleeping together.
Jonathan and Antoni do not need to be secretly dating.
John and Sherlock do not need to be secretly gay.

I could go on and on, but we have a problem. Hell, there are people out there trying to put *Elsa and Anna* together. Our society is suffering when we have to fetishize any relationship as if it's less valuable or fake if it's not romantic or sexual. It's part of why ""the friend zone"" is a thing,  it's a part of why people feel so isolated. 

We need more examples of good nonsexual relationships in the media. We need to quit cheapening the ones we get."
Marriage Contract,One of my favorite scenes with Joey and Phoebe was when Phoebe and Chandler were playing chicken with each other in who will take the flirting the furthest.   Joey then unbuttons Phoebe's shirt in one swift move so Chandler will get distracted
Marriage Contract,I loved Joey and Phoebe. I always liked the idea that they were secretly having an affair behind everyone‚Äôs back.
Marriage Contract,"https://youtu.be/8ICuaPYb74c   
     
Op I think you might be the only one who sees it ""secretly""."
Marriage Contract,"Joey was always my favorite of the Friends, and hold on to your butts for an unpopular opinion: His spin-off show, Joey, is actually pretty good, and he's the only Friend who I could see having his own show."
Marriage Contract,"I mean...I think there‚Äôs a full circle effect in that Ross and Rachel are both bad people and kind of deserve each other. They‚Äôve both lied to each other, cheated, interfered in each other‚Äôs happy relationships, and just been major dicks to the rest of the group.

In the end they should be together not because they‚Äôre perfect for each other, but because they‚Äôre too terrible for anyone else.

But yeah, Joey and Phoebe are awesome and I wish that had happened."
Marriage Contract,"Phoebe is one of the more grounded people in that show. She acts like she hasn't a clue but she 'has her shit sorted' more than the the rest (except Ross, maybe)."
Marriage Contract,"> Ross and Monica were each others' first kisses

This is something that I totally had forgotten about those two. Also, ew who though that would be funny and/or cute?"
Marriage Contract,"I never understood Ross

It seemed like a fantasy the writers had. 

Rachel was very attractive, living in NYC. She would have incredibly attractive and interesting guys asking her out all the time. 

Yet, [Ross's competition](https://youtu.be/vCFLGB3eqcI?t=33) were always these oddball guys who by comparison made Ross look better. But she wouldn't be dating guys like that anyway. 

Idk, it just seemed like shy guy's fantasy that a meek nerd who simply because HE CARED ALOT and would ""treat her well"" would somehow convince a hot woman to go out with him. 

Its just fantasy."
Marriage Contract,"not sure if anyone else mentioned this, but:

Early in the show's run, Joey had a fling with Ursula (Phoebe's self-absorbed identical twin). He fell for her kinda hard, but Ursula being Ursula, she didn't want a long-term commitment, and she didn't have the decency to say so.

So... Pheebs met Joey at the cafe, posing as Ursula, and basically broke it off with him on Ursula's behalf, and with more kindness & class than Ursula could ever manage. Joey asks if he can give her a goodbye kiss and Phoebe says, sure. Joey laid one on her & afterward Phoebe's facial expression was like ""HUBBA HUBBA"""
Marriage Contract,I always assumed they were supposed to end up together but then they had to setup the Joey spinoff so they abandoned it
Marriage Contract,Why didn't Ross as the largest Friend not simply eat all the other Friends?
Marriage Contract,"I always thought she was the hottest, yet they focused on Monica and Rachel the most in the early seasons."
Marriage Contract,">>Although... and I realize this is the kind of observation that would only occur to the mind of an eternal being, how did they afford that apartment? A waitress and a chef with those Manhattan real estate prices?"
Marriage Contract,"Joey and Phoebe were always my faves. Chandler's sweet and again, I loved his relationship with Joey, but Monica, Ross and Rachel were just dull and annoying."
Marriage Contract,Chandler and phoebe was the original idea. But they had to add  other people since thesentwo never dated and would fail after the pilotbepisode. Which explains why the kept changing apartments.
Marriage Contract,"Joey I think is the only character in the show who is pretty much pure. Other than sleeping around and not calling women back, he never really puts a foot wrong with the people he really cares about. He tells his mother about his father's cheating to try and help her. He stands up against his best friend for his sister. He dotes on Phoebe as you've mentioned and is just generally a good dude. He has flaws like every other character sure, but the other characters do far more dickish things throughout the show."
Marriage Contract,"Honestly Ross and his hot cousin were a better couple than Ross and Rachel, as least if they got together everyone would finally acknowledge how fucked up ross is."
Marriage Contract,"Well, tbh, the Ross/Rachel thing annoyed me because Ross sucked. He was just a nebbishy douchebag. He was like a grown version of Kyle‚Äôs cousin from South Park."
Marriage Contract,"If you wanna look 19, you got to do something about your eyes."
Marriage Contract,Fried stuff w cheese
Marriage Contract,"Joey is way out of her league and not attracted to her, that's why they can be friends"
Marriage Contract,I always found Phoebe the most attractive of all the Friends and Joey the most fun.
Marriage Contract,Was*
Marriage Contract,"I'm on my 18th-ish rewatch of the series (RIP Friends on Netflix) and Joey is by far the best friend. I used to write him off as the loveable goofball lady's man (which he still is) but he's the only one that isn't lying to the rest of the group or keeping secrets unless one or all of the rest are forcing him to. He's also the most selfless of the gang. The episode with the lottery is a perfect testament to this. You assume he wishes for the group to win the lotto when he pulls the wishbone but he actually was wishing for Chandler to get the job he really wanted. I've seen that episode so many times but it really clicked how good of a friend he is watching that again last week. Not gonna lie, I teared up a little."
Marriage Contract,"Rachel just had a lot of growing up
To do. She grew up an entitled rich girl and didn‚Äôt know how to be normal. She had the constant internal struggle of learning how to assert herself without alienating people who support her. This all began when she had an epiphany and left Barry at the altar because she didn‚Äôt love him. Her feelings for Ross were complicated and that scared her. Plus they had a history, which made it confusing.

Ross had a failed marriage with a lesbian who has custody of his son. He wants to stand for himself too. But he also desperately craves the marital life that was robbed from him. So this leads him into messy situations, like with Emily. She was controlling, but he went along with it because he wanted that. 

And let‚Äôs not forget the writers were intentionally splitting them up for drama. But I think Ross and Rachel will make it work, thry just had a lot of baggage going into it."
Marriage Contract,"In all honesty, that relationship is ridiculous. And calling Ross a nice guy? [He sucks donkey balls.](http://www.collegehumor.com/post/7054273/8-reasons-ross-from-friends-was-a-massive-asshole) Ross is a horrible human being."
Marriage Contract,"All of the relationships in this show suck.  Relationship decisions were made based on not wanting to hire on other permanent actors and clearly nothing else.  Otherwise, we'd have seen Chandler end up with Janice, Monica with Richard, Ross with Emily, and Rachel..no idea, all of her relationships were shallow, which is fitting for her character.  The only reason Phoebe ended up marrying outside of the group was because the show was ending anyway."
Marriage Contract,"> And don't even get back together until the last 5 minutes of the show?

Dude, spoilers?"
Marriage Contract,Straight facts
Marriage Contract,"Sorry OP because this isn't really about what you posted but does anyone else think Joey is a loser.

Near the beginning all of the friends are in a similar situation of figuring out life. All of them barring Joey move forward either in career or relationships or both.

While Joey is pretty much the same. If anything he's in a worse position as he's 10 years older. He's never been in a serious relationship and has barely had any serious jobs to speak of."
Marriage Contract,[deleted]
Marriage Contract,"Maybe a controversial opinion. But I always found Joey funnier when he wasn't hitting up women, and was far more sweeter. So he made the right call."

Marriage Contract,"I agree, that joke was amazing, one of the best character moments for joey ‚Ä¶but did you intentionally look for the worst quality version of it?"
Marriage Contract,"The whole Joey/Rachel thing was obvious that the writers were just inventing whatever could help fill episodes for the last season or two. They kept getting ridiculous renewal contracts, the series went on way too long."
Marriage Contract,"Pretty sure friends is based on a BBC show called coupling. The Joey character in that show is way more of a horndog. It's actually a much better, more adult version of friends."
Marriage Contract,I'd love to watch a clip of that with the laugh track edited out.
Marriage Contract,Would be funny if they ever do a friends reunion move and every thing that Phoebe said would happen actually ends up happening.
Marriage Contract,[deleted]
Marriage Contract,We were on a break!!!
Marriage Contract,"I mean, honestly, if you ever watch the show critically from the beginning... All the Friends are kind of awful in funny ways. That's where the comedy comes from. But Ross really is the worst. Almost everything leading up to them going ""on a break"" was Ross's fault.

I could maybe cut him some slack for sleeping with the hot copyshop girl, but that only happened because he flipped out when Rachel was confiding in her friend that Ross was so insanely jealous of. He was jealous, he didn't trust Rachel, he ignored her wishes, he smothered her, he got in the way of her career after being told how important it is to her, disrespected her.

Ugh. Sorry. I just rewatched it recently after not having seen it for years and maybe ""woke"" twitter got to me or something, but good god is Ross an assmunch."
Marriage Contract,Nah Chandler and Joey is the best duo
Marriage Contract,"I think they're all funny in their own ways..  Ross is the most talented of the guys though IMHO. His humour is all in facial expressions and mannerisms/physical humor. Joey is in your face and Chandler just spits one liners. But they all add a different element which makes it work so well.

But yea I've always loved the relationship between Joey and Phoebe."
Marriage Contract,If you think people were not tuning in at the time because of Ross and Rachel you are fooling yourself.
Marriage Contract,"I think it was supposed to focus on four friends, with Phoebe and Chandler as supporting characters. [Link](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/tv/g13098604/friends-tv-show-facts-trivia/) 

Regardless though, I agree all six characters are needed for this to work!!! And OP, I honestly really liked that P and J were friends and didn't end up together. For one, I really like Paul Rudd as her husband, and I think it was relatable for Joey to be single as his friends were in relationships. At least for me"
Marriage Contract,Ross is easily the funniest
Marriage Contract,"Really? I heard that it was originally not supposed to be about Ross & Rachel at all, but then that storyline came out."
Marriage Contract,Joey and Monica was the original idea I think.
Marriage Contract,"Well that's interesting, because I read that Monica was supposed to be the main character with the other 5 being supporting characters. And it is abundantly obvious that this is what they were going for at the beginning of the series."
Marriage Contract,That's probably because friends is based on this BBC show where the Ross and Rachel characters are the main ones.
Marriage Contract,That show's a goddamned masterpiece
Marriage Contract,"It‚Äôs so good, but harder to watch than Scott‚Äôs Tots"
All About the Washingtons,"Literally never heard of this till today.I can't be the only one, I'm sure that's got something to do with it hah"
All About the Washingtons,*unexpected*
All About the Washingtons,"Not surprising, none of the cast members had any comedic timing. "
All About the Washingtons,It was weird having grown up watching Runs House and then seeing a fictionalised version of that show. 
All About the Washingtons,It was for the best. No one asked for this.
All About the Washingtons,We all saw this coming. haha
All About the Washingtons,"I hadn't heard of it but saw it mentioned on the side of this a week or so back.

I actually googled it and *still* can't tell you what its about or what type of show it is"
All About the Washingtons,"I watch multiple hours of Netflix per day and browse through all their categories way too much, and I have never once stumbled on this show. Never even heard of it."
All About the Washingtons,Lmao this looks terrible
All About the Washingtons,"Wowser hadn‚Äôt heard of this until now, but reading the description, it sounds like a train wreck "
All About the Washingtons,"I would 1000% prefer Netflix airing Run's House. I'm watching it right now, and Run should stick to reality...not acting. haha

But I'm still gonna watch all of it because I try to support black sitcoms. So far, I much prefer Marlon...take that however you'd like."
All About the Washingtons,I saw the trailer it's just Run's house with different kids also they're acting this time and are not very good at it. 
All About the Washingtons,"Update: around episode 7, I kinda started to enjoy it."
All About the Washingtons,"This looks really bad. It was supposed to air on ABC I think, but still. Yikes."
All About the Washingtons,Jeezus...
All About the Washingtons,"Succession, Succession, Succession!!"
All About the Washingtons,Daisy Jones and the Six and Swarm look exciting.
All About the Washingtons,The Mandolorian and Ted Lasso
All About the Washingtons,Attack on Titan
All About the Washingtons,"Ted Lasso, Succession, and any news about Severance."
All About the Washingtons,Part 2 of The Glory.
All About the Washingtons,"Yellowjackets, Ted Lasso, Mandalorian, Succession, and Big Brother Canada!"
All About the Washingtons,"I'm really looking forward to The Fall of the House of Usher.

I've enjoyed all of Mike Flanagan's Netflix mini-series (except The Midnight Club, which I haven't seen yet). Midnight Mass was especially good, with some very thoughtful and thought-provoking dialog regarding the nature of sin, guilt, and death."
All About the Washingtons,"Mando, Ted Lasso, Shadow and Bone, Sanditon, Survivor, Doogie Kalikimeha, and I am intrigued by, but not too hopeful for True Lies."
All About the Washingtons,Only time yellowjackets and top chef have ever been together in a sentence lol
All About the Washingtons,"From this group, I am really looking forward to ***Perry Mason***.  The lead actor is one of my favorites (The Americans), and I thought they did a solid job with the character."
All About the Washingtons,& Ted Lasso!!!
All About the Washingtons,"shadow and bones, and the mandalorian"
All About the Washingtons,Yellowjackets is a big one for me.  Ted Lasso and Mandalorian and MLB baseball are the others
All About the Washingtons,History of the World pt 2!!!!
All About the Washingtons,I‚Äôm a big sucker for Justin Theroux and political scandal so I‚Äôm very much looking forward to White House Plumbers on HBO later next month
All About the Washingtons,MLB Opening Day March 30th! Every team is playing on opening day this year
All About the Washingtons,"Succession far, far above anything else coming out in the same period"
All About the Washingtons,Party Down Revival
All About the Washingtons,I think You is by far the fucking dumbest TV show I've ever seen and yet I can't stop watching. I love to hate it.
All About the Washingtons,Perry Mason was surprisingly good.  Looking forward to Season 2.  Yellowjackets was great too.
All About the Washingtons,"Daisy Jones and the Six and Succession

I was excited for ‚ÄúYou‚Äù but Part 1 was boring compared to season 3 so I‚Äôll probably still watch it but I‚Äôm less excited for it"
All About the Washingtons,"The new season of Mandalorian, Shadow and Bone and Ted Lasso. SO MANY NEW THINGS IN MARCH"
All About the Washingtons,Survivor
All About the Washingtons,Rabbit hole
All About the Washingtons,"Uh, like, yeah- fuck you OP. I mean, uh, succession."
All About the Washingtons,"Yellowjackets, Succession and Mandalorian"
All About the Washingtons,"* Succession.
* Yellowjackets.
* Lucky Hank."
All About the Washingtons,There is Succession and then everything else.
All About the Washingtons,Yes for Perry Mason!! I wasn't sure it was coming back since it's been so long since season 1 came out.
All About the Washingtons,Attack on Titan Season 4 The Final Season Part 3 Segment A or wherever we're at by now
All About the Washingtons,"I don't watch any of those... I considered Perry Mason but just never really bothered, I hadn't heard of Yellowjackets until it was halfway done I think but I'll probably watch it eventually.

There's a few things starting in March but I'm most looking forward to Ted Lasso... but I'll also be watching Superman & Lois, Shadow and Bone, Sanditon and The Mandalorian. 

I'm actually more looking forward to April with season premieres of Schmigadoon, Single Drunk Female, From and The Afterparty... and whenever the final season of Endeavour starts on PBS, hopefully won't be too long."
All About the Washingtons,So hyped with top chef and Ted lasso
All About the Washingtons,Yellowjackets! Ready for the cannibalism
All About the Washingtons,Barry
All About the Washingtons,How is Yellow Jackets? Been on my list to watch just haven‚Äôt had the chance to start it
All About the Washingtons,So looking forward to Severance but I am so worried that it won't be as good as the first season. That final episode had me literally on the edge of my seat.
All About the Washingtons,I'm excited for whenever S2 of Severance will happen.
All About the Washingtons,"Succession first of all so much wait coming to over 
Kendall and shiv they gone rock the company üòÇ

Then you season 4 part 2 gone be a epic i have seen the trailer look so hyped up i want to know next move of joe 

Yellowjackets i have not seen but gone watch in this week 
Season 2 will be good as per review of season 1."
All About the Washingtons,">Yellowjackets Season 2:  **Showtime**

showtime's gonna milk thing to death, aren't they?"
All About the Washingtons,"yellowjackets? woke crap no thanks

Perry mason season 1 was terrible with this stupid drama shit. so i do not have high hopes for season 2.

Love top chef? why the fuck would i want to watch a show about cooking? i hate cooking myself so no thanks.

never watched you, but seems another of those oh i feel so sorry for the main character kind of bullshit, i wonder how he will survive all this.

in other words i have completely different taste then you. i mean i have good taste and you do not :)

what i am looking for is succession, shadow and bones season 2. Mandalorian, ted lasso,  swarm"
All About the Washingtons,"Attack on Titan, Yellowjackets, You S4 pt.2"
All About the Washingtons,"I have not watched ""The Last of Us"", I've been waiting for the whole season to be out, to be able to binge watch it all at once!"
All About the Washingtons,"Yellowjacket‚Äôs and succession
Tried really hard to like perry Mason but felt it was a total drag"
All About the Washingtons, Top chef!
All About the Washingtons,God damnit. Yellowjackets can not be coming out. I have accomplished nothing...
All About the Washingtons,"Yeah I hope Top Chef ends up being good. I just don‚Äôt see how any of them can ever beat Buddha, he‚Äôs not only the most dominant Top Chef competitor basically ever save for one or two, he's also had the most recent experience."
All About the Washingtons,Succession and Perry Mason. Loved the first season
All About the Washingtons,"March is pretty stacked, honestly. Most looking forward to *Succession*, *The White House Plumbers*, *Perry Mason*, *Yellowjackets*, and *The Mandalorian* (among quite a few others)."
All About the Washingtons,"So much more than that.

Probably most excited for mando.. yellowjackets.. succession ..shadow and bone..and Perry Mason...and You.. tho this season has been a bit ridiculous and the ""eat the rich"" undercurrent was not as subtle as normal..not as good as other seasons but still great.

There is a large amount of great shows in season now that are all headed towards the end. Was kinda worried. Didnt realize this much stuff was about to drop."
All About the Washingtons,All bangers all the time
All About the Washingtons,Fuck off!
All About the Washingtons,If it had to be said so it be...so it is.
All About the Washingtons,My bruh
All About the Washingtons,Where do I watch this at
All About the Washingtons,Ooww i almost forgot Ted Lasso
All About the Washingtons,"My son is so excited about Mandolorian!

All About the Washingtons,[deleted]
All About the Washingtons,From what I've seen filming should be wrapping up end of May
All About the Washingtons,"‚úîÔ∏è

I really need to start on ""Succession"" and ""Severance;"" they both get such excellent audience and critical raves"
All About the Washingtons,Don't think there is more severance until 2024.
All About the Washingtons,"When i finished the first part like 2 weeks ago, I thought it was really good but not amazing. but since then i couldnt stop thinking about how i need more. excited for march 10th"
All About the Washingtons,"Completely agree with your assessment of ""Midnight Mass;"" loved that show


Heard mixed things about ""Midnight Club,"" apparently it's from YA fiction & aimed at teens but sometimes that works out ok, guess will have to check out to see for self"
All About the Washingtons,"""On today's quickfire challenge, you are to hunt, clean, and cook a rabbit dish. In your stations you will find scrap metal salvaged from a plane crash. These will be the only tools at your disposal. The dish you will prepare should be appropriate for a Michelin star restaurant. Tom, release the wolves."""
All About the Washingtons,I feel like this show has zero hype and I just loved it. There was a Carnivale vibe to it. So well done.
All About the Washingtons,World. Baseball. Classic.
All About the Washingtons,"Hell yes, I'm so excited to hear about this happening."
All About the Washingtons,"Didn't know about this; I'm a big fan of a lot of his work, too, and my sister got me HBO Max for my birthday...thanks for the heads-up!"
All About the Washingtons,Yay! ‚öæüèÉ
All About the Washingtons,You know the first ep is out already? It's good!!
All About the Washingtons,"‚úîÔ∏è‚úîÔ∏è‚úîÔ∏è

I'm really looking forward to both. The art direction, sets, & costume design on ""Perry"" are remarkable üî•

I've read the writers on Yellowjackets promising big reveals this season as per the ""who is this cult?""  & ""cannibalism--did they or didn't they?"" questions"
All About the Washingtons,"I'm also excited about ""From.""

Give ""Perry Mason"" a chance, it's very well done. 


As others have said, if you're from a certain Riot Grrl or Gen X generation you will probably love ""Yellowjackets.""

I've been curious about the new ""Superman & Lois"" and Shadow & Bone but haven't seen any eps of either yet"
All About the Washingtons,Yellowjackets is amazing and I highly recommend it. I can't wait until The Afterparty season 2! I loved season 1 so much. I constantly watch the dance/rap clip of 2 shots whenever I need a laugh.
All About the Washingtons,"Expertly cast. Hauntingly creepy. Uproariously droll. 

Also while the timelines seem to line up with Millennials as the girls' birth generation, they are built of pure Gen-X rocket fuel."
All About the Washingtons,"It's awesome. I usually stay clear of teen drama but this show has a perfect balance of it. It's creepy, I like the mystery and the cast is great!"
All About the Washingtons,Severance is still filming.  Succession comes out in March.
All About the Washingtons,You‚Äôre so smart! You‚Äôre in for a treat. It‚Äôs excellent!
All About the Washingtons,üíØüî•üíØüî•üíØ
All About the Washingtons,This is the way.
All About the Washingtons,"I thought there is going to be just one, one hour long episode"
All About the Washingtons,Succession is on track to be on the GOATs with season 4 being its last and Severance has one of the best pilot seasons of a show I've ever seen. Highly recommend both.
All About the Washingtons,Might as well add Shrinking to your collection of S shows to watch.
All About the Washingtons,"Both are near perfect shows for me to be honest! I was disappointed HotD won over Severance at the Golden Globes, even though I really enjoyed it - it was a significantly better, tighter series premiere."
All About the Washingtons,"Don't bother with Midnight Club, it got cancelled... and it wasn't all that great to still warrant a watch. The YA stuff didn't bother me, it was more that the actual show's plot took a backseat to the stories the group would tell. Sure, the stories are meant to be used as a way to work out their issues, but it shouldn't have overshadowed the actual show itself. Though it was cool that some of the stories they told were small adaptations of some of Christopher Pike's other novels.

Flanagan seems to work best with a confined story, instead of trying to stretch it out just in case it gets another season."
All About the Washingtons,"Just checked it out. It's definitely teen-oriented, so not really my thing."
The House of Flowers,"Damn this looks really good, I don't care if it's in Spanish I might watch this. "
The House of Flowers,[deleted]
The House of Flowers,"Show has no good values at all.

Just more liberal garbage from netflix

Adultery
Homosexuality
Fornication
Family secrets
Drug use
Transsexuality

There is nothing good about this show, at least if it was entertaining but its just plain BORING this show was so uncomfortable to watch with my family

This whole novela was one big agenda push"
The House of Flowers,[deleted]
The House of Flowers,"It's funny how you mention ""drug use"", yet you watch El Chapo. Also, by your post history, you're a fan of Eminem, so it's more offensive to show two men in love than a straight dude call someone a f****t? Your interests are fine, but it's hypocritical to criticize this show's ""morals"" when you don't apply those same criticisms to other stuff you like."
The House of Flowers,"Homosexuality sounds great, that definity a good thing."
The House of Flowers,"Is that a bad thing? 

Like i said i could overlook somethings if the show was actually good, but after 3 episodes i gave up, im used to netflix shoving gay sex down my throat (no pun) but this series is down right boring

El chapo has a lot of gay scenes but thats actually a great show.

This was embarrassing just seems like they tried to shove as many liberal things as they could here. "
The House of Flowers,[deleted]
The House of Flowers,"They are not glorifying anything, its based on real life and its one of the only shows that actually stick very close to the real life events, since the start of his life until his downfall

This is fiction and the whole show is glorifying homosexuality and adultery, cheating on your wife is OK 

Does it get better after the 3rd episode? Or is the whole novela a sex fest? Seriously curious

Thats if you can actually discuss about the show and not attack my religious beliefs 

I didn‚Äôt go at you personally. I watched 3 episodes and gave up because it was too slow"
The House of Flowers,[deleted]
The House of Flowers,"Yes i saw gay scenes in the first 3 episodes.

So are you going to answer any of my questions or just deflect? "
The House of Flowers,[deleted]
The House of Flowers,"You said you totally recommend the show. 

I came here and said the show was terrible and im mexican.

Im asking what makes this novela so Good for you to recommend? Does the story actually get good? Or does it get more explicit?

"
The House of Flowers,"Another way to write this headline 
‚ÄúHBO had the biggest hits on TV for 2nd consecutive year‚Äù"
The House of Flowers,"HBO needs to teach their movie counterparts (WB) the importance of screenwriters, because they‚Äôre the ones responsible for delivering quality! HOTD and TLOU are so damn good!"
The House of Flowers,Maybe this will make execs notice you should be hiring writers who love your ip and not writers who hate it/just use it as a vehicle for their own shit ideas.
The House of Flowers,"Sony to Neil be like ""please make part 3, we have consoles to sell & more money to make!"""
The House of Flowers,"I knew it!

&#x200B;

Second season, just like Dragon, is gonna be huge, man HBO just doesn't miss."
The House of Flowers,"Well deserved.

I for one am so happy they didn't mess with the story.  Too many adaptations just do lip service to the source material and end up being completely different.  This just upsets the existing fanbase, especially when the adaptation is bad to boot.    Here they had a stellar story and didn't mess with it often recreating scenes that were near identical to the game.    It was so awesome seeing it come to life without significant changes other than cutting things for brevity.    

Here's hoping they do the second game similar justice as it's story is just as worthy of being adaptated straight up though I can see how they might tinker with way they tell the story in that they'll show the stories of the dual protagonists at the same time rather than separately."
The House of Flowers,"Discovery really underestimated HBO, I hope this means that they aren't going to try and control more in the merger and still take risks on shows."
The House of Flowers,"You know what's the best feeling in the world after every good news about this show? 

It's knowing that the salt mine that is The Last of Us 2 subreddit are seething with hate. Absolutely love it. 

Good news. Can't wait for season 2."
The House of Flowers,"HBO needs to pick up the Witcher man, which they won‚Äôt do because they have Westeros, but I still dream of what could have been"
The House of Flowers,"TLOU is a rare example of a big production team having respect and understanding for the source material. Most of the time, Hollywood follows the business model of  taking a generic script and sticking a known IP in it to gain publicity (see- Halo TV)."
The House of Flowers,"I played the game a couple times. Once on ps3 and then ps4. But I didn‚Äôt it so long ago I was able to watch the show and not know exactly what was going to happen scene to scene or what was change or the same. The game definitely has you feeling more attached to Ellie and Joel together as you play as Joel and it‚Äôs your job to keep Ellie safe. So some of the stuff in the show didn‚Äôt hit the same. Also, I found when I played the game I sided with Joel almost fully. Like he was doing the the wrong thing for the right reasons. But being removed from controlling him and watching it play out on a tv show, I feel I got the intended effect. And it definitely makes Last of Us part II more obvious how that plays out."
The House of Flowers,"Damn. This is impressive.

Imagine how Halo show could‚Äôve been if they actually respected the lore."
The House of Flowers,The writing has been superb.
The House of Flowers,"I liked TLOU wayyy more than HOTD and I‚Äôm saying this as someone who loves GOT and who didn‚Äôt play the TLOU game.

TLOU felt way more streamlined and easier to follow. Maybe it‚Äôs like not really comparable as they‚Äôre different thematically and stylistically, but I remember numerous times during HOTD being like ‚Äúwho‚Äôs that guy again?‚Äù Or ‚Äúwhy are they doing this again?‚Äù

TLOU is solid storytelling and great acting. Coming into it with no background, my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed ourselves far more."
The House of Flowers,It‚Äôs a copycat industry so be on the lookout next year for the newest video game adaptation series: Turok Dinosaur Hunter on Showtime
The House of Flowers,Praise Druckmann. Well deserved achievement. It goes without saying that TLOU Season 1 has probably surpassed viewership records for Game of Thrones Season 1 when it first aired as well
The House of Flowers,"It‚Äôs a good show. The ending felt rushed and a bit of a flop for my wife who didn‚Äôt play the games. I think they could have done better with Joel thinking about everything, slap in a ton of flash backs and actually show the action more. 10 more minutes would have been great."
The House of Flowers,This is the way.
The House of Flowers,It‚Äôs because House of the Dragon didn‚Äôt cast Pedro Pascal
The House of Flowers,So for the fifth straight year some very vocal people who told me a show or a movie was going to bomb for being too woke were wrong? Say it ain't so....
The House of Flowers,"They really have to stretch. HOTD still had more peak viewers, but to make TLOU look better they have to go to ""full season viewers"".

Isn't it enough that TLOU did good? HOTD had almost 2 million more viewers on air date."
The House of Flowers,"I must applaud the show's comittement to the source material, but the execution left me wanting. I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as HotD.

Ellie not being able to swin paid off with her nearly drowning while trying to reach the hospital near the end of the game, but that was cut from the story. Instead we got a flashback, which explains why Ellie is immune, which undermines why it has to be Ellie that needs to die in order to produce a cure. 

Action setpiece, tense sequences where you sneak past Clickers, or move through spore-filled underground tunnels (which wouldn't work anyway, given how they changed the cordiceps), the show could have used more of those."
The House of Flowers,House of the Dragon season 2 and Last of Us season 2 are going to pull huge numbers is what you're telling me. HBO wins on both counts.
The House of Flowers,"While the show has been strong I feel like they‚Äôre making changes to make part 2 make more sense. So much deconstructing of Joel as a strong survivalist. Too much Ellie making jabs at Joel and not enough of Ellie and Joel bonding. It took 6+ episodes before we got any survival bonding. This show feels rushed and it feels like Druckman is changing so much just to make part 1 make part 2 make sense. Part 2 made so little sense vs part 1. 

I haven‚Äôt hated this but as I went through this show it got worse and worse imo. I am not looking forward to the less well received part of the Last of Us getting more love. This first season has felt rushed in ways."
The House of Flowers,"Great HBO, now do oryx and crake!"
The House of Flowers,HoTD > TLoU
The House of Flowers,"Don‚Äôt care, HOT D still better üëç

TLOU was pretty good but it didn‚Äôt really blow me away. A nice 7/10 show, maybe 8. Was never gripped like I was watching my Targ friends weekly"
The House of Flowers,"Kid asked me why did Marlene task a single man to deliver Ellie across the country when she managed to teleport there before them with a big armed crew?

I didn't know what to say"
The House of Flowers,"Man, I really hope HBO picks up a good Sci Fi IP. That would be the ultimate trio.

Bring back FIREFLY please"
The House of Flowers,"Its almost like HOTD becoming popular brought in more viewers for this show to do even better  ü§î

This is why making well written content matters."
The House of Flowers,Bring back WestWorld!
The House of Flowers,"I never played the game or seen anyone do it.
So i didnt know what to expect when i started watching this series.
After the 2 first episodes i pre-ordered the PC release for the las of us, after 5 episodes i jumped on youtube and watched jacksepticeyes playtrough of the last of us 2.

I don't know why i never bothered earlier, but goddamn this is some good shit."
The House of Flowers,God I Hope so
The House of Flowers,Well deserved. The Last of Us is the better show with better source material and audiences clearly agree with that sentiment
The House of Flowers,How the hell?
The House of Flowers,"Unpopular opinion but to me this show was way overrated. Boring, characters making dumb decisions, like walking around unattentive. I enjoyed Raised by Wolves and From much more."
The House of Flowers,"As an experiment in turning a video game into a show, I thought The last of us was really great sometimes. The last episode however, did not work for me at all."
The House of Flowers,Pascal Power.
The House of Flowers,Now get the rights to Red Dead Redemption. Adapt the 2nd game first and then the 1st.
The House of Flowers,"The most overhyped tv show I've ever seen. Just wait, it's not even going to be close to House of the Dragon in terms of award nominations"
The House of Flowers,I'm happy these two shows got made but at the same time it makes it hurt even more seeing things like Wheel of Time and The Witcher with c tier writers with no respect for the source material.
The House of Flowers,"And people try to say that hbo is the worst streaming platform. HBO is by far the highest standard when it comes to making quality content, it‚Äôs not even close."
The House of Flowers,Is the season over yet? Can I pay for one month of HBO and watch it all at once?
The House of Flowers,if only they did halo correctly.
The House of Flowers,"hey, i didn‚Äôt have time to follow the show this last month, was it good?  did it feel like a video game movie addaptation?"
The House of Flowers,[deleted]
The House of Flowers,It was pretty lame compared to HOTD.
The House of Flowers,Its a much better show so thats great
The House of Flowers,Good
The House of Flowers,"Excellent, TLOU was so much better."
The House of Flowers,"Why does anyone care about this kind of thing? If it‚Äôs good it‚Äôs good, do we really need to know who‚Äôs watching which more?"
The House of Flowers,"It's a bit like comparing the heights of new NBA players to Minut Bol.  They are all frigging giants.

I'm just impressed that HBO has managed to keep its quality > quantity in an era that seems to be all going the latter (at least in terms of it's original scripted content, not so much the streaming service licensed content)."
The House of Flowers,The nice part about The Last of Us compared to House of the Dragon is that you can see things on your TV screen when you watch it.
The House of Flowers,Good. It was better.
The House of Flowers,"Well deserved. 

Craig Mazen does it again"
The House of Flowers,"Well deserved. Great casting, even greater writers."
The House of Flowers,Deserved. It's a better show.
The House of Flowers,"That‚Äôs crazy, as HotD was loads better, imo. It even came from the public falling out that was Got season 8."
The House of Flowers,"No surprise. HOTD was a pretentious, often boring disappointment. TLOU wasn't perfect but at least met my high expectations."
The House of Flowers,I honestly didn‚Äôt like house of the dragon but loved TLOU but that‚Äôs just my opinion
The House of Flowers,Was it really THAT good???
The House of Flowers,"Hype is a powerful thing.

I watched it all and thought it was okay. The game is superior."
The House of Flowers,"Almost as if respecting the source material has its pay offs. While HOTG‚Äôs been doing great job at sticking near the source material, the fuck up that was Game of Thrones season 8, has tarnished the brand‚Äôs reputation. IMHO."
The House of Flowers,My favorite thing about The Last of Us is that there were no late night misunderstandings that dropped the entire European country into a bloody war and made a family slowly kill each other over the course of decades which resulted in one of their descendants losing it 270 years down the line and burning a city down :)
The House of Flowers,"That's because ""The Last of Us"" wasn't a mediocre show trying its damnedest to ride the hype of a show that came out ten years ago."
The House of Flowers,Now let's get them to do an Uncharted series on HBO. Can Craig do comedy?
The House of Flowers,Good. Screw Game of Thrones and everything that spawned from it in the cinematic spectrum. They did us so freaking dirty with that last season.
The House of Flowers,"I couldn't finish HotD, got to episode 5 dragging my feet. I watched TloU every Sunday night, it was a better show for me personally, but I think my opinion is from a biased perspective, I played the game, but never read the story about HotD so felt less invested"
The House of Flowers,It's a vastly better show
The House of Flowers,Not surprised.  House of the Dragon was awful
The House of Flowers,I dropped off hard with House of Dragons. I got to episode 8 and just forgot about it.
The House of Flowers,"This season felt so rushed

Episode 3 spent too much time away from Joel and Ellie. That episode being longer than the finale is a shame

The lack of infected is a damn shame

Walking dead season 1 was much better"
The House of Flowers,"HoD sucks donkey balls.
That‚Äôs why."
The House of Flowers,"I didn't care for house of the dragon. Just didn't grab me. I feel like the only one. On the other hand, I loved TLOU."
The House of Flowers,Not watching any gOt spin-offs as revenge for season 8
The House of Flowers,I couldn‚Äôt get into either show. I think I‚Äôm over GOT and zombie type shit. I‚Äôd like to see more dramas about real life again. Plus that girl in The Last of Us just makes me want to turn of my television.
The House of Flowers,It was better.
The House of Flowers,It's worth pointing out that HotD went up head to head with NFL football
The House of Flowers,"fuck that game of thrones lite boring ass bullshit

this isnt even close"
The House of Flowers,HotD is the definition of mid and I'm tired of holding my tongue
The House of Flowers,This always ends each episode with a ‚ÄúOH NO!‚Äô It‚Äôs always a long week until the next episode!
The House of Flowers,"Loved both.  HBO is back, baby."
The House of Flowers,"I can't watch shows like these. I have the attention span of a gnat and I get bored, really bored."
The House of Flowers,"Yeah, because house of the dragon sucked in comparison"
The House of Flowers,"If it keeps sticking close to the games, it‚Äôs going to jump from Game of Thrones Season 1 to Season 8, in only two seasons. I am a fan of the games, but The Last of Us Part 2 is a narrative dumpster fire."
The House of Flowers,What‚Äôs the appeal of the shitty incest show? Are people really that degenerate?
The House of Flowers,‚Ä¶. Because it is FUCKING AWESOME
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,To be honest it looks to me like it's going to be one of those examples of shows that is going to repeat itself every time you come back from a commercial break and really drag out the handful of content you have to show. Having said that I will give it a go. Best of luck to you.

72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,Why are most of the crocs shown freshwater crocs? Those guys are kinda chill
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,How's it feel to contribute to five future Cracked articles?
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,"[Serious] Show looks great. I am from the US. Where is it going to air, only Australia or will we get it over here? Looks really interesting and I would definitely watch it and my 9 yo son would love it as he wants to grow up and become an ""Animal Scientist"" as he puts it."
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,I can actually say that its not. Every episode pumps through the infomation and its actually interesting. 
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,Haha you'll have to watch and find out
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,Kinda being the key word here
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,"Oh awesome thanks mate! It will air in the US, it will be on Nat Geo in early August. As I have more airing details I'll flick you a message!"
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,Will be sure to keep an eye out for it.  Keep up the good work and thanks again.  Will be sure to mention it to friends and family also.  
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,"Hey mate! An update on this, The firs Episode has aired in Australia.
Its on Nat Geo Wild every Tuesday night at 7:30pm 
Sorry for the late reply just remembered about this."
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,Wow ! Thanks a bunch. Was wondering about that lately and tried to look for it on Nat Geo Website a couple of weeks ago to no avail. I *REALLY* appreciate you thing of me and remembering to contact me. You are what makes Reddit great !!!
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,"Oh well thanks heaps!
Let me know what you think about the show, love to hear some feedback"
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,"Having a hard time finding it in the channel listings, including the dates and times you listed. Does not seem to be on ???"
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,"Because, contrary to what movies and TV would have you believe, encounters with large predators are quite rare, especially in the lower 48. I've been an avid camper and backpacker for 30+ years. I have had exactly one encounter that gave me (very slight) cause for concern, with a mountain lion.

Seen plenty of coyotes, though. But they're about as dangerous as squirrels. I've seen a few rattle snakes and water moccasins, but never close enough to be in any danger. Also black bears, but again only from a distance.

Frankly, raccoons are the sketchiest creatures I've run into. They're bold and can get aggressive when trying to get at your food.

I would *love* to see a grizzly or a wolf, from a safe distance of course, but I've only seen their scat and tracks."
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,"There is actually an episode of Survivorman in South America in which Les Stroud sees and is stalked by a leopard or jaguar, I can't remember which. He ends up leaving his camp to find safety in a village because of it.

The other shows have camera crews, so I imagine animals just avoid groups of people. Some of them are also kind of notorious for not really going into the bush very far. 

Also Bear Grylls is known for faking some stuff."
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,"Animals avoid humans in pretty much every case unless they're starving. So yeah, a bunch of people with cameras and lights and vehicles are not likely to run into much."
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,[deleted]
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,"Doesn't Naked and Afraid and Dual Survival have camera crews and whatever crews with them? Only one who would be in real danger, is the only one who actually survives on his own, Les Stroud. Damn, I need to watch Survivorman again. 

When it comes to safe areas, I was just watching Dual Survival and they had plenty of lions and other animals around them, but as I said, they also seem to roll with a crew, so I'm sure there were people with guns with them too. Same goes with Survivorman man and safe areas (not the crew part), with animals wandering and with some thicker forests he goes into, it's quite impossible to make it actually a safe area. "
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,"You should watch Alone on the History channel. It‚Äôs a lot like survivorman, contestants survive alone in the wild with the camera and recording equipment that they have to film themselves. The last contestant left wins half a million dollars. It‚Äôs the only competition show I like and it is the best survival show since Survivorman. But, contestants are constantly encountering bears and cougars. Every single season has two are three contestants tap out of the show because a bear shows up to their camp and night. It‚Äôs some tense stuff, and my favorite contestants from the first season stayed in his tent with a knife and a flare because there was a mountain lion outside his tent pacing. He was talking to the camera hoping his voice would scare it away. One of the best part of the series, you should check it out"
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,They obviously groom and scout the area beforehand. 
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,"Actually for survivor man, he has encountered numerous dangerous animals . Here in Alaska, a bear came to his housing one night and tried to get into it while he slept. But for a of those shows, there is a much easier answer: Because they pick areas where the animals are not.

Most of those shows don't tell you that they are in protected park areas where there is often lots of traffic by people and animals often avoid those areas. Also, they often pick areas that there are few if any predators. For a person like Les Stroud, he also researches and prepares for each show about six months before shooting. That gives them the chance to find out about wildlife in the area. Many times he has done areas where there is little to no dangerous animals. Also, most of the shows had a production crew which keeps them safe by having numbers. And even if they encountered an animal, it would most likely not make the shows. 

Most animals are actual scared of humans or don't care. A few will have a curious nature. Snakes and spiders could care less and only really strike if they think you are endangering their lives. And most bugs aren't poisonous, but do carry disease which they are vaccinated against before leaving of course. 

And then there is a show like survivor which is just...fake as all get out despite what people think. Between the crew, the ""contestants"" and everyone, there is enough noise to keep most animals away. And if you want to know, Bear Grylis is all fake despite what you may think. he goes out, shoots and then goes back to the hotel for the night only playing up the survival angle. So I hate to say it, but most of the Survival reality shows are complete fakes. "
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,"Years ago I used to camp at Balsam Mountain off the Blue Ridge Parkway. The rangers had camp fire circles every night called Bear Circles. Warned about bears in the campground. Had tall pipe poles at every campsite with forks at the top like an old coat rack to hang your food from. Not even toothpaste or chips in the tent because the bears could smell it. They had broken into cars regularly when food was in them. Kinda spooky, but a great place to camp "
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,Scope the area out beforehand. Also predators probably don't want to go after humans when there's a bunch together in one area.
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,Because TV is fake.
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,They're actually rare to come across?
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,Based on a true story. 
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,"Clue, it‚Äôs not fucking real !"
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,Because they are all fake and scripted to sucker soccer moms?
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,"Closest encounter I had was in Florida, we had a couple bear cubs run through our campsite. I'm sure mama bear was nearby"
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,"I was hiking a trail on the Delaware water gap when i saw a bear about 50ft away, and he saw me too. We stared at each other for a minute and I, being the idiot that i am, slowly took out my camera and took a photo. Then I slowly continued down the trail, never taking my eyes off the bear until i was a safe distance away. "
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,"I have more bad luck with opposums they tend to be dumber then coons and more aggressive in my neck of the words, "
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,Idk man I knew a girl who was killed by coyotes while hiking so I'd say slightly more dangerous than squirrels. 
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,Damn that kinda gives me chills about the leopard. Imagine seeing it a few times eyeballing you. Just wondering when it'll come to kill you. 
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,"Yea, and when he did his Alaska stretch, they wouldn't let him go out there without a rifle, cause of the polar bears.

Thing is, most animals want nothing to do with us."
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,Along with the camera crews are local animal trackers/spotters/guards for insurance purposes.
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,Survivorman also encountered lions in Africa and had to use the burner from his hot air balloon to scare them off. And I think I remember a bear getting close to him in Alaska too.
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,"> Also Bear Grylls is known for faking some stuff.

I wonder if he faked pooping out all those worms."
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,[deleted]
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,"> Having people die in your country is generally bad for business and PR

Well, at least if it's someone of any note.  
Tourists however are usually stupid and some losses are to be expected."
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,"Is suvivorman better than any Bear Grylls show? He was fun to watch at first a while ago but it‚Äôs getting more ridiculously staged. One time he jumps in a frozen stream on purpose and strips and is trying to tell the viewer the dangers of keeping wet clothes on but you suspect he has a heated blanket ready for him two yards away after they cut away. I like naked and afraid because every couple is legitimately starving for protein and struggling from the get-go. They make it clearly known they can‚Äôt interact with the crew unless it‚Äôs a medical emergency (one woman had severe hypothermia and had to be airlifted out) but they also do remind the viewer the crew is nearby at all times so it‚Äôs no trickery like Grylls. 

Edit: Happy cake day /u/ummhumm"
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,"> bear cubs

I'm sure that increased the pucker factor, lol."
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,"That is pretty much a normal way to deal with a black bear, just show respect and don't show fear. They're lazy as hell 99% of the time. Was walking with my gf in NW Jersey in a field and we happened on a relaxing bear in the tall grass, maybe 30 feet away. It stood up, looked at us, and we backed away slowly and it went back to sleep and that was that."
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,"I was dubious of your claim, but apparently coyotes *have* been known to attack people, although it's extremely rare and has overwhelmingly been attacks on infants and small children.

I've seen countless coyotes over the years and have never once had an issue with them, so...TIL, I guess. :/

edit: sorry about your friend."
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,Except of course for Polar Bears.
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,"I live on Vancouver Island, in B.C., and we have lots of black bears. We see them all the time but rarely do they ever attack anyone. They're just trying to survive, they really don't want to tango unless they feel they have no other option. Like 90% of animals will flee at top speed when they see people, especially if it's a region in which people hunt. We're pretty efficient at murder, I think most animals know this."
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,"Survivorman is actually him alone in the wilds. Sure, they've given him a basic tutorial on what's eatable in the areas, what to expect in there to begin with and all that, but it's him alone, for 7days. He doesn't get food, besides some candy bar here and there to begin with and his equipment is usually salvaged from what he came with. Like when he got estranged with a broken motorcycle, he just stripped what he could possibly use from the cycle. 

He even drags the cameras back and forth to get the ""travel shots"" from a bit of a distance, which has tricked some people who've only seen youtube clips of the show, to think there's a crew hopping along too. No, it's just him doing extra work to get better shots. 

Add to this, since it's one guy for 7days, Les is also a really charming fellow and it's just nice to listen to him talking about this and that and trying to stay positive and productive when the energy levels just drop lower and lower. 

But yeah, I honestly rank Grylls show pretty much the lowest of the shows I've watched simply because how staged it is and how outrageously stupid advice he gives now and then. So, my word isn't the best one to take about this. Survivorman all the way still. 

Also, the show is easy to judge by just watching the first episode, since it stays pretty much the same, with just locations and starting gear (quite little at best) changing. 


"
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,"Yeah, the cubs themselves i wasnt too worried about,  it was the mama bear nearby that i couldn't see was what I was worried about"
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,Did you have to change your pants afterwards though?
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,[unfortunately it did happen](https://www.google.ca/amp/www.cbc.ca/amp/1.779304) 
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,"> we‚Äôre pretty efficient at murder, I think animals know this


Not tigers. Those fuckers will actively hunt people."
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,"Yeah, saw that come up repeatedly when I started googling. You knew her? Sorry, man. :("
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,"I have big issues with both the ending for Samurai Jack and Primal

That said, several episodes of each go into the greatest episodes of television hall of fame, incredible shows."
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,"Its so well made and I'm definitely that person who wouldn't shut up about making people watch it while S2 was on. I liked ""Primal Theory"". I didn't even mind the scale of the Colosaeus for three episodes. 

However, I can't deny that I felt betrayed by the finale's brutally unfair pacing, and its left me soured on recommending it a little. A show that took an entire episode dedicated to the perils of a single nighttime, an episode to their raft-at-sea anxiety, all these masterful tonal pieces so viscerally depicted just to speed run the conclusion to the story? 

In the age of television cancelations, I could even understand having a rough conclusion if they'd been told to wrap it up but despite no S3 official renewal, Tartakovsky has said its going to continue as an anthology which only makes the finale feel more like something hastily severed once he'd shifted interest. 

Great show, absolutely worth watching, the ending is not on pace or par with the rest."
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,Ending is terrible though
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,I'm a broken record but the final episode is amazingly bad. It ended up being a show me and my friend don't even discuss because the first thing that comes to mind is the finale
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,it was incredible until the end of season 2. that was complete garbage.
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,First season was great. Second was just ok
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,It's amazing
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,Is the end of season 2 so bad it's not worth watching? This has been on my list for quite sometime but I'm hesitant due to the poor reception the ending received.
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,I loved the show. It would make a great video game
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,This show is brilliant except the ending.
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,last season sucked
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,Yes.
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,I've been watching through Samurai Jack for the first time and it is amazing. I'm watching Primal next.
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,Truly an amazing show.
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,It is an amazing show.  Holy hell is it awesome on weed.
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,I was hoping really hard that the whole show would end up just being a really gritty reboot of the Flintstones
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,That seems a pretty common POV but honestly Primal isn't a show where I ever particular cared about the overarching story. Its very much a show where the episode-to-episode journey is what I love about it and how it ends is sort of immaterial.
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,"Primal isn't over yet, that was just the conclusion of Spear and Fang's story"
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,"After Samurai Jack S5, the ending of Primal (that it was disappointing/rushed) was almost completely predictable.   


Watching ""Primal Theory"" was an ""Ah, okay. I don't really feel it, but I understand."" moment. And then with the finale being what it was, really made it feel like ""Primal Theory"" stole much-needed time from it."
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,"The finale really was so terrible on so many levels. It's left me with GoT syndrome all over again. Not saying it shit the bed anywhere near as bad as GoT, just that it went from something that I absolutely loved and looked forward to to becoming something that I just don't even care about anymore."
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,Some may say. I thought the ending was perfect.
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,6037697606247028
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,"It‚Äôs not that it‚Äôs bad. Season 2 is great, but the last episode feels like it should‚Äôve been at least twice as long considering the themes and loose ends it had to tie up. It feels like a season‚Äôs worth of built-up dread is confronted and resolved in six minutes."
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,Imagine spending half a season hyping up an epic confrontation then it happens in 2 minutes in a 20 minute finale.
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,You should watch it and decide that for yourself.
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,"No, not at all. I'd say it felt rushed. It's making a point about evolution, I'd say. 

But maybe that's just all the time it really needed. And there are moments of sheer awe throughout the show. 

Give the first four eps a shot and then decide."
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,"Normally I wouldn‚Äôt even bother responding to this, but this statement is so jarring to me that I actually have to ask; do you seriously believe that statement? Do you honestly think that half of the entire show completely and utterly ‚Äúsucked‚Äù? The whole second season, from the first minute to the last? Or are you just saying that because you dislike a part of it, like the ending?"
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,"Absolutely the best show to watch high. Brother and I have so many ""broooo"" moments üòÇ"
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,Please tell me you hate Samurai Jack S5 ending as well.
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,It was‚Ä¶weird
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,"I thought the ending was just fine as well.  When I went to the primal subreddit to see how others felt, I was honestly shocked at how negative many people were about not only the last episode, but also Primal Theory and most of S2 in general.  It was very confusing to me, because in several ways I thought S2 was better than S1.

And I thought Primal Theory was an awesome one-off. I was shocked when people started talking. In a good way."
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,Double episode finales can be very effective. Couldn't find anything definitive regarding season 3 so..
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,I always intended to watch. Was more so wondering what about the ending is disappointing. This helps and will likely only slightly irritate me.
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,"maybe not the whole season sucked, but a lot did

same situation as rick&morty, characters turning into stereotypes, they are in the prehistoric times & suddenly the egyptians or whatever show up?"
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,Yeah it was dog shit. Basically season 5 went downhill once the characters started talking.
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,"The issue is that primal theory just ate up an entire episode that did not relate to the show we were sold for 10+ episodes.  

The ending imo would have been fine if they switched up the order of events just a little bit."
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,You shouldn‚Äôt be talking about stuff like this on a post that I hoped would get new people to watch the show. At least use a spoiler tag or something. Getting to that episode is supposed to surprise you.
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,"I do not understand. The show takes place in an obviously fantastical setting. People and dinosaurs coexist. Why is the appearance of a more civilized human culture such a problem?

I also don‚Äôt know what you mean by characters turning into stereotypes. In fact, I think some of them gain a lot more depth, like Spear and how we see him think introspectively on his own life in a very intelligent way, running directly against the stereotype of the brutish Neanderthal caveman. Mira, as well, with an identity we‚Äôve never been familiar with until the final episode."
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,you were sold a show for 10+ episodes?  By whom?  What show were you sold?  I don't understand your comment.
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,I was referring to information that was already mentioned in the post that you were responding to.
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,"Primal (the show) was advertised as a mostly unspoken Dino adventure with a cave man about their travels, all ads and marketing show cave man and Dino. 

Primal theory got rid of cave man and Dino adventures and swapped it in with a crazy dude terrorizing some British chaps."
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,and it sounds like that one stand-alone episode ruined the show for some people?  Amazing.
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,"I don‚Äôt think so I think the last episode was probably the culprit. Again I think the last episode could of probably used one or two rounds of rewrites to refine the ending just a little bit. 

People are angry at the one off because they might assume that it may be responsible for the rushed feeling of the final episode. As in if there was more time spent on spear, fang and Mira we could have had an extra 20 minutes to properly set up the ending or flesh out the conclusion.

I enjoyed the episode for what it was but I don‚Äôt think it added anything to the other episodes as a whole."
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,Nothing worse than fans who take more pleasure in hating what they love rather than enjoying it.
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,"I'm a Star Trek fan, all of it, and your comment is very true for half of the fanbase today.  I choose to find things to like about Discovery/Picard/etc!"
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,Seriously.
72 Dangerous Animals: Asia,No one wants to be the girl who played Meg but left and got replaced by Mila Kunis.
Afflicted,Wasn't that the documentary with the woman who said she is allergic to electricity and forced her husband to move to some shitty desert town that for some reason had very little cellphone reception?
Afflicted,I do find it almost funny when people knowingly go on tv to brag and show off their fake illnesses and ailments and then get upset when they get portrayed as the idiots and scammers they are.

Afflicted,"The issue is the precedent set. 

*A state appellate court agreed in a ruling that may impact the liberties that documentarians enjoy to weave certain narratives after shooting.*"
Afflicted,"Good. While I‚Äôm all for free speech being used to take down individuals and corporations normally insulated from criminal prosecution, Netflix in particular has perpetrated a string of sensationalist documentaries that care less about revealing the truth than they do about raking in viewers and creating panic and outrage. Lying to an interviewee to get them to give you the sound bite you want is the tactic of a reality show producer, not a documentarian."
Afflicted,">‚Äúwere reasonably susceptible to an interpretation that defendants were portraying [their] illnesses, and accompanying physical symptoms, as not the result of any underlying, diagnosable medical condition, but rather as either the product of [their] imaginations or some mental disorder.‚Äù

Afflicted,"And then try to sue and cause even more attention to the same documentary. I for one am definitely going to watch it now, and hadn't even heard of it before today"
Afflicted,"The problem is that while many of the people featured could be easily dismissed as faking, they were edited in a way that completely changed what they were saying and often portrayed them as even more unhinged than they actually are. I remember shortly after this came out the young woman who lived in the desert was edited to look like she turned down a treatment because it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúwhat she wanted‚Äù or something extremely vague and weird. It was implied she didn‚Äôt want treatment because she wanted to stay sick. In reality the doctors couldn‚Äôt administer treatment because she was too dehydrated. 

You don‚Äôt have to believe them, but at least make sure you don‚Äôt believe them because of things they actually say, not what they were edited to say."
Afflicted,"You‚Äôve obviously never had to deal with someone you love being sick, and doctors not having a clue. Please apply a little critical thinking and take a moment before you take a bug gulp of whatever BS is being pushed. 

It‚Äôs bloody terrifying to feel this helpless."
Afflicted,[deleted]
Afflicted,r/okbuddychicanery
Afflicted,"Yep, from a legal standpoint, this is huge.

There a large number of documentaries that tell an interviewee one thing, have them sign a contract, then use the interview as a hit piece.  For good or bad, this has been how they filmed a great many of the documentaries much like Tiger King. They didn't have to worry about misrepresentation lawsuits afterward because of the contract that was signed. This lawsuit might change all of that."

I hope down the road they have to pay out the ass and it sets a precedent for these exploitative and manipulative reality series creators/finders (that should never have the word ‚Äúdocumentary‚Äù associated with them in the first place), terrified. 

For anyone calling them idiots, these companies are like cops in a police interrogation; they can lie all they want and by the time the person signs a confession, it‚Äôs too late.

Afflicted,"Your statement that she was too dehydrated doesn‚Äôt make sense. It‚Äôs honestly really simple to rehydrate pt‚Äôs via IV fluids. It‚Äôs commonplace in hospitals. 

Plus, I‚Äôve never heard of you not being able to admin an antipsychotic because of dehydration. You might just need to lower the dosage so that toxicity doesn‚Äôt occur. Even if that specific drug had some kind of diuretic effect or being difficult on the kidneys (which most antipsychotics aren‚Äôt) you could change it to another comparable antipsychotic that doesn‚Äôt have such affects.

As for therapies, most you would just rehydrate the patient so he/she is more cooperative and receptive to the teaching/therapy. It also would not prevent them from scheduling a future appointment. 

Btw I highly doubt they would discharge a patient that is dehydrated to the point they cannot perform a procedure. To be that dehydrated would be some major shit. Like she would not be able to walk or be coherent. 

TLDR: The woman most likely left AMA (against medical advice) when she didn‚Äôt like something."
Afflicted,Doctors can't hydrate people?
Afflicted,I watched that episode for the first time last night and enjoy this comment
Afflicted,"No, not really. The defendants failed in their anti-SLAPP motion. Doesn‚Äôt mean they won‚Äôt win down the road."
Afflicted,"> the panel ruled that the consent releases the subjects signed aren‚Äôt enforceable because they were lied to and pressured to waive their rights not to be defamed

> this is huge

No it‚Äôs not.

‚ÄúThe lawsuit can continue‚Äù is not huge."
Afflicted,"I mean, once defamation makes it to a jury it's not particularly hard. The issue is getting there"
Afflicted,Fuck Chuck.
Afflicted,"Always has been. 

Fake documentaries and by extension documentation has existed for centuries.

The problem in this case is that the ‚Äúvictims‚Äù have contractually agreed to be exploited and are now upset that they were exploited"
Afflicted,Yeah Netflix has been pushing that line further and further recently. Sadly it‚Äôs working brilliantly for them as viewers are consuming docs constantly now. But morally it‚Äôs so much worse than reality tv.
Afflicted,"Well they were rewarded an insane amount with the Tiger King nonsense, so of course they're trying to strike gold again by putting out a bunch of other garbage sensationalized documentaries."
Afflicted,"I'm only explaining what the people themselves said after the show went to air, and it was only one example of how the crew edited and exploited their conditions to make them seem even crazier than they were. I am not a doctor, and I watched this series years ago, but I am fairly confident they were not administering her an antipsychotic, but an experimental treatment for lyme's disease and that they were not in a hospital.

What matters is not the technicalities of the treatment, but the fact that the crew edited what happened to be something salasious instead of a reflection of reality. It's one thing to look for a storyline in a docuseries with the footage you have, and another to edit your subject so completely that the reality you've created is a blatant lie.

\[edit\] I've found the article written by Bekah's partner, Jesse, and he explains how the scene went down in reality vs how it was edited by Docshop. Every single participant of this docuseries has publicly spoken out about their experience with the crew. You can read the rest of Jesse's article here: [https://medium.com/@jessebercowetz/the-problem-with-the-netflix-series-afflicted-1953e09b5205](https://medium.com/@jessebercowetz/the-problem-with-the-netflix-series-afflicted-1953e09b5205)

*>> ""Take, for example, ozone therapy, one of the perks dangled in front of Bekah‚Äôs nose like a carrot. She‚Äôd had good results from ozone in the past and was excited to try this purported new variation. What you see in the film, though, is a failed attempt at a treatment that turns into an illustration of the filmmakers‚Äô preconceived idea that such remedies are just chimeras. In fact, the procedure didn‚Äôt work because Bekah was too dehydrated for them to draw blood. She had told Docshop‚Äôs doctor that she needed saline for this very purpose, but was ignored. We don‚Äôt see that part though. What we learn in the film is that ozone is just another failed cure, when the reality is that she didn‚Äôt receive it because they wouldn‚Äôt listen to her. Since Afflicted came out, we have been getting emails from people who are suffering from mold toxicity and are under the impression ozone therapy did not help Bekah. It‚Äôs not true, and is an example of how this film does a disservice to the chronically ill community.""*"
Afflicted,"I've found the article that Bekah's partner, Jesse, wrote about their experience with the crew during this particular scene. More-or-less Bekah was open to the ozone treatment, but was too dehydrated to draw blood. She told the crew doctor she needed saline, and they ignored her, and chose to edit the scene like the treatment didn't work because she was crazy.

Afflicted,Never before has such a case been allowed to be seen before the court rather than dismissed. It's pretty precedent setting.
Afflicted,"If you think it's not a big deal you've never been sued.

In most circumstances, ""The lawsuit can continue"" means a huge cost to the defendant and it will definitely have a dampening effect for good or evil.

The best hope a defendant has for being sued is a quick dismissal and/or loser pays court costs (which almost never happens)."
Afflicted,"It opens up the floodgates on all past documentaries that used this kind of contract.  

This is massive.

Every documentary maker from the past 30 years is shitting themselves."
Afflicted,"That season finale was a fucking roller-coaster and hard to fucking watch. My fianc√©e lost his dad in a house fire like two months before that episode too. He had to leave the house and go for a walk after the credits rolled.

Extremely powerful episode and a horrifyingly great representation of what mental illness can do to someone."
Afflicted,You don't like me as your partner? Imagine me as your enemy.
Afflicted,"Centuries? The first documentaries were 1 century ago, actuality films. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuality_film"
Afflicted,This is so true and I love documentaries.  Anyone that I watch that says something that I think is to unbelievable to believe I do my own research.  Besides that every single doc is made with bias so you can have two docs on one instance with two polar opposite outcomes.
Afflicted,"""Afflicted"" was released years before Tiger King."
Afflicted,"Ozone therapy is pseudo science:

Afflicted,I just finished season 1 and all my homies hate chuck. Not gonna lie though I didn‚Äôt expect Better Call Saul to be such a banger. This might be an unpopular opinion but I may like it more than Breaking Bad
Afflicted,That's one word I wish I could fit into sentences more often
Afflicted,How do you know this?
Afflicted,Oh no! How will Netflix pay for legal counsel to deal with a garden variety tort like defamation? It‚Äôs not like they have insurance for these kinds of things.
Afflicted,I‚Äôm not Netflix and I‚Äôve never lied about and pressured someone into signing my consent releases.
Afflicted,"Good.

They shouldn‚Äôt have lied to get people to sign the releases then.

If a doc team didn‚Äôt lie they have nothing to worry about."
Afflicted,>documentation.
Afflicted,Okay? I'm not arguing the validity of the treatment. The entire point of this lawsuit is that every single subject of the docuseries were grossly misinterpreted to the point that Docshop's final product is a blatant misrepresentation of the events they claimed to document in the first place.
Afflicted,[deleted]
Afflicted,"Definitely not an unpopular opinion. 

My favorite thing about the show is when it was first announced, I asked ‚ÄúWhy are we getting a spin-off about the freaking lawyer?‚Äù Once I started watching it, I quickly said, ‚Äúwhy didn‚Äôt we get this sooner?‚Äù 

The whole cast/crew completely outdid themselves with the show and I love how it justified itself quickly. It‚Äôs got smart writing/casting and it all works so well. 

But, it shouldn‚Äôt surprise anyone. They honed their craft on Breaking Bad, and perfected it with BCS."
Afflicted,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_Fz32QSfMw
Afflicted,"Of course, any legal insurance they have certainly doesn't cost anything and if the premium goes up, nbd. 

And since they are the only people that make documentaries, they'll be fine. There wouldn't be any *precedence* to affect any other producers, because they're all Netflix."
Afflicted,Docshop must have also gotten affected by the 5g!
Afflicted,The writing in the show is PHENOMENAL and I like the direction it‚Äôs going. If season 1 is any indication of the quality for the later seasons I‚Äôll be watching then maaaaan does BoB Odenkirk deserve some awards for his acting. Haven‚Äôt encountered a dull moment yet
Afflicted,"FFS, Netflix got sued for defamation and the cases moved forward just this year in another case:

https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna13943

And the year before:

https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/netflix-must-face-ex-prosecutors-defamation-lawsuit-over-central-park-five-case-2021-08-09/

Don‚Äôt give me this ‚Äúnever before‚Äù nonsense."
Afflicted,"Eh, maybe. This case survived an anti SLAPP motion, maybe it gets kicked on an MSJ. Either way it‚Äôs not a big value case and plaintiff isn‚Äôt going to be well liked by a jury."
Afflicted,"Those two examples are not relevant to what's at stake here.  The never before at stake is that the contract that protects documentarians from lawsuits when they lie about the intent of filming has for the first time been unable to prevent a case from going to court, thereby risking lawsuits from many other documentaries.

I posted my source and you responded within 1 minute with an answer. You neither watched the link nor have any idea what the point is so get lost with this hot headed garbage."
Afflicted,"Oh no. People never dispute the contracts they sign. Never happens. First time ever, for sure."
Afflicted,you are a fool
Afflicted,"Credibly alleging that you were lied to about the purpose of the Release in order to induce signing is not some brand new legal territory. It‚Äôs pretty bog standard. But hey, I just read the decision, what do I know.

Also - just to add - the plaintiffs have a very low bar here to defeat an Anti SLAPP motion. They‚Äôre going to have a tougher row to hoe when it comes time for an MSJ."
Afflicted,"If the subjects' allegations are true (that the filmmakers blatantly left out facts, fabricated narratives, and misrepresented events through edits), then I hope that they win this lawsuit. 

There should be laws against falsely misrepresenting people for documentaries, news programs, and reality TV."
Afflicted,I only watched one episode but it was about the lady who thought wifi makes her sick. Was that misrepresented? Admittedly it made her look like a crazy person... but if the shoe fits...
Afflicted,"If crazy hypochondriacs can sue for being made to look like crazy hypochondriacs, then I‚Äôm going to sue gravity for what it‚Äôs done to my girlfriends breasts."
Afflicted,So they did see themselves.
Afflicted,Unfortunately they ARE crazy hypochondriacs in need of serious mental health help. Hyperbaric ozone therapy...give me a break.
Afflicted,"They are crazy hypochondriacs,  they just dont like everyone who has been telling them that being right."
Afflicted,"For anyone interested in the personal responses of those portrayed in the show, [here's a short article](https://medium.com/@afflicted/the-truth-behind-netflixs-afflicted-92e92d32cd7c) with further links to personal responses. They're quite detailed and interesting.

And while I obviously have no idea if the allegations are true or not, documentaries sure as hell have vastly misrepresented people before, and Netflix is quite well known for producing really bad shows in general. So I wouldn't be surprised if this turned out to be true."
Afflicted,"here is the thing.  we as a society look badly on people who have diseases that are ""all in their head"". as if it is their fault. we dont blame people with depression anymore. these people are genuinely in pain. they need psychiatric help. Part of it may be they do get pleasure from attention, but they likely also do feel real physical pain.  And as a society because we look down upon, these subjects dont want to hear that they have a mental illness. They believe they are being dismissed. Instead they are being diagnosed by a doctor likely. It is overall likely a terribly sad situation.  One where there disease is likely psycho-symatic but none the less real, and can be treated by the right people."
Afflicted,"Wait, did Netflix produce the series themselves, or did they buy it from a production company? If a production company was responsible, why sue Netflix?"
Afflicted,Good.
Afflicted,"Good, I hope they win. This documentary twisted things to make them look bad and call into question their very real though seldom understood medical conditions.  This has a profoundly negative impact when casual viewers watch this twisted narrative and use it as an excuse for not accommodating people's disabilities and or throwing relatives under the bus and out on to the streets on the mistaken assumption that their uneducated cynical asses know better when they've never bothered to read the medical science or practice empathy.  People with rare chronic illnesses deserve respectful, inclusive reporting that validates their conditions as real and deserving of accommodation and support."
Afflicted,[deleted]
Afflicted,"I agree, and there already are really. But I'm sure they gave the rights away for any kind of civil action in whatever contract they signed to participate."
Afflicted,To be fair the very first documentary ever made was staged. Editing can make any perspective seem like the right one.
Afflicted,should they go after the filmmakers instead of netflix ?
Afflicted,You have no idea
Afflicted,"A lot of the docudramas on Netflix lack any kind of integrity. Like the one about the Central Park five highlight only the issue of race, it ignores key elements in the case that led to the court‚Äôs decision. This makes it easier to paint the court as evil and racist,  telling a narrative that is more compelling than the truth."
Afflicted,U U
Afflicted,Still feel pretty good to me.
Afflicted,"""I‚Äôm going to sue gravity"" - alfalfa6945 

Take a look at this wacko people, he is actually trying to sue gravity."
Afflicted,"I expect a bit of distortion from some documentary makers, especially when they aren't on camera themselves. 

I didn't really like this show as it was exploitative and frustrating to see mentally ill people not helped, and sick people called crazy.

The only thing worthy of taking from it was how bad the healthcare system is, and how both mental and physical issues are intertwined."
Afflicted,">and Netflix is quite well known for producing really bad shows in general

I'm suing you for causing injury after making me roll my eyes so hard"
Afflicted,*cough* *Cough* White Helmets *Cough* *Cough*
Afflicted,"Netflix has the deep pockets. I guess the headline is far less buzzy as: ""The suit also lists Doc Shop Productions, series creator Dan Partland and other producers as defendants."""
Afflicted,">their very real 

Oh please, just a bunch of first world wackos."
Afflicted,At this point we have no reason to believe they are lying. The accusations could very well be true.
Afflicted,"Can people just give their rights away?
Wouldn‚Äôt it be fair to say their waiving of rights was done with an expectation that wasn‚Äôt met?"
Afflicted,"Got to go after the money, and Netflix has way more than the producers."
Afflicted,Mrs. Gravity will be confused when she finds out shes a verb.
Afflicted,My only response would be: Another Life.
Afflicted,"Ignorance like yours kills, but we will not be silenced, scum."
Million Pound Menu,"This already played in the UK and it was brilliant, absolutely check it out. But they spent a lot of time on the defense and very little on the prosecution.

The real Chris Tarrant said even after watching the show he was still 100% positive that Ingram did it."
Million Pound Menu,"First episode going into the creation of the show is the best.  It's not terrible overall but is severely tainted by the ludicrous lean toward them being innocent, which they absolutely were not."
Million Pound Menu,"Ehhhh... There's speculation over that. There were nearly 200 coughs recorded from the audience during that taping, plenty coming after wrong answers.

Ingram didn't know Whitock at all, his supposed accomplice who also gained nothing from doing all of this. Whitock himself went on the show and only managed to get to a grand before tapping out. He had a disastrous performance yet he was able to lead Ingram, a member of Mensa (granted, I don't think it's that hard to get onto Mensa really) to a million?

I'm not saying that they're innocent, but there's certainly a lot of reasonable doubt."
Million Pound Menu,I tend to agree but mostly because there was a whole string of questions in the middle that Ingram answered with no coughing help.
Million Pound Menu,"Yeah exactly. I didn't go through everything that supports the Ingrams but like I said there's more than enough reasonable doubt. The fact that Charles Ingram and Whittock had never really met is surely more than enough (unless the theory is also that they did this deliberately to help their defence should they get caught, but that's starting to get a little far fetched) let alone what Whittock would actually stand to gain from helping out what are total strangers. Even if he had met Diana, they didn't know eachother well enough to hatch a plot like that."
Million Pound Menu,"But it wasn‚Äôt just the coughing that gave it away, though. It was Ingram‚Äôs complete lack of knowledge on certain questions.  Typically, a contestant gives an insight into why they go with an answer - usually by showing some knowledge of the topic. Ingram doesn‚Äôt do this on a number of occasions.  

For example, on the question about the city that Baron Haussmann planned, straight off the bat he says he thinks the answer is Berlin (presumably because Haussmann sounds - and is - German).  He even says he doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs Paris, but then inexplicably goes with Paris and is correct.  At no point does he show any kind of knowledge of the topic at all.  Now, you can get lucky once, but this happens multiple times.  
The exact same thing happens on the question about what is 1x10^100 ?  He starts off saying he doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a googol and then inexplicably (and correctly) goes with googol and wins the million pounds - no critical thinking shown and no apparent knowledge of what any of the answers were or meant.

Also, on the the early Craig David question, you can first-hand see his wife coughing over the answer. 

Ingram will claim that it was lucky guesses, but there‚Äôs a reason there have only been a handful of millionaire winners - it‚Äôs really hard to get that far.  If you blindly guess on a question you have a 75% chance of losing, to guess twice and the odds are 93.75% chance of losing.  The odds are against him being that lucky and he supposedly ‚Äúguessed‚Äù more times than that.  
NOW, bring in the fact that all these coughs just happened to coincide with him changing his mind on certain questions - you can see he clearly cheated.

I think their guilt was thoroughly proven.

TL;DR it‚Äôs not just the coughing - a complete lack of knowledge and Ingram‚Äôs inexplicable changing of answers shows he‚Äôs guilty."

Million Pound Menu,"Rupert Murdoch's right wing tabloid the Daily Fail ragging on litter is only a distraction, and it looks like you've fallen for it hook, line, and sinker. Litter is a whole different issue. Anthropogenic Climate Change is something that is preventable if we just take some basic action, or we could just keep waiting and letting things get fucked up. "

Million Pound Menu,you should try watching the video :P
Million Pound Menu,Did you watch the video? 
Million Pound Menu,"It's a joke. The video was about how gop senators refuse to accept climate change because the 'proponents'  of climate change are scientists who study the climate. Ie, they invented climate change to keep themselves in a job. 

So the by extending that line of thinking, OP doesn't accept job stewarts reasoning, as it's his job to make videos on news topics, climate change is a made up news topic surely. "
Million Pound Menu,">is something that is preventable if we just take some basic action

so's littering, isn't it?"
Million Pound Menu,"It is, although I'm not on board with this ideology.. I do travel to cities such as San Fran a lot, which is the self proclaimed birthing of this movement, it is one of the dirtiest cities I've ever visited (only topping that is NYC) 

But I went to Dallas and its BEAUTIFUL spotless... I personally think this movement is moving into a political danger zone where the fringes are going to take over and make the moderates (most people) look bad....  This doesn't help anyones cause.. I'm all for a cleaner planet but at the same time, the amount of work we do gets trumped by the emissions of countries like India and China "
Million Pound Menu,"Litter won't have as drastic of an impact on the environment as Climate Change. As for litter, all of that material still exists regardless of whether it's on the roadside or in a landfill, so anti-littering campaigns tend to be more about having things look good. We need more than cosmetic environmentalism, we need actual reforms that stop the most devastating pollutants and practices (like massive deforestation) from continuing if we want to live long term on this planet. It's all about sustainability. "
Million Pound Menu,"Don't forget Japan.  Their emissions and consumption are well high:

http://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2014/sep/23/carbon-map-which-countries-are-responsible-for-climate-change"
Million Pound Menu,"That's why the climate change debate can't be driven by massive protests made by common people. Common people do common stupid things... like throwing garbage to the ground in a fucking MARCH FOR CLIMATE CHANGE. It only gives climate change deniers ammunition.  
 The debate must be made by the people who actually know what they are talking about, scientists. And by people with the power to change things, politicians. Instead of marching in the streets, people should turn up for elections and vote on politicians who will defend the world's climate. The problem with China is that it is very hard to have internal opposition in that country because well... they are an economic dictatorship. The opposition must come from outside China and somehow force them to take action against climate change. (I really don't know how tho, since they pretty much have every single country in their pocket)"
Million Pound Menu,And there in lies the problem.. Companies here have been under such a tax burden and EPA burden that they had no other choice but to leave..  Even companies like Burger King are leaving...  If we were to set an actual example of industrialization in 2014 then we maybe have a shot of turning the tides but as long as these same people who are littering are also shopping at wal-mart we have an issue 
Million Pound Menu,Amen to that.
Million Pound Menu,"As much as I enjoy watching this show on Netflix (and I watch it a fairly decent amount), there's no way I'm paying for an extra streaming service just for one series. I felt the same way when they announced The Office would be leaving for NBC's streaming service."
Million Pound Menu,I can't even imagine the residuals check those people get each year.
Million Pound Menu,"Netflix spent $100,000,000 to keep Friends for a another year, and WarnerMedia decided to move it to HBOMax anyway in 2020!"
Million Pound Menu,"And it has begun, the streaming services aren't that far from bundling and creating a new digital ""cable"" system. We went in a goddamned circle"
Million Pound Menu,"This is why I just continue to buy DVD sets now. It's not worth the hassle of paying for services when shows keep moving and it's especially not worth the price of one service for one show. Disney+, Hulu, Netflix, HBO Max, NBC. It all adds up. You're better off just paying the price for the complete series or individuals sets for shows on DVD. Cheaper in the long run to be completely fair. I already bought the DVD sets for The Office and Parks and Rec, the latter of which will probably also go to NBC's streaming service."
Million Pound Menu,"Originally, I got Netflix to save money and get rid of cable.  

  

Now, I don't know what to do. Is pirating just going to come back into fashion?"
Million Pound Menu,I find that Friends is still on cable enough that I don't need to have access to it on a streaming service. I wouldn't buy a service just to watch Friends episodes I've already seen 10 times. Good thing Netflix already had a good amount of their own content now that each studio is pulling their own content off in order to get a piece of the pie. I wonder how many of these new services will end up failing for being too late to the party.
Million Pound Menu,"I mean, I can watch it on TBS, since it‚Äôs on 5 days a week for 6 hours a day."
Million Pound Menu,"If a bunch of streaming services start trying to compete and split content off like you are paying for a bunch of channels, people will just go back to pirating. I guess shit really does go in circles."
Million Pound Menu,"Hear that? That be the call of the sea, matey."
Million Pound Menu,"The golden age of streaming ends next year. 

NBC and Warner/HBO don‚Äôt even have to compete with Netflix because streaming services are just a secondary revenue stream. They can throw a few hallmark shows like The Office and Friends on there and rake in whatever fees they can. If it doesn‚Äôt work out, they pull the plug in a few years and people will just watch cable again."
Million Pound Menu,Piracy's back on the menu boys!
Million Pound Menu,"Get back to me when one of these new streaming services is actually successful. It‚Äôs still only Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu.  NONE of these newer services have challenged any of the Big 3.

Not only have they not challenged them, it‚Äôs highly questionable whether any of them have been successful.   DCUniverse is already being shut down (to add to WarnerMedia‚Äôs content), YouTube Red was a failure, I hear YouTube TV isn‚Äôt much better and CBS All-Access is doing so poorly, they won‚Äôt even share their subscriber numbers without lumping them in with Showtime.  Even Disney+ is looking questionable for most people.  Disney now has full control of Hulu, meaning Disney+ will likely just be for their family-friendly content.  The only question there is which service the MCU movies will be locked behind.  They also have Star Wars, but Disney won‚Äôt get back the streaming rights for the first six movies until 2024 (thanks a lot, Kathleen Kennedy).

Companies like WarnerMedia need to understand.  People don‚Äôt subscribe to Netflix to watch Friends.  They watch Friends because they already have a Netflix sub.  No one is leaving Netflix to follow an almost 20 year old TV show they‚Äôve likely already watched."

Million Pound Menu,"I think people need to understand that newer content is just as, if not more important than old content. Netflix is losing many of their legacy shows but they have produced a metric ton of new content these past 5 years. Some of it is disappointing, some is outstanding and most ranges from ""just OK"" to ""really good but could've been great if..."". i think they'll be fine."
Million Pound Menu,"I have zero interest in subscribing to a stream service for a tv show that's 10-15 years old.  I've seen it, I don't need to see it again and if I do, I'd probably be better off getting the blu rays.  In the long run, it would be cheaper.

What I'm interested in is what new and original content any of these services is going to bring.  That is what gains my interest.  That is what would keep me around."
Million Pound Menu,"It‚Äôs the beginning of the streaming wars. Every company and their Grandma now is making their own service for streaming content. The repercussions of this are that you can only pay for so many different streaming services before the costs outweighs the costs of cable. 

Soon we‚Äôre going to start seeing some of these services shutter their doors as the tried and true remain to take market share. I estimate that services such as this Warner service, CBS All Access, and other channel/ company specific services will die first. 

I believe the primary services that‚Äôs survive are likely to be Netflix, Amazon, HBO, and Disney Plus, though I imagine Netflix will be providing primarily original content and will have to find a way to lower their prices to compete with the others, especially Disney whose price is very competitive. 

I‚Äôd like to say Hulu will stay, but I think Hulu will be turned into something else entirely. Truthfully it‚Äôs always confused me as to why Disney created Disney Plus from the ground up when they already had the majority share of Hulu and now own it entirely. I would‚Äôve thought they would‚Äôve rebranded it as Disney Plus, restructured it and re released it to cut back on costs of building the infrastructure. 

In the end I think we‚Äôre hitting the end of the golden age of streaming. Now will be a slow and steady thinning of the herd that will leave only the true players left standing."

Million Pound Menu,The golden age of streaming is coming to an end.
Million Pound Menu,"regardless of your thoughts on the actual show, this is probably a bad thing for Netflix. The Office and Friend brought a *lot* of subscriptions in. 

The way this seems to be going, streaming services are just turning into a more complicated version of cable, where you have to subscribe to a ton to actually get a good variety of shows."
Million Pound Menu,I am not going to have multiple streaming services to watch shows like this.
Million Pound Menu,Ima be straight honest with you. No way in hell am I paying for WarnerMedia‚Äôs Streaming Service or Disney‚Äôs new streaming service. Im not about to be paying for 10 differnet streaming services - its about to end up like Cable but instead of 80 channels its 80 streaming services and you pay 7.99 a month for each. Fuck that shit.
Million Pound Menu,"""Cool, I definitely can't wait to pay another subscription fee to another provider further decentralising my content, I certainly wouldn't consider going back to just watching all my shows for free"" - nobody in human history, 2019"
Million Pound Menu,[deleted]
Million Pound Menu,"No one told me that life was gonna be this way...

My internet connection‚Äôs a joke, streaming is broke

There‚Äôs a new streaming service by AT&Tayyyyyy?!

It‚Äôs like the streaming is always buff-er-ing. And when it doesn‚Äôt load a show, I just turn it off and start to say: 

I‚Äôll cancel Netflix...when the shows fail to load...I‚Äôll cancel Netflix...when I dislike the ‚ÄúHD‚Äù mode...I‚Äôll cancel Netflix...and I‚Äôll cancel Hulu toooooo..."
Million Pound Menu,"I‚Äôm not missing your point. I get exactly what you‚Äôre saying. It‚Äôs not a difficult concept to grasp. I still don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre going to see the popularity of shows like That 70s Show reach the level of The Office, or Friends, or even Parks and Rec. I understand being at the top of the list probably means more viewers, but I also think that quality is a huge factor. I don‚Äôt think shows that aren‚Äôt already on that top level, because they‚Äôre not as good, are going to all of a sudden reach that top level just because they‚Äôre there. That‚Äôs MY point, and it‚Äôs just my opinion."
Million Pound Menu,Just download The Office and Friends now. Problem solved
Million Pound Menu,I'm curious to know what Netflix is gonna look like in 3 years. Originals only? Strike a Deal with Universal to get all their films?
Million Pound Menu,"While streaming will still be better than cable, we are passed the golden years"
Million Pound Menu,Looks like golden days of black flag!
Million Pound Menu,"Yeah I‚Äôm not paying $20 a month for HBO, Friends, and a few Reese Witherspoon cable movies"
Million Pound Menu,Ha. Joke is on them. I just finished it for the 12th time
Million Pound Menu,We had everything so good. Now all of these streaming services are ruining everything.
Million Pound Menu,These companies have completely missed the point. The content is being consumed on the the cheapest platform available. People are broke and sick of paying $200 for cable. People will still choose the best cheapest option and watch whats on that platform. They will now lose major paydays for existing content with the pressure to produce original content just for their platforms.
Million Pound Menu,"we've been complaining for decades we only want to pay for the channels we want to watch.  Now we're getting to pay for only the channels we want to watch and people are complaining they don't want to pay for it.

basically, we only wanted to pay *a little*"
Million Pound Menu,"Good riddance.  I'd rather see Netflix put that money into making more originals than feeding me reruns of stupid sitcoms that have been off the air for over a decade now.  If I wanted that I'd just get cable, FFS."
Million Pound Menu,Is this just in the USA or in Canada too?
Million Pound Menu,"Okay, but can I continue to read about this once a day with my complete FRIENDS boxed set I‚Äôve had before streaming was a thing?

NO MORE

P.S. Netflix non-original content is lacking and the future looks bleak. Their original content isn‚Äôt as good as other things they‚Äôve licensed."
Million Pound Menu,They could replace it with something better like Seinfeld.
Million Pound Menu,"oh my god, now it can only be watched 24/7 in syndication on cable!"
Million Pound Menu,I must be in the minority as I‚Äôve barely rewatched Friends and never got heavily into the Office. So much great new content I can‚Äôt even finish to watch.
Million Pound Menu,It's not even that good of a show.
Million Pound Menu,Bye!
Million Pound Menu,Guess I‚Äôll be buying the Blu-ray collection of the show
Million Pound Menu,">**HBO Max will also be the exclusive streaming home for** all episodes of *The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air* as well as ***Pretty Little Liars***. Those will join all HBO current series and library content including ***Game of Thrones*** and The CW originals starting with *Batwoman* and *Riverdale* spinoff *Katy Keene*.

&#x200B;

So will this essentially replace HBO Now, or will this be another service that they want me to pay for?  The way this was written, it sounds like you'll get everything you get now through HBO Go/Now, but you'll also get a back catalog of WB produced content. Using the HBO name for brand recognition I guess is a smart move on their part, but having three separate streaming services fall under the HBO banner is a bit confusing if they are planning on keeping it that way."
Million Pound Menu,I feel like cable with on demand services are going to be better than cutting the cord in the near future.   I haven't had cable or satellite in about 4 years but it seems like streaming services are just going to get more and more diluted as the number of streaming services increases.
Million Pound Menu,Is Stan available in America?
Million Pound Menu,"Last thing we need is billion streaming services and they all run subscriptions. Gee, I wish I‚Äôd be getting multiple salaries a month as well..."
Million Pound Menu,Didn't even know friends was on Netflix.
Million Pound Menu,So what‚Äôs going to happen now that all these companies want to start their own streaming service? One of the many things I like about Netflix is it‚Äôs acquisition of a lot of old content I could stream. These no way I‚Äôm paying for all these platforms to see content.
Million Pound Menu,"Fuck. Friends is my favourite thing on Netflix.

Good thing I have satellite still, and all the DVDs"
Million Pound Menu,I start to hear these sound of waves hitting the beaches of the bay. The normal guy is can't afford all these services.
Million Pound Menu,Well...Bye
Million Pound Menu,Glad my wife and I streamed it all over a few months.  Now I won't be bummed when it goes bye-bye.
Million Pound Menu,Fantastic!
Million Pound Menu,They are announcing a new streaming service that only streams Friends.  It is called the Friends Streaming Service.  It will cater to all your entertainment needs for only 9.99$/month.
Million Pound Menu,"The same handful of corporations own the content, and the method of delivery. The consumer loses again. God forbid we regulate anything in this country."
Million Pound Menu,"no seinfeld
no friends
what the fuck"
Million Pound Menu,First we were buying streaming subscriptions to save money on purchasing tv series‚Äô. Now I have a feeling we‚Äôll be doing the opposite soon.
Million Pound Menu,Ha! Implying im paying for another streaming service.
Million Pound Menu,[deleted]
Million Pound Menu,"Well, looks like I'm renewing my VPN subscription and sticking to torrenting/Ebay deals if they're going to keep this up.

&#x200B;

Most of these streaming services will fail, regardless. I hope Netflix keeps investing in series, though."
Million Pound Menu,I'm on the verge of cancelling all my streaming services altogether. I'm not about to pay for all of these different ones
Million Pound Menu,So when are these anti-consumer practice is going to end?  it is already illegal for movie companies to only let their movies play in theaters they own.
Million Pound Menu,Looks like its time to do some piracy
Million Pound Menu,I won‚Äôt be surprised if this market division ends with a huge resurgence of piracy.
Million Pound Menu,this streaming service bubble has to burst at some point if it hasn't already
Million Pound Menu,"‚ÄúIll be there for you... Oh, nevermind I won‚Äôt‚Äù"
Million Pound Menu,The streaming service war is heating up.
Million Pound Menu,GOOD
Million Pound Menu,"Hail our lord and saviour, the torrent."
Insatiable,"Loved that show so much. Was gutted it got cancelled, along with so many more. Netflix don't get my money anymore."
Insatiable,"yes... yes... a million times, yes. loved insatiable."
Insatiable,"I enjoyed the first season but never completed the second one.

It got a lot of hate for fat shaming which missed the point imo."
Insatiable,Loved Insatiable it was so campy and over the top. Maybe I'll start a rewatch tonight
Insatiable,I just watched it. Wow. That was a wild ride! Absolutely want more. Any hope??
Insatiable,"Sadly, it got cancelled. We won't see any more of it."
Insatiable,"When Debby Ryan pretty much became a serial killer I could tell the show didn't have much left to offer. Definitely a fun, crazy little program though."
Insatiable,"The show is the most batty, insane, camp shit I've ever seen and I absolutely LOVED it. I'm honestly sad it got canceled."
Insatiable,"I know this is controversial, but I loved the ending. Yep, she's a serial killer. Yep, she's going to kill again. And there's nothing anyone can do about it."
Insatiable,"Sounds right up my alley then! I love out there odd ball crazy shows. Waiting for more Doom Partol, and highly reccomend Dirk Gently, Legion, Maniac, and Happy! if you are into crazy fun."
Insatiable,My favorite was reading reviews trying to figure out how the show was going to push the moral message of what they felt the show should have (Patty learning that looks don‚Äôt matter). And instead she learned that she was overeating to fill the whole in her heart that only murder could patch up.
Insatiable,I miss it. All the deaths in season 2 were unexpected and I like how crazy the show became
Insatiable,batshit crazy is spot on...and its exactly why I loved it lol
Insatiable,"I initially avoided it due to the reviews, but eventually checked it out and couldn't figure out why the reviewers were so offended"
Insatiable,"When does it get nuts?

 I wanna watch but where it gets good."
Insatiable,No wonder The CW passed on it.
Insatiable,I fucking love that show and frankly I‚Äôm considering canceling my Netflix subscription. What‚Äôs the point if everything I like gets axed after 2 seasons
Insatiable,I loved it too! It felt like a new version of Drop Dead Gorgeous.
Insatiable,"If you loved Insatiable, you'll prolly adore The Politician.

Really wish this show got more seasons!"
Insatiable,I couldn't even believe it when the main character ended up being a serial killer without her even noticing. She was always so sorry about killing people but wouldn't stop doing it. Completely insane!
Insatiable,"Yeah, I thought it was a pretty decently contained two-season show. I thought the ending was awesome."
Insatiable,Dexter made it through 8 seasons...
Insatiable,Ahhh! Damn.
Insatiable,Watched all of those except Maniac. We have great yet questionable taste!  This is more like a teen dramedy that goes completely off the rails towards the end of the first season.
Insatiable,"How funny is Maniac? I love dark comedies and Netflix always suggests it to me and calls it one, but the trailer and teasers don't make it seem like one. It's been sitting in my list forever and I've never talked to anyone who has seen it."
Insatiable,"Maybe you will like
Dead like me
Misfits or
Pushing daisy's 
All weird, all good or great"
Insatiable,You could add teenage bounty hunters to that list (another show sadly canceled after one season)
Insatiable,A lot of times the professional reviewers only get to watch the first half of the first season. Not the best way to judge a show.
Insatiable,"The first few episodes are fairly standard dramedy stuff, it gets progressively crazier towards the end of the first season and the last couple episodes are just nuts."
Insatiable,"I mean, have you seen Riverdale lol"
Insatiable,Dexter was a serial killer the entire time.  This show is different.
Insatiable,"I loved Maniac. Very weird and funny...lots of dream sequences and a little sci-fi mixed in. Jonah Hill and Emma Stone were awesome. I'll definitely be checking out Insatiable still though, seems like my kind of weird."
Insatiable,I think it‚Äôs hilarious. Lots of funny characters and weird and awkward situations. Id say give it 2 episodes (1st episode I would say is more fairly normal and not weird yet) and go from there. It‚Äôs definitely a dark comedy though with some mind bendy sci fi mixed in.
Insatiable,Maniac makes you smile a lot more than laugh out loud.  The first two or three episodes are just getting the lead characters into a secretive scientific research program and having them ingest both of the experimental drugs.  I'd say you could just start watching at episode 4 and still get 99% of the fun parts.
Insatiable,I‚Äôve heard good things about those. They are definitely on the ever expanding list of shows I need to watch lol.
Insatiable,I actually just added that to my list yesterday after seeing the trailer. That sucks it‚Äôs only one season. Did they wrap it up nicely at least?
Insatiable,Loved Maniac.
Insatiable,"Sounds right up my alley. I'll finally give it a watch. I appreciate the perspective, stranger."
Insatiable,I actually enjoyed the scientist's plotline more than that of Emma and Jonnah
Insatiable,It‚Äôs a very satisfying season for the most part. Perry episodic. It ends in a cliffhanger that honestly isn‚Äôt as groundbreaking or show running as others
Insatiable,Hope you enjoy it!! I might have to watch it again now actually‚Ä¶
Insatiable,"Apparently, the audience was satiable."
Insatiable,Damn.... season two was great.  Oh well.
Insatiable,"This show was bat shit, and I loved it! The song they sing at the benefit in season 2 had me dying laughing."
Insatiable,Ahh too bad. But I‚Äôd still recommend it to people since it was such a crazy ride.
Insatiable,"Shame. I really enjoyed it. It was super crazy and insane but the acting was phenomenal and it was great fun.

Hopefully the actors get some good work out of it."
Insatiable,I'm devastated. I love this show especially the second season.
Insatiable,"Wouldn‚Äôt it be in Netflix‚Äôs best interest to finish their shows? At least shows that have moderately positive buzz, like this. I‚Äôve read that Netflix only cares about getting new subscribers. So unless a show is a runaway hit, then it is up for the chopping block, because a show that isn‚Äôt a huge success, won‚Äôt bring in a whole lot of new subscribers. But Netflix is slowly gaining this reputation of cancelling shows before they get a proper conclusion. People won‚Äôt even bother starting certain shows, because they know it doesn‚Äôt have an ending. And some people may be hesitant to even start a show, that doesn‚Äôt have a lot of hype surrounding it, because there is the possibility that it may get cancelled in a year or two. These shows live on Netflix forever, unlike a traditional cable network, where cancelled shows are quickly forgotten. People will still see these cancelled shows, while browsing through the catalogue, years down the road, but their value is essentially reduced to zero, since there‚Äôs almost no point in watching them.

Soon Netflix‚Äôs catalogue will be full of half-finished shows, and that will just lower the brand‚Äôs overall reputation, and the value of their catalogue. Sure, it costs money to run these shows, but Netflix spends billions of dollars on their content. They have the money to blow. Also, wouldn‚Äôt continuing an already established show, cost less money than to start a new show from scratch? But what do I know? I‚Äôm no TV exec that knows how to operate a billion dollar company."
Insatiable,But 13 reasons why lives on........again.......
Insatiable,Did it end on a cliffhanger?
Insatiable,"It‚Äôs entirely unsurprising considering the controversy during season one and that they did jack shit to promote season two. It was a fun ride though. I hope Dallas Roberts will do some more dark comedy, he was so fucking hilarious."
Insatiable,Aww Loved this show!!!
Insatiable,noooooooooooooooooooooooo. üò¢
Insatiable,"Really getting fed up with Netflix cancelling everything on cliff hangers. At the moment I can't even think of a Netflix show I have watched, which is no longer being made that hasn't been cancelled on a cliff hanger."
Insatiable,"This show made me feel less alone with my eating disorder and I was excited to see where Patty‚Äôs recovery was going to take her. They really nailed the eating disorder thought and shame and behavior spirals in a way that wasn‚Äôt glorifying. Well I‚Äôm not surprised, I am disappointed in Netflix for canceling this and continuing 13 reasons why which does glorify a lot of stuff."
Insatiable,It still worth watch? The ending for some closure or left many things open?
Insatiable,As is tradition.....
Insatiable,"This is probably the first Netflix show I've only just heard of cos of its cancellation.

Looks good I'll check it out"
Insatiable,"Aww I loved this show, but I figured it wouldnt get a 3rd."
Insatiable,At some point people are going to stop even bothering with Netflix shows.
Insatiable,Enjoyed the first season but wasn't a fan of the second. Oh well.
Insatiable,"Season 1 was great, but 2 went crazy near the end"
Insatiable,"Not really surprised, this show seemed ALL over the damn map"
Insatiable,I never watched the show and had no interest in it but I'm sure netflix will use the money to buy some more foreign shows that *everyone* will watch /s
Insatiable,What do they expect from CW reject.
Insatiable,[deleted]
Insatiable,Sucks Debby Ryan has become such a bad actress as an adult.
Insatiable,Thanks hate groups. /s/
Insatiable,It's Netflix. We will never know.
Insatiable,I thought the first season was better. It was hard for the second season to sustain the levels of crazy.
Insatiable,[deleted]
Insatiable,Debby Ryan impressed me the most. I only had only seen her Disney sitcoms but she showed she can do mature comedy as well
Insatiable,"Yes, it's absolutely in their interest but they are short sighted and focused in the quarter/financial year. One more season and they could have wrapped up this, Santa Clarita, THE OA, just one more god damn season for each and they would be legitimate entries in their catalogue for decades to come. Now they have this half finished confusing catalogue where new subscribers never know if a show is gonna be wrapped up or not."
Insatiable,I don‚Äôt see why one would start to watch a show knowing it‚Äôs canceled and doesn‚Äôt have an ending. I loved Santa Clarita but if I would just find out about it now knowing it was canceled I wouldn‚Äôt watch it. I hate canceled tv shows that have no ending more than a bad show.
Insatiable,"If I find a show with 1-2 seasons and it‚Äôs obviouslg cancelled (it‚Äôs old enough for that) I skip it. Doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs good at that point. It‚Äôs why I haven‚Äôt seen firefly, it would just be irritating.

I‚Äôve rewatched IASIP several times. Netflix needs shows that I want to go back and rewatch when I can find something new. Their backcatalog isn‚Äôt good, at all. Too much cancelled too early or too crappy.

It‚Äôs like they are flinging poo at a wall, to see what sticks. They should work harder on shows before they greenlignt them."
Insatiable,"I had hoped Netflix wouldn't be like network TV.

Every series deserves an ending, even if it's a rushed mess."
Insatiable,It‚Äôs kinda like what‚Äôs been occurring at Nickelodeon for years now. Any show that doesn‚Äôt immediately become a massive hit in the ratings just gets ignored completely for a few years before they just straight up cancel it. And unsurprisingly the time slots those shows had become replaced with SpongeBob reruns.
Insatiable,"These are my thoughts. I do not want to put to much time into there shows knowing that there is an extreme high percentage chance it will get axed even if it is good ""Santa Clarita Diet""

&#x200B;

Netflix is like the opposite of HBO. HBO seems to focus on quality over quantity. Whereas Netflix just piles on with quantity. They have a lot of good shows but like you said the cancelled shows are starting to pile up. 

&#x200B;

I would not be surprised if someone put together a list of all there cancelled shows and what percentage make it to season 1, 2, 3 or more."
Insatiable,"I dunno, shows have been getting axed before a proper ending since forever.  I don't expect netflix to spend money on a show that isn't producing whatever they consider value to their platform.  You start giving every niche show a ""hand out"" final season... that shit adds up fast.  I'm all for proper endings ,but I also don't expect a business to invest in something they already don't think is profitable.  And nobody is going to not use Netflix because it has a bunch of unfinished shows lol.  That's just silly."
Insatiable,You are succumbing to the sunk coast fallacy
Insatiable,"That‚Äôs the stupidest shit, of all the concepts to never need another chapter or continuation."
Insatiable,Probably because it's super popular.
Insatiable,Their next season is their final one.
Insatiable,Like you even have to ask.
Insatiable,Yes.
Insatiable,Yes but in a way it could serve as a series finale.
Insatiable,"It's a Netflix show that had a small, passionate fan base and it got a little bad press in the first season. So yes."
Insatiable,Yeah but thankfully the showrunner sketched out how he was going to end the show in a long interview. I'll edit my comment with the details later.
Insatiable,Noooooooooooooo
Insatiable,"I can think of a few. Bojack (though the producers apparently wanted to go more seasons but we're told season 6 would be the last), Orange, GLOW should be since they were given a heads up about a final season, and Trollhunters.

I've been somewhat lucky in that I haven't watched too many of the early cancellation shows, pretty much just Santa Clarita Diet and I guess the Netflix Marvel shows. But I'm pretty fearful for some of the recent shows I watched. If they cancel Kipo and/or The Dragon Prince I'm gonna be pretty pissed and will probably switch from. subscribing year round to only subscribing part of the year."
Insatiable,That might be our new normal now.  I don't know how I am going to get into any tv show when it has such a high probability of never getting a proper ending.  Like reading half a book.
Insatiable,"Yes definitely. The ending had maybe one cliffhanger but it wasn't anything SUPER big, and yes it would have affected the third season, but not for the main character or the main supporting character. It served as a good finale in my opinion"
Insatiable,"Let me guess, you didnt watch Dark or Casa de Papel because subtitles are too difficult for you?"
Insatiable,"Honestly...it was so much better than other CW shows because it actually handled the crazy well (Riverdale, I'm looking directly at you)."
Insatiable,[deleted]
Insatiable,Grow up
Insatiable,She was perfect for the character and a show that doesn't take itself seriously
Insatiable,Yup. S2 toned down the craziness big time. Leaving us with a very poor drama. I had a feeling the series was gonna get canceled in the middle of watching S2.
Insatiable,That must be new because it wasn't labeled that when season two was first released.
Insatiable,"Yup 100% correct...I watched season 1 of The OA and enjoyed it, after season 2 was released and with the hype that followed I was ready to watch it when I had some time.  Then they announced it was cancelled, so I haven't watched it b/c, ""what's the point?"".....at the same time though I haven't unsubscribed to Netflix so i guess maybe they know what they're doing? lol"
Doctor Prisoner,[deleted]
Doctor Prisoner,"Great write up!


I'm not familiar with most of these, and I watch a shit-ton of TV and movies. I really like the effort, and the writeups are perfect in length.


Again, not knowing these a lot, is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show? (Nothing against non English speakers of course) 


Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.


Totally agree with the couple from White Lotus being great characters, I much preferred season 1 (which seems like a hot take) but those two, specifically the woman, were very interesting characters to me."
Doctor Prisoner,"""hidden gems of 2022 for me"" might be better title for this post.

i must admit some of these plots engaged my curiosity. im gonna look for them. rhanks for the list."
Doctor Prisoner,"How you pick what to watch? I‚Äôm overwhelmed with all these shows in Netflix and I always seem to pick the limited series or those talked about in reddit, especially regarding to the foreign shows or K dramas. There isn‚Äôt much write-ups or reviews in English."
Doctor Prisoner,I am glad and surprised Prisma is number one. Well deserved
Doctor Prisoner,"This is Going to Hurt: I'm a medical student and I thought I'd seen every medical show but this one is on my list now! I've heard that this show shows the reality of a doctor's life without all the glamor of medicine.  
  
This show compared to other medical shows what do you think and what other medical shows have you watched I'm curious!"
Doctor Prisoner,"Insanely odd for the 2 anime to show up to be an average romcom (with crazy production value) and a good but lesser known sequel.

(Oh NVM I thought this was a list from some website not yours! Still surprised to see MDUD though!)"
Doctor Prisoner,"What did Frank Ocean say that one time? ""I got two versions. I got twooo versions‚Ä¶""

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Doctor Prisoner,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
Doctor Prisoner,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.
Doctor Prisoner,No Atlanta? Both seasons last year were incredible
Doctor Prisoner,Pachinko is the most slept on series of 2022
Doctor Prisoner,"1. She hulk
2. Ted lasso
3. Ms Marvel
4. Harley Quinn show
5. Lord of the rings
6. Spy x family 
7. Chainsaw man
8. Loki
9. Mob psycho
10. Hot D"
Doctor Prisoner,Which ones did you see? ü§î amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?
Doctor Prisoner,"> is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
Doctor Prisoner,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
Doctor Prisoner,üôÇüíï
Doctor Prisoner,It‚Äôs great but it‚Äôs depressing.
Doctor Prisoner,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
Doctor Prisoner,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
Doctor Prisoner,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
Doctor Prisoner,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7‚Ä¶ cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
Doctor Prisoner,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
Doctor Prisoner,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
Doctor Prisoner,Oh my bad. I‚Äôm late to the party.
Doctor Prisoner,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
Doctor Prisoner,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

damn. guess i gotta hurry and check this one out now. lol."
Doctor Prisoner,"You should check out Kotaro Lives Alone, such a good show!"
Doctor Prisoner,"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven‚Äôt managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
Doctor Prisoner,I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!
Doctor Prisoner,"I read a book and kinda liked it. 

First episode quite resembled what i remember from book. The only question is: where did he get so much money to live in Bombay without job. As i remember from book he started working soon after arriving to India.

Also it was weird that he ran from prison, a man gave him some money and next thing we see he is on plane with fake passport. I'd like to see more of what he did before flight to know the main character better."
Doctor Prisoner,"Imho, it's amazing. People call it boring but I absolutely love the pacing and all the characters are interesting, except the blond woman lmao."
Doctor Prisoner,"The accents are horrible and pronunciations.  I do not know why they do not cast proper actors who can actually speak the native language fluently. Example: Kader Bhai really cannot speak the language and is just saying some words which sometimes are not even understandable or means nothing. He is a good actor, but for this part it was not not truly for him. Sad they cannot bring authentic actors to the role for series which actually demands it for the storyline to flower in the right way."
Doctor Prisoner,"The women and men equality fear thing made me laugh, I bet it's not in the novel but hey it's 2022 live with the day you incel !"
Doctor Prisoner,Is it worth watching?
Doctor Prisoner,I forgot this was coming out.
Doctor Prisoner,garbage.
Doctor Prisoner,"I think through the first episodes, its very very good.  Probably my favorite book of all time."
Doctor Prisoner,Is there much foul language?
Doctor Prisoner,"I thought he got the money from the robbery. His friend got away. But imo his escape from prison was well done. If it seemed rushed, it‚Äôs not really a huge part of the book beyond him trying to find himself and be a better person. All you need to know is that he was in prison and has a past that he‚Äôs not proud of, and now he‚Äôs in Bombay trying to find himself and rewrite his story."
Doctor Prisoner,"I enjoyed the book, 1st episode seems rushed but then I did read the book years ago. Charlie Hunnam's Australian accent isn't that great but he gives it a good try. As for the ""man"" that gave him money, am I wrong? but from the dialog I'm pretty sure it was his father."
Doctor Prisoner,"Iirc in the book there‚Äôs flashbacks that fill in the backstory. Have you read the sequel? Think it‚Äôs called *The Mountain Shadow* . Absolutely fucking dreadful. Puts *Shantaram* in context a bit, which I‚Äôd (now) describe as a really good story rather poorly written."
Doctor Prisoner,"If I remember correctly from the book, he arrived with cash and didn't work for a while. ~~When visiting his friend's village, he got robbed. Then he moved to the slums and started working.~~"
Doctor Prisoner,"I kind of assumed kader bhai isn't a native, like his driver"
Doctor Prisoner,Yea this is really the toughest part for me when Charlie hunnmans Hindi is better than Khader.
Doctor Prisoner,"After first episode, imo it has potential. Not usually fan of Charlie Hunnam, but he seems more relaxed in this. They should cast him to surfer bro types of roles in the future. He seems more in his element like that."
Doctor Prisoner,"I did not know of the book or the show.   I watched ep1 out of curiosity.  Like it enough to watch ep2 and then ep3 which took me from like to love.  

Alexander Siddig is sublime / superb as Khader Khan."
Doctor Prisoner,Personally I‚Äôm watching just to see what they do but I can‚Äôt imagine watching it without knowing the book that it makes any sense
Doctor Prisoner,I highly recommend it! It just keeps getting better each episode.
Doctor Prisoner,"There's tons of ads about it, especially on reddit"
Doctor Prisoner,If that's a concern to you - grow the fuck up.
Doctor Prisoner,Yes it was his father
Doctor Prisoner,I quite enjoyed *Shantaram* but I had no idea there was a sequel. What was 'dreadful' about it?
Doctor Prisoner,Never knew there was a sequel
Doctor Prisoner,Yep the start of second episodes is about passport and money
Doctor Prisoner,It was dreadful in the sense that it was a blood bath but for me Shantaram wrapped up all that sin into a box with a bow and a lot of loose ends and this completed it.
Doctor Prisoner,I‚Äôm watching it without the book and love it. Makes perfect sense.
Doctor Prisoner,I must be lying...
Doctor Prisoner,That was his teacher
Doctor Prisoner,"I actually enjoyed it too- Shantaram (though not great literature) was a good tale and definitely tapped/taps into a certain zeitgeist. You can barely walk into any tourist joint in India without seeing a gap year backpacker or wandering hippy with a copy propped up on the table. But his sequel seems so overblown in terms of what people praised in the first book. There‚Äôs endless, rambling conversations between Lin & Carla and Lin and a guru-type, full of aphorisms that are clearly intended to be linguistic showpieces and just end up falling flat. It‚Äôs not a re hashing of the original plot exactly but there‚Äôs enough similarities to make it feel lazy."
Doctor Prisoner,"Ok I'm 50/50 on if that's sarcasm or not. Assuming it's not, anyone who uses reddit that doesn't know about this show either doesn't go on a lot or ignores ads completely."
Doctor Prisoner,and what motivation did he have to give him money?
Doctor Prisoner,"I think it‚Äôs important to look into the author here.. this was based off true events yes, but he ultimately was extradited to Australia and went back to jail with time in solitary confinement. Idk if he wrote it in there or after‚Ä¶ but there‚Äôs a little crazy you can see. Lots of time to think this all up in overdone detail. I gave myself allowance to skip a few pages when he was just going off lol"
Doctor Prisoner,"Huh I check this sub multiple times a day but havent seen an ad yet, is this an app thing?"
Doctor Prisoner,üíØ I'm a liar bc you see an ad a lot ü§£
Doctor Prisoner,How can you only be 50/50 that that‚Äôs sarcasm?
Doctor Prisoner,He liked him
Doctor Prisoner,"Probably, I'm on the app and I see it everytime I'm on the home page like 3 times."
Doctor Prisoner,Nah I actually don't know if they were joking or not.
Doctor Prisoner,Same lack of awareness that compelled them to make that stupid comment in the first place
Doctor Prisoner,">A major character or two should have died, which was a missed opportunity to seriously shift the show into a dark, emotional, serious tone. 

You are watching the wrong show.

Just in general, you are watching the wrong show.  Like, I don't know what show you *think* you are watching or want to be watching, but this isn't it."
Doctor Prisoner,"I'm assuming ""let's be honest"" just means ""if you don't agree with me you're so wrong its actually lying"""
Doctor Prisoner,"I'm not going to go point-by-point on everything you brought up, but I think there are answers to just about everything.

There will be plenty of tension between former CK if they try to integrate into MD.  Anthony/Kenny, Tory/Sam, Kyler/Everybody, Penis Breath/Everybody aren't just going to get along swimmingly.

Kreese and Kim may team up to head up CK and they'll still join the tourney.

Silver was arrested but most of the stuff was pretty legally murky.  If they want to reuse him, easy to have his lawyers get him off.

Julie could have her own dojo or otherwise be involved with the running of the tournament, leading to conflict there.

I strongly disagree that someone should have died to make the show darker.  That's not what this show has been about and it shouldn't be.

In the end, I'm not worried.  I've enjoyed every season a lot.  Maybe they'll get it wrong at some point, but I see no reason not to give it the benefit of the doubt until they do."
Doctor Prisoner,">Lets get straight to it. They WASTED an entire great buildup of Terry/Kim and CK vs MD in Season 5 because of the fear that they wouldn‚Äôt get renewed

I thought 5 and 6 were renewed at the same time, with 6 being the last?"
Doctor Prisoner,"Like nearly every show involving legal stuff I just had to ignore the end 

In reality. . . . Terry would not have been arrested.  Legally he was 100% the victim of everything that night  An investigation would eventually be started but that would take a while.  Meanwhile Johnny, Chozen, and Mike get arrested for a bunch of felonies for entering Terry's house and attacking.   Daniel and all the good kids get charged for breaking into Cobra Kai.   Terry was defending himself in his home and then defending his business.  We know he is a snake but legally he was the victim in everything that night."
Doctor Prisoner,"Never saw any of the Karate Kid movies. I thought the first season of Cobra Kai was great and really fresh to do things from Johnny Lawrence perspective.

Season 2 was meh, it sort of became more about Daniel than Johnny, which kinda lost me. Season 3 was good enough, but I was sort of over the gimmick by that point.

I haven't seen season 4/5, there's only so many times, I can watch people not be friends, then be friends, then do karate."
Doctor Prisoner,"For anyone that hasn't watched the original 3 Karate Kid films, this whole series is kinda pointless, imo. Also, imo, 6 seasons will be enough... we dont want to jump the shark here. 6 seasons and it'll be a great, memorable Canon and legacy"
Doctor Prisoner,"Didn't you realize from the stranger things discourse? The only kind of good writing is character deaths. And the more characters die, the better written your show is."
Doctor Prisoner,"Yeah, this is where I stopped reading the post."
Doctor Prisoner,"Its a kids show now?

Look how great the ending of S4 was when it got real dark after Miyagi Do lost and Terry took over

Death is where you draw the line, but seeing Kreese get shanked and Chozen fully sliced on his back is fine? You‚Äôre funny"
Doctor Prisoner,"Lmao  exactly...ah, fucking people today üòÇ"
Doctor Prisoner,Now predict something exciting that will happen next season. You can‚Äôt.
Doctor Prisoner,Writers want more than 6 seasons now. They were saying this before season 5 released
Doctor Prisoner,"...YEEEEEAH, that's kinda why it's called 'fiction'."
Doctor Prisoner,Agreed. My problem is that the writers came out before Season 5 and said they plan to do more than 6. Unless Terry comes back its just dumb
Doctor Prisoner,"People don't understand symbolism or the place a character death has in a narrative. It's all on the nose to them so they think characters should just die randomly because it's ""realistic"" or whatever. Does it matter if the character represents something integral to the plot? Nope just kill him and be white boy quirky like GRRM."
Doctor Prisoner,"Look how great the ending of S4 was when it got real dark after Miyagi Do lost and Terry took over

Death is where you draw the line, but seeing Kreese get shanked and Chozen fully sliced on his back is fine? You‚Äôre funny"
Doctor Prisoner,"Look how great the ending of S4 was when it got real dark after Miyagi Do lost and Terry took over

Doctor Prisoner,"If it doesn't have regular character  deaths, it's a kids' show?"
Doctor Prisoner,What‚Äôs wrong with one major character dying? It would add a serious emotional tone heading into next season
Doctor Prisoner,"Yes, that is an example of shitty writing"
Doctor Prisoner,"In what way? 

Chozen got into a samurai fight and got fucking bladed, which all of you enjoyed. But he can‚Äôt die?"
Doctor Prisoner,K
Doctor Prisoner,Exactly

Doctor Prisoner,"I'll admit I haven'y seen most of these, but I 100% agree with your assessments on the ones I *have* seen. Severance was like a breath of fresh air! Unique, evocative, and humanist. It asks and answers the question: what if we had the ability to manage our pain in a completely nihilistic way? Who would do it and why? The characters, the acting, the symbolisms of the color schemes, the mystery, the horror...Ben Stiller is soooo good behind the camera. And if you like his sensibilities here, check out Escape from Danemora, a biopic abt the woman who helped 2 men escape a high security prison. Also with Patricia Arquette. Ben Stiller directed. This show is one of my top 5 favs this year. 

I usually LOVE shows like From. Unfortunately, it was lacking everything you mentioned. It made a really good premise feel trite and boring :/. 

A show you didn't mention but deserves to be here is Physical on AppleTV. Omg SO GOOD. Rose Byrne (love her!) is a woman with severe eating disorder (tw) who falls into 80s aerobics stardom. It's funny, it's sad, it's entertaining, and if you are someone who has had intrusive thoughts abt your physical appearance and laments what your past decisions have cost you in your life while trying to improve your current situation, this show will speak to you.

Peacemaker is HILARIOUS and surprising. Also in my top 5 this year. Pam and Tommy was good, not great, but I was entertained enough to watch it all. Gave me a whole diff perspective on Pam Anderson and left me feeling angry that no one went to jail over the theft!"
Doctor Prisoner,"Don't agree with you on Bang Bang Baby. Thought it was executed magnificently but agree it could have been tighter. It was produced by the same guy who produced My Brilliant Friend and Young Pope. He also produced The King which came out this year. Think you'd love it: https://youtu.be/soami2tlDH4

Pachinko and Severance were great. The Tourist would have been great with a showrunner and writer like Steven Moffat. Could have been the British/ Aussie Fargo. Conversations with Friends was a waste of time. The book is untranslatable to screen but they still went with it. Peacemaker was great and had heart which was super surprising. Can't wait for the next season!"
Doctor Prisoner,"I like ""workin moms"" on Netflix.  Good 30 minute comedy."
The Chef in a Truck,They shoot for 16-18 hours 6 days a week so it‚Äôs easy to have an off night.  In addition the dinner service is a couple hours but they just show you the couple instances where they mess up.
The Chef in a Truck,"Gordon forbids instant-read thermometers just because it makes for more drama.

Every kitchen uses instant read thermometers. They are a tool, not a crutch."
The Chef in a Truck,[deleted]
The Chef in a Truck,"The producers look for a very specific type of ""chef"" when they cast for the show, they are looking for people who have worked in and even managed professional kitchens but not actual fine dining. Also who have inflated egos and who overestimate their actual cooking skill, preferably with emotional maturity deficiencies.  These producers have figured out there are plenty such people working in food service, and that they the are the perfect set up for the exact type of drama they want to create on the show.

There is a huge difference between working in a run of the mill, ""nice but not fancy"" white table cloth kind of place, and working in a place that has a Michelen star type of reputation on the line. 

Don't get me wrong, all kitchen work is demanding and oftentimes just plain hard, but it really is a whole different ball game working at the highest level of fine dining, where you're expected to hold yourself and everyone around you to the highest possible standards in everything you do. It takes years to fully acclimate to that environment, and even then it is incredibly stressful, daily. In Hell's Kitchen they try to make people who imagine themselves to be seasoned pros and try to acclimate them to that world in a matter of days, and predictably the meltdowns ensue.

No, the episodes are not staged but the dramatic blow ups are highly engineered."
The Chef in a Truck,Its more that its edited to portray things a certain way
The Chef in a Truck,"In the defense of Gordon Ramsay, I do feel as though some of the excessive drama is staged, especially in the latter seasons, but having been a line cook for most of my life, there is a BIG difference between most commercial restaurant kitchens and those of fine dining establishments. 

While I've only worked in hotel kitchens throughout the DMV, I did spend a week in an actual fine dining restaurant in New York and the level of service was on an entirely different plain of existence. 

Even with my experience, there was a much higher level of service and perfection wasnt expected, it was demanded and when I did make mistakes, they spiralled throughout the entire team. 

It was like being a part of a machine and having one bad rotation that then completely threw off the rotation cycle both metaphorically and literally."
The Chef in a Truck,"I'm convinced that all cooking competition shows have producer gremlins. Someone who accidentally lowers or raises the temperature of an oven, removes a needed tool, or makes sure there's only one container of a necessary ingredient to go around.

Not exactly a script, but definitely a way to manufacture drama."
The Chef in a Truck,"This also seems a bit sped up probably. And a lot of these chefs are not experienced. Some are but others have only worked a couple years in kitchens. If you are throwing in the pressure, the speed, the lack of help I don‚Äôt know why you think people trying to compete with others would fail sometimes. You are also comparing a 10 dollar omelette which doesn‚Äôt even get checked probably to a 150 dollar steak which have to meet his standards."
The Chef in a Truck,It‚Äôs real but manufactured competition to create tension and drama. So they don‚Äôt get all the tools and are deliberately placed in very difficult situations.
The Chef in a Truck,"* Dinner service apparently lasts a lot longer. Like hours while serving hundreds of dishes. The camera only catches the moments that they screw up.
* Different kitchen and appliances may play a role. You are cooking in a completely alien environment compared to usual, and even the same recipe can have wildly different result depends on the heat setting etc
* Lots and lots of pressures. Competitors are locked in a dorm with no Internet and ways to contact the outside world (understandable so they can not simply leak the results etc). They also can not contact their family. Accompanied with being bombarded by GR, it happened. 

Also I think it's part of the producer effects to specifically pick certain participants with high ego and what not."
The Chef in a Truck,It‚Äôs not one service u see. U see a week or month of service and usually they have a couple thing of each of the chef to pick over. The whole idea is for tv drama but also works to see how bad each chef will get. It is still a job competition too
The Chef in a Truck,"I ain't no bitch, chef"
The Chef in a Truck,"Trained on other menus, with more room for error, more options to correct mistakes, simpler dishes, etc...

Obvious the show is exaggerated for effect. Ramsey over-fixates on small issues because it makes good tv, but I still believe that not everyone knows how to make risotto, or properly cook Halibut. Working at IHOP doesn't teach you have to nail a scallop."
The Chef in a Truck,"Yes, it's staged, in the sense that the people running the show manipulate the contestants, the situations, and the editing to produce the most drama.

Even though it's called ""reality TV,"" there isn't that much that's real about it."
The Chef in a Truck,"Everyone here has mentioned the grocery list of reasons why it's likely staged. What I just want is for reality television to get its head out of its ass already with the kayfabe shit.

For those unfamiliar with wrestling lingo, kayfabe refers to staying in character. In the pro wrestling industry, it was standard practice up until the late 90s that performers had to stay in character in outside media as well as pretend any ongoing storylines are honest to god reality. Consequences could be severe for anybody who breaks kayfabe, as the industry was fiercely protective of the perception that pro-wrestling is a legit sport. Most people knew it was scripted, of course, but it was often hard to tell at times because nobody really knew.

That's where reality tv is at right now. We all know it's fake, but they still have their heads stuck in the sand pretending we don't. Get rid of all the stupid non-disclosure agreements where you can't talk about behind the scenes stuff even after the airdate. We know about wrestlers keeping razor blades in their wristbands, I want to know if the rumours of remote-controlled appliances are true."
The Chef in a Truck,"u/c_rookie - you want to address this? I wouldn't blame you if not, LOL."
The Chef in a Truck,"I've always felt it was fake, or at least partially. I think there are two real candidates that Ramsay picks then the rest of the chefs are cast to fill a role, much like Big Brother. They add drama with fake scoring of team based challenges, I think a lot of the outcomes from challenges and service are all planned out in advance and they stage things to help the producers narrative play out. 

Just my personal feeling I get when I watch it."
The Chef in a Truck,"everyone is staged. Hells Kitchen isn't the worst but it is one of the biggest. 

Ramsey picks 2-3 out of the list of everyone, then they bring in the rest. Then they go though the show. All of the appliances are 'remote controlled' go with me here. They can turn the stoves off or put the temps in the pizza oven from 400-500 in a second. You see this a lot to build drama. For example scallops. Anyone can cook them but can anyone cook them when the stove get's cooled down without anyone noticing it or heat it up and watch the fire start. Remember, how the spaghetti pot sometimes isn't at a boil and Ramsey yells? Donkey the stove isn't even on but they said they remember it. Yeah. 

It's silly stuff like that. They are always watching on the cameras and after the two weeks, they make a show out of it. Sometimes Ramsey has to reshoot something or you can pick his voice when he has to redub something. Usually, his back is to the camera when it happens. 

Then there is the chaos of calling the tickets. Some of the non-three people have never worked a line in their life. Tickets get called and Ramsey knows which ones are confused... read it back and poof, drama. 

It's not like they can't cook. It's that it's cut on the floor to look like they can't. 

If you watch the food network shows they are better at it but silly stuff still happens. 

I honestly know about all the BS but I still love watching Hells Kitchen. Usually you can pick the top 2-3 out after the third or fourth episode but it's fun to watch them do the dance."
The Chef in a Truck,Tv fake? No way
The Chef in a Truck,It's fake. A 3cstar Michellen restaurant and not a single hair net
The Chef in a Truck,Because capable talented chefs would make for bad tv. I think I stopped somewhere around season 8 when i binged.
The Chef in a Truck,"I‚Äôm sorry are you seriously asking if a reality show is staged?

How stupid are you lmao"
The Chef in a Truck,you can walk right? why arn't you an Olympic marathon runner? it's basically just fast walking right? are you the dumbest walker on earth? why can't you win an olympic gold medal in walking fast?

The Chef in a Truck,"They require the cooks to make everything to-order, and eliminate a lot of shortcuts that any sane chef would use."
The Chef in a Truck,"All reality TV is staged to different degrees, some completely, some partially. Assuming Hell‚Äôs Kitchen is only partially staged you have to realize these chefs are learning a new kitchen, equipment, head chef, recipes, and stations while filming long hours and barely sleeping which helps nudge the drama along. Also, not all of them have experience in a high volume, busy restaurant. 

And don‚Äôt forget, editing can make you see whatever the show runners want you to."
The Chef in a Truck,"One-stress of competition. Two-working with those you really don't know, who are competing against you, in a kitchen not your own, doing plates, not your own."
The Chef in a Truck,"I mean of course it's staged. When they do the challenges it always (99% of the time anyway) comes down to the last dish or whatever to see who wins. Really??? There is NEVER a blowout by one team??? Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the show but that aspect of it always irritates me on every episode."
The Chef in a Truck,"As with ~~most~~ all ""reality"" TV, if it isn't outright scripted, it's mostly staged and the drama and difficulty is contrived to be more than it really is."
The Chef in a Truck,"I'd add that they are thrown at random stations and swap the menu constantly. Yeah, I can see how someone would make 2-3 mistakes over the course of a night (which is often enough to get sent home)."
The Chef in a Truck,"Most reality shows follow the same basic rules:
- Select people with personalities that are considered aggressive or abrasive.
- Keep them stressed out and sleep deprived, or occasionally drunk, to keep emotions and simple mistakes at an all-time high.
- Give them tasks and give them a time limit that is extremely difficult to meet.
- Watch the TV magic happen."
The Chef in a Truck,"when  i bought one for the first time about a year ago it was a lifechanger.. is that pie done in the middle? Before I'd over cook things to 'make sure' and now i stab it, the pumpkin pie filling is 200F and i'm just like yup that's it."
The Chef in a Truck,I remember he told one of the chefs not have one and I remember my girlfriend who was a chef at the time literally saying why? A lot of those things are pretty common now in steakhouses to save on waste. The touch and feel technique is more of a showman thing.
The Chef in a Truck,"This gave me a rage flashback. When I graduated high school my parents were pushing me pretty hard to do some kind of further education, so I picked cooking school. At the time the school was accredited and had a huge rep for being the Place to Go, but I had a really bad time there for several reasons. But I remember that our chef would have us make things like a genoise cake, and he‚Äôd tell us we couldn‚Äôt use stand mixers to whip the egg whites or yolks because ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not how real chefs do it.‚Äù (Wut)

Eventually I caught on that they actually just didn‚Äôt have enough mixers for all of us to use one and I started to get suspicious.

Anyway the environment was crazy toxic overall and I dropped out after about 4 months when my mental health absolutely tanked. My parents were maximum disappointed in me, but I got mad vindicated when the lawsuits against the school started rolling in a few years later, and it was eventually shut down after being repeatedly sued for its false claims about the success they could provide you with if you went there. Which made sense because they would get you internships after you were there for maybe 14 months, and when I quit I was working in a Papa Murphys, and a guy got hired at the Papa Murphys as his internship from the school."
The Chef in a Truck,"I saw a recipe video of his a few days ago.  The dude was making pasta and said in the video ""first you start with the most amazing water"" and I was like I don't think hes really a chef."
The Chef in a Truck,"There have been some past contestants that've talked about how the producers did all they could to fuck with the contestants. Like keeping them standing around for hours while the get enough footage of the food, how they contestants were sleep deprived  so they were constantly on edge. 

Add in the idea that there's a single dramatic person that stirs up trouble that lasts the entire length of the show until the top 5-6, I wouldn't put it past the producers from telling Gordon and the others ""Keep this person around"" and feeding the judges small guidances. It's definitely not staged but it's definitely not some ideal situation where you just have to be a good chef."
The Chef in a Truck,"This is something the other main posts are missing. The episodes are heavily edited, and things are sometimes out of context, stitched together, and shown out of order. If you really pay attention, you can see that the dinner service footage is sometimes not shown in proper order, a lot of times to make it look like someone's reacting to something that happened they're trying to make look like was a big deal when it wasn't."
The Chef in a Truck,Does the DMV have good kitchens?  I assumed if anything it would just be cafeteria and vending machine food.
The Chef in a Truck,"Its a 5-6 hour service that gets condensed into a 20-25 minute segment of the show. Pretty much all of the mistakes get put in the show and it really isn't a lot of them for the overall night but there is a ton of pressure to do good and Gordon really puts on the pressure for every single mistake. 

It's also very stressful because its so fast paced. The show is only filmed in a few weeks. The services are usually every single day, sometimes they skip a day but it's almost always all filmed within 5 or 6 weeks and they are working 12-16 hour days every single day"
The Chef in a Truck,"I totally agree with you on this. Being from the UK, I often see the US reality shows and think how unrealistic and over dramatic they are compared to the ones produced over here. 

It was at this point when I realised that all ""reality"" shows film for 4 or 5 hours a day, and for a week, or a month. Then they just hand pick all the most dramatic and exciting/interesting footage that they imagine will keep people watching, you can imagine how much content ends up on the cutting room floor and how many times people have arguments or screaming fits at each other. 

Same with the talent shows on TV when they have the crazy nutjobs on, you know they were already aware of this before letting them on, so why do it? Just for views, much more interesting than boring people who are talented."
The Chef in a Truck,"I did a lot of restaurant kitchen work back in college and for a while afterwards, so I have a good idea of how the back of the house actually works. It amuses me no end to watch Hell's Kitchen because a lot of the contestants look like they'd struggle to make eggs and sausage for the family on a Sunday morning."
The Chef in a Truck,Even fucking Dr. Phil uses methods like this.
The Chef in a Truck,"Exactly, just shake up the coke bottle til it explodes"
The Chef in a Truck,"That‚Äôs unsafe. You need the pumpkin pie to be over 212 for safe consumption.   You gotta boil that sumbitch

Edit: people really needed the /s huh"
The Chef in a Truck,">he‚Äôd tell us we couldn‚Äôt use stand mixers to whip the egg whites or yolks because ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not how real chefs do it.

Lmao I don't get why schools impose such artificial limitations on students. It's like a programming class that says you're not allowed to use code libraries. But in a professional industry time is money, and everyone uses a library if they can."
The Chef in a Truck,"> lasts the entire length of the show until the top 5-6,

that must be why in the final rounds it gets so professional"
The Chef in a Truck,"It's also been stated that the producers and crew will outright fuck with them in the kitchen, like turn off/change the heat on a burner/stove, hide ingredients, move things from where they left them, etc."
The Chef in a Truck,"He means the DC, Maryland and Virginia corridor. Not the Dept. of Motor Vehicles."
The Chef in a Truck,"Considering I've worked in the cities of D.C, Baltimore, Alexandria and Hyattsville, I would say that assumption is entirely wrong. 

Several of the hotels and restaurants I've worked at in those cities have been highly rated and while not fine dining, the kitchens were rather well to do in most respects. 

I only jumped around because I cant sit still and being young at that time, I wanted to learn everything from everyone. 

Only reason why I remain at my current job is because I'm the only Black female chef there and I'm arrogant enough to say that I can cook circles around my colleagues."
The Chef in a Truck,"I would agree especially risotto and scallions...

THEY ARE BURNED YOU DONKEY!!!!!!!!!!!!"
The Chef in a Truck,"You said ‚Äúeven Dr Phil‚Äù like Dr Phil isn‚Äôt one of the biggest pieces of shit on the planet. He is a grifter, con man."
The Chef in a Truck,LeVar Burton does not endorse or approve boiling any sums of bitches.
The Chef in a Truck,"Not using code libraries at the beginning kind of makes sense though, cause your usually meant to learn Gad algorithms behind those libraries at that point"
The Chef in a Truck,"""Been stated that""? Has there been anything other that a reddit post by a fan suggesting that as a possibility?"
The Chef in a Truck,">and crew will outright fuck with them in the kitchen

Um, isnt there any sexual allegations in this regard? They should outright sue them because of this."
The Chef in a Truck,"DC, Maryland, Virginia."
The Chef in a Truck,I think they thought Dept. of Motor Vehicles lol. As a Baltimoron myself most people that aren't from around dunno DMVü§£
The Chef in a Truck,Oh‚Ä¶. I seriously thought you worked at the Department of Motor Vehicles.  Now it makes sense.
The Chef in a Truck,"It was a season 6 contestant, Tek Moore."
The Chef in a Truck,"Two contestants, Jen Yemola and Tek Moore, both stated that a lot of the drama was artificially created (and that Gordon Ramsey was fed lines through an ear piece).

But really, it's common in reality television."
The Chef in a Truck,"""fuck with them"" means mess with their heads - so if someone leaves the paprika on their station, someone on the crew will grab it and move it to another contestant's station, for example"
The Chef in a Truck,Corrected.
The Chef in a Truck,"You're fine mate, I really need to get out of that Marylander habit of not spelling out that acronym."
The Chef in a Truck,The idea of certain dmvs having high end fine dining is pretty funny.
The Chef in a Truck,"Succession, Succession, Succession!!"
The Chef in a Truck,Daisy Jones and the Six and Swarm look exciting.
The Chef in a Truck,The Mandolorian and Ted Lasso
The Chef in a Truck,Attack on Titan
The Chef in a Truck,"Ted Lasso, Succession, and any news about Severance."
The Chef in a Truck,Part 2 of The Glory.
The Chef in a Truck,"Yellowjackets, Ted Lasso, Mandalorian, Succession, and Big Brother Canada!"
The Chef in a Truck,"I'm really looking forward to The Fall of the House of Usher.

I've enjoyed all of Mike Flanagan's Netflix mini-series (except The Midnight Club, which I haven't seen yet). Midnight Mass was especially good, with some very thoughtful and thought-provoking dialog regarding the nature of sin, guilt, and death."
The Chef in a Truck,"Mando, Ted Lasso, Shadow and Bone, Sanditon, Survivor, Doogie Kalikimeha, and I am intrigued by, but not too hopeful for True Lies."
The Chef in a Truck,Only time yellowjackets and top chef have ever been together in a sentence lol
The Chef in a Truck,"From this group, I am really looking forward to ***Perry Mason***.  The lead actor is one of my favorites (The Americans), and I thought they did a solid job with the character."
The Chef in a Truck,& Ted Lasso!!!
The Chef in a Truck,"shadow and bones, and the mandalorian"
The Chef in a Truck,Yellowjackets is a big one for me.  Ted Lasso and Mandalorian and MLB baseball are the others
The Chef in a Truck,History of the World pt 2!!!!
The Chef in a Truck,I‚Äôm a big sucker for Justin Theroux and political scandal so I‚Äôm very much looking forward to White House Plumbers on HBO later next month
The Chef in a Truck,MLB Opening Day March 30th! Every team is playing on opening day this year
The Chef in a Truck,"Succession far, far above anything else coming out in the same period"
The Chef in a Truck,Party Down Revival
The Chef in a Truck,I think You is by far the fucking dumbest TV show I've ever seen and yet I can't stop watching. I love to hate it.
The Chef in a Truck,Perry Mason was surprisingly good.  Looking forward to Season 2.  Yellowjackets was great too.
The Chef in a Truck,"Daisy Jones and the Six and Succession

I was excited for ‚ÄúYou‚Äù but Part 1 was boring compared to season 3 so I‚Äôll probably still watch it but I‚Äôm less excited for it"
The Chef in a Truck,"The new season of Mandalorian, Shadow and Bone and Ted Lasso. SO MANY NEW THINGS IN MARCH"
The Chef in a Truck,Survivor
The Chef in a Truck,Rabbit hole
The Chef in a Truck,"Uh, like, yeah- fuck you OP. I mean, uh, succession."
The Chef in a Truck,"Yellowjackets, Succession and Mandalorian"
The Chef in a Truck,"* Succession.
* Yellowjackets.
* Lucky Hank."
The Chef in a Truck,There is Succession and then everything else.
The Chef in a Truck,Yes for Perry Mason!! I wasn't sure it was coming back since it's been so long since season 1 came out.
The Chef in a Truck,Attack on Titan Season 4 The Final Season Part 3 Segment A or wherever we're at by now
The Chef in a Truck,"I don't watch any of those... I considered Perry Mason but just never really bothered, I hadn't heard of Yellowjackets until it was halfway done I think but I'll probably watch it eventually.

There's a few things starting in March but I'm most looking forward to Ted Lasso... but I'll also be watching Superman & Lois, Shadow and Bone, Sanditon and The Mandalorian. 

I'm actually more looking forward to April with season premieres of Schmigadoon, Single Drunk Female, From and The Afterparty... and whenever the final season of Endeavour starts on PBS, hopefully won't be too long."
The Chef in a Truck,So hyped with top chef and Ted lasso
The Chef in a Truck,Yellowjackets! Ready for the cannibalism
The Chef in a Truck,Barry
The Chef in a Truck,How is Yellow Jackets? Been on my list to watch just haven‚Äôt had the chance to start it
Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-,"I dont really agree with most of these choices, but that‚Äôs what opinions are for.

I do want to applaud the inclusion of ZeroZeroZero. It‚Äôs been overlooked and it‚Äôs an excellent show. Amazon did it dirty by releasing it the same time as their misfire about Nazi hunters and failing to promote it."
Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-,"Hey random reddit reviewer,

I've been using your reviews for several months now (since quarantine began really). You write a lot of them, so they're a great litmus test for if a new tv show is worth the time investment. even if I enjoy watching some schlock a lot more than you.

Please don't let these naysayers down your spirits. Even if some might be struggling to understand why you would rate non-schlock 100%-attentive shows so highly. There's more scripted content these years then ever before, so when someone starts naming their favorite shows that aren't part of the broader talkoshere, they get worried that they haven't invested their time in the cream of the crop. 

My favorite new show this was probably We Are Who We Are. I have had Desenfranadas on my netflix queue for so long theyve changed the name of it to something else, so I'll need to catch up to that one.

One last point; I think a lot of people here think everyone derives enjoyment from run-of-the-mill comedy/fantasy/sci-fi big budget monstrosities/""guilty pleasures"". I can find things to like in these, like the soundtrack and the production values, but I truly look foward to tv shows that try something different. Your guides have been a great source of that.

Cheers,
Fellow avid tv show consumer


Edit: i didnt see at first you put My Brillian Friend s2 on the list. I love Richter's soundtrack for this one so much I've learned most of it."
Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-,"Do you ever get bored about watching shows featuring race, gender, privilege, or journeys of self-discovery? Seems to be every show on this list just about.

Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-,"Holy shit, people are downvoting you! Thank you for the list and review man, so many unseen ones!

To me, this year was saved by Raised by Wolves"

Thanks!"
Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-,I May Destroy You?
Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-,Sounds like someone needs to see Ted Lasso.
Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-,People mad OP didn't put more mainstream and US shows. It's so stupid. Anyway I watched very few shows on your list ZeroZeroZero was so good I was surprised it didn't get discussed more. I didn't watch the second season of L'amica geniale but the first one was amazing
Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-,I feel like Dispatches From Elsewhere would be a good addition to this list. It didn't get a lot of pub but it was one of the most earnest and heartfelt shows I'd seen in a while.
Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-,"unrevised version of list (before possible recency bias):

Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-,Interesting list and write-up. Haven't seen or heard about these shows much but I'll definitely check out those Netflix shows. Thank you.
Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-,"Everyone's ganging up on you because you aren't a normie (welcome to contemporary US television audiences). I want to say keep on trucking. Every art field has a lot of xenophobia in US mainstream culture, but maybe none more so than television. I looked at several top critics' picks this year that had a top twenty with nary a pick outside the US/UK.

Surely someone outside the US/UK has made quality television. I mean, the critics that have looked at movies have done the bare minimum and found at least a few year in year out. And all television really is is a bunch of short movies that follow some sort of theme or idea.

All of that said, while you give luscious descriptions I don't know if many of these things interest me. I'm kind of done with the post-2010's melodrama and Rich People Problems stuff. Tower of God and ZeroZeroZero sound cool, though."
Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-,the fact that attack on titan isn't on here is a crime
Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-,is OP a feminist?
Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-,"Great list, keep up the great work"
Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-,"I am so glad Dave made this list. I have been a Lil Dicky fan since he first started getting big on Reddit. I wasn't expecting a lot from the show, so when I saw it I was dumbfounded. I would recommend that to anyone."
Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-,Bad list is bad.
Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-,Am I the only one who feels like nothing good aired this year besides What We Do In The Shadows? I blame COVID.
Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-,You should watch Normal People on Hulu. It'll end up on your list.
Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-,"Pretentious, but not as pretentious as av club."
Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-,You need to branch out A LOT.   You have some very odd tastes but I guess that‚Äôs just what you like.
Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-,"*Tower of God* but no *Re:Zero*? Damn. 

Even if I very much disagree with Re: Zero being left on any list. I‚Äôm glad to see one without *Lovecraft Country*. That show was such a dumpster fire I‚Äôm not sure how any competent person could watch it and says it‚Äôs good, let alone one of the best of the year."
Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-,Do you tell people that you own many leather bound books?
Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-,"Hey, have you watched: Alex Rider, Alice in Borderland, Someone Has to Die, The Flight Attendant, The Great, To the Lake? These have all been released this year so I was wondering if you'd watched them. I've been reading some of your reviews and you write pretty well, although I don't necessarily agree with all your opinions."
Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-,"I wasn't aware that Juno Temple was in another project titled Little Birds, so I thought you randomly threw a 2011 film on the list. I will have to check that out, as well as a few others."
Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-,Sounds like you would like Suburra on Netflix based on this list.
Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-,Part of why I love end of the year lists is that I often discover shows (or movies) I never knew existed and/or am given a reason to try a show I might have skipped.  Your list definitely inspires that.  Bonus points for articulating why the shows worked for you.
Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-,Tower of god (webtoon) is one of my favorite pieces of writing ever. The anime isnt that great imo
Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-,What a great list. But please refrain from adding Japanese shows. No way that any is worthy of the top 25.
Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-,"> the same time as their misfire about Nazi hunters

What show do you mean?"
Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-,"Haven‚Äôt heard of zerozerozero but it sounds right up my alley. I‚Äôll check it out, thanks"
Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-,yep OP is definitely suffering from Wokeism
Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-,"I like that OP sticks to their guns, but some of their choices are not great to me.

Desenfrenadas in particular I found just laughably bad in how clumsily it tried to present real meaningful subjects but fell terribly short with its transparent privileged fantasy idea of what struggle in the ground looks like. It takes checklist, cliched characters that it thinks will benefit from a taste of ""real life"", but the test it makes them endure, beneath the thin layer of modern coating is terribly old fashioned and cliched too and it doesn't realize ever seem to realize its vision of reality is just testament that no one involved has ever gone on a crash course road trip in places like the ones it depicts. I found the all the leads (besides lucia bracho, who is the best, deserves better than this and I hope gets a vehicle soon) wooden, stiff, perpetually-instagram-posed and unlikable.

Also, it didn't help that it's just the exact kind of ""nuMexico vibe"" mexicans like me are extremely tired of.

And even after all of that, it just doesn't have a great structure. I had to hyper sweep the show for a sort of documentary job and it has a lot of cracks. 

But I also thought my brilliant friend s2 was great, even if it fell quite a bit shy of S1 for me, which I just adoooored. So we're a bit in tune maybe."
Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-,"OP is of course free to like whatever they like, but I think the reason people are giving them grief is more because they give off a really strong vibe of pretentiousness.

Yea as i said I'm hella biased against this show. It's something i didn't particularly enjoy... but can't necessarily say it's *bad*. I don't know, maybe it's because it kinda reminds me of my favorite film franchise 'The Before Trilogy', acting like a cheap imitation of that. Or maybe because of the sex scenes that reminded me of Fifty Shades of Grey... or idk, I just wasn't feeling it.

like where?

But.... that's exactly what it is. As I said in another comment here, art is subjective, and any end-of-year list you see, whether posted on AV Club, Deadline, Variety, YouTube etc. will always be the author's opinion and limited to what the author has seen this year. Go on Variety and look at one of their ""Top TV Shows of 2020"" list.. now look at name of the author in that little box below the title, that's their ""favorite TV shows of 2020"".

I do too... good writing, good acting, beautiful visuals and good production values all round, but a lot of shows have those elements, what I'm saying is for me to consider it noteworthy or outstanding, originality, creativity and uniqueness are the 3 main factors that must be there... along with the essentials.

Nah, let's admit most people come into posts like these expecting to see shows they've watched and regard highly, obviously this isn't that for most, so no i didn't make it expecting people here to like it.... but honestly it's going better than i expected.

Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-,"Ted Lasso is a comedy, it leans heavily on the goofiness of its main character. The funniest show you have on your list is... Dave? That's what I mean when I say your list is humourless.

You have so many shows on your list of people facing trauma or going through a personal journey. Most people don't enjoy that. People like watching escapist tv where characters are solving problems and going on actual journeys and landing in humorous situations, your list has nearly none of that. Your list takes the joy out of watching tv and makes it a chore.

And when you say stuff like ""what matters to people is what's mainstream and popular"", you will get called pretentious. Makes it seem like you don't care about the quality of a show, you only want people to know how unique and special you are. I don't think r/television only follows what is popular, it follows the higher end of what the male 18-34 demo follows, and it doesn't seem like you are part or at least don't understand that demo at all.

Also, lists like AV and stuff are usually a collaborative effort, so it's usually not just one person's opinion and meant to be more all-encompassing than a random video on Youtube. And you really don't see many random ""top tv shows of 2020"" Youtube videos being posted here. You'll probably see more vitriolic criticism being spewed at those videos in the comments than what you are getting in this thread."
Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-,"> The funniest show you have on your list is... Dave? That's what I mean when I say your list is humourless.

Yea... you right. But don't be dissing Dave though. üòÇ

> You have so many shows on your list of people facing trauma or going through a personal journey.

Lol you right as fuck.... and i'll admit, this is something i didn't even realize before you said it, but the top 3 are essentially very similar shows story-wise, characters on self-discovering journeys. Lol you got me there. 

But see the thing is (*and this is something I guess I should've noted separately in the post, even though I did in some of the reviews*), I'm not just rating these shows based on just plot, im rating based off the way they chose to tell their stories, their visuals/cinematography or style, their production values etc. 

for eg. Partisan is ranked no. 9, but it has absolutely garbage ass plot that by the end leaves you quite unsatisfied (that's why I barely mentioned it), but it has beautifully unique cinematography and the way it builds mystery and tension with its cold and isolated atmosphere is quite innovating, thus... it makes the list. 

So Ted Lasso is good, it tells a decently good story, but how did it tell it? Was it innovative? Did it do anything creative like Dave's ""Jail"" music video montage? Was it doing anything special visually? ... or was it just pretty typically straightforward in the way it presented itself? (which it was in my opinion)

> Your list takes the joy out of watching tv and makes it a chore.

Shit that's pretty harsh... but I can't argue. I guess most of these aren't necessarily 'fun' shows. No. 1 is though (but demographic might be an issue there as you mentioned as it's a very female driven series. üòÖ)

> ""what matters to people is what's mainstream and popular""

Is that what I said or did you misquote? üòï I feel like that's not what I typed. But if it was that's not what I meant. 

> Makes it seem like you don't care about the quality of a show, you only want people to know how unique and special you are.

But... ""quality"" is subjective. üòï Unless you mean ""quality"" as in production values well that is less subjective but that's not an issue on this list i promise you. 

And no if I come off like that I really don't mean to at all... like why would anyone even think that? üòï it's just TV shows. I'm passionate about TV shows. I've been posting and rating TV shows all year, it's really just for fun. Something I decided to commit to earlier this year because I had a rough year last year. Im just giving my opinions on TV shows. Another commenter called be a snob... and I'm baffled cause I don't know how I'm coming off like that or how to stop coming off like that. It really got me down."
Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-,"I hear you, I didn't call you pretentious myself (the poster I was responding to did), and I don't think you're trying to make it seem like your taste is better than anyone else's. People like what they like. But I do think you're putting too much of a premium on creativity and not enough on the pure enjoyment that you get out of a show.

I don't rate Lasso as highly as some people here do, but I still think it is a fantastic show. It may not be as creative as a show like Dave, but it provides joy and satisfaction that Dave could never give. You need to give more thought about what you simply enjoyed watching over what you thought was unique. A show can be derivative and still have quality at the same time. A show's quality should depend on how it makes you feel. That's why I think people are calling you a snob, because you're treating these shows like cases to study rather than what they are, escapist fantasies to be enjoyed.

I'll just give you an example, I think Queen's Gambit is infinitely better than Unorthodox, because Gambit is an uplifting story with well-fleshed out characters and a polished look, that doesn't demonize anyone and has no real villains (that last part makes it easily more unique than 99% of shows). Unorthodox, on the other hand, is not nearly as pretty of a show, and beats you over the head with the cartoonishly dumb orthodox Jew characters and a boring naive main character with zero charm. What could have been a good character study about a woman's struggle with her faith turns into a story of female persecution, which I thought made it completely unenjoyable by the end. But you have Unorthodox ranked higher than Queen's Gambit, with a much more muted description for the former as well. What you said about Gambit, ""one that actually takes our main character places, through losses, wins, good times and bad times"", people care more about than what you said for Unorthodox, a ""self-identifying and freedom-discovering story"". That I think is what people find snobby... you're placing a premium on things that don't matter to most people."
Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-,"> But I do think you're putting too much of a premium on creativity and not enough on the pure enjoyment that you get out of a show.

I mean... read the note at the very top of the post:


> *shows were chosen based on originality, creativity and uniqueness (as those are 3 main factors I look for in TV shows).*

..... that's what i enjoy. Those are the things I look for in TV shows. I'm fully enjoying a TV show when it's unique, creative, when it's giving me something I've never seen before. When it's being presented in a way I've never seen before. And as we agreed, the list is made by me, my opinion, my favorites. That's why at the start of the post, I tell people what I look for/want from a TV show. Creativity, originality and uniqueness, that's what the list is based on. 

Also keep in mind that I watch a lot more TV than the average viewer. Not to be a snob, as the commenters said lol, but after you've watched over a 1000 TV shows you tend to crave stuff you haven't seen before. 

> That I think is what people find snobby... you're placing a premium on things that don't matter to most people.

Yeah, you probably right. But what did you want me to do tailor the list for /r/television? Fill the list with the most talked about shows on here. Think of any critic, would they do that? Think of music critic Antony Fantano, would he fill his ""Top 20 Albums of the Year"" list with selections that his comment section favored, or would it be filled with music that he enjoys? music that probably sways on the experimental side because just like me he's looking to be wowed by stuff he haven't heard before.

Also, The Queen's Gambit and Unorthodox aren't that far off in my head quality wise. I gave Queen's Gambit a 8.0 and Unorthodox a 8.3... and the only reason is because I liked Unorthodox directing and clean aesthetics more. They are both equally great stories to me. üòÑ

But anywhooooooooo! I actually really enjoyed this convo. I wanted you to check out the Top 25 list I made back in 2017 and tell me what you think... but it's on another site, I'd have to pm you the link."

Dark Blue Kiss,"I'd like to reiterate, fuck Caillou."
Dark Blue Kiss,here's a [good read on Total Drama Island](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/uptttz/animation_the_tragedy_of_total_drama_reunion_how/) from the r/HobbyDrama subreddit
Dark Blue Kiss,This was a great read.
Dark Blue Kiss,"That was quite the word vomit, and I remember Teletoon fondly as a kid watching it on weekends during sleepovers at friends places. How are you going to write all that and not mention some greats like:

-	Roughnecks (Animated Starship Troopers)
-	The Oblongs
-	Undergrads
-	Mission Hill
-	The Critic
-	Tripping the Rift

And some weirder ones like Home Movies, Quads!, and god knows what else I can‚Äôt quite remember. I do recall Cybersix being a little over my head as a kid though and thought the main character was actually a dude for awhile lol.

Edit - I also rewatched the entirety of Roughnecks recently and it actually holds up pretty damn well. The voice acting is done well, and even though the CGI is from that era, it was really well done. I had never seen it all the way through when I was younger due to missing episodes and their infamously bad release schedule, but it was well worth the time to watch. The last season got cut short and it could have ended more cleanly, but I still enjoyed it thoroughly even after all these years."
Dark Blue Kiss,"I was there for the silver age. 

I really liked Delilah and Julius. 

And one I didn't see mentioned later on was Detentionaire. Came in 2011-2015 and was pretty good."
Dark Blue Kiss,"I remember watching Undergrads and Clone high on Teletoon, you mentioned so many shows I totally forgot about....What a loss, but it was time."
Dark Blue Kiss,Teletoon was such a big part of my childhood. I used to watch scooby doo every day after school.
Dark Blue Kiss,Neds newt was the shit. You missed Dragon Ball
Dark Blue Kiss,"Omg I forgot about Megababies. The theme song immediately started playing in my head. I LOVED Braceface and For Better Or For Worse! Ugh I grew up on Teletoon, from the mid/late nineties till about 2004. This post was so nostalgic."
Dark Blue Kiss,"This post was a huge nostalgia trip for myself. Just thinking back there are so many shows that I enjoyed that actually were Teletoon originals and I just didn't realize it - it's kind of amazing! Teletoon circa 2005 through 2009 was my favourite period, mostly because of all the cool action-adventure shows that premiered in that time. I loved watching Chaotic, Bakugan, Spider Riders, Atomic Betty, and Skyland. I did also enjoy 6teen, the first season of Total Drama Island, and Johnny Test, but I never watched them consistently. From their earlier blocks, I will always have a soft spot for The Tofus, What About Mimi, What's with Andy (though admittedly I mostly watched the Romanian dub for this), Rescue Heroes, Maggie and the Ferocious Beast, The Kids from Room 402 (mostly the Romanian dub again)...and the theme song from Flying Rhino Junior High will still occasionally get stuck in my head :P 

I just hope that all these shows will be made more accessible for more folks to enjoy in future and not get put into an inconspicuous vault/removed from streaming without warning."
Dark Blue Kiss,I just bought the entire Redwall book series. 20+ books. Hoping it gets another shot at the screen because it's prime for adaptation imo
Dark Blue Kiss,"I grew up in Quebec and teletoon was my childhood. I remember it had the best animated series out there even before series that had continuity(not episodic) was a thing. Redwall, silvering and toad patrol were amazing."
Dark Blue Kiss,"My parents didnt want to get more than the basic tv package, we didnt have the Teletoon channels, much to my chagrin.

Channel 44 for us, I think that was the french version.

We had to make do with VrakTv (25) and YTV (70?)."
Dark Blue Kiss,Anyone remember Untalkative Bunny? That's the first thing that comes to mind when I think of Teletoon
Dark Blue Kiss,"Man I thought I was the only one who remembered Mega Babies.

Also shout out to weeknights from 8-9pm when The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show was on."
Dark Blue Kiss,Delta state was the shit!
Dark Blue Kiss,"Don't forget Clone High! The late night era with Undergrads, Oblongs, Mission hill and Clone High was the best."
Dark Blue Kiss,Dragon Ball was on YTV
Dark Blue Kiss,I knew I was forgetting one. Clone High was amazing.
Dark Blue Kiss,It was on both actually
Dark Blue Kiss,I seem to remember Sons of Butcher playing in that era with those shows but that might‚Äôve been YTV
Dark Blue Kiss,"Ah, I see now. They aired 13 episodes in 1997. So yeah you're *technically* correct, but I think most Canadian kids who grew up in that era would remember it as a YTV show."
Dark Blue Kiss,Saw that too and I swear they had more than 14 episodes. It was a long time ago so who knows
Dark Blue Kiss,"The most popular shows in the U.S. are not the most popular U.S. shows in the rest of the world.

Looking at the average of  American shows gives you no idea of what American shows are being watched outside of the U.S."
Dark Blue Kiss,"I get a little of what you're saying but maybe watch more stuff? There's loads of famous blondes. Supernatural, Buffy, Doherty, Shatner, MacLachlan, and Kate Jackson is a really weird mish mash of random TV and it just feel like you're naming stuff you like rather than naming the biggest ones. As though you almost intentionally picked a strange group of examples. Kate Jackson is a weird choice especially since she was always dwarfed in fame by the blonde blue eyed actress that was on the same show she is best known for.

Example, I'm checking back through people nominated for the Emmy for best actress in recent years and about 50% of them have blonde hair in their role."
Dark Blue Kiss,"There aren't normally natural blonds let alone tall women from Asian countries.  Since that stands out in American films and TV... it's not a big surprise that we'd get thought of that way.  And to be fair, every one of my kids started out with blond hair even though it changed as they got older... same for myself and my wife."
Dark Blue Kiss,"Mae West, Marylin Monroe, jayne mansfield,....

They were/are the ""face of american women"" in movies for almost a century and they were blonde

Dark Blue Kiss,"Just an FYI... I don't think the word foreigners is as frequently used today, and not sure what is the preferred description;  perhaps overseas friends, internation\ally, Europeans..."
Dark Blue Kiss,"Because a lot of the swarthy whites from states around the coasts arent always the most iconic americans.. When foreigners think of Americans they think of people like Stone cold Steve Austin (blond before going bald), or James Hetfield from Metallica (blond his whole life before going gray). A lot of Americans in the midwestern states are blond due to the Germam/Scandinavian lineage, while around the coasts and urban cities of the North East (let alone the west coast that is overwhelmingly east asian and hispanic) most of the whites are swarthy ethnic whites or mixed raced people with pseudo-white looks.."
Dark Blue Kiss,"> Baywatch was ignored in the U.S. 

Cultural phenomenon."
Dark Blue Kiss,Baywatch was absolutely not ignored in the US. Maybe you‚Äôre thinking of how David Hasselhoff was much more popular overseas than in the US.
Dark Blue Kiss,"Still proves my point. For example Jaclyn Smith lasted far longer than any of the original Angels and Fawcett didn't stay long in the show leaving by season 1 and the show was an ensemble cast anyway so its not like Farrah hogged the limelght even when she was around.


The simple fact s the overwhelming majority of TV shows, even niche stuff, have far more dark haired people than blondes. 24, X-Files, Monk, practically almost every American TV show. So for someone telling me to watch more,  I find it amusing you neglect David Carradine and Chuck Norris and so many are who make up the majority and not Jeannie Garth and Amanda Seyfried.

Even shows with lead blondes still have far more brunettes on the cast that it makes the blonde blue eyed American stereotype ridiculous. Does anyone not remember Baywatch had some brunette Vixens too? 


The Emmy doesn't even make sense as an example because some of those blond roles appear in their natural dark hair color so anyone outside of America who's big into TV should already know just by watching the Emmy that some of their fav characters aren't even real blondes. And 50%-that means the other half aren't blondes either so how the stereotype came to be s nonsense.


I mean nobody remembers that half the cast of Friends as brunettes?  Even Rachel often made her hair dark in some seasons."
Dark Blue Kiss,"I know Xena is New Zealander but thats beside the point sinceshe's a TV icon...........


Which proves your point so wrong because we're talking about TV celebrities, not movie stars. And even in movie stars your list is dubious because not only are more recent actresses just as famous if not more so such as Carrie Fisher, but even during the listed old movie stars' peak they except maybe Marilyn weren't the top face of the American industry. Gene Tierney, Rita Hayworth, Jane Russell, etc were just as Big and even surpassed them in the A List except Marilyn. And Marilyn has A listers symbolic of America as she is even in around her era of career like Elizabeth Taylor."
Dark Blue Kiss,"Except even in Golden Age Hollywood..... Most of out stars were brunettes? Vivien Leigh for example? Nathalie Wood?  Elizabeth Taylor? Even the First Lady of Cinema Lilian Gish despite being blonde, was often assumed to be a brunette because the white and black silent film cameras often showed her having brown hair. Most casual movie goers of Silent era didn't know sh was actually a natural yellow haired blonde."
Dark Blue Kiss,Why do you think blonde is an American stereotype
Dark Blue Kiss,"Because friends represent the typical swarthy whites from the east coast or something.. who usually are irish/italian mi, or just plain italians, jewish/italian and people with distant or recent hispanic ancestry..."

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Dark Blue Kiss,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
Dark Blue Kiss,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.
Dark Blue Kiss,No Atlanta? Both seasons last year were incredible
Dark Blue Kiss,Pachinko is the most slept on series of 2022
Dark Blue Kiss,"1. She hulk
2. Ted lasso
3. Ms Marvel
4. Harley Quinn show
5. Lord of the rings
6. Spy x family 
7. Chainsaw man
8. Loki
9. Mob psycho
10. Hot D"
Dark Blue Kiss,Which ones did you see? ü§î amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?
Dark Blue Kiss,"> is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
Dark Blue Kiss,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
Dark Blue Kiss,üôÇüíï
Dark Blue Kiss,It‚Äôs great but it‚Äôs depressing.
Dark Blue Kiss,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
Dark Blue Kiss,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
Dark Blue Kiss,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
Dark Blue Kiss,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7‚Ä¶ cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
Dark Blue Kiss,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
Dark Blue Kiss,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
Dark Blue Kiss,Oh my bad. I‚Äôm late to the party.
Dark Blue Kiss,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
Dark Blue Kiss,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

damn. guess i gotta hurry and check this one out now. lol."
Dark Blue Kiss,"You should check out Kotaro Lives Alone, such a good show!"
Dark Blue Kiss,"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven‚Äôt managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
Dark Blue Kiss,I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!
Dark Blue Kiss,"I‚Äôm liking the show so far, but Dakota will always be the perfect book Lyra to me. The show seems to be going for a very different version of the character."
Dark Blue Kiss,"Say what you will about the movie's treatment of the magesterium, but I don't know if I've ever seen a movie that was more perfectly cast than The Golden Compass. I'm a huge fan of the books but I also like the movie because of how perfect the casting was... People go hard on it for tiptoeing around the religious stuff, but it's still a really fun and engaging film.  It's a shame that they were so reined in. With that cast, the effects, the directing, etc, it all could have amounted to one of the greatest spectacle franchises of all time.  I'm finding it difficult to buy into the series because I still see so many of them as other actors, and I get annoyed seeing so many humans on screen that appear to not have daemons (I know it's just a budget thing, but come on).

I always thought that they would get to the darker aspects in future films, but, yea, the ending is really rushed in The Golden Compass.  For people who are quick to call the film dogshit, what is it that you dislike so much? Is it just that they didn't go full anti-religion?  Or are there other parts that don't work for you?"
Dark Blue Kiss,"I was wondering if she was gonna watch it.

I wish she can get at least a small role in the series, as a little wink !"
Dark Blue Kiss,"I was talking about the show with a friend and he sent me a link to the first 90 seconds or so of The Golden Compass movie. Honestly, watching that 90 seconds of movie makes the show make *sooo much more sense.*"
Dark Blue Kiss,Dafne is great
Dark Blue Kiss,"I havent watched the show yet, but I agreed that Dakota had the perfect vibe for book Lyra. I think the cast of the movie was mostly spot on, even if the movie itself was awful. How is the show's version of Lyra different?"
Dark Blue Kiss,"The whole look of the show in general is just way, way off. The film had its issues but the characters and environments were on point. Don't get me wrong, the show is great overall."
Dark Blue Kiss,"I loved Logan and i'm really enjoying His Dark Materials, but i need to say it. Dafne Keen is a HORRIBLE actress, she is the main negative thing in the show. Her expressions are awkward and don't match with the situations (i mean, in the last episode she was told the truth about his father, and that cry try was awful)."
Dark Blue Kiss,"The whole movie felt really rushed to me. Like reading the book's SparkNotes. I also feel like you'd probably be pretty lost if you weren't at least a little familiar with the source material, which is a bad look for an adaptation. 

Fun(ish) fact - the original cliffhanger end of book 1 was filmed, but the studio insisted the movie end before it in case they didn't get a sequel (ok move in the end, I guess.) It would have been the opening of the second film."
Dark Blue Kiss,the problem people had (including me) with the movie was how sugarcoated it was compared to book like it felt like family friendly film and the show seems like it's fixing that
Dark Blue Kiss,"> I get annoyed seeing so many humans on screen that appear to not have daemons (I know it's just a budget thing, but come on).

tbh that seemed more like a problem in the first episode. In the two following episodes the daemons are much more present."
Dark Blue Kiss,I always saw Mrs Coulter as Nicole Kidman. That was one thing I was happy with.
Dark Blue Kiss,"This Lyra is a lot more fearful and angry. Lyra of the movie (and I'd argue the books) was almost deliriously entertained by all the things going on around her, and greatly enjoyed making up stories and lies and manipulating the adults around her [spoiler](#s ""until the horrendous things she witnesses at Bolvangar."") I like the book version because the connection between her and her mother are so clear, and it makes that reveal all the more horrifying. Not to say I think they're going the wrong direction in the show - I think this take is a little darker, and a bubbly and overly confident character would have been a distraction from the tone."
Dark Blue Kiss,"I loved the casting for the movie, Lyra, Ms Coulter, Lord Asriel, Lee Scorsby, all such great choices and very similar to exactly what I had been imagining in my head"
Dark Blue Kiss,"> Dakota had the perfect vibe for book Lyra

Agreed. The show Lyra is a good actress but she sounds... different.

Also, is it just me or she really looks a little bit like Greta Thurnberg? That had been a little distracting for me. I keep imagining her saying ""How dare you!"" to Miss Coulter. :) 

> I think the cast of the movie was mostly spot on, even if the movie itself was awful.

I think that the movie was mostly perfect except for the way that they butchered the end, which ruined everything. People who only know the movie may think that [Spoiler](#s ""Lord Asrael is a really nice guy"") ..."
Dark Blue Kiss,I've found most of the actors to be quite wooden even the really great ones. I think it's more the dialogue and direction not being that great.
Dark Blue Kiss,"Did you read the books? In the book, she had no reaction beyond ‚ÄúLyra could only sit in wonder.‚Äù"
Dark Blue Kiss,"Yea, I hear people say that. I just didn't share that experience.  The magesterium stuff was certainly watered down and the film received a lot of negative backlash for bowing to religious pressure, but I still think it offered a great slice of HDM entertainment and could have been near perfect if they'd landed the third act.  I mean they still had Iorek punch a bear jaw off. It was never a dark adult tale to begin with, it was always family friendly in every version, Pullman just slipped some religious anarchy into it (especially in the later books) but it was still a book for youth."
Dark Blue Kiss,"Yea. It's perfect. Same with Sam Elliot as Scoresby and Eva Green as Serafina, and Daniel Craig as Asriel. Those three were pitch perfect, and then Dakota Blue Richards nailed Lyra. It's a shame what happened, it was so close to being the franchise I'd always wanted."
Dark Blue Kiss,Edit
Dark Blue Kiss,bad reaction =/= no reaction
Dark Blue Kiss,"Ooops! Sorry, I read the books like 15 years ago and I didn't even thought of that as a spoiler. I edited the comment to put a spoiler tag.

But look at the bright side: you still don't know *why* he isn't nice. ;)"
Dark Blue Kiss,Thanks for the understanding-am just about done with the he first book
Dark Blue Kiss,"Yeah, God forbid anyone find some vague ass spoiler for a 25 year old book"
Dark Blue Kiss,The comment was removed - can you re comment it with the spoiler tag? I‚Äôm curious what your response was
Dark Blue Kiss,"How odd, it's showing to me. Anyway, here it is:

> Dakota had the perfect vibe for book Lyra

Agreed. The show Lyra is a good actress but she sounds... different.

Also, is it just me or she really looks a little bit like Greta Thurnberg? That had been a little distracting for me. I keep imagining her saying ""How dare you!"" to Miss Coulter. :)

Dark Blue Kiss,"It's not out yet, but obviously I hope it's good. Can't be sure until it's out."
Dark Blue Kiss,">For me I just don't get the purpose

Well that would be the same point as the Bebop show, the Death Note movie, and other animated to live action remakes. Money."
Dark Blue Kiss,It has potential but it could also be a disaster but I like the casting for the show so I‚Äôm cautiously optimistic
Dark Blue Kiss,I have more doubts than hopes.
Dark Blue Kiss,Specifically catering to people who refuse to watch animation.
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"I think this show would be better if it were called ""Kublai Khan"" and shifted the focus to him and left Marco Polo as a subplot.

Delving more into Khan's complex balance between aggression and caution and his playing various parties is far more interesting than watching Marco make googley-eyes at the Blue Princess."
Darwin‚Äôs Game,I don't know what the hell you guys are talking about. I'm enjoying the shit out of this. 
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"I like it. It's a historical drama in a similar vein as Vikings. It's also beautifully shot. The storyline is okay, not great.

Edit: It's similar to Spartacus in many ways too."
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"I liked Wong's performance as Kublai Khan. I saw nothing wrong with the lead either. A bit slow to start, but this is only the first episode. I recall I didn't really get into GoT right away either (not that they are really that comparable). "
Darwin‚Äôs Game,Wonderful title sequence!
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"I'm so glad that I didn't pay attention to the negative reviews. This is series is great. It starts out slow, but it picks up quickly. "
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"Just started watching the first episode, I feel like Netflix has horribly promoted this show. It wasn't even on the banner when i got onto their site."
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"The accents though... all over the place man 
Prince Jingim sounds Australian to me"
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"I posted this in the other thread but I guess I'll post it here too if there's going to be more discussion on this one. I feel like a lot people are being nit picky because they read reviews before hand that it is a Game of Thrones ripoff and are watching it already expecting not to like it.

I'm a few episodes in and it's worth a watch if you like historical fiction. If you watch it expecting Game of Thrones or Rome you probably won't like it because it isn't exactly like those shows, but if you watch either GOT or Rome expecting the other you probably wouldn't like those either. That said I don't see the claims of it being a GOT ripoff because it feels more much like Rome.

Yes, it isn't a documentary and like Rome they speak english for convenience.

I don't understand the claim of it being over-sexualized when GOT has much more forced sex scenes."
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"I've only seen 3 episodes so far (so my opinion may change as I go deeper into the series). 

My impression after these first few episodes is that the cinematography is incredible, costumes beautiful, and soundtrack impressive - the quality is on par with a big budget Hollywood movie. Unfortunately, the writing and acting results in characters which are (so far) hollow and one dimensional. It is visually fantastic, but the story has been somewhat boring, derivative, and filled with tropes, caricatures, and stereotypes. At this early point in the series, I don't really care (good or bad) about any of these characters and that is a serious issue if I am going to be drawn into the story and keep coming back for more.

I suspect this might be a series that is going to be all style and little substance. It seems to lack a soul. While mindless entertainment can be enjoyable in some ways, I had hoped for more. I'll see if it gets better (as some have suggested). "
Darwin‚Äôs Game,[deleted]
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"I am really liking it so far. It's fun, epic, and has room to develop. I just hope the journey is worth it all in the end. Only having seen two episodes, it definitely can fuck up at any time."
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"I finished episode 1, I enjoyed it, but it felt dull at times. "
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"Just finished watching all 10 episodes. Absolutely amazing, specially the Khan acting he is really good. 

Can't wait for season 2, I just wish for less romance and more of everything else. "
Darwin‚Äôs Game,I finished it all. This show is a lot of fun. 
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"I keep looking at the star of the show and thinking ""bam margeras twin...wtf..."""
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"**[edit]** While everything I said remains on point, it seems they apply mostly to the first half of the series and not the later half, in regard to the TNA over-storyline. In the last 5 episodes we get some insight into the cricket minister, and some of the characters are fleshed out a bit more. Still, a lot more could have been done, especially with fairly central characters like Youself, Sanga, The bastard, the rebellion of Ariq, even the machinations of the cricket minister. I still have no idea who 100 eyes was or his history. He seems to be a very intriguing character, and is referred to as a tao priest, yet he teaches kungfu, an art created by Buddhists, and so on.

Overall, I give the first half, a 5/10 (worth watching for the setting and custumes alone) and the back half a 7/10 with time laspes being the most grievous issue.


--------------------------------
OK. I love historical drama. This show is pretty good, especially since it covers material that hasn't really been covered in the West-- which is crazy considering how important the Khan dynasty was historically, politically, religiously and economically. 

That said, things I didn't like:

* Historical inaccuracy in armour, weapons used, fighting styles and effectiveness of weapons/armour. Buy a damn set of lamellar for the khan if you're spending millions per episode and don't have them take off the most important piece of armour before a battle.

* Too much focus on sex and titillation. Too many shows are going down this road and it's ruining television for me. There is nothing wrong with tits and ass, but the story HAS to come first. If you have no real story or developed characters, you have nothing. Tits don't make a show adult and edgy, the story line does.

* Uneven pacing with no real sense of time. The time between events and the events themselves have no immanent presence in the show. They simple happen and we're supposed to accept a month just passed, or a day, or 10mths over the spawn of 10 to 20m at times. 

* Not enough time has been spent on character development. We're left with one dimensional people like the ""cricket chancellor"" who seems evil for the sake of being evil. People aren't like that. What are his goals, his sense of duty, his private fears and so on. What did his sister do to make him so ambivalent toward her? And so on. 

* Too clean, too pretty, and the horror of the law and sweeping power of the Khan haven't been fully realized. And, I don't think they are making full use of the setting and the time period. 

That said, there are things I like about the show:

* settings look amazing
* great costumes (armour and swords aside)
* interesting time period
* a new historical setting I haven't seen much about pregnant with possibilities for further development
* the foundation is there for an over-the-top, legendary show if they take the focus off tits and put it on story
* I love the actor playing the Khan and 100 eyes
* big possibility of focusing on war, cost of war, attrition even economics and spycraft

tl;dr the show has bones but needs to be fleshed out"
Darwin‚Äôs Game,I found it slow but interesting at first. It really picks up about half way though. I enjoyed it. The random slow mo sex scenes felt out of place though. 
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"I've only seen the pilot so far, but I'm really fascinated with the setting. I'm not at all familiar with the historic period, so I couldn't care/wouldn't notice what is accurate or not. 

With that said though, there's a serious issue with accents. I understand that it needs to be in English (I would have preferred subtitles), but the different accents kind of throw it around. "
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"Not much to say about this show.. it is kind of .. hmm underwhelming. But those Dojo-training scenes are pretty great though.

Edit: Holy shit... neked fight scene... wow... that actually just happened. 
Edit: Just finished the series... and it has it moments. I think it was around ep7 when the 2nd hand unit actually woke up and started making good establishing shoots.

Claudia Kim stars as Khutulun... has a weird story arc. Just a random sex scene then the writers completely forgot about it. Overall i like the show. 100 eyes, is a badass MOFO... i want him on my team."
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"Four episodes in and I'm not a fan of some of the silliness [Episode Three](#s ""naked Kung fu and what seems like the beginning of a traditional ""she is an exotic princess and out of your league"" plot"")

Seems incredibly formulaic and stale. The best thing I can say for it is that it's muted and may go in a different direction at any time. It's not the main focus of the show."
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"Yeah first ep is a little slow but after that i was hooked and the second  half of the season i enjoyed even more. Fight scenes are awesome and the blink monk is unreal :) Fuck the reviews... I hope NETFLIX renews it for another season but with all the bad press, I'm worried it won't."
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"I know that the lead actor only learned English during the making of the show, but he's given really bad delivery of some lines so far. Despite being the titular character, the portrayal of Marco Polo seems pretty bland and generic as well.

Having said that, I'm really enjoying the visuals in the show."
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"The visuals and locations are lovely and I have enjoyed the first three episodes but it seems like Marco is not developed well as the lead.  I feel like we know the supporting characters much better.  The pacing is also quite slow, which is more tolerable in the Netflx format than it would be if viewers had to wait a week for the next episode."
Darwin‚Äôs Game,Shit.. I thought Marco Polo was Bam Margera
Darwin‚Äôs Game,I got to episode 8 and stalled out. May not finish it. 
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"It is really meh.   
It feels as if they threw together all the possible worst asian clich√©s.  
If one wishes to watch naked fighting scenes then Crying Freeman was good enough. "
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"I might watch a couple more episodes but if the premiere is any indication of the rest of the season, I'm jumping ship. I'm still interested because I want to see more Mongolian related things. It's such an interesting setting... Fingers crossed that it gets better.

Which reminds me, WHEN IS VIKINGS COMING BACK?! I need something in the Game of Thrones downtime!"
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"Great cinematography especially on episode 2 (just saw episode 2). I enjoy it, but I find it a bit off. The guy who plays Marco is terrible. He looks and acted like a clueless bitch. That nude kungfu is awesome."
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"This show was certainly not *exceptional* by any means besides the work that went into the costumes and sets, but goddamn was it fun to watch. I hope Netflix gives it more, because I certainly want a lot more. 

Edit: Something to add, as the show progressed I liked how it kind of shifted away from Marco being a prisoner in China to being a *part* of China. "
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"I just watched the first episode. Parts of it was interesting. That time and place is extremely interesting and I was hoping for a drama with lots of intrigue, political maneuverings and such. I suppose I got a little of that? It felt thin and half-assed though.

And I really don't see why they feel the need to crowbar in sex scenes and gratuitous nudity. If they do a Spartacus and start to veer into softcore porn, I'll be really disappointed."
Darwin‚Äôs Game,[deleted]
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"If anyone has complaints about this show its only because they didn't get with mary before hand.
Very beautifully shot, and production value is amazing."
Darwin‚Äôs Game,Quality series. I really enjoyed it.
Darwin‚Äôs Game,zhu zhu is fucking hot!!!! btw anyone knows how accurate this shows is?
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"I am 38 minutes into the pilot and it's 50/50 chance that I might die out of boredom by the end which is 51 minutes.

Very little is happening, characters could be painted by the number 2 pencil, Western sensibilities heavy handedly dumped on every single relationship. Of all the _deep_ period dramas I managed to survive for more than one episode (Rome, Borgias, Spartacus), this looks the most insultingly boring. "
Darwin‚Äôs Game,Why did Netflix use the Stats template? I mean the show sure looks pretty but narratively it is a jumbled mess.
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"An expensive, sluggish embarrassment for Netflix.

edit: I love that there's a Netflix social media intern that's been put to work downvoting all negative comments"
Darwin‚Äôs Game,reminds me of the shogun series - but i like it 
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"Yaaaa, for the potential that this show had. This is not very good. Just in the battle scene from episode 2, that would've been a horrible battle with that dry river bed in the center of the battlefield. Many would've died because their horse broke a leg trying to charge over it. 

Edit: it does make for a good porn show though. "
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"Ugh, pure garbage. A show only the Netflix defence league could like. Pity because it sounded like such a great concept when it was announced."
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"Sorry netflix, the ultimate historical fiction about Marco Polo has already been written:

>When Marco Polo lay on his deathbed, his priest, his friends and relations clustered around him
to plead that he at last renounce the countless lies he had related as his true adventures, so his
soul would go cleansed to Heaven. The old man raised up, roundly damned them all and
declared, ""I have not told the half of what I saw and did!"" - [""The Journeyer"" by Gary Jennings](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0765323494/?tag=11770-20)"
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"Eh... The narrative feels a bit all over the place. I've watched the first 5 or so episodes and it hasn't really hooked me. Outside of Kublai, none of the characters really inspire much interest. All said, it's certainly not terrible, and the setting is exotic enough that it is still interesting, despite the humdrum storyline. If you want to watch a good historical drama on Netflix, check out Borgia (The one with John Doman). "
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"How come everyone has great English in this, like only a hint of accent is thrown around. And they even communicate with each other in English. I know it's made for US audiences and all, but seems way odd for an Italian explorer and a Mongolian Emperor to be communicating in perfect English while all the subjects standing around understand everything they are saying. And I fell asleep half way through it."
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"Derivative, historically dubious and ludicrous. If you're a history teacher and either show or recommend this to students, you should be put on death row.

How the fuck am I getting downvoted for this? Lots of studio employees must be on this board. Really pathetic guys."
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"I saw info on this a while a go, a new big show from netflix, and even trailer was included. So exciting.

So I watched the trailer and barely finished it, it left absolutely no impression. I know it's only a trailer and it's false to judge a show from tiny bit information, but what I saw was fancy production value, average acting and nothing to interest me. And now reading some opinions I have even less interest in checking it out. High budget and big label isn't everything."
Darwin‚Äôs Game,I'm 4 episodes in and I agree im far more interested in the Khan court intrigue than Marco.
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"I think it's more of the point that we are following Marco Polo's journey through a vastly different culture via Khan. I feel that they will expand more on the importance that he brings to the western world from what he learns in his travels later in the series.. Since that's kind of like what happens to him in history. His impact is what sparks centuries worth of travels and adventures (columbus directly in fact) and the first fully documented account of the East really isn't something to snuff about. 

**TL;DR**: I think Netflix will take care of the series if you let it develop some as they clearly have shown they know what they are doing in the past."
Darwin‚Äôs Game,[deleted]
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"Was very satisfied after watching the whole thing. Reminds me a lot of [Red Cliff](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425637/), but without the native Asian-style overacting and time to flesh out the plot as well as relationships."
Darwin‚Äôs Game,[removed]
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"Thoroughly enjoyed it.  I feel like most of the regular season is just okay, with some great parts strewn in.

But... if, like most of the ""reviewers"" out there, you haven't seen the last episode, then you I feel as though YOU SHOULDN'T SAY A THING ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU HATE IT.

The last episode has a huge battle scene, kung fu, treachery, political maneuvering... it has it all.  Really lifts the series to new heights in just one episode.

Besides that, I think the scenery, costumes, and the vibrant colors everywhere amazed me throughout the entire series, so they did a really great job with that."
Darwin‚Äôs Game,Just finished all 10 episodes and I want more!!!  It was amazing. 
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"I'd say the production values are far higher than Vikings though,  which is a show I also like, don't get me wrong. 


But on Vikings, what is the most characters we ever even seen on screen at once, during a fight?  Maybe 20. "
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"Benedict Wong is the best thing in it, totally believable. "
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"I think its just nice to see a show like this, that didn't resort to WhiteWashing the whole cast. "
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"I went to the Ben's private premier on Friday night, seeing on a huge screen was even better.http://i.imgur.com/z61gin7.jpg"
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"A lot of the acting is good, but the narrative of the show is lacking."
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"I wonder what negative reviews people are talking about?  I just glanced at IMDB, and the show has an 8.X+ on all the episode ratings, which isn't bad at all. "
Darwin‚Äôs Game,It was the banner for me two weeks before it even started.
Darwin‚Äôs Game,It's at the top now.
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"Yeah,  I pay a decent amount of attention to TV, and didn't know anything about this before it came out.  Then again, I dont't watch any ads or commercials either. "
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"It's strange. I saw zero marketing before the release, but in the last couple of days I've seen a whole bunch of trailers on tv and in the cinema, as well as interviews on the radio and stuff. I think they've tried to capitalise on people going to watch it immediatly after hearing about it, rather than trying to hype it up in advance. "
Darwin‚Äôs Game,I had no idea it was happening until it came out. 
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"That doesn't bother me so much. The great khans are famous for promoting people based on merit regardless of birth or ethnicity. So it is pretty accurate that they have so many different nationalities in the Khan's court.

What *is* bothering me is how dumb the dialogue is. Even Marco, who was supposedly spared because of the beautiful way he has with words, have really boring dialogue."
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"That's because the actors are using their own accents, the man playing Marco Polo for example just learned English for this role, hence the Italian accent. Prince Jingim's actor is from Australia (and also a Redditor) as seen [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/acting/comments/2p4d73/the_tv_show_i_worked_on_for_the_better_half_of/)."

Darwin‚Äôs Game,"> hey read reviews before hand that it is a Game of Thrones ripoff and are watching it already expecting not to like it.



A pretty stupid opinion in the first place really.  Everyone is doing Historical Fiction right now,  its the hot new thing, ever since GoT hit it big. 


We've got Marco Polo, Da'Vinci's Demons, Vikings, all running right now.  And several others coming soon. "
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"I finished this series and wanted to update my prior comment. It does get better. Episode 5 stood out for me and I started to enjoy the series more after that. 

There remain issues with writing and acting, but there are improvements in story and character development. I was also able to forgive some faults and overlook some annoyances as the story became more interesting. 

I still can't say that I care (good or bad) for any of these characters and that remains an issue for me - Polo is probably the least interesting of all.

I wouldn't miss this series if it never came back, but when it does I will watch it again. I'd give it a *""meh"" plus*. "
Darwin‚Äôs Game,[deleted]
Darwin‚Äôs Game,Not really. Its for convieniance. The lead dosnt even speak english as a native language.
Darwin‚Äôs Game,The show is beautifully shot if nothing else. Some amazing scenery and camera angles. 
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"So outstanding plots come season 2 are that the minister of finance is plotting a coup with maylin?

And what happened to the blue princess basically?"
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"Overall I agree with you, but I want to point out that they do go into the cricket chancellor's relationship with his sister in a flashback and dialogue in later episodes. Still, he's pretty one-dimensionally ""evil"" but I enjoyed the show regardless."
Darwin‚Äôs Game,[deleted]
Darwin‚Äôs Game,The ones where's he's drugged up? I thought they were a bit odd too but I kinda let them go because he's supposed to be high I guess.
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"How about they battle scenes when two enormous RL armies face each other without major computer-generated imagery, but using real people instead? The show has it's moments!"
Darwin‚Äôs Game,Dude.  Naked Kung Fu is awesome. 
Darwin‚Äôs Game,The character is suppose to barely speak Mongolian isn't he?
Darwin‚Äôs Game,Which lines? He seems fine to me.
Darwin‚Äôs Game,[removed]
Darwin‚Äôs Game,He reminds me of that dude who plays Anakin Skywalker.
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"It warms up a lot after the first few episodes.  

> WHEN IS VIKINGS COMING BACK?!

Season one came in early march and season two in late February, so somewhere in that timeframe. "
Darwin‚Äôs Game,Where can I watch Vikings? It's not on Netflix is it? 
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"> Fingers crossed that it gets better

I'm on second-to-last episode. It does not get much better."
Darwin‚Äôs Game,Why is it jarring that the Asian characters speak perfect English when the European characters aren't supposed to be speaking English either? It's a compromise that tv shows have to make to keep an American/British audience interested because most don't want to be reading subtitles for the entirety of a show.
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"Have you seen Rome, Gladiator, Alexander, Cleopatra, Vikings, 300, Kingdom of Heaven, Hercules, The Hunchback of Notre dame or The Borgias (among many others)?  Was it jarring to you then that they were speaking english instead of Greek, Latin, Egyptian, Old Norse, ancient Farsi, Italian, French or Arabic?"
Darwin‚Äôs Game,I'd rather they speak perfect English than do fake Chinese accented English that would be horribly offensive.
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"The fact that its sitting at a 46 on Metacritic.com can't be a good sign for Netflix. Doesn't exactly  make me want to spend my free time to watch a sub par show. Oh well they've renewed shows with lower scores. But this is one of the problems they may face increasingly, is putting millions of dollars into a single show for one whole season, only for it to come out less than stellar or less than average in the case of Marco Polo."
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"> Western audiences

It's more for everyone who isn't an American. The goal is to make netflix a more attractive sub for countries where they don't have rights to House of Cards and such.

It's not really about the quality of the show, more so that it adds value to people who haven't subbed yet. ""I could watch that Marco Polo show that I heard was so expensive."" And even then, that's likely not the primary impetus for subbing to netflix (it's the catalogue).

The show would have to be really really awful (as in blatantly offensive) to cost them subs,  and across the world it need to help attract 90m in subs which really isn't that much to be honest."
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"> And I don't know if this is historically accurate, I don't know how it went, but I have a feeling that this show is going to be about this great white savior that is going to save this repressed Asian country.
> 

Probably not. The nice white guy forming a bond with the leader of the Asian country because...some exotic skill (to the Asian leader) and conveniently fucking some Asian woman out of his league while learning from the exotic natives though? 

Very likely."
Darwin‚Äôs Game,That's  the most  racist  thing  I have ever  heard. Get  of your  Fucking  High  horse. 
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"When the khan switch between Mongolian and English while talking to Marco Polo at the start of the show, I was like ""WTF is that"" and turned it off.

I mean it is OK to replace the local language with perfect English and replace other non English ones with a accent. But why the fuck switch between English and Mongolian? What language is English suppose to represent here?"
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"Which is a shame, considering how rich Mongol history is."
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"It doesn't *look* expensive. People keep complimenting the cinematography. But aside from some gorgeous wide shots, most of the show is pretty bland visually. Most of the show takes place within the Khan's palace, and it looks pretty boring."
Darwin‚Äôs Game,Read the book and watched the series.  If I remember correctly the tv series is one of the major reasons why the US started to become more interested in Japanese culture.
Darwin‚Äôs Game,[deleted]
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"> Just in the battle scene from episode 2, that would've been a horrible battle with that dry river bed in the center of the battlefield.

So what do you exactly know about Mongolian battle strategies and traditions during this period? Do you have any background knowledge to judge if this scene is really unrealistic?"
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"Didn't you just love all the Latin in *Rome* and the Norsk in *Vikings*? The show is even showing how he is learning the basic of the language during his voyage east.

Are you trolling?"
Darwin‚Äôs Game,"""Oh hUrro mista Polo, wercome to the grea Khan's cuort""

From the brief MOTD highlights (and the camera angles) it's often impossible to see what's happened in build up to a goal say, or how an individual has performed over the course of a full 90 mins - the extra analysis very obviously adds to your understanding of a game.

And these aren't random bland media idiots giving their insight, all 3 you've mentioned there were world class strikers, the absolute best at what they did. If you think you can watch 3 mins of highlights and know as much as these guys about what's happened you are beyond deluded."

At the Dolphin Bay,"What the heck man?!  He is awesome, has majors roles in the John Wick movies, he was a major character in the Horizon games x 2, and also he was the main character in the Resident Evil Netflix show.  What a loss.  RIP."
At the Dolphin Bay,"Funny how different community know him by different roles..

/r/television - The Wire, Fringe, Oz, Lost

/r/PS5 - Horizon games

/r/XboxSeriesX - Destiny, Quantum Break

/r/movies - John Wick and Wire


Same article showing up on different communities but the title reflects how they know him best."

[Rip Agent Clappers](https://youtu.be/d-n81Pl-zm0)"
At the Dolphin Bay,I know it‚Äôs probably been mentioned but he was great in Fringe. RIP
At the Dolphin Bay,"60!! Wtf, that‚Äôs heartbreaking. I always got excited when I saw him in a role. He really added strength to the characters he played. Gonna rewatch Fringe in his honor"
At the Dolphin Bay,"Well fudge.  RIP Zavala, may your light always shine on!"
At the Dolphin Bay,"Damn. I just watched the Toys R Me Funny or Die skit he did a few days back:

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GU-2C8Ec6co"
At the Dolphin Bay,"A damn shame.  He killed it in every role he had, regardless of medium."
At the Dolphin Bay,Literally watching fringe as I read this ..
At the Dolphin Bay,God fucking damn
At the Dolphin Bay,"Fucking what. God damn it, today sucks. Reddick was great in everything I've seen him in, this is a huge loss."
At the Dolphin Bay,"My god this shocked me. How awful, he still had a lot to give. Rest in peace sir, god this was way too soon."
At the Dolphin Bay,His deadpan delivery as the hotel manager was what sold the John Wick film as humor and not just action. He also voiced the dragon in Vox Machina season 2.
At the Dolphin Bay,"Truly heartbreaking news. I've been a fan since I saw him on Fringe nearly 15 years ago. He was great on there. And then of course he was incredible on The Wire (only watched it for the first time a few years ago). Not to mention how versatile he was, because of course he's in the John Wick movies, but he played one of my favorite characters in the Horizon video game franchise. What a loss. Condolences to his loved ones. üòî"
At the Dolphin Bay,He‚Äôs so amazing in ‚ÄòCorporate‚Äô on Comedy Central. Dude had range.
At the Dolphin Bay,Dude never got his iconic slave role. :(
At the Dolphin Bay,"I don't usually get emotional over celebrity deaths but this one hurts. Gonna go watch The Wire for a bit. RIP Lance, thank you for all your work."
At the Dolphin Bay,Fuck today
At the Dolphin Bay,He had the best strut. RIP Lance
At the Dolphin Bay,"No, no, no. Love this actor.  Hollywood just suffered a massive loss. üò¢"
At the Dolphin Bay,"Fuck. I've just been rewatching Fringe, which he's so good in."
At the Dolphin Bay,"Damn shame. He had that ""cool factor"" that most people just don't."
At the Dolphin Bay,"He seemed to play the same character over and over again, but that was okay because that character was AWESOME."
At the Dolphin Bay,"He was a phenomenal actor who crushed it in tons of different roles across movies, TV, and video games, but I will always think of The Wire when I think of Lance Reddick. He actually read for the parts of both McNulty and Bubbles before the producers asked him to come back and read for Daniels. It's hard to imagine how different the show would have been if he'd been playing one of those characters instead of Daniels, but that just speaks to how iconic his performance was.

RIP Mr. Reddick. You will be missed."
At the Dolphin Bay,"Whoa..

I just finished rewatching Fringe, a towering presence among the series that influenced me growing up; I hadn‚Äôt revisited the series since it ended.

I‚Äôd totally forgotten that originally, his role was positioned as sort of just another ‚Äúoverbearing superior who demands results but underestimates the heroes‚Äù-type character, not unlike Agent Skinner from The X-Files (Fringe‚Äôs chief inspiration).

But almost immediately, this characterization in the pilot disappears in subsequent episodes. Instead, Agent Broyles defies the archetype and proves a capable leader who genuinely cares about his people. Lance Reddick brought so much complexity and emotion to a character that, despite a hardened, sometimes cold exterior, had a warmth and sense of vulnerability that made him so much more.

I wish he hadn‚Äôt been pigeonholed into roles seemingly written as ‚ÄúLance Reddick-types,‚Äù but I‚Äôll always remember seeing him take what could‚Äôve been just a gag, and turn it into a brilliant performance of hilarious euphoria and wonder, followed by existential crisis and finally total emotional vulnerability when, in a later season, Broyles is accidentally dosed with LSD.

RIP

At the Dolphin Bay,"Jesus that‚Äôs terrible news, such a great actor. I‚Äôve never seen him give a bad performance."
At the Dolphin Bay,"Haven't watched The Wire yet (I know), but his arc on Oz was great! RIP"
At the Dolphin Bay,"Literally just finished watching the wire for the first time.

RIP"
At the Dolphin Bay,Terrible news:( RIP
At the Dolphin Bay,60 is far too young.
At the Dolphin Bay,"He made Corporate, his cold steely way of saying the most absurd things was so funny.

Really sad to hear this"
At the Dolphin Bay,He was great in Corporate too
At the Dolphin Bay,"Just watched the first John wick last night after thinking I should re-watch all 3 to get in the mood for chapter 4 & I think besides John my favourite character is Charon, Lance just had such a presence whether it be something so simple as him saying hello to JW or him calling his room to tell JW the hotel has had a noise complaint.

The John Wick franchise will be a little less awesome now that Lance is gone. RIP"
At the Dolphin Bay,I loved him in Fringe and was looking forward to seeing him in the Percy Jackson franchise. So shocking and sad. And only 60?! :(
At the Dolphin Bay,"Ahh man! Lance had one of the smoothest voices in Hollywood, and his presence on screen was undeniably cool. He will definitely be missed. 

I was already planning a John Wick movie marathon this weekend, looks like there‚Äôs an even stronger reason to rewatch now. The Continental will not be as cool without him."
At the Dolphin Bay,RIP to a legend. ‚ÄúBend to far you‚Äôre already broken.‚Äù
At the Dolphin Bay,He was great in Fringe
At the Dolphin Bay,Just finished a rewatch of the Wire. RIP Daniels.
At the Dolphin Bay,"No way!! What the fuck?!

Awful news, he was fantastic. Rest in power Lance."
At the Dolphin Bay,Damn. I just started watching Fringe a couple weeks ago. His performance was superb. We lost one of the greats today. RIP.
At the Dolphin Bay,"Crazy how I was just rewatching the wire am at the second episode, look at Reddit for a moment then see this. His voice is so recognisable in some games too. He did a awesome job in Horizon. Not to mention the movies he has been in."
At the Dolphin Bay,"WHAT THE FUCK!!!
my god this news just breaks my heart!! i just started watching the tv series ""Fringe"" a couple of weeks ago (i'm already well into season 2!) and i love it!
60 years old is not old! i just stunned and wrecked at this news. Mr. Reddick was EXTREMELY talented! he was an excellent actor.

my condolences to his family, friends and fellow fans.
RIP"
At the Dolphin Bay,"OMG ! I last saw him on resident evil and despite many people here tank the show. I enjoyed it especially Lance Reddick performance. He did a few roles and did them well.

Also 60 is very young and I always wonder what is the meaning of death by natural causes. 60 is not natural."
At the Dolphin Bay,I STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH THIS!
At the Dolphin Bay,"I'm not even sad about this, I'm angry. Guy seemed healthy as a horse and he's much younger than my parents. 60 is too fucking young to just die of natural causes. It's such a 'fuck you' that it ever happens. 


Great actor in every role I've seen him in. Even if he never got his iconic slave role like Levar Burton. RIP."
At the Dolphin Bay,Gone too soon. Can't believe it. may he rest in peace.
At the Dolphin Bay,"He was just promoting his new movie.  Had to Google this after I saw this headline and it is very jarring to see this news alongside an article of him doing a very recent interview. 

Wow.  RIP"
At the Dolphin Bay,"I gave this lovely man a twice weekly Covid test in October,2021. HBO studio out in the Valley. Told him I loved The Wire, he told me to watch Bosch. I was impressed by his calm gracious vibe.RIP."
At the Dolphin Bay,Noooo!  I loved him!
At the Dolphin Bay,"Aw man this sucks. His presence in the Wire was incredibly powerful, I don't think anyone could have played his role like him. He will be missed."
At the Dolphin Bay,Fuuuuuuuuck. I always wanted him to take over as the host of jeopardy.
At the Dolphin Bay,"Damn so young. Amazing actor and amazing voice.

I wonder what they‚Äôll do for the third Horizon game. Hopefully he recorded some lines."
At the Dolphin Bay,RIP legend
At the Dolphin Bay,No!  Always loved him.  What terrible news.
At the Dolphin Bay,So many amazing roles but he‚Äôll always be the boss in Corporate for me. Absolutely hilarious performance. Please check it out if you haven‚Äôt seen it. RIP.
At the Dolphin Bay,I was just watching ‚ÄúFringe‚Äù last night
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,"No wonder Netflix fucks up all these adaptations. Targeting ya female audience with Resident Evil show? What the fuck. Naturally the writing in the show was quite bad to begin with, but damn they pretty much started with failure as the goal."
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,How exactly did a real life human come to the conclusion that a zombie video game franchise was the perfect franchise to target YA loving teenage girls? You‚Äôd be hard pressed to find two genres that mix less.
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,"Constantin does seem to, very very reluctantly, be moving closer to a Resident Evil that's more faithful to the source material. They're just in this annoying middle road where they still feel the need to change vital aspects. The Umbrella town could have been fantastic, and did have some parts that truly felt like RE.

But then they went and had the apocalypse happen right away. Holy shit, what is their obsession with that? The games have a fifty year timeline going with no apocalypse happening. All it does is close off story telling possibilities. All of the RE movies after 2 just blend together in my mind because of that. It also takes away Umbrella, preventing the show or movie from exploring the corporate evil that results in the various incidents, including the annihilation of two cities. Seriously, we have *plenty* of post-apocalyptic stories of there. Resident Evil shouldn't be included among them. It has a different niche, one that draws both men and women."
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,"According to people I've talked to in the RE community with connections to these productions, there were two pitches for the Resident Evil show. One was a spinoff of The Final Chapter with a new cast, but with Milla Jovovich returning in a supporting role, and the other was a young adult oriented show about teenage girls in a mysterious Umbrella-controlled town. It seems that Netflix wanted the latter, but Constantin wanted the former.

The final show is a mishmash of ideas, but firmly YA-oriented, and with Jade Wesker trying to fill in for Alice.

It could be Google translate, but there's a hint of snark to his remark about how Constantin have been making Resident Evil movies for 20 years, and they kind of knew what audiences responded well to, but Netflix wanted to use the show as an experiment to see if they could transfer to the brand to a young female audience. Resident Evil has always been a female action series in the film world, but it was never YA. It was always R rated.

Still, they're happy that the show went to #1 for a while because it shows interest in the brand, and they can leverage that for the next movie whenever or however that happens.

edit: I personally think Constantin deserve some blame for mashing the concepts together. That was on them. Netflix wanted their teen drama, Constantin wanted their ""we have Alice at home"" show.

They should have focused on the 2022 storyline with the teens simply because it was more unique. It was exploring something you'd never seen in RE before -- this corporate dystopia with room to flesh out characters and explore themes. It had real potential, and some of that potential is in the show. It just needed more rewrites. The show has this issue where it's good quite often, but then it reminds you that it's ""YA"" in an awkward way. It really drives home how important editing and reshoots can be. This show, I feel, could have been ""fixed"" in the editing room to be far more popular and well liked."
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,"Honestly, it's not inherently the worst idea. I'm not a big RE fan, but Jill Masterson could appeal to that demo, right? If they like Hunger Games, The Maze Runner, that kind of thing then a show about a rookie making her way through the mansion could work. Terrible execution, but that's its own problem."
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,Oh are they admitting now media companies are butchering IP in misguided attempts to capture a market that doesn't actually exist. Just because it's popular in social media to spam two chromosomes hate thread topics doesn't mean there's actually a large portion of the population that is that way. It just means the internet loves hate. This is like making a show that appeals to incels that think all women wear stupid.  I really hope this trend dies down and we can get creative story telling not captured by pop culture trash bin back
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,Netflix was the evil resident
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,You'd think after exhausting all roads they would just make a decent faithful adaptation of RE one and call it a day. How about maybe see if making a deliberately faithful retelling of those events would go anywhere.
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,"Idiots.


I give shows a chance even with the reviews and internet hate, but RE was terrible.  Only thing good in it is the actor playing Wesker, and why he signed up for it with his pedigree is beyond me-but he‚Äôs a good actor no matter what he‚Äôs in, it seems ."
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,"There's a lot of stuff in there. They are producing a show about Hagen von Tronje, they are producing a show based on ""Smilla's Sense of Snow"", they are producing a Roland Emmerich show called ""Those About to Die"". All news to me, but that might be because I don't follow stuff like that normally."
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,The game series has a huge female fan base.
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,The company paying for production is always going to want to expand the audience or make a new one. You can see it with pretty much every franchise reboot. Star Trek being a good example. They're not going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to cater to the people who liked Trek in the 90s. Obviously. Or not obviously to the heaps of people who seemed constantly surprised by this kind of thing. Expecting Netflix to use their newly acquired franchise to continue on the Paul W. S. Anderson schlock starring his wife is insane. Of course they're going to try to do their own thing. Why would they not?
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,"Considering the last 20 years of Resident Evil movies, I can see why Netflix wanted to try something different. 

Obviously it didn't work out, but I understand the attempt."
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,That‚Äôs the demo media companies want now. It spends the most money and it rewatches.
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,"I'm so at a loss here as to what the thought process was. First off if they wanted a female audience they could have easily used any of the series many female protagonists and came at it that way. You could have still had that sweet sweet ""strong female lead"" check box and still made something that fans of the series recognized. If Jill and Claire are too old for the YA demo Rebecca is literally 18 in the events of the first game. 

Secondly was it a hope that the female YA demo would be strong enough to abandon the rest of the series followers? Did they hope both would show up? Why take a franchise with one demographic and force another one into it? No one wins and no one gets something they want. It's somehow insulting to everyone. Young women are being told ""you'll just follow and gobble up anything as long as it stars a young snarky eye rolling woman who hates her dad"" and young men are in a way being told they don't matter and they're not worth appealing to as a market. It's just a cold weird cynical way to develop a franchise."
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,"I mean if Archie and be a gritty teen drama why can't Resident Evil be a YA adventure horror for teen girls?

Problem is Riverdale pretty much positioned itself as a much different incarnation. Resident Evil just let RE fans tune in without setting expectations. The show was decidedly average but I will say it had some good strong performances. 

It doesn't deserve the sheer amount of hate it got, which was mostly from fans of the games and probably fans of the movies who were angry it wasn't more of what they expected."
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,"I do find it hilarious that the thirst for Lady Dimitrescu in the last RE game came directly from Jane Douglas on Outside Xbox seeing her in the first playable demo and blurting out ""Oh my god, step on me""."
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,Welcome to Raccoon City was a welcome step forward towards the right direction. They just need to not mash two games together into one story
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,"You have to have airtight writing to flip back and forth between timelines.  This show didn't do that.

The story starting in the town with the teens and continuing from there would have worked.  Flipping back and forth with the timelines didn't work."
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,Rebecca Chambers is the perfect lead character for something like that as well
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,"There's quite a few popular YA zombie books and a lot of action related dystopias and fantasy.  Teen girls love books about girls who kick ass (with a romance woven in).  But they didn't go all in with anything in the series and they didn't write smart kick ass girls, they wrote whiney annoying ones."
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,Then the executives couldn't take as much credit. The suits always want to be able to say that they fixed whatever franchise they're in charge of.
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,"Turns out girls love the RE games as they are, they certainly don't care about a female YA angle otherwise they wouldn't be playing them in the first place, that's what these idiot companies don't get"
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,Proof plz
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,"Right? I'm a little confused by this angle, to the point of questioning it, Resi has an unusually large proportion of female players in my experience."
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,"Berben's referring to the demographics of their movie franchise, not the games."
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,"> Why would they not?

Because it is a risk. You risk losing the existing fanbase without gaining a new audience. Which is exactly what happened here. And going by the existing evidence this seems to be a repeating pattern."
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,"It's very normal to seek to expand brands beyond their existing forms. But there is an issue where ""YA"" ends up being a kiss of death. There is a glut of dead YA franchises, and there are a lot of YA-oriented TV shows that fall into very firm ""Young Adult"" ruts. A lot of the stuff the CW puts out is driven by its genre and the conceits and constraints of its genre.

Resident Evil in a new incarnation aimed at a younger & female audience isn't a bad idea at all. And it's not like the show is a train wreck, at least in my view. It has a lot of stuff it does pretty well. But it also falls into similar ruts to a lot of ""YA"" stuff. From the musical choices to the abrasive personalities of the young female leads.

It's the difference between ""teen drama"" and ""drama that happens to have teens in it"". And it's important. One of them makes audience members leave the room.

>They're not going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to cater to the people who liked Trek in the 90s.

The closest franchise to Resident Evil is probably Underworld. Both Screen Gems, had a crossover mooted at one point. Underworld is way less popular than RE, but it holds.

Imagine you made a Netflix reboot of Underworld, and it's aimed at teenagers. It's not just aimed at teenagers, but it's trying to fit into a ""YA"" box, and has Billie Eilish music in the first episode. Think about the impact this might have on the show's viewer retention, on its tone.

It's one thing to have an Underworld reboot about a teenage girl turned into a vampire with no Selene in sight. It's another to have a ""Young Adult"" Underworld reboot with all that entails.

Arguably the problem with the RE show is that instead of expanding RE into a new demographic in a healthy way, it resulted in a show a lot of people wrote off because they thought it looked ""CW-ish"" or it alienated them with its creative choices. Lance Reddick argued a lot of people didn't understand what they were trying to do, and I think he's right. These factors arguably contributed to the show falling off in ratings, and thus being cancelled. The show should never have gone in the ""YA"" direction, crowbarring an established brand (The RE film brand is VERY established globally, and that's part of the PR issue with new entries) around a concept that was difficult to market, but rather tried to be a show that also appealed to teenage girls."
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,"The new Abrams Star Wars movies seemed to only want to appeal to older fans, which is why TFA is basically a rethread of ANH and TROS is stuffed with returning characters like Lando and Sidious.

The TV shows seem like they want to appeal to people who liked the Clone Wars cartoon."
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,"The new thing that would have worked, most likely, is to be much closer to the source material.


This was nothing like it at all.  And neither are any of the movies"
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,"Those movies are nothing like the games lol.


Something different would have been actually sticking close to the source material"
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,">Why take a franchise with one demographic and force another one into it?

Since many women have played Resident Evil, I don't see the problem you see.

The real issue is implementation.

Netflix tends to be pretty hands-off, so I highly doubt this story.

The show isn't very good. That's the much bigger issue."
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,She didn‚Äôt start anything.
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,Ain‚Äôt nobody bought any tickets for that movie. That reboot is DOA. They will not be doing that again. Constantin are probably back begging Milla and Anderson to come back and help sell some tickets become all they have since it two reboots that absolutely bombed!
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,"I know of Resident Evil because my husband is a life-long fan of the video games. Never have I watched him played and thought, ""I wish they had a lead woman so I can relate to this horror survival storyline."""
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,Right. That was my point.
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,And I'm talking about both.
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,"Whatever you make there's always the risk of a flop. By creating your own thing, the rewards can be much greater. If you just make more PWS Anderson nonsense, success won't be worth it anyway. Because no one cares about PWS Anderson or his shit movies. Being associated with them is real risk here. 

 I imagine their first decision was to see how quickly they could put as much distance as possible between a new show and the old movie franchise. No one wants their new media IP to be tied to something like that."
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,"That's kinda the only thing that raised my eyebrow here. I thought the YA fad was over at this stage. It does seem a little behind the times. If I was a trend following TV exec I'd probably be telling them they need a bunch of likable kids with relatable banter having an adventure like Stranger Things rather than YA teen girl is destined to save the world stuff.

I think they were definitely right to strike out on their own to do something different. But yeah they picked the wrong direction. Can't win em all."
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,And a lot of those shows that really try to fit in the YA box end up being shitty because they are using old men to write what they think teenagers are who end up making characters that are annoying as hell instead of making young characters that are interesting to watch.
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,"One of the reason that TFA is the only actually decent one is that it pulled that off. The reason I haven't even seen TROS is because it famously didn't. I think you're right about the Clone wars thing too. I liked The Mandalorian up until it was obvious that they wanted it as part of this expanded universe/franchise. It made half of the second season just painful for me. It just couldn't be it's own thing, everything has to be a universe now."
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,That ship sailed over two decades ago unfortunately.
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,"At this point, I‚Äôd rather have no movies for a while"
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,"I didn't see it at the cinema but I thought it was the best RE film made so far, and much closer to the source material than other attempts."
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,There are several lead women in the games tho
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,"You know, there is another option besides aping Anderson. For example, actually making something like the games. I am actually confused why you seem so against that approach. It's what people wanted. For example, exactly what they seem to have done with The Last of Us, which will almost certainly be a hit."
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,"> Whatever you make there's always the risk of a flop. 

Fair enough. Obviously true.

> By creating your own thing, the rewards can be much greater. 

Also true. Bit in this case they didn't do their own thing. They used an existing IP.

> If you just make more PWS Anderson nonsense, success won't be worth it anyway. 

A success is a success. At the end of the day nobody really cares about the quality too much as long as it makes money. 

> I imagine their first decision was to see how quickly they could put as much distance as possible between a new show and the old movie franchise. No one wants their new media IP to be tied to something like that.

By itself not a bad idea. You can do that without aiming at completely different demographic. Building extra hurdles in front of you is a self-inflicted wound."
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,"I imagine TFA is the way it is because they really wanted to distance themselves from the prequels and show people this is old school Star Wars. TLJ actually wanted to develop the SW universe and move things along after TFA just left the universe in the exact same state it was in A New Hope with none of the rebels fighting meaning anything.

Obviously there were certain vocal fans that didn't like it and with Treverrow off the project (which was suppose to have him cowriting with Johnson) Abrams just tried to do the same thing he did with the first film."
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,Same. At least there were scenes recognizable in both that film and the games.
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,That's not saying much though. Silent hill movie stayed as close to the material as possible and people still thought it was lame. At the end of the day you need creative people to make creative films and welcome to raccoon city was just cutscenes the movie.
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,"I'm aware. I'm just saying that I never felt like the series had to do something to grab my attention, regardless of the leads. I don't have the coordination and patience to play RE myself but I won't pass up watching my husband play the games.

We watched the Netflix show and I came away more annoyed than my husband after the first episode. It's not even ""it's so bad it's good,"" it was insultingly bad."
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,I didn't express any opposition to that approach.
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,">I am actually confused why you seem so against that approach.

That is not what the person you are arguing against is saying.

He's saying that a new approach was needed and that any new approach always comes with a risk.

The real issue is not the target audience, the issue is the quality of the show."
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,How much money would that make though? Netflix want bigger successes than of Paul WS Anderson and Milla Jovovich. They're not above total schlock but they can make their own schlock. They're not going to buy a 25 year old franchise just to produce schlock.
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,That's the tragedy of TLJ. It really did have some good ideas but fumbled the execution and the ending. That script needed a chop happy editor big time.
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,"The Netflix show was just trash, other than the dude who played Wesker, the girls‚Äô father"
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,"You are right that Resident Evil is a small enough franchise to experiment on. I can't imagine that Netflix paid a lot for the IP or the production of the show. If you want to try something Resident Evil is the place to do it.

> They're not going to buy a 25 year old franchise just to produce schlock.

Ironically, they did exactly that."
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,"Well I'm using a very specific, traditional(perhaps outdated?) form of ""schlock"" here. But yeah I suppose a lot of the 2010s YA trend could be just lumped into a modern schlock category. Though they usually had enough of a budget to be safe from that label."
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,Seems like this week is the week for shows that didn't get promoted and are there just to fill in slots. Hopefully there are a few gems that stick around for quite a while!
La Robe De Mariee Des Cieux,"Watched the Super Fun Night pilot.  It was really rough.  Rebel Wilson was struggling with the American accent the whole time, and there were a couple out-of-place, incredibly dark jokes that just killed the tone of the scene they were in.  Skip it."

I know I've completely ruined the joke but it's how I remember it"
Touch Your Heart,Hicka bicka boo?
Touch Your Heart,I had no idea Friedle voiced Ron!
Touch Your Heart,"I was halfway through that video before I realized they weren't doing new episodes. Basically the cast ""reunited"" just to talk about the old shows. Bummer. It was such a cool cartoon. My oldest two kids were little when the show first came out."
Touch Your Heart,The live action movie was sadly a major oof.
Touch Your Heart,"Indeed!  The world was fun, the heroes were amazing and the villains were memorable.

Personal favorite antagonist: Se√±or Senior, Senior for the fact that he just did the villainy for fun."
Touch Your Heart,"There‚Äôs a synaptic portal for instant transmission in my brain between any mention of the moon landing and her singing ‚ÄúWe went to the moon, in 1969, not 1970 but one year soooooner.‚Äù"
Touch Your Heart,The movie was a total trip too!
Touch Your Heart,You might like the movie Mirrors 2
Touch Your Heart,You were on Even Stevens? When you were 9?
Touch Your Heart,The name is *I Hear Voices* for anyone else wondering
Touch Your Heart,"Yea that was literally the pilot episode I believe and even nearly two decades later I can hear that German man shout ""Nein means no!"" as he slams the door behind Ron."
Touch Your Heart,Hoo-sha!
Touch Your Heart,I always heard Eric
Touch Your Heart,"Well, Covid happened right after it landed so it's basically been forgotten."
Touch Your Heart,The fact that Ricardo Montalban played a billionaire who *wasn't* an evil supervillain... but then decided to become one after Ron explained him how fun it could be.
Touch Your Heart,That‚Äôs when we made a landing that was lunaaarrrrr
Touch Your Heart,Boooooo
Touch Your Heart,"I didnt til rewqtching it as an adult, but yeah he sounds like if eric was even more cartoony"
Touch Your Heart,"We went to the moon, in 1969, not 1968 but a year laaaterrrr!"
Touch Your Heart,"FX is the king of sleeper hits you wouldn‚Äôt have even considered   

I‚Äôll give any of their shows a try at this point."
Touch Your Heart,Oh shit it‚Äôs Lip from Shameless. That guy‚Äôs a damn good actor. Definitely down for a watch.
Touch Your Heart,"We found that one of the reasons we felt such anxiety the whole season is that you would have a phone ringing in the background nonstop. Like god damn, someone get the phone!"
Touch Your Heart,"*Yes, chef*"
Touch Your Heart,"So, like working in a restaurant?"
Touch Your Heart,CORNER!!!
Touch Your Heart,"""69 all day, Chef!""

\*edit\* it clearly shows here I wrote ""chef"" but for reason it came out ""boss"" ...huh"
Touch Your Heart,"Carmy‚Äôs jacked. If he spends all his time and energy at the restaurant, how is he so jacked?"
Touch Your Heart,"Great show I binge watched it in one sitting. Jeremy Allen White is exceptional, I hope this gets him more roles. Matty Matheson is my hero and plays a great part."
Touch Your Heart,That ending had me in tears. >!Everything after he made the connection with Mikey and the sauce cans was some of the best TV I‚Äôve seen in recent memory.!<
Touch Your Heart,"Let it RIP....You don't have to agree with me, but Jeremy Allen White's acting in scene where he talks about him and Mikey..is some of the BEST piece of acting I have ever seen"
Touch Your Heart,Agreed.   Episode 7 when the shit hit the fan ....reminded me  of my pharmacy when everyone wanted everything  at once. I left and finished the Episode in the other room .  This is almost like a less dysfunctional version of Shameless... another Jeremy Allen-White  program  that was on Showtime
Touch Your Heart,"This has been compared to Uncut Gems in terms of making the viewer uncomfortable and stressed. That was one of the first movies to incite that uneasiness in me. I'm not sure I am ready to do that to myself again.

*edit : After all your lovely comments I went and watched the first two episodes. Holy fuckballs. This show is absolutely fantastic. I.have no doubt the drama will be heavy as well when they get into the brothers death, but the pacing, acting and dialog are killer.

Thanks all for setting me straight! Might be my.second favorite show of 2022. I mean, Better Call Saul will always have my top prize. Although I am a bit biased because I got to film with Bob last year. Look for me in the Gene scenes in Ep 10, July 23rd ;)"
Touch Your Heart,"It's a great show, cousin."
Touch Your Heart,"Definitely one of the best things to come out this year. Short and sweet, they knew what they wanted to do and did it."
Touch Your Heart,Episode 7 gave me the only panic attack in my life that I actually enjoyed. Felt so real.
Touch Your Heart,"Its a really great show but I couldn't watch it.

Its like the other great show on FX is the old man, and that's like secret agent stressful, the Bear is like my shitty job stressful I can't deal. 

Great show, not for me."
Touch Your Heart,Brought back so much stress and latent PTSD from my line cook days. Love it. Favorite new show.
Touch Your Heart,My favorite thing is Hulu promotes the show as a comedy.
Touch Your Heart,"Ok, I thought it was just me and my anxiety issues that made this so stressful to watch.  I had to get up and pace because I almost couldn‚Äôt handle it.  I hung in there because Jeremy Allen White is SO FUCKING GOOD.  That monologue in the last episode.  Jesus Christ.  I‚Äôve been thinking about it for days."
Touch Your Heart,"For anyone who likes The Bear, I recommend a recent Stephen Graham film called Boiling Point.It follows the same 'nightmare day at work' feel in a restaurant, and is entirely done in one take."
Touch Your Heart,Lip just can‚Äôt get out of Chicago.
Touch Your Heart,Did anyone else get boyfriend vibes from Marcus and his roommate Chester? I feel like they are more than just friends
Touch Your Heart,"Wife and I binged the whole show on Sunday, it's great"
Touch Your Heart,Heard.
Touch Your Heart,"‚ÄúAny of you incel, Q-anon, 4chan, Snyder cut motherfuckers wanna get out of line now?!?‚Äù"
Touch Your Heart,This show gives me anxiety. It's somehow fantastic lol
Touch Your Heart,"Great show, but I don't get the ""cousin"" thing. I've never heard people call each other cousin like that. Is that a Chicago thing?"
Touch Your Heart,"As someone who has worked in restaurants for 10+ years, this is the closest a show has ever gotten to accurately depict what it‚Äôs like to be in the kitchen. Plus, Ayo Edebiri is a fucking star."
Touch Your Heart,"Episode 7 ‚Äúthe review‚Äù is the most amazing, loud, weird, and emotional and thought provoking episode on current tv. 
Highly recommended!"
Touch Your Heart,"It‚Äôs really quite a show.

I worked for a chef recently who came from the 3* world and the personality similarity is shocking. It really captures the feeling of some different parts of restaurant service amazingly, though there are some details that aren‚Äôt *quite* right.

I also lost my best friend 18 months ago and those notes have resonated pretty highly with me, I‚Äôve cried a few times in the first two episodes."
Touch Your Heart,This show is well done but I had to bail because it‚Äôs just so anxiety inducing to watch
Touch Your Heart,"One of the best shows anywhere right now. Just a great show that really gets your heart rate up. Totally know this family, totally understand the dynamics. Totally gets the work place. It's just too real that's what makes it so good. The writers, producers and directors need to be given a fuck ton on money."
Touch Your Heart,Episode 7 was one of the best episodes of television I have seen in a long time.
Touch Your Heart,How does it compare to films like Boiling Point.
Touch Your Heart,Just wrapped it up in 3 days‚Ä¶it is genuine and an adrenaline ride. Loved it and would highly recommend!!!
Touch Your Heart,This show is really good! Have 1 more episode to go.
Touch Your Heart,"Man, I really tried to watch it.  The conflict is too stressful for me.  I don't understand why, as the rightful owner of the restaurant, he didn't threaten to fire all those disrespectful chucklefucks halfway through the first day.  Instead he just kept screaming ""Please!  Please!"" all the time.

When I correctly predicted some mobster type would show up to shake him down, because no way they wouldn't take the opportunity to add to the drama, I decided it's not for me."
Touch Your Heart,Still waiting to watch it in Canada
Touch Your Heart,"Unless you‚Äôre in canada and can‚Äôt watch it, even though it was advertised that you‚Äôd be able to."
Touch Your Heart,This is not the first time I‚Äôve seen this exact post title posted on Reddit. This is a paid spam/shill account.
Touch Your Heart,Article is almost unreadable due to the constant movement of the text as more and more ads get pumped onto the page. What a disaster.
Touch Your Heart,I want to give this show a try but I'm worried it's just misery porn.  Does it have levity and humanity or does it just leave you feeling bad?
Touch Your Heart,"I‚Äôve watched a few episodes and the acting has been terrific, but I‚Äôm trying to figure out the point? Like‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs the arc?  This might be like Mad Men. Everyone loves it, but nothing ever really happens."
Touch Your Heart,"Yeah I'm not sure who binged this. They're either stronger than me, or have never worked BOH."
Touch Your Heart,"This is funny bc my friend and I started watching it this weekend and 5 minutes in I said, ‚ÄúThis is giving me anxiety, I can‚Äôt watch it.‚Äù I just had to up my Lexapro. I‚Äôll give it a whirl after it kicks in."
Touch Your Heart,"I‚Äôm 5 episodes in. 7.5/10 for me so far, it‚Äôs good not great. Maybe that opinion will change by the end"
Touch Your Heart,I know what you mean. I really enjoy it but I‚Äôm tired after watching. It‚Äôs really intense.
Touch Your Heart,"If you love the character [Neil Fak (Matty Matheson)](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm8274309/) do yourself a favour and check out his show ‚ÄòJust a Dash‚Äô on YouTube. It‚Äôs his hilarious and surreal cooking show that demands to be seen.

Touch Your Heart,Feels like I‚Äôm watching the Gallaghers all over again. Love it!
Touch Your Heart,Watched it in 2 days. I want 50 more episodes.
Touch Your Heart,"It‚Äôs a great show. We‚Äôll written and superbly acted. But I really have to give the entire crew props for their long camera shots and one shots. 

There are some really long scenes in this show without camera edits or cuts, whether it‚Äôs focusing on one character doing a several minute monologue, or in one case they do a 10-15 minute one shot following various characters around during the chaos of a dinner service, all in one take. From a technical perspective it is incredible to watch."
Touch Your Heart,Is this an ad?
Touch Your Heart,"Episode 7, that was filmed in one take, was honestly one of the best episodes of TV I've seen in a very long time. It was so stressful, but so absolutely brilliant. This whole series is stellar."
Touch Your Heart,Yes Chef!
Touch Your Heart,"It's basically just Lip running a restaurant that's also in Chicago, but it's so damn good"
Touch Your Heart,I tried to watch it. Too much for me. That's a compliment.
Touch Your Heart,"Just finished this last night. It is my personal opinion that this year, only Severance is a better show and even that's debateable. Just phenomenal television and I hope to see them get what they deserve this year come award season."
Touch Your Heart,The title give me have a stroke
Touch Your Heart,It‚Äôs Uncut Gems in a kitchen.
Touch Your Heart,I'm not from the service industry but a fan/musician into hard rock and punk and the most stressful part of the show is never hearing the rest of that Refused song.
Touch Your Heart,"loved this show, just finished it today..gave me flashbacks of working in the kitchen !!! Not for the weak"
Touch Your Heart,Episode 7 was one of the best episodes of the year easily
Touch Your Heart,It was just on the edge of too manic for me. If the episodes were any longer i couldnt do it.
Touch Your Heart,"After he sold his ragged denim for meat, had to turn it off."
Touch Your Heart,I am glad to hear it is not just me that found it stressful. I stopped watching though...it was too anxiety provoking
Touch Your Heart,Lol the title ‚Äúgive you have you‚Äù. Are titles hard OP?
Touch Your Heart,I finally stopped having dreams about being in the weeds. I think I‚Äôll pass.
Touch Your Heart,Or give you have a heart attacküíÄ
Touch Your Heart,As a chef I get anxiety watching this show
Touch Your Heart,"I got to episode 7 (and I might keep watching), but the main girl really drags the show down with her plot lines (and her acting) imo. I do like the dynamic between the cousins though. 

But also the idea of a family diner running like a big time restaurant feels weird to me."
Touch Your Heart,This show is absolutely fantastic.
Touch Your Heart,"Really? I watched 3-4 episodes and kind of hated it. It's just people screaming. Feel bad for the actor, he apparently is typecast as asshole from Chicago."
Touch Your Heart,Best show I‚Äôve seen in a very long time. Enjoyed every second of it.
Touch Your Heart,"Okay, I got around to watching it this week, and it's a good show. Probably would have worked better as a movie, but it's still nice enough. I've done some restaurant work, and it was never like that, but I'll accept that the situation is specific and unusual. However, before I started watching, I was told it's a comedy? The show ain't funny, darkly or otherwise. So that's a heads up for anyone who wants to watch it now during the hype. It's a fine show, there's even some decent drama, but it's not funny. At all"
Touch Your Heart,This title is next level awful.
Touch Your Heart,"I love this show. Very heavy at times, but I love the character development.

It's funny from time to time, but I don't watch it to laugh... so idk if the ""Comedy"" label feels accurate on Hulu"
Her Private Life,Amazing luck that her daughter got the role.
Her Private Life,Still pissed about her letting Jack go‚Ä¶..
Her Private Life,Is this the sequel to I am Sam?
Her Private Life,Remember when Spielberg's daughter got attached as director to some film and she said her name had nothing to do with it and how she had to struggle like everyone else? lol
Her Private Life,I hope she is good. I would hate to see something with Kate Winslet ruined by bad acting.
Her Private Life,I've gotta be honest. This stuff has never really been an issue in fields like acting. If an actor who's a draw wants to do a project with their kid or whoever... let em. Project probably wouldn't exist otherwise anyway
Her Private Life,"It's the lying that aggravates more than the nepotism! Just say you wanted to give your daughter a leg up, ffs."
Her Private Life,That‚Äôs a pretty ignorant statement.
Her Private Life,"I mean her boobs were great in titanic.  I mean, her acting was great in titanic."
Her Private Life,"It's an objectively true statement. Actors are allowed to work with their own kids. 

Whatever ""fairness"" is being breached never existed. Get famous enough to have pull and you can do a project with some friends or family. Welcome to life."
Her Private Life,"Lol, you‚Äôre completely missing the point. But that‚Äôs cool!"
Her Private Life,No I'm not. Maybe don't apply my words to a context other than the one I used them in?
Her Private Life,"Really giant implications you‚Äôre missing. Again, very ignorant views on your part."
Her Private Life,In this specific context? No.
Her Private Life,‚ÄúKids of actors getting roles has never been an issue‚Äù. üòÇ
Her Private Life,If you have to make up quotes I didn't say in my posts right above you then you are just admitting you are wrong
Her Private Life,That‚Äôs called paraphrasing
Her Private Life,She was the best part of Zombieland 2. She really market corrected Haley Lu Richardson
Her Private Life,"Man, all these comments hating on her for having a famous mother. Half of Hollywood is related. She's pretty talented from the movies I've seen her in.  Are we also hating on Josh Brolin? I get people like Kevin Smith's daughter who can't act (well, she acts about as well as Kevin does), but Zoey can act."
Her Private Life,"Just finished watching ""Not okay"", a movie that wasn't even on my radar and I just decided to watch because of Zoey. She's a really good actress, and as far as nepotism babies go, she's one of the most talented ones, and still SO underrated! ugh"
Her Private Life,"She was honestly the best part of Zombieland 2 and that lazy script, I had no idea she was Lea Thompson‚Äôs daughter until this article but now I can see it

Edit: lmao at the comments criticizing her for being a nepotism kid of famous parents, like it hasn‚Äôt been a thing for decades and includes a bunch of your favorites like Carrie Fisher, Kiefer Sutherland, Nic Cage, Liv Tyler, Rashida Jones, Zoe Kravitz, Maya Hawke from Stranger Things, Jack Quaid from The Boys, etc 

John David Washington literally got his start on HBO‚Äôs Ballers because when they were casting the show someone remembered Denzel has a son who played football lmao no audition literally just because he had a famous dad, this is not a new thing"
Her Private Life,I swear this sub is so far up it‚Äôs own ass 98% of the time I hardly even read the comments anymore because it‚Äôs usually filled with bitter incel assholes who hate everything and everyone. Who gives a fuck if she has famous parents she can act and this movie is actually good. It‚Äôs solid social commentary on how social media has fucked our society sideways and how it ends is gut wrenching because of how bad the main character fucks up and she realizes this. The main character actually shows growth as a person which this sub needs to take  a cue from.
Her Private Life,"Not Okay was cringey, dumb AF, &... hilarious. Check it out."
Her Private Life,"Anyone else read that as ""Not okay with her star turn in Zombieland"" at first?"
Her Private Life,Shout out to Ringer which I think was her first starring role.
Her Private Life,Buffaloed was so good.
Her Private Life,[deleted]
Her Private Life,Nepotism.
Her Private Life,Well it all happened with my mother was famous rich and connected in Hollywood.
Her Private Life,‚ÄúOh my god I *literally* missed you guys! Hi old guy!‚Äù
Her Private Life,"> She really market corrected Haley Lu Richardson

?"
Her Private Life,I see the similarities but I think they have very different archetypes they excel at. Richardson is great in more dramatic work like Columbus or After Yang whereas Deutch is perfect playing really unlikable characters but making them charming somehow.
Her Private Life,IMO her character ruined the movie for me
Her Private Life,Kevin is a much better dramatic actor than his daughter when he actually tries.
Her Private Life,"I don‚Äôt really mind nepotism in entertainment. The worst thing that can happen with that is that you get a crappy actor or singer in a movie. That sucks but no one really dies because of that. Nepotism in government, politics, other big corporations, etc. is way more problematic since it might lead to an incompetent, unqualified person making major decisions for other people. 

But who cares if Zoey Deutch got a break because her mom was Leah Remini or something? If she‚Äôs good at her job, and IMHO she is, then it‚Äôs not a serious problem."
Her Private Life,Surprised no one has talked about Nepotism parents.  They gave this Judd Apatow guy a movie on Netflix just because his daughter is a main cast member on Euphoria.  Hopefully that is the last we hear of that guy who easily made the biggest stinker of 2022.
Her Private Life,I just learnt now that Maya Hawke has incredibly famous parents omg. (That changes nothing to her talent. I was just surprised.)
Her Private Life,[removed]
Her Private Life,Cry
Her Private Life,Does this comment apply to every project Alexander Skarsgard and Angelina Jolie have been attached to?
Her Private Life,"‚ÄúBut they ain‚Äôt got what we do‚Ä¶‚Äù   
‚ÄúGuns.‚Äù   
‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have guns.‚Äù   
‚Äú*What!?*‚Äù"
Her Private Life,"It‚Äôs an old circus term. Because Zoey Deutch and HLR are about the same age and have a similar appearance, they‚Äôre probably up for the same roles. I think HLR had a bit more heat career-wise, but I think ZD probably has snuck ahead and is probably now taking big roles from HLR."
Her Private Life,"Also HLR seems to play more genuine (?) characters, if that makes sense. Zoey is always playing a snarky and sarcastic type. I really don‚Äôt think they take similar roles at all, they just look alike."
Her Private Life,*Lea Thompson. :)
Her Private Life,She somehow looks exactly like both of her parents at the same time.  I wasn't particularly surprised to be honest.
Her Private Life,"That one was kinda obvious, tbh"
Her Private Life,People forget that all of these productions are investments. Money and careers are at stake.  And no one is compromising their investments by handing out roles to do a favor for Zoey Deutch's parents
Her Private Life,"100%. When you‚Äôre around it your entire life, you know what it looks like to prep for a role and act in a role, on top of your already successful parents knowing what avenues (schools/training/etc) to push you towards to set you up for success. That absolutely gives you a leg up in the industry. Same thing in sports/coaching. There is causation here, but it isn‚Äôt the nepotism some claim it to be."
Her Private Life,"Nepobabies rule the world, so they don't need you to defend them."
Her Private Life,YES! And you should feel that way also. Just like the CEO's kid bossing you around after their first year there and your 10th.
Her Private Life,‚ÄúI look like a pencil‚Äù
Her Private Life,I love Claire
Her Private Life,"Claire‚Äôs best scene was when she and sis were at the silent retreat center. Late at night after fighting, Fleabag comes into their room, gets into bed behind Claire, big spoon style. Claire reached back and grabs her sister‚Äôs hand/arm and pulls it over herself to snuggle closer. That‚Äôs when I knew Claire had some compassion in her. ü•∞"
Her Private Life,Such a perfect series!
Her Private Life,"My friends who are oldest sisters as well as myself all felt like, a physical reaction to her performance as Claire. There was just something so perfect about her portrayal of that tension, that perfectionism, that need to KEEP IT TOGETHER that I know a lot of oldest sisters feel. I don‚Äôt think I act (too much) like Claire but watching her felt like a mirror held up to some deep parts of my psyche."
Her Private Life,Life After Life is a great book. I didn't realize they're making it into a show - I'm excited for this.
Her Private Life,"She was so hilarious in this show, I also ended up crushing on her lol, even when she turned into a pencil"
Her Private Life,How does one pronounce Sian?
Her Private Life,I loved this series! I was heartbroken for her (no spoilers)
Her Private Life,I love the way this ended. The perfect song choice for a perfect ending. The ending lives rent free in my mind.
Her Private Life,"I really wanted Clifford to win an emmy for that performance, it was so good."
Her Private Life,Love how the series ended. It is definitely a perfect series.
Her Private Life,"I want to see a show called Flea's Bag.

A lifestyle show following Flea of Red Hot Chili Peppers"
Her Private Life,"If you love her and PWB together, watch Crashing! It only had one season, but it‚Äôs hilarious and she‚Äôs even funnier in that. Also has Jonathan Bailey way pre-Bridgerton."
Her Private Life,Miss this show everyday
Her Private Life,"I love her and PWB as sisters. Also love another British duo who played sisters (and act a lot together), Sharon Horgan and Aisling Bea"
Her Private Life,It was a uniquely funny show. British show have a certain charm to them.
Her Private Life,"This whole series (well, both seasons) and this character were so well written. And the character was superbly acted. She absolutely nailed it. I LOL just thinking about some of the dialogue. 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell me how big my fucking office is‚Äù"
Her Private Life,She was excellent in her episode of Inside No 9
Her Private Life,And here I have been hanging out for season 3. Felt like it could go in a couple more seasons.
Her Private Life,"""Tooting.""

I died."
Her Private Life,Yay!!! God she was my favorite! I really hope we see her in alot more.
Her Private Life,"Shake your phone

Take a break from news"
Her Private Life,The show is massively overrated
Her Private Life,She's still very attractive
Her Private Life,I don‚Äôt get it. It‚Äôs a show about privileged attractive women self-sabotaging themselves because‚Ä¶.?
Her Private Life,What and who?
Her Private Life,[deleted]
Her Private Life,Cutting fleabag after 2 seasons was cheap af
Her Private Life,Love her so much. She was so monumental on the show.
Her Private Life,It's French!
Her Private Life,*I LOOK LIKE A PENCIL!*
Her Private Life,"‚ÄúI have two degrees, a husband, and a Burberry coat.‚Äù"
Her Private Life,"When I watched a recording of the original stageplay (it's on Amazon Prime, I think, through National Theatre live) the main thing I thought when it was over was how important Sian Clifford really was to the show. Kinda knew that anyway, obviously, but it was a really huge like ""oh, wait, she's so key to this"" that came from her absence in the stage version."
Her Private Life,Absolutely loved that episode!  Very touching.  And the gag with the woman silently getting stung by the wasp and ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been stung by a wasp‚Äù appearing on the chalkboard later in the episode was my favorite joke of the series.
Her Private Life,"and when she says ""the only person I'd run through an airport for is you"""
Her Private Life,That's the episode that turned the show around for me. I really didn't like it at first because I found Fleabag herself *so unlikable* and miserable but that episode really humanised both her and Claire.
Her Private Life,I love the scene when she and her sister are listening to that feminist speaker and they both raise their hands when she asks if they would give up 5 years of their lives for the perfect body
Her Private Life,It‚Äôs one of those that you want more of but at the same time glad it ended because it was perfect
Her Private Life,"It‚Äôs a great love story - with oneself, with the priest and with Claire."
Her Private Life,https://i.imgur.com/bDOnvXz.mp4

Her Private Life,Sharn.

Her Private Life,Why heartbroken? >!I was extremely happy for her!!<
Her Private Life,Looking at the engagement on this post it will do better than this show
Her Private Life,"Just for the sake of clarity to anyone reading this, Sian Clifford isn't in crashing."
Her Private Life,"FYI Sharon and Aisling are Irish, not British"
Her Private Life,It‚Äôs‚Ä¶not about that?
Her Private Life,"No its about a dysfunctional person trying to overcome addiction,guilt and shame while trying to juggle her family and social life at the same time."
Hotel Del Luna,Damn a lot of people still watch GOT
Hotel Del Luna,Poland with Trailer Park Boys in the top 10 lmao
Hotel Del Luna,"Hey FYI  - the French show ""The Bureau"" is by FAR the best espionage/spy/thriller TV show out there. Makes shows like Homeland look amateurish. I would highly recommend it."
Hotel Del Luna,I'm glad to see that *Dead to Me* made the list.
Hotel Del Luna,Surprised Dark isn't on here. Most overlooked show of all time.

VIVA LA MERDA"
Hotel Del Luna,"Wow, ""Hollywood"" so high. Too be fair the first episodes were interesting but then it turned to a cringey cheesefest if there ever was one."
Hotel Del Luna,"Damn feel like I really need to watch Money Heist now. Happy to see The Last Kingdom on that list, it‚Äôs such a good show."
Hotel Del Luna,"I'm surprised The Last Kingdom was that high.  I've enjoyed the show, I just didn't know it was that popular."
Hotel Del Luna,"Kirin Ga Kuru - does anybody know how to get hands on those NHK taiga dramas with english subtitles? 

There was once one about Yoshitsune and ""Tales of the Heike"" on youtube, but unfortunately it was pulled after a time so I could never finish it. It was a bit overly long but I found it still very interesting, and learned a lot about Japanese history."
Hotel Del Luna,Proof that popularity and quality are not always related. Peaky Blinders LMFAO.
Hotel Del Luna,"Had no idea Westworld was so popular, am always surprised when it gets renewed each year since nobody really talks highly of it. As someone who loves the movie and really enjoyed season 1, the show turned to absolute shite after it embraced its embarrassingly simple and shallow themes on feminism 101 and introduction to socialism, and the dialogue is atrocious. So much wasted opportunity for a fun and genre bending sci fi show. I was hoping it would be canceled and then rebooted properly in ten years."
Hotel Del Luna,Never heard of Money Heist
Hotel Del Luna,"Right lol I've seen a lot of people on reddit try to push a ""no one cares about GOT since they ruined it with the last season"" narrative but it seems like a lot of people are still watching the show even a year after it ended."
Hotel Del Luna,Doesn't this just mean people are looking up Game of Thrones on Wikipedia? Seems like the type of show where there would be a lot of people looking up stuff about it even if they hate it or aren't watching it.
Hotel Del Luna,"Well now I‚Äôm intrigued, never heard of it. Thanks for the suggestion, I love well made espionage shows"
Hotel Del Luna,"Dark is a great show that I would not recommend to most people. It is like watching Primer, which is also a good movie but not something I would recommend to people."
Hotel Del Luna,Dark is on there for Germany.

Hotel Del Luna,"Thanks, we plan to prepare detailed description in the next research and submit the paper to scientific conference/journal soon.  On the other hand, if some of ""overclockers"" will known how we do that, they will prepare additional ""cheat codes"" ;)"
Hotel Del Luna,"That link took me to some alternate world where Wikipedia ain‚Äôt in American, I dint like it."
Hotel Del Luna,you should look it up on wikipedia
Hotel Del Luna,"reddit just likes to act like they're smarter than the rest of the population to make themselves feel better. They do the same thing with the movie Avatar. ""There is no cultural impact it's a trash movie blah blah blah"" lmao"
Hotel Del Luna,"That's because, despite what many Redditors will have you think, most people watch TV for the journey and not the destination. A few stinkers at the end don't erase all the prior successes of a TV show in the same way that, say, a bad film ending makes the entire film bad."
Hotel Del Luna,"I think anyone who finishes the show is so disgusted by it, that turning on it is inevitable."
Hotel Del Luna,"Yeah pretty much which also explains why 'Hollywood' is so popular since it also features some old hollywood stars, not surprised if people are looking those up. It doesn't really mean 'a lot' of people are still watching it but it's a safe assumption I guess. Most shows don't really need to get wikipediaed."
Hotel Del Luna,It‚Äôs by far the best one if you can get past the game subtitles it‚Äôs great. Ultra realistic
Hotel Del Luna,"I always recommend Dark. 

I warn against Primer."
Hotel Del Luna,Yeah but even there it's #10. Should be much higher in general.
Hotel Del Luna,What movie? There is only the animated series.
Hotel Del Luna,Yes. It's a wonderful show! I need to start my rewatch before season 3 comes out.
Hotel Del Luna,"Do it, you won‚Äôt regret it. I just finished another rewatch of S1 & S2 in preparation and am contemplating doing it. I‚Äôve tried to start other shows since I finished my rewatch about five days ago...but the quality of Dark is so good it feels like others can‚Äôt compare right now."
Hotel Del Luna,Season one was ok. I miss the troll hunter. Will check out season two soon though.
Hotel Del Luna,"Never heard of this, very interested because I love Del Toro and the inclusion of voices like Offerman and Yuen and Close make me even more interested. Is season 2 the end?"
Hotel Del Luna,"Jim, and the other characters that left with him, will be back for the 3rd show later this year: Wizards."
Hotel Del Luna,"So it is part of a larger universe called ""Tales of Arcadia"". The first show in the series is the 3 seasons of Trollhunters, 3below has the 2 seasons (the second season is the last for it), and the final show in the series is Wizards which isn't out yet."
Hotel Del Luna,"So, I guess their goal today was to take everyone who said D+ had no original content besides The Mandalorian, and pretty much punch them in the face repeatedly."
Hotel Del Luna,Hooch is crazy
Hotel Del Luna,"Every official announcement/trailer.

Hotel Del Luna,I thought this was wallstreebets DD for a second lol
Hotel Del Luna,"Nothing on any of the ""old"" Netflix series has me sad...  Nice write up, though."
Hotel Del Luna,/u/arashtp you missed Percy Jackson.
Hotel Del Luna,Super stoked on most of this. I‚Äôm especially looking forward to the Nat geo content. Can you imagine if Disney+ dropped with half of these titles? Game changer
Hotel Del Luna,"Based on the release timelines of those shows, it looks like their strategy is: 

Zeitgeist show for 6 weeks -> 1 week of cool down ‚Äî> couple weeks of hype up -> next Zeitgeist show -> Repeat"
Hotel Del Luna,They're really going all out with the High Republic.
Hotel Del Luna,did She Hulk get a trailer or anything?
Hotel Del Luna,that's a lot of content
Hotel Del Luna,"So strange to realize Ice Age is owned by Disney now. 

Also I‚Äôm sort of unexpectedly excited about the continuation of Mighty Ducks!"
Hotel Del Luna,A Turner and Hooch reboot yyyeeeeessss!!! I've been a fan (we call ourselves Hoochers) for years and am flipping out right now!!!!
Hotel Del Luna,Missing rogue squadron on Star Wars
Hotel Del Luna,Hocus Pocus 2. What.
Hotel Del Luna,"A lot of this is awesome, but can I just take a moment to appreciate *Sister Act 3*?"
Hotel Del Luna,">Tiana is the first princess to have her own Walt Disney Animation Studios series

Just going to ignore the Little Mermaid and Tangled series apparently."
Hotel Del Luna,[deleted]
Hotel Del Luna,I have only read a hand full of moon knight comics but from what I have heard and read making a PG moon knight show is not going to go over well with fans.
Hotel Del Luna,Any specific dates to go with this?
Hotel Del Luna,You forgot the multiple tongue in cheek references to Matt Murdock.  Charlie Cox's Daredevil is officially part of the MCU now.  Hes apparently in She Hulk and Spider-Man 3.
Hotel Del Luna,"Damn, the Ducks end up becoming what they rebelled against..."
Hotel Del Luna,"As a bi dude I'm still waiting for literally anything big that features a non-straight dude. In film they ignored it almost completely out of fear of gay-hating countries banning it and them losing money (like China). 

Really hoping for something to come through, maybe with x-men back in the fold Iceman could get something"
Hotel Del Luna,So is Ahsoka taking the place of the Rebels spinoff? Because thats what I was most excited for
Hotel Del Luna,Disney is milking Star Wars and Marvel for everything dollar they can squeeze. There are way too many reboots and remakes. They need originally sourced content that has no reliance on existing IP. How about some original NON-Marvel/Star Wars scripted content? I think the Mandalorian is a cute show but I want to see ORIGINAL content for once. This slate of shows are not enough to keep all of their subscribers satisfied.
Hotel Del Luna,I just want to have the spin off Thrawn and Ezra travels in space show.
Hotel Del Luna,"Hey, bozo, why didn't you mention It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia?

Great list, otherwise."
Hotel Del Luna,so much content that post alone made me vomit .
Hotel Del Luna,Seems like Star Wars's future is on TV.
Hotel Del Luna,Is it weird that I'm most excited for the Josh Peck version of Turner and Hooch?
Hotel Del Luna,"Looks like they're updating Microcosmos with A Real Bug's Life, that should be cool as fuck."
Hotel Del Luna,">The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers

>Lauren Graham (Gilmore Girls, Parenthood) and Emilio Estevez (reprising his role from the original feature films) star in the next chapter of the hit Mighty Ducks franchise, premiering in early 2021. In present day Minnesota, the Mighty Ducks have evolved from scrappy underdogs to an ultra-competitive, powerhouse youth hockey team. After 12-year-old Evan is unceremoniously cut from the Ducks, he and his mom Alex set out to build their own ragtag team of misfits to challenge the cutthroat, win-at-all-costs culture of competitive youth sports.

I hope Disney has been paying attn to Cobra Kai and takes all the good from it and applies it to the Ducks!!!"
Hotel Del Luna,"Man, Tony Stark cannot keep control of his tech, can he? Well, I guess he's dead, so that makes sense."
Hotel Del Luna,The one thing I want from Marvel is an OG Nick Fury and the Howling Commandos show.
Hotel Del Luna,They forgot Shadow Hunters.
Hotel Del Luna,Disney+ launch was more like beta test to ensure their decision of allocating such resources to the platform
Hotel Del Luna,"The criticism was regarding lack of original screenplays, too. It's still true in that aspect."
Hotel Del Luna,"It's still lacks diversity, it's still marvel, star wars and Pixar animated pg-13 movies, still no new new IPs."
Hotel Del Luna,[deleted]
Hotel Del Luna,"If they don't have Phill Lewis playing the dog using mocap, they dun goofed."
Hotel Del Luna,*holds up lighter*
Hotel Del Luna,Thanks man you're awesome
Hotel Del Luna,[Rogue squadron](https://youtu.be/5bLkTjn6Y_s)
Hotel Del Luna,Not enough üöÄüöÄüöÄ
Hotel Del Luna,"Just hints at Daredevil, from Sony in Spider-Man 3 and at the reveal here today for She-Hulk."
Hotel Del Luna,"Yeah sounds like the Multiverse in SM3 will pull in Daredevil and Kingpin. Which could be great.

Daredevil was hinted at strongly for SheHulk, and there have been rumors that DNofrio has campaigned hard and they‚Äôve taken him seriously as maybe using his character to put together the Sinister Six."
Hotel Del Luna,"There's a big hint in Hawkeye. Maya Lopez is a definitively Daredevil character (Echo, a deaf woman who can see something once and imitate it originally hired by Kingpin to take out Daredevil and eventually befriending him). She also wore the Ronin outfit for awhile that Hawkeye wore in Endgame after his family vanished (New Avengers comics).

Edit: why am I being downvoted for this?"
Hotel Del Luna,And Swiss Family Robinson.
Hotel Del Luna,It‚Äôs pretty genius
Hotel Del Luna,Super into the Acolyte as I‚Äôd really like to see what the Sith/dark side users were up to during this time period
Hotel Del Luna,"No, but they confirmed Tatiana Maslany."
Hotel Del Luna,Tim Roth will be back as Abomination and Mark Ruffalo.
Hotel Del Luna,Its a rather deceptive line if your not in the know.  WDAS is the movie studio. Disney Television Animation is the studio that typically handles the TV side (they were the ones that made the Tangled series).
Hotel Del Luna,That's not necessarily a bad thing tbh. It's how they execute it that matters. GOTG was kinda considered a bottom of the barrel IP for marvel before they made it and it turned out well.
Hotel Del Luna,"There‚Äôs like 70 announced shows here and less than 10 are actual original ideas. Really disappointing *in my opinion*.

I get people like Star Wars and stuff, but it seems extreme to me."
Hotel Del Luna,"I think it could be done. For me at least the fun part is the mind-bendy unreliable narrator stuff and not the graphic violence. Although there is something to be said for when other characters meet Moon Knight and are like, ""oh this guy is *crazy* crazy and not just *Batman* crazy."""
Hotel Del Luna,"This didn‚Äôt mention any of the Marvel movies since it‚Äôs still not certain whether they‚Äôll be released in theaters first or on Disney+ at the same time, but The Eternals is set to have their first openly gay main character whenever that‚Äôs released.

If you haven‚Äôt watched the Disney+ short film Out, you absolutely should."
Hotel Del Luna,"Young Avengers is just over the horizon, and that comes with the most prominent gay couple in marvel. Still a few years out though."
Hotel Del Luna,Not sure if it is 100% confirmed but I remember seeing somewhere that Valkyrie is looking for a wife in the next Thor movie.
Hotel Del Luna,"As a fellow homo, I'm sorry you're getting downvoted, but that's r/television for you. I've learned not to bring up representation issues on this sub anymore."
Hotel Del Luna,"I would bet it will be in a team, or they will reveal the character is gay in a sequel...that way people in China will already be invested.  Because you‚Äôre right....they want that China money badly. 


Wouldn‚Äôt it be a kick in the nuts to China if the wait until like Shang Chi 3 and reveal he was gay the whole time! Lmao. That could literally start a war!!"
Hotel Del Luna,"I feel like this'll be a big part of the Ashoka show, considering that she was still searching when we see her in The Mandolorian."
He is psychometric,two and a half men is multi cam right so it reuses sets a lot or whatever probably and doesn't do a lot of on location filming.
He is psychometric,Multi camera v single camera. Single camera  has more locations  and more takes v multi camera shot mostly on reused sets with a couple takes at most.
He is psychometric,"Multicam shows are more like doing a play, you can run through a lot more of the show in one take and cover a lot more angles at a time. Longer takes + fewer setups = much shorter days."
He is psychometric,"Actor/entertainment worker here.

Multi camera sitcoms like 2 and Half Men, Big Bang Theory, Seinfeld, all are shot like stage plays that are also being recorded. The actors have to memorize all their lines and scenes and marks and it takes a lot of preparation. But you show up to one location (the set). All the set locations are built for you (the office, the house, the back yard, etc). Lighting is already set up. And in a few hours on filming day you can shoot a 22 minute episode. The general order of things is something similar to this: script is Monday. Table read/rewrites Tuesday (and of course throughout the week). Rehearsals/camera blocking Wednesday and Thursday. Friday is filming. Maybe a handful of pickup shots throughout the week. But it's a very efficient way to do things. 

On a single camera show, you're not limited to a few sets. The scope of those shows usually means a larger number of locations. And often you're traveling to them. And with that, it requires more time to set up. Everything has to be lit, set dressed, etc. You're not just shooting the same three walls week after week. You need four walls and you have to find them often in new places. You have to close down streets and coordinate stuff. And like the name implies, generally there are a lot of shots only using one camera, or at least that's the aesthetic. So you have to set up constantly for new shots. And setting up those shots takes time to coordinate lighting, camera people, actors, etc. It's more involved. So rather than set up for one big scene to be filmed at a time from afar, you're setting up hundreds of shots to be filmed individually. You're filming every day rather than on one day. It's constant. It's going to take longer filming 4-8 pages a day versus shooting it all in one quick go of things.

Granted, you could still do single cam like a play with the only difference being people hold the cameras and there's no audience. It's Always Sunny shoots most of their bar stuff that way. But what happens with those styles is that you often have more locations to go to because you can. It's not just everything in the house/office/bar. And you're spending a lot of time traveling and getting things perfect. You're less likely to see shots of actors covering their mouths and laughing like you would with friends. You have more passes and retakes of doing the thing. There's less structure in that style of creating that just expands the schedule."
He is psychometric,Game shows are the best production schedule. Bang off a couple of weeks shows in a couple of days.
He is psychometric,"My Name is Earl was a single cam show with locations that were a mix of soundstages and on location. Two and a Half Men was a Multi-camera show shot exclusively on one soundstage with very occasional trips to a backlot.

Multi-camera is often shot with a live studio audience. They're often there for a long time, but it's not like 10 hours. You can literally just brute force scenes through and it's a lot like live theater with the same urgency and energy.

Multi-camera sitcoms are also usually all shot on one soundstage with a couple permanent main sets all adjacent to one another. Changing locations for a scene usually just means scooting over to the left or right by a few feet. On special occasions they will shoot exteriors, always on a backlot. They do these sorts of scenes infrequently because they are more expensive.

Multi-camera sitcoms are... multi-camera. You have a few cameras recording the same action. In single cam shows, you have to reshoot a scene again from scratch if you want a different angle. Every time you move a camera you have to adjust lights, focus, move production equipment around so it's not in the shot, etc. Takes time.

Film sets are a lot of ""hurry up and wait."" It's long hours, but a lot of that time is involved with the technical process of setting up a shot. For multi-cam sitcoms, a lot of that tech debt is done ahead of time before the actors even show up for the day. All the lighting is figured out ahead of time and camera movements are simple and routine."
He is psychometric,">  I was just listening to Ashton kutcher on Howard Stern and besides the crazy facts that he made $750k an episode on 2 and half men

Why is that a crazy fact?

Kutcher is an A lister who was replacing the lead of a hugely successful show whose main character's public image had disintegrated. Kutcher had everything to loose."
He is psychometric,"In a sense, his relationship with his father drove him to make that much money."
He is psychometric,Imagine working 8 hour days and earning that much money ü§Ø
He is psychometric,Because sitcoms are always 1 set.
He is psychometric,"*He* worked 8 hour days. I bet the crew and background were there 12-14 hours. My kid is typically on sets for tv shows 12-14 hours at a time, but not every day. And, most don‚Äôt film on weekends. üòÇ"
He is psychometric,Live studio audience? I didn't watch 2 and a half men.
He is psychometric,"Eh, you've already got answers, but I'll add the main one I don't see anyone else saying. 

It's shot regularly on a soundstage at a studio. Most of the crew is union, so you avoid overtime by making it 8 hour days to stay within budget. 

Also, the live audience can't be there more than 8 hours because of some laws or something. 

Also studio time is framed around an 8 hour day."
He is psychometric,"Sitcom is predictable, like every week is the same and you know what to expect:

Example

Monday 
Table read through 

Tuesday 
Blocking on set

Wednesday
Read and blocking

Thursday and Friday audience show

Also Ashton was a well seasoned actor and the 2-1/2 men set was a well oiled machine when he was added on."
He is psychometric,"Number of cameras, number of scenes, number of actors, number of locations. All lower. Sitcoms cost way less time and money to make."
He is psychometric,"Most of the the entire show takes place in the same living room and sometimes kitchen, yes."
He is psychometric,Whereas so much of *Earl* was shot outdoors.
He is psychometric,Which also means the lighting and the like is a known factor. Effectively a setting you want for the set as opposed to setting stuff up and then not have it look how you want it and messing with it until it‚Äôs perfect
He is psychometric,"Also if it has a studio audience (which I believe Men did), then they probably have set times for the actual tapings so there's some sort of regularity for the crowds they bring in."
He is psychometric,"Yep. ""Single camera"" is basically like shooting a movie, both on location and on sets. ""Multi camera"" is the old fashioned 4 camera sitcom style which is largely confined to 2/3 sets.

The location work of single cam leads to long 12-14 hour days, just like any other film or tv show and you shoot five days a week. Multi cam hours are much saner since you're all just working on the same soundstage and only actually shoot two days a week. The rest of the week is spent rehearsing. Source: me, I work on both kinds of shows. Lots of people behind the scenes prefer to work on multi-cam."
He is psychometric,Almost 3 times as many takes‚Ä¶
He is psychometric,Is it also a shorter day because of child actor(s)?
He is psychometric,"Judge Judy had the best job. [3 days a week, every other week, $50 million a year. ](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/judge-judys-year-round-schedule-enormous-salary-and-career-advice/ODBY5UBHX32JC3AJEI5IL2PSNY/)"
He is psychometric,Yes. My kid has been an audience filler on a few shows like Family Feud back when the kid first started acting and this is how it was done. One long day to do a week‚Äôs worth of episodes.
He is psychometric,"Wait until they hear the person Kutcher initially replaced was making $1.8 million/episode

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest_paid_American_television_stars"
He is psychometric,The Friends cast were all making a million an episode years before that. That's pretty standard big-time sitcom actor pay.
He is psychometric,"What‚Äôs he talking about, Robin?"
He is psychometric,Toss in the front door and the deck you got 90% of the locations.
He is psychometric,Usually a weekday evening. Same day every week.
He is psychometric,Not always. You can schedule around limited time frames for things especially around that.
He is psychometric,And they each still make 20 mill a year from syndication.
He is psychometric,"A million an episode was a really big deal at the time, hardly standard. And Friends was like the biggest show in the world at the time whereas later seasons of Two and a half men was not exactly must-watch TV"
He is psychometric,Absolutely!
He is psychometric,They make more on the syndication than they ever made as salaries
He is psychometric,"That stat is over 10 years old and was never properly sourced.

I'd be curious as to what is the current figure."
He is psychometric,"Thank you, context matters, a million an episode was far from being standard at the time. Seems like some people don‚Äôt know what standard means."
He is psychometric,Yes. Friends almost ended early because of the salary demands they made. It was very much not the standard. They did an entire People spread on it at the time iirc because it was such a big deal.
He is psychometric,"$24M is more than $20M, so not true at all"
He is psychometric,Last season had 18 episodes
He is psychometric,"The author was almost weirdly defensive about positioning Bob as the central character, his name is the title of the show. It's OK to just accept he's the main character"
He is psychometric,"‚ÄúI may or may not have tried crack last night. I don't think I did. But if I did, I liked it.‚Äù"
He is psychometric,"The fact the The Belchers have little wins is the point of the show, they can‚Äôt open a second location or become a hit restaurant with out ruining the feel of the show. It would be like the lottery season of Roseanne"
He is psychometric,"Bob's Burgers is like taking a Xanax after watching all of those off-the-wall, over-the-top animated shows out there. It's a good wholesome show to bring me back down to mellow.

That being said, Bob has his restaurant and his family, and I think that is ""his win."""
He is psychometric,I hope one day Bob gets a win that lasts. Like a rooftop garden. I think Bob would love that.
He is psychometric,Being a beloved long running tv show that had its own movie released in theaters sounds like winning to me.
He is psychometric,My wife asked why I loved this show and why I started letting my kids get into ans I told her it's because it's the most loving family TV while being entertaining as hell. Each Belcher has each other's back regardless of anything else. I love the wholesome shit.
He is psychometric,"Bob is such an amazing dad. I knew my childhood was fucked up when Bob took Gene to that laser rock show, Gene freaked out, and Bob didn't ground him or call him a big sissy."
He is psychometric,"I would love it to be incredibly small and insignificant to everyone else, like a new shirt with a pocket or something:)"
He is psychometric,I would say Bob is the successor to Hal from Malcolm in the Middle for wholesome dads
He is psychometric,"I want to give a shout out to what a great mom and wife Linda is too. She accepts her family with all their quirks, and is always trying to understand more about herself along the way. She's supportive, but also not a pushover if she doesn't agree. I want to be a mom like that Linda."
He is psychometric,"I'm 33 and I want to be like Bob when I grow up.  He's such a hard working, wholesome dude.  He deserves a win."
He is psychometric,I ask myself WWBD when my son is driving me nuts. He really is a great dad in that regard. Him and Bandit from Bluey are top tier.
He is psychometric,He‚Äôll always be John McGuirk to me
He is psychometric,You can't yearn for a realistic victory for Bob when the reality is that a restaurant with a total amount of customers you can count on one hand means it would have closed long ago and he'd be even more miserable.
He is psychometric,"I just want the last episode to be them being successful.  Not overly ""jam packed every night"" but enough to live comfortably after the kids grow up and Louise moves out to conquer earth. 

Bob's Burgers is the most comfortable comfort show around, it's nice to just see a family actually love each other with no dumb 'omg they're cheating on me and my kids hate me!' nonsense."
He is psychometric,I just now realized that their business neighbor Mort's name is a pun because he provides mortuary services.
He is psychometric,Well he did just get a sign from a comet that his countertop choice was a good one so that's a win I think
He is psychometric,">We come to understand that Bob‚Äôs Burgers probably¬†could¬†be a big success, if Bob would simply give up some of his integrity and be more like Jimmy, but that‚Äôs not who he is. How can you not admire him for that?

That's why the show is so great. Bob gets wins, they're just small and really deserved. But when he does you can tell he really appreciates them. 

Would I love an episode where he sells a burger recipe that saves the restaurant financially so he could pay the rent? Sure. But that isn't who Bob is. He's not the guy who would sell out to a big corporation. He isn't the guy who would franchise and let other people make his burgers.

Just like his dad's diner, Bob just likes to cook and wants to run a small business. Sure he deserves more wins but he still gets them. 

Even if he wasn't his version of winning is making a really creative burger pun that gets a laugh. That and family are all that matter to Bob and that's why we love him."
He is psychometric,Bob wins every episode imo. His fam loves him and each other. Most dads would call that THE win
He is psychometric,"It's easier to be a good dad when you win, it's far harder when you're losing. That's why Bob is one of TV's best dads because he's a good dad in spite of their circumstances not because of them."
He is psychometric,"Personally, I think this is one of Bob‚Äôs best Dad moments.  Link opens in YouTube.

[Louise‚Äôs Volcano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtD-r3hRgeo)"
He is psychometric,">Compared with Linda, Bob grapples more often with the knowledge that he could be failing as a dad and as a provider. Where his wife is protected more in these situations by her own personal aura of optimism and adult naivete rather than let things like their often frightening financial situation really get to her, Bob stews on those perceived failures and lives with a constant, high-pitched background hum of anxiety.

I take a bit of umbrage with this depiction of Linda. She may be the high energy optimist but she's way more aware and involved than the author gives her credit for. Bob may be the driver of all things creative with the restraunt and is certainly the work horse in the kitchen, but Linda is in charge of managing the administrative side of the business and has a much keener understanding of their exact financial situation at any given point. I can't remember which episode it was but Linda left Bob alone to manage the restraunt while she went on a trip and he got completely overwhelmed managing their accounts, giving him a newfound appreciation for her contributions.

Linda isn't necessarily more naive than Bob; she just has a different personality and outlook on life. It also feels like Linda **tries** to be the silly upbeat one to counter Bob's tendency for cynicism."
He is psychometric,"What an absolutely terrible take. The writer doesn‚Äôt seem to understand the spirit of the show at all. Bob isn‚Äôt suffering, no matter how bad his life seems, because he has his family (his life is more than just his economic situation, this is his own mindset and it is explored in so so many episodes). That‚Äôs the charm of the show. Coming to terms with the fact that you don‚Äôt need wealth to be happy is the central theme of the show, and what makes it so special (this is a rare message in TV) Nobody is wishing for a ‚Äúbig win‚Äù that would just be a huge shark jump."
He is psychometric,I just want Bob to cook his beloved turkey on thanksgiving and enjoy it with his family.
He is psychometric,He got that baseball and I was happy for him
He is psychometric,"This is a weird take, like saying Wile E. Coyote really needs to catch the Road Runner. The conflicts are what drive the story."
He is psychometric,"Dude was stuck in a wall and decided to play poltergeist with his Daughter to scare her friends, dudes an absolute G"
He is psychometric,"He wins every day. Days with his loving wife and rambunctious imaginative kids.
Every day Louise avoids child protective services or a conviction.  Gene performs original songs every day.  Tina daily romance.
Never leave Bob!

Edit: The Menu Tower!"
He is psychometric,Someone absolutely does not understand Bob. Period.
He is psychometric,I love this show and I look forward to their Thanksgiving episodes every year.
He is psychometric,Someone should start a GoFundMe to help Bob pay his rent this month
He is psychometric,"He has one of the best voices for cartoons, a Family Guy episode (I think it was last week) had a bit where they said ""everyone should have John Benajim's voice"" lol"
He is psychometric,"Been binging Bob's Burgers for the first time. Some of the ways they ""fix"" their problems have irked me at how unfair it ends up being for Bob, especially when he has to suffer for someone else's screw up."
He is psychometric,Bandit from Bluey is the best dad
He is psychometric,"Bobs burgers, the great north, and Central Park are all my comfort shows right now and all three have amazing casts."
He is psychometric,What a weird article. Who watches TV like this?
He is psychometric,"No he should barely scrape by forever. It rings true. If it were real life, Bob's is the kind of place that struggles to stay in business for years, but it's where you take friends and family for a burger when they visit from out of town and they talk about it for years as ""that really good burger place we went"".

A place like Bob's is one day fated to either suddenly and mysteriously go under almost overnight, or have one of the kids take over and completely change the menu because Bob himself is the secret ingredient."
He is psychometric,"I have always said, what makes Bob's Burgers great is the fact that the Belcher's seem like your normal family. Bob is great because as a parent he tries to understand the kids perspective but most of the time he doesn't get it. But he still encourages the kids to try whatever it is they are fascinated by. Sometimes he joins in himself. Where most shows go over the top with stuff making it unrealistic, Bob's Burger keeps it fairly realistic and relatable."
He is psychometric,"I will say, bobs burgers sober is great, but bobs burgers high, amazing."
He is psychometric,"Bob's Burgers fills the same ""slice of life"" niche King of the Hill occupied."
He is psychometric,My wife watches this every night while knocking out so Ive heard the majority of the show at this point. All I can say are the one liners are the best part and there's so many great quotes.
He is psychometric,The only win that matters to me is when he gets his garden
He is psychometric,best dad is still doofenshmirtz but bob is a very close second
He is psychometric,I'm honoured
He is psychometric,"Bob chickens out of improving his life on a regular basis. In the episode where he has the opportunity to expand into the building next door, he sees in a dream that he‚Äôs successful making different types of food but he neglects a burger on a grill. That made him choose to keep things the way they are barely scraping by.
Also in the episode where his friend invests $100k into the business and puts up tiki decorations and Bob gives the money back because he doesn‚Äôt want to embrace change to become successful.

I stopped feeling sorry for Bob because he won‚Äôt ever be successful because he‚Äôs unwilling to embrace change."
He is psychometric,The final episode should be Bob finally getting recognized with a Michelin star. However it closes with him smiling and watching his family from the back with the award tucked away in the background.
He is psychometric,It‚Äôs going to be like ash from Pok√©mon 22 years later
He is psychometric,Bob's a good dad. mine was more like Cotton Hill.
He is psychometric,the beauty is that Bob already has a perfect life. he has everything he needs and is surrounded by people who love him. he has little wins and.. at the end of the day is living a full life
He is psychometric,Everyone is saying it‚Äôs so impossible for Bob to have a win but the article is just suggesting he‚Äôs able to get a little me time
He is psychometric,Bob reminds me so much of my dad. He needs a win too.
He is psychometric,"Bob‚Äôs clueless. The endearing thing is, he *knows* he‚Äôs clueless, but every episode he‚Äôs in there pitching anyway, trying to make things better for his family.

Certainly H. John‚Äôs best drawn character, and I say that as a big Coach McGurk fan."
He is psychometric,"They had a win, remember? They won that blender that one time."
He is psychometric,I read that in Bob/Archers voice. Felt it worked both ways.
He is psychometric,He is a cartoon
He is psychometric,Bandit from Bluey is TVs best dad.
He is psychometric,Bob's Burgers is my comfort show. I can warxh it over and over and over. It's just something about that is semi grounded in reality.
He is psychometric,Bob‚Äôs win is his family
He is psychometric,Oh look it‚Äôs Bobby and Lin and the kids! Lil babies

Search WWW,"I'm a huge fan of the original movies. This show is unwatchable. Terrible terrible writing, insufferable YA character tropes, none of it makes any sense and not in the fun way that the Cage movies were. Got through the first episode and won't continue."
Search WWW,"Yeah, this show is not great. It‚Äôs a Disney Channel cast with Disney Channel writing but with a Disney+ budget and a reputable brand to stand on. They did the same thing with the new Willow show and it‚Äôs YA angle. 

Side note: does it feel like it‚Äôs shot horribly too? It reminds me of old PBS Special camera work at times. Like a slightly higher budget episode of Wishbone lol. Just throw in a terrier sidekick. Who knows, it might help.

Edit: I just watched the puzzle box bus scene and wow. That solution was horrendous and out of thin air. And then ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna turn her into a shoplifter‚Äù and unironically using the word ‚Äústanning.‚Äù

Search WWW,Man I feel like she's not legally in the US. Anyone else get that vague sense? I don't think they said anything about it.
Search WWW,"It‚Äôs kinda hard to believe that she would know the level of information she knows. In the movies, nic cage‚Äôs character had a phd in history and grew up around the stuff. The main character in the show just so happens to figure everything out. That puzzle box solve on the bus shows that issue. She creates a story with no historical basis to solve the box. Then, there are the pandering lines that feel thrown in so companies can call the reboot/sequel/spinoff fresh and modern. 

Interestingly, the writers of national treasure were involved with the project and yet the show feels different from the movies. There should be a feeling of whats next, theories, and a buzz by the community. So far, it feels like we are being told a story after it happens. When all the clues have been solved and the  treasure hunter is regaling their grandchildren of their adventure.

Not entirely unwatchable but not worthy of being called national treasure."

It is very obvious this is a low budget show and will never make it to a season 2."
Search WWW,"I sat through four seasons of The Librarians, so even though I'm not enthused about this new paint-by-numbers YA cast, I'm always game for the globetrotting adventure aspect.

But I still can't ignore stupid things, like the fact that the fake Mulder and Scully FBI agents questioned her and ransacked her house for the letter, yet she was still willing to throw it away. Or the fact that nobody has been able to find Liam, but she was able to track him down instantly on Instagram and he was still living in Baton Rouge. I also hate that they killed off Harvey Keitel's character so quickly, when he was the best part about the first episode.

All cynicism aside, when I heard that slow version of the main theme playing during the Games of Thrones-esque opening sequence, I still got goosebumps. I'll stick with it because it seems like dopey fun.

Edit: >!Jesus Christ, she gave up all of Sadusky's confidential information to the FBI at the beginning of episode 2? So fucking dumb.!<"

Writers... any writers. Please stop with this inane bullshit. Please let people act with some semblance of realistic emotion and decision. Please PLEASE. And any aspiring writers, if you write this in a script, trash it and start over.

She just randomly spins the dial to any old guess, and it unlocks? 2000 years and not once was it pointing North? 2000 years and no one thought to brute force this thing by trying every permutation? Nah. The woke girl on DACA with the diverse set of friends is the key.

Girls strong, men weak. Lecture an MP in a toilet about zeitgeist terminologies

Stopped watching after weak man scene in gift shop. Can't take it anymore.

EDIT: Day after reflection. I think after a few years, once things mellow down a bit, Disney will regret making the script so blatantly forward and 'woke'. It's nothing to do with the characters/settings, but the speeches and script itself. They tried to catch the attention now, compared to some sort of longevity"

Tasha has no clue what he's saying yet takes it upon herself to call him a ""mansplainer"" simply because he's a white male.
That's pretty petty and disgusting in my eyes.
They're destroying what was a fun movie franchise by making it as woke as possible, inserting lines that have no relevance to the plot or scene. Just peppering them in whenever and wherever they can."

I feel no resemblance to the original franchise besides the fact there is symbolism and ‚Äòa treasure to be found‚Äô. Sad. 

I give every show the benefit of 3 episodes before I decide to continue but if the script keeps with this attitude, it‚Äôs just not worth the time.

Search WWW,I'll ssee this series out as long as the rest of the episodes are 30 mins.  The pilot isn't the greatest first impression
Search WWW,The comments are about what I expected.
Search WWW,"Kudos to Disney for trying to embrace the Latinx community (hate the term though, doesn't work in Spanish).  But seriously the movies focused on AMERICAN treasures, and it's still called ""national"" treasure, so having a group of American kids looking for a Mexican treasure kind of feels like colonialism (or at least that's my imho as a Mexican), especially since it¬¥'s still called ""national"" treasure. And the main character might be their ""in"" but she's Mexican only in a legal sense.  She grew up in the US, she's never known Mexico.  She might as Mexican-**American**, she might identify as having Mexican **roots**, but not really Mexican per se.

Then they disrespect the culture by not even bothering to do basic research.  They use lines and dots on the box, which Mayans used as numbers but here two lines don't mean ""10,"" but rather the ground that the bunny was on. Like, that's basic (I actually learned that in a Canadian elementary public school).

Basic research improves the quality of any mystery trying to use ""real"" history.

Other than that... it's fine, it's an okay kids show (and basically anything on Disney+ is for kids anyways).

&#x200B;

The TL;DR version is:

The show's fine but having a series which traditionally focuses on AMERICAN (US) treasures now go after a MEXICAN treasure feels like colonialism to me.

&#x200B;

BTW, the Inca were never part of Mexico so their being part of the legend/relics makes no sense)."
Search WWW,It's weird how many comments display such visceral hatred for the cast simply because they're diverse. We had no issues with the all white cast of the films but somehow this is an major issue

Search WWW,"I have to agree. Had high hopes when I saw it being made. From what I have so far seen, this opportunity has been utterly wasted.

Granted its not been fully told yet, but I feel all the indicators point to ruin. The situations and dialogue are cringe bad, the cast sounds like they're expositioning at each other rather than conversing. 

There's none of the original magic, or feelings of curiosity to history or even historical conspiracy theories (which are fun and give insight to how people thought back then.)

Performances all feel uninspired and robotic. Legacy characters/celebs added to try and prestige away the bad taste just feels cheap, and doesn't work IMO. (Also if your gonna do this, at least give us what we want. I mean of all the things Nick Cage is in.. You couldn't get him for this?)

Finally, while it graphics aren't the point, the CG is 1990 or prior bad. Also cg was used for pointless sh-- like that farm? The wilderness? No one was like ""Guys.. This is Phanto Menace bad.."" But someone heard that and went ""hold my beer."""

Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"Great show, very clever and good acting.  I like how the show lets the viewer share the ‚Äúsuper power‚Äù of the main character."
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"I want to watch, but not enough to add another streaming service"
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"If this was on Netflix it'd be streaming #1 right now. This show was a pleasant surprise. It took me 2 episodes to realize it's not a murder mystery, the mystery lies in how she catches them. It's a fresh take in the genre for sure.

EDIT: Yes....I know it is very similar to Columbo. I knew that before I wrote the comment. When I say ""fresh"", I mean relative to the other ""murder mystery"" options out there today."
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"Yeah I am enjoying the show. I'm a big fan of Columbo so I'm excited to see that kind of narrative style brought back, titles are also really retro. Very clever and fun framework for having cool guest stars every episode, looking forward to the weekly installments."
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"Been on a bit of a Russian Doll binge recently, late to the party I know but it‚Äôs created a new appreciation for Natasha Leonne, she‚Äôs bloody brilliant. Look forward to watching this."
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"Love the show, in my eyes Natasha Lyonne is the Tom Cruise of television, she plays herself in everything, I don‚Äôt mean that in a bad way, I find her totally intriguing and entertaining. I hope I never tire of her.

Soundtrack is good too, the gentle understated banjo just seems to fit nicely."
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"His comparison of shows like this one and ""Columbo"" to sitcoms was spot on. The mystery hooks us, but we keep coming back to spend more time with the characters. Every episode I watch the opening murder scenes with interest, but I'm really just anxious for my buddy Charlie Cale to show up and solve the crime while charming the pants off everyone she meets."
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,It‚Äôs a great show.  The entire family loves it.  It‚Äôs like a throwback but with a prestige format.
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,I‚Äôm happy for Peacock that they have original programming to go with The Office and Yellowstone. I‚Äôm in the minority but I think Comcast/NBC/Peacock and Paramount/CBS will still be around in 20 years. I‚Äôve read three blind mice and they are no strangers to evolving landscapes as they have survived cable and HBO/Showtime.
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"Peacock is on a roll. First Paul T Goldman, now this."
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"I like the show, but her ""power"" makes it a bit easy for her to find the murderer each time. 

1. Wait for a murder
2. Talk to some people about the murder
3. When you hear they are lying, ask more questions until you guess how they do it.

They've not had many instances where she finds a liar who **isn't** the murderer."
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,I love it. But I literally love everything Rian Johnson does. But watching Poker Face (which i love) I couldnt help but think that its extremely well crafted. It's very meticulous and even though the bad people get caught what they do is extremely smart and clever. I wonder if Rian Johnson is trying to do a perfect murder in real life.
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,I see people talking about it constantly. Probably Peacock‚Äôs biggest original series.
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"I liked the show so far, but my only issue is with how unbelievably coincidental all the events have been relative to the star's timing (when the star showed up in the lives of each episode's guests)."
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"100%, I just watched the 4 episodes yesterday and yea every episode was pretty great."
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,The first episode was okay. It's there to set up the series. I liked the 2nd and 3rd episodes much better. They're great.
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"I think the show is good, but the fact that the main character has basically superpowers (she just knows when someone is lying) feels very gimmicky and cheap."
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"I've enjoyed it so far. The metal band episode was good but the music they played... I'm not a metal gatekeeper or anything but I don't understand how there was nobody at all anywhere near the set who found it in them to explain that what they were singing wasn't metal by any stretch of the term.

Not a dealbreaker because the story itself was cute the same way of Poker Face has been so far (that is, cute in a macabre sort of way) but it's one of those things."
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,Gonna start it once I catch up with Mayor of Kingstown s2
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"For anyone who has Xfinity in the US: Check your bill, I have been getting Peacock for free on my plan for a while and literally only just noticed the other day."
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,I‚Äôm officially in love with Natasha Lyonne now!
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"The show started to fall off after episode 3 for me. Really wanted to like it, but the writing was starting to go down."
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"WARNING SPOILER BELOW

Pretty sure Charlie is actual Death or
Something similar that will be revealed at the end of the season.  Despite avenging all these peoples deaths, her direct interaction and recommendation is what causes them to be killed in the first place.  Her friend in the first episode with the child pornography, black web stuff,  the guy going vegan in the third episode because she want him those movies to watch etc. etc.   

Really good show"
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,Is it just an old-school mystery show or are their any Johnson ‚Äògimmicks‚Äô or subversions? I love the Knives Out for his twists.
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"I'm enjoying it, though I'm only 2 episodes in. It really is a hybrid of Columbo and The Rockford Files. 

I got a paid Peacock sub just to watch this show and it's astonishing that Peacock still has such a pathetic library relative to its competitors. I will say it was neat to be able to watch 24 Hours of Daytona, and if I were a bigger wrestling fan this would be neat but aside from Poker Face it looks like they're still the ""What, you don't like The Office anymore?"" streamer. 

If this were on literally any other service barring maybe Starz it would indeed be bigger."
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"Doesn't even have a UK release yet, I'm not sure about other international territories. Why delay a streaming only show? Who benefits?"
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"Great show, I am obsessed with Natasha‚Äôs gravelly voice. Can‚Äôt wait for the next episode to be released."
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"It reminds me of a blue skies era USA show. I miss those, so I'm loving it so far. I also find it amusing how she's trying to get out of there before the cops show up but also set it up so there is available evidence and so on for the person to not get out of trouble.

My only wish is that, like all of these shows, that they would take on other types of crime than murder. If I were her and people were dropping like flies everywhere I went, I'd start to think I was a death omen of some sort. Taking down the gambler running his own games was a fun plot in the pilot but that got put aside for the central murder mystery.

Also, the _Sucker Punch_ song has been stuck in my head for days since watching episode 4."
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"I‚Äôm only on the 2nd episode and I really love how effortlessly diverse the cast is. Anyway really enjoying it so far‚Ä¶I‚Äôm only watching on Peacock because a family member with Xfinity let‚Äôs me use their login, I‚Äôm the only one that uses it."
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,I'm loving this modern female fucked up version of Columbo.
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"I hate Peacock, they need to die snd just put thier shit on Paramount."
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"hard agree

if it was on Netflix or HBO, this sub would be melting over it.

it's also unlucky that TLOU is also on at the same time."
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"Don't get me wrong, I really liked it, but it started getting repetitive after the 3rd episode."
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,Enjoying the show but find it a bit too convenient that a human lie detector just happens to have random acquaintances murdered on a weekly basis. Some suspension of disbelief required.
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,I‚Äôm paying 99 cents a month for a year‚Äôs subscription to Peacock. I had no idea Poker Face would be on it and am so glad I got this great deal. I love this show.
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"Oh! Thanks for the reminder that it dropped! Love Natasha and honestly, I enjoy Peacock. I'm a Bravo watcher (love Below Deck) and love that I can watch on there and not worry about recording.  The Peacock Exclusive Below Deck Down Under was so good, they put it on the network later.  

You all should be binge watching The Traitor as well!  Delicious show!  Interesting mix of people... some ""contest reality"" with Survivor,  Big Brother, etc alums;  then Bravolebrities (Below Deck, Housewives, Shahs); an Olympic athlete (they almost have be liking Ryan Lochte), and then average never been on TV people!

Plus Alan Cumming.  It is why I couldn't resist."
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"I've been meaning to watch this, been too busy but I should be getting to it soon.  Thanks for reminding me."
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"I don't think I'll be watching the rest.

It's procedural and very predictable already. I don‚Äôt mind procedurals but it feels a bit copy and paste.

Story happens, someone or a group of peuple kill a person.

Then we find out she has some kind of link to that person and finds something quickly that makes her think it's fishy. Her ""magic"" lie detector superpower already feels like a crutch."
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,Trailer had me thinking that it would be a different type of show
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"So the first episode has the human lie detector watching hidden cameras of the players faces to then tell the player who is bluffing.      

Over just watching the cameras of the cards they are holding?"
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,It's just a murder she wrote rip-off for genz
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,Should've been on Netflix like Russian Doll. üò°
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,Is peacock going to get absorbed by Hulu or something anytime soon?
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,Why is anything that Rian Johnson involved in relentlessly promoted on reddit? It's annoying.
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,Can‚Äôt stand Natasha Lyonne
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,Liked first two episodes then they started with the politics and ruined it.
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,I‚Äôll never watch this. If he ruined Star Wars then I‚Äôll do my best to ruin his show and future movies
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"i just like to know if my prediction so far is true. 

how many white bad men have been the murderer?

and if was not a bad white man, but someone else, then i expect at least that a white man was the problem, like he raped someone or exploited people for monetary gains, therefor the killing was justified in the viewers mind.

so how far did i do i have not watched any episode yet."
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,It's so good!
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,Rest in Metal
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,I haven‚Äôt gotten a chance to watch this yet. Been catching up on other stuff. I am hoping to get to it this week at some point. If I time it right there will be a 5th episode to enjoy once I start it.
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"I‚Äôll watch anything Natasha Lyonne is in, she‚Äôs such a creative force (don‚Äôt know how she didn‚Äôt get a Emmy writing nod for s2 of Russian Doll)."
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"Fantastic show, wish I could recommend it to friends but its not even available in Brazil yet (we dont have peacock here). Ahoy I guess"
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,I tried watching it but I have always hated Adrien Brody's voice. It always sounds like a New York wise guy from an older era. And it was getting in the way of me enjoying this series. Is he in every episode a lot?
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,is Peacock even available outside of the US? It'S not available in the Nordics. Would never know about the shows existence if not for...the internet
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"Yeah, sorry, Peacock, you were late to the game. I don't have any money left for another streaming service."
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,Episode Five is my favorite so far. Does anyone know how if can find out the playlist from that episode? Loved the music too.
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"Poker Face is crap. It claims to be Columbo, then they have this human lie detector who doesn't have to discover the contradictions and lies in a story on her own, just deux ex machina.

Fun to watch, but only because I am a pinhead with no self-respect."
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,We watched the first episode. Wont be watching another one. What rubbish. More implausible crap from the writers. Could someone please write something that's believable?
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"Amazing show but it's a bit out of step with modern taste I feel. Major Columbo vibes!  
Peacock is probably the bet streaming service at the moment. I cancelled Netflix and hopped to peacock."
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,wtf is [peacock](https://linktr.ee/quackpoker)
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"I just love shows that are stand alone episodes. I just do not have it in me to invest so much time in a series that I need to follow/remember. 
And I like the throw back to the Columbo style where it‚Äôs not a full out mystery."
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"Honestly, I love Natasha but I hate her character maybe because I hate snitches and people that go out of their way to snitch or get people arrested. Even though it‚Äôs done with good intentions I can‚Äôt bring myself to like it."
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"I love this show! It‚Äôs kinda predictable at times, but I‚Äôm pretty good at figuring things out in movies/tv shows so I can deal with that. It‚Äôs very much worth the watch."
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,Did anyone work BTS on this show? As a a PA?
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"> very clever 

i really like the show, but if you want 'clever' or twists this isn't really the show for you. i know they show the murder at the beginning so it's not really much of a mystery but even the way she solves stuff usually involves a ton of luck and a ton of coincidences. once you realise it's that kind of show it's a fun ride, but if you are expecting holmes like observation and deduction skills, this show is not for you."
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"There are several good shows on Peacock. If you aren't into the high seas, you could get something out of a month long sub for sure: the resort, killing it, girls 5 Eva, Rutherford falls, Vigil, bust down, wolf like me-- to name those I've seen.

I don't watch psych, but the new psych stuff is on there. One year of premium is $30."
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"I'd check it out, but there is not even a legal way to watch this in Germany right now."
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"You can watch the first episode for free without subbing, that's at least an option if you care to see it."
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"Yep, same boat. I have enough other stuff I still want to watch on the services I already subscribe to that I can't justify adding another one, even though I really want to check out Poker Face. 

I might consider adding Peacock for a month or two next time I unsubscribe from something else, but at this point it's really getting tough to justify so many subscriptions, even though most of them have at least one or two shows that I'm really interested in."
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"I get peacock for free, but I'd rather pirate a peacock show than open their buggy/slow and ad-filled app."
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"Not sure about ""fresh"" as it's very similar to Columbo, a series from the 70's and 80's.

It has a similar formula, where we see the murder first. Then Columbo arrives on the scene and figures out not only the murder but the motive behind it.

Peter Falk was such a delight in it, too. No super powers, he just acted folksy and scatterbrained in order for people to underestimate him (which they always did). It was a LOT of fun."
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,It's a two-Fer on the mystery. Who is going to die and how? How is she going to solve the murder? I think it makes it more fun than a simple murder mystery.
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,For sure. It‚Äôs unfortunate that a lot of people can‚Äôt watch it because Peacock is not available in a lot of countries.
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,[deleted]
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,Just like Knives Out. Such a nice journey to watch.
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,Could you say it‚Ä¶.. subverted your expectations?
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"I bet Natasha Lyonne could do a great impression of Peter Falk, too. She's so perfect for this role."
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,IMO Russian Doll drops a little bit in S2 but this seem a more 'fresh' character
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,Always sound's like she just got done with 3 packs of cigarettes
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"She's definitely got a distinct thing. For some reason though, she's one of the only actors I can think of where I'm totally on board about it. I think with someone like Cruise it feels too blatantly like a focus grouped and stage managed persona, whereas with Lyonne it feels like she probably is closer to that person than not."
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"She is the reason I cannot watch this show. I cannot stand the character she plays on everything. It is bad enough when she is just a side character. Her as the show lead, no thanks."
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,Well paramount just merged with Showtime so they increased their chances of success tenfold.
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"The neat part is, just like with ""Columbo"", there's knowing and then there's proving. So the thrill is seeing how she gets the culprit to slip up. But I agree it would be cool to see her superpower take her in the wrong direction once because someone was lying for an unrelated reason."
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,Watch in a few years when we discover Rian Johnson is actually a genius serial killer that just simply managed to get away with everything and just spell his murders in movies/TV shows. /s
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"But that‚Äôs the fun of it, right? It‚Äôs like how Angela Lansbury‚Äôs character in ‚ÄúMurder She Wrote‚Äù came across all those deaths coincidentally, even though she lives in a tiny fishing village in Maine."
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"Agreed! Think my favorite so far is episode 2. Although I really liked ep 4 with the heavy metal band. They‚Äôre all well done, tough to pick a favorite"
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,Their old hit and their new hit didn't even sound like the same genre lol.
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"It bugged me when the song was first played because I was like ""this sounds like the Friends theme why is a metal band excited about the Friends theme?"".  So I was glad for the payoff at the end of the episode."
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,Episode 5 is even better!
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,Episode 4 was awesome. You might wanna give it another chance
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"It's sort of a mixture of the Knives Out formula and your basic Columbo episode. You see the murder happen just like on Columbo, but then there's a short Knives Out-style flashback to show us that Lyonne's character actually just showed up recently and already knew at least one of the involved parties."
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"Natasha has a tell when someone is lying she fells something is off so you even see people she knows indirectly not replying, asking questions instead of a reply etc"
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"A few shows I'd recommend on Peacock: The Capture, Vigil, We Are Lady Parts, Everything I Know About Love, Trigger Point, and Killing It. All but Killing it are British imports. All very good in their own ways."
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"Same as some Hulu and FX stuff not going up on Disney plus straight away, end up forgetting about some of the shows and when they do get added they don‚Äôt even get a banner"
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,Bro literally just google ‚Äúwatch poker face online free‚Äù and click any link. I watched all the episodes this week in 1080p.
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,It‚Äôs great. I love knives out and glass onion so I‚Äôll watch anything Rian Johnson releases. Hope you enjoy!
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,The guy they were trying to cheat was sitting with his back to the window and poker players typically cup or hide their cards only taking peeks so it would be hard to see what the cards were on cameras.
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,Hulu gonna get absorbed by Disney+
Monz√≥n: A Knockout Blow,"Because it's a good show? Also I searched for other discussions in this subreddit and only trailers came up. sooo yeah, go be mad about something else."
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,"The plan: To drive up HBO and HBO max subscriptions, I'll release a new six episode series on the channel."
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,"Nathan is a damn genius! It is hard to imagine him topping Nathan For You, but I can't wait to see what happens in this new show"
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,"Trying to keep my hype in check. Surely there is no way that this is more hilarious than NFY, NFY is one of the best pieces of media ever produced."
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,Best way to fast forward to Friday?
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,"This is the show I am most excited for this summer and there's a lot of competition.



 Watching some Nathan for You in advance and it's as clever and funny as ever.  
""I told him about tag team bro""."
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,"I don't know how people are still sleeping on this guy, he is brilliant... Cannot wait for this."
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,"Wow--he seems to be getting a lot of praise for this one. I'm excited. Even though Nathan for You made me physically cringe every ten minutes, it also had some of the highest highs in comedy. It's a show I almost had to force myself to watch, and by the end of each episode would be crying laughing"
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,Is this the show the Safdie brothers were involved with Fielder?
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,Will this show be released all at once or weekly?
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,This season was just his rehearsal

Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,"Anyone else and this would be a joke, but I could absolutely see a big reveal in episode 6 that everything so far was a staged rehearsal of how he actually wants the show to go."
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,I‚Äôm so late that I just started watching from season 1 two weeks ago and now can‚Äôt stop raving about it to anyone who will listen like I just discovered a new element.
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,"Everything about it just lined up.  You have the hilarious premise, but then you have things like Dumb Starbucks taking off and the Bill Gates impersonator not actually being who he said he was that took episodes in a whole new direction and completely changed the tone of the show in absolutely hilarious ways.

Edit: and how can we forget about the guy that randomly volunteered that he drinks his grandsons pee?"
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,"lmao I heard that in his voice, thanks for that."
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,Fistfuls? I still want to wake up Friday. Maybe if I make finy fists.
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,WHAT ahahahaha
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,"One of the best parts, can‚Äôt believe he found those two"
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,The last episode revolving around him pitching to HBO
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,You should also watch How To With Jon Wilson. Nathan is a producer on that.
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,"> Edit: and how can we forget about the guy that randomly volunteered that he drinks his grandsons pee?

This is the part that sold me on the show. It just came so far out of left field and was so absolutely absurd that even Nathan was taken aback."
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,what episode was the elvis impersonator?
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,"Yes! I‚Äôve watched that since season 1 and have been suggesting that, too. That‚Äôs what lead me to finally give Nathan For You a chance since I knew he was a producer. I needed a John Wilson fix and figured NFY might scratch that itch as I await season 3 off John Wilson."
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,You can tell that he totally broke character in that moment because it was so unbelievable.  He came up with an utterly ridiculous idea so that nobody would do it and then this shop owner just casually talks about drinking children‚Äôs pee when he‚Äôs afraid.  It‚Äôs so batshit insane.
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,"I‚Äôm dumb, I said Elvis and I meant Bill Gates."
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,"So, I guess their goal today was to take everyone who said D+ had no original content besides The Mandalorian, and pretty much punch them in the face repeatedly."
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,Hooch is crazy

Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,I thought this was wallstreebets DD for a second lol
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,"Nothing on any of the ""old"" Netflix series has me sad...  Nice write up, though."
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,/u/arashtp you missed Percy Jackson.
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,Super stoked on most of this. I‚Äôm especially looking forward to the Nat geo content. Can you imagine if Disney+ dropped with half of these titles? Game changer
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,"Based on the release timelines of those shows, it looks like their strategy is: 

Zeitgeist show for 6 weeks -> 1 week of cool down ‚Äî> couple weeks of hype up -> next Zeitgeist show -> Repeat"
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,They're really going all out with the High Republic.
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,did She Hulk get a trailer or anything?
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,that's a lot of content
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,"So strange to realize Ice Age is owned by Disney now. 

Also I‚Äôm sort of unexpectedly excited about the continuation of Mighty Ducks!"
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,A Turner and Hooch reboot yyyeeeeessss!!! I've been a fan (we call ourselves Hoochers) for years and am flipping out right now!!!!
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,Missing rogue squadron on Star Wars
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,Hocus Pocus 2. What.
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,"A lot of this is awesome, but can I just take a moment to appreciate *Sister Act 3*?"
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,">Tiana is the first princess to have her own Walt Disney Animation Studios series

Just going to ignore the Little Mermaid and Tangled series apparently."
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,[deleted]
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,I have only read a hand full of moon knight comics but from what I have heard and read making a PG moon knight show is not going to go over well with fans.
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,Any specific dates to go with this?
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,You forgot the multiple tongue in cheek references to Matt Murdock.  Charlie Cox's Daredevil is officially part of the MCU now.  Hes apparently in She Hulk and Spider-Man 3.
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,"Damn, the Ducks end up becoming what they rebelled against..."
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,"As a bi dude I'm still waiting for literally anything big that features a non-straight dude. In film they ignored it almost completely out of fear of gay-hating countries banning it and them losing money (like China). 

Really hoping for something to come through, maybe with x-men back in the fold Iceman could get something"
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,So is Ahsoka taking the place of the Rebels spinoff? Because thats what I was most excited for
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,Disney is milking Star Wars and Marvel for everything dollar they can squeeze. There are way too many reboots and remakes. They need originally sourced content that has no reliance on existing IP. How about some original NON-Marvel/Star Wars scripted content? I think the Mandalorian is a cute show but I want to see ORIGINAL content for once. This slate of shows are not enough to keep all of their subscribers satisfied.
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,I just want to have the spin off Thrawn and Ezra travels in space show.
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,"Hey, bozo, why didn't you mention It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia?

Great list, otherwise."
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,so much content that post alone made me vomit .
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,Seems like Star Wars's future is on TV.
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,Is it weird that I'm most excited for the Josh Peck version of Turner and Hooch?
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,"Looks like they're updating Microcosmos with A Real Bug's Life, that should be cool as fuck."
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,">The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers

>Lauren Graham (Gilmore Girls, Parenthood) and Emilio Estevez (reprising his role from the original feature films) star in the next chapter of the hit Mighty Ducks franchise, premiering in early 2021. In present day Minnesota, the Mighty Ducks have evolved from scrappy underdogs to an ultra-competitive, powerhouse youth hockey team. After 12-year-old Evan is unceremoniously cut from the Ducks, he and his mom Alex set out to build their own ragtag team of misfits to challenge the cutthroat, win-at-all-costs culture of competitive youth sports.

I hope Disney has been paying attn to Cobra Kai and takes all the good from it and applies it to the Ducks!!!"
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,"Man, Tony Stark cannot keep control of his tech, can he? Well, I guess he's dead, so that makes sense."
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,The one thing I want from Marvel is an OG Nick Fury and the Howling Commandos show.
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,They forgot Shadow Hunters.
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,Disney+ launch was more like beta test to ensure their decision of allocating such resources to the platform
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,"The criticism was regarding lack of original screenplays, too. It's still true in that aspect."
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,"It's still lacks diversity, it's still marvel, star wars and Pixar animated pg-13 movies, still no new new IPs."
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,[deleted]
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,"If they don't have Phill Lewis playing the dog using mocap, they dun goofed."
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,*holds up lighter*
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,Thanks man you're awesome
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,[Rogue squadron](https://youtu.be/5bLkTjn6Y_s)
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,Not enough üöÄüöÄüöÄ
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,"Just hints at Daredevil, from Sony in Spider-Man 3 and at the reveal here today for She-Hulk."
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,"Yeah sounds like the Multiverse in SM3 will pull in Daredevil and Kingpin. Which could be great.

Daredevil was hinted at strongly for SheHulk, and there have been rumors that DNofrio has campaigned hard and they‚Äôve taken him seriously as maybe using his character to put together the Sinister Six."
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,"There's a big hint in Hawkeye. Maya Lopez is a definitively Daredevil character (Echo, a deaf woman who can see something once and imitate it originally hired by Kingpin to take out Daredevil and eventually befriending him). She also wore the Ronin outfit for awhile that Hawkeye wore in Endgame after his family vanished (New Avengers comics).

Edit: why am I being downvoted for this?"
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,And Swiss Family Robinson.
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,It‚Äôs pretty genius
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,Super into the Acolyte as I‚Äôd really like to see what the Sith/dark side users were up to during this time period
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,"No, but they confirmed Tatiana Maslany."
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,Tim Roth will be back as Abomination and Mark Ruffalo.
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,Its a rather deceptive line if your not in the know.  WDAS is the movie studio. Disney Television Animation is the studio that typically handles the TV side (they were the ones that made the Tangled series).
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,That's not necessarily a bad thing tbh. It's how they execute it that matters. GOTG was kinda considered a bottom of the barrel IP for marvel before they made it and it turned out well.
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,"There‚Äôs like 70 announced shows here and less than 10 are actual original ideas. Really disappointing *in my opinion*.

I get people like Star Wars and stuff, but it seems extreme to me."
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,"I think it could be done. For me at least the fun part is the mind-bendy unreliable narrator stuff and not the graphic violence. Although there is something to be said for when other characters meet Moon Knight and are like, ""oh this guy is *crazy* crazy and not just *Batman* crazy."""
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,"This didn‚Äôt mention any of the Marvel movies since it‚Äôs still not certain whether they‚Äôll be released in theaters first or on Disney+ at the same time, but The Eternals is set to have their first openly gay main character whenever that‚Äôs released.

If you haven‚Äôt watched the Disney+ short film Out, you absolutely should."
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,"Young Avengers is just over the horizon, and that comes with the most prominent gay couple in marvel. Still a few years out though."
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,Not sure if it is 100% confirmed but I remember seeing somewhere that Valkyrie is looking for a wife in the next Thor movie.
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,"As a fellow homo, I'm sorry you're getting downvoted, but that's r/television for you. I've learned not to bring up representation issues on this sub anymore."
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,"I would bet it will be in a team, or they will reveal the character is gay in a sequel...that way people in China will already be invested.  Because you‚Äôre right....they want that China money badly. 


Wouldn‚Äôt it be a kick in the nuts to China if the wait until like Shang Chi 3 and reveal he was gay the whole time! Lmao. That could literally start a war!!"
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,"I feel like this'll be a big part of the Ashoka show, considering that she was still searching when we see her in The Mandolorian."
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,Thats not on Disney+ you 1 star fool.
Drug Squad: Costa del Sol,That‚Äôs pathetic
Love Destiny,What was the Disney Deal?
Love Destiny,The porn has the same name as the Judd Apatow rom-com. Cue hilarious misunderstanding. 
Love Destiny,"Disney made a deal with Netflix way back in the ancient days of 2012 that they would be the sole subscription vod service for Disney/Marvel/Pixar movie content in 2016. Previously Disney had deals with Starz and some others. Details are/were scarce other than that.

In the 4 years since the deal, while neither side has commented on it, there has been a growing confusion if it was a good deal for either side and if it would actually go forward.

Not seeing any Disney content in Jan and now Feb means there potentially could be some snags with regards to the contract. In addition, Starz was able to secure the rights to Star Wars ep VII over Netflix.

I suspect Disney ain't happy with the deal they signed 4 years ago for what was at the time a fat sum (at least $300M), but now looks like a win for Netflix and not Disney. Just opinion on that part

Interesting times."
Love Destiny,"To clarify - it has long been conjectured that TFA would fall under the old deal with Starz. Hence, they did not secure the rights as much as point out that they were owed them all along with everything else Disney released in 2015 (Starz was granted the rights to broadcast every new film from Disney 8 months after theatrical release). 

The downside for this is that Netflix will also have to wait until probably next year to show ***Age of Ultron, Inside Out, Ant Man, The Good Dinosaur*** and every other Disney film.

Also, it was widely reported that the deal would go into effect in February 2016 and most assumed that Netflix would make a huge marketing blitz proclaiming all the Marvel, Pixar & Lucasfilm movies coming.

IMHO what's probably going on is that Netflix or Disney is still negotiating with Fox for the rights to stream the first 6 ***Star Wars Ep I - IV*** whose rights remain with Fox until 2020. Except for ***A New Hope***, whose right will FOREVER remain with Fox. To further complicate this negotiation, is that many believe that Disney will possibly make a bid to buy the rights from Fox outright for Ep IV and arriving at a purchase price is what's holding it up. Until then, Disney cannot issue a ""complete collection"" package once the new trilogy is completed in 2019 (and they clearly will want to have that ready for Christmas of that year). 

Additionally, Disney might have asked Netflix to hold off on a Marvel blitz until April in order to build the hype for ***Civil War***. "
Love Destiny,"> I suspect Disney ain't happy with the deal they signed 4 years ago for what was at the time a fat sum (at least $300M), but now looks like a win for Netflix and not Disney. Just opinion on that part

That would be tempered by how successful the first two Marvel series for Netflix have been, plus however much they are making from that deal which is separate. While Disney might be having seller's remorse (had they waited until last summer, obviously they could have easily gotten twice that from Amazon or Hulu), they've also had that money for 3 years and the interest alone could have paid for half of TFA's budget...."
Love Destiny,"Yeah totally understood, I think its an interesting situation, give it an 8% discount rate for time value of money, but even then we don't know the specific payment schedule with them and Netflix.  I think Disney's remorse are that they could have done way better elsewhere, as you said, and that they could have likely gone into the process of launching their own types of services as well for Disney content, which is now a bit out of the question for a while.

Disney was always one of the most progressively technological companies, them joining with Netflix (especially with kids content parents will sub to) seems like a strong fit, but I think Disney may be feeding an enemy, they are growing the pie for sure, but I don't know if it will be the right long-term choice.

I'd love to be sitting in the war room over there in the Disney movie strategy department..."
Love Destiny,">  Disney may be feeding an enemy, they are growing the pie for sure, but I don't know if it will be the right long-term choice.

More like the opposite: Disney is letting Netflix develop streaming only content that one day will revert back to them once Netflix finishes it's transition to being the HBO of streaming. 

Because that's the **on the record** goal of Netflix. Reed Hastings himself has said, ""We want to become HBO faster than HBO can become us.""

Netflix opened a Pandora's Box when it started the streaming ""land rush"" and knew it could never remain what it started out as (ie, offering so much acquired content, especially film). At this point it's inevitable that more content will be shifted to platforms that the producer has a stake in, especially TV.

Worse for Netflix, as the film deals with HBO, Showtime, Encore, Epix and Starz expire, the streaming rights will become become a sticking point. Don't be surprised if HBO loses one of it's bigger sources like Fox or Universal because they make a better deal with one of the others or Hulu/Amazon. 

Hence, Netflix is simply a farm team for Disney right now and the inevitable Disney streaming service will debut in 5 years (with an assist from ESPN, which would be a deadly combo). "
Love Destiny,"Very interesting times in the industry, I had said in a previous content, I think we will see a bit of cyclical business cycles here with content and ownership vs distributors.

Oh yes, Netflix wants to be HBO, even HBO discusses it (HBO has said they think there is room for both HBO and Netflix).  Their rush certainly got them TONs of cheap deals early, and that sweetheart packages will never return.

Yeah I'm also scared HBO will lose a big player, but HBO, like Netflix as much as we want to talk about it, is really in the TV content business, not movies, its unpopular to discuss since they are movie services, but thats what the (current) public is demanding.

I actually think in this context of farm team is GREAT! outstanding point. With the ESPN side they also have SlingTV (and other Disney stuff there too), which may act in the same manner."
Love Destiny,Travelers was seriously amazing. It‚Äôs one of those rare shows that makes the sci-fi storyline not feel completely out of hand. Watching the travelers adapt to the lives of their hosts was really good too. Just all around a great watch.
Love Destiny,"Count me in. I watched the first episode, but got sidetracked by other programming. I‚Äôll give it another shot. Thank you for putting this back on my radar."
Love Destiny,"It was talked about a lot when it moved fully to Netflix, then after S3 came out, the conversation died."
Love Destiny,Eric McKormack knocked it out of the park with this role.
Love Destiny,"Absolutely brilliant show. Ridiculously high concept, but kept really grounded with wonderfully human characters. I LOVED how Trevor was the kind old man in the body of this hotshot teenager. Plus it did what good time travel fiction does in that it established its own rules early on and followed them throughout."
Love Destiny,Trevor is an all time great character.
Love Destiny,I blame the art they use of the guys in hazmat suits messing with a big Ethernet cable
Love Destiny,"Yeah it was really good, my wife and I watched it a few years back.

I thought the way they did the ending (no spoilers) on the bus was pretty genius too."
Love Destiny,Amazing show. Some really good characters and actors that portrayed them.
Love Destiny,"Loved the first season, second season was great as well, still not sure how I feel about the third season. Not happy with what happened to David and even though I liked the ‚Äòreset‚Äô ending it‚Äôs still feels like they failed (well, they did fail) so it ended on a sour note"
Love Destiny,"Loved it with only a single complaint: The bitchy wife trope. He comes home from LITERALLY defusing a nuke and saving the world, and they write his wife giving him shit for missing a party.

That's such a tired cliche and kind of felt out of place."
Love Destiny,"It‚Äôs been so long I think I watched the first two seasons and I really enjoyed it, one of the best time travel shows, but for some reason I never started season 3."
Love Destiny,"This show got some buz a year or so ago which is how I learned of it. I loved it, I didnt hate any of the main characters."
Love Destiny,The Destiny references are awesome.
Love Destiny,I got into the show after season three released but just before it was cancelled. With a few episodes to go I was super bummed at the cancellation. Even if the ending rounds itself off nicely as a complete story the premise lends itself to so meany more stories and characters. If Brad Wright were to find a home for a reboot or continuation it would be a Day 1 watch for me.
Love Destiny,My wife and I to this day still cry while eating bacon.
Love Destiny,I'm just into Season 2 and I love the characters development. it feels like an solid old school television writing that takes time to breath with character relationships. The way the show peels back on its world building and plays with its established rules respectfully and from every angle and compounds marvelously. I miss this time of television
Love Destiny,"10/10 show.  

Best two shows ever are Travellers and The Expanse.  Both are brilliant, well thought out, and grounded in reality.

I fucking love it when Trevor and Kyle have a burger for the first time.

Or when Trevor turns down a girl his age cause he is too old for her.

So many little things"
Love Destiny,"The first seven episodes were excellent, then it limped along for the rest of S1.

S2 was carried by the really cool characters.  Well mostly carried. 

S3 was just a bore."
Love Destiny,"I loved the scene where they send a huge group of soldiers back in time, into a doomsday cult of senior citizens who were minutes away from mass suicide.  Young folks, now in an old body, nothing but bitching, my back, my bladder, my hip, etc.  But when its go time, grandma turns into freaking Rambo and its unintentionally funny."
Love Destiny,"> I seriously don't understand why this show is so obscure 

When it was good, it was very good; but when it was bad, it was very bad indeed.

Thoughts:

1) Great premise. Erik McCormack is great in his role.

2) >!The longer the show goes on, the less concerned it is with humanity as evinced by the collapse of the ratio of traveler to non-traveler characters (which follows Supernatural's human:demon:angel rule).!<

3) >!The social worker/boyfriend should have been fired and put in jail.!<

4) >!There are significant discrepancies between the travelers' ability to fit in the present and their descriptions of the bad future.!<

5) The show's insistence that the traveler's work to save their future is as important as their relationship bullshit *almost* makes the show not worth watching."
Love Destiny,OK you convinced me but is there an ending? Hate to start something and then it's cancelled without closure.
Love Destiny,Man I loved it and wanted so much more.
Love Destiny,It had a great concept and low budget. Surprised Netflix didn‚Äôt milk it.
Love Destiny,I watched a lot of this then forgot about it. Thanks for putting it back in my memory.
Love Destiny,Just finished a rewatch. Great show.
Love Destiny,Sold! Add to the watchlist
Love Destiny,There had been talk about a reboot.
Love Destiny,Especially great if you like Stargate as a co-creator(Brad Wright) is the creator of this and there are a ton of familiar faces
Love Destiny,Great show! The ending made me sad though
Love Destiny,I love this show. It is so well written.
Love Destiny,"I would love to talk about it more but only occasionally do people 'get it' and I'm like PLEASE WATCH THIS SHOW omg.

I wish there were more."
Love Destiny,"I had this idea about how they ended it.

!Because we see that there is a version 2 at the end! I thought it would be cool if a Dr. Who approach was taken. Three more seasons with the same travelers, but with different hosts. So they have to complete a mission while also adapting to the lifestyle of their new host bodies.

I could see fans discussing which version they preferred better similar to go they discuss which Doctor they prefer."
Love Destiny,"Just adding a comment & a like so more people can give the show a spin that might have missed it; good 3 season arc with an (attempted) finale. Great sci fi, good cast, good production value. 

Well worth the time."
Love Destiny,OP you should watch the 12 Monkeys TV show if you haven't
Love Destiny,"I enjoyed the first few episodes but I started to lose interest towards the end of season two. They took their time explaining the future and the reveal was not especially interesting. 

I am not exactly sure what happened at the ending. The team failed their mission so they choose to go back to reset and start their mission over? Maybe someone can explain it to me."
Love Destiny,"Enjoyed the show. Personally don't agree with the sentiment that it got a good ending or conclusion. Post this every time this show comes up but to me, it was like if Fringe had been cancelled after S3. You could kind of accept the ending of that season as a series finale but it would have felt super abrupt and unsatisfying overall.

Obviously isn't the writers fault that the show got no attention and cancelled. Just sucks because I think the writers would have nailed the second mission and a real ending had they gotten a chance."
Love Destiny,I'm glad OP enjoyed it.  I found the CW-ness of it off-putting and gave up after 2 or 3 episodes.  It doesn't surprise me that folks don't talk about it.
Love Destiny,I couldn't stand it. Why would time travelers jump into bodies of people whose lives were complete shitshows? It got so sidetracked dealing with their BS.
Love Destiny,"I loved it,  until they tried to cram 2 seasons into the last six episodes.  It's kinda hard to recommend it when I know the person is also going to experience that desperation to get all the plot out because they find out too late it was canceled."
Love Destiny,"Ehh, S3 was seriously shit for most of it.  Especially since Season 2 was actually pretty good."
Love Destiny,A lot of cliche bs. Like the Traveler and her boyfriend issues. Nope nextttt.
Love Destiny,I was pissed when Netflix canceled it & The OA & Altered Carbon & countless other shows
Love Destiny,Netflix is a platform to kill a show
Love Destiny,"I don't know what you people are smoking, but this show is incredibly bad on so many levels it's not even a joke. So many inconsistencies, some episodes end on a cliffhangers that are set up like it is really important and then the next episode either they completely ignore it and sweep it under the rug or they mention something in passing like it isn't a big deal.   
The idea is good but the execution is horrible. The only positive thing I can say about the show is the acting and that the characters can be interesting, but they are completely wasted because of atrocious plot writing."
Love Destiny,As soon as I started watching it was canceled
Love Destiny,"Before you go raving about this show, Let me tell you about Dark (Netflix). Well actually I can't tell you anything because it would ruin it for you. Don't google it  All you need to know is that it won Best Netflix series 2020.

[Best Netflix Series Winner 2020](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prd-rteditorial/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/04150535/Netflix_Original_Series_Showdown-Winner.jpg)"
Love Destiny,I'm on season 2 as I read this --- sooo good!
Love Destiny,"Yeah I know, it's great. But just very under the radar. Sad it got cancelled, but the fact that Netflix gave it 3 seasons was great in the first place."
Love Destiny,I always wanted to see what the future (or one of them?) looked like.
Love Destiny,Given the nature of the show it would be really cool to have another story following another group of Travellers
Love Destiny,"I've started a rewatch, and I honestly forgot how much I liked this show.  The ideas in it are so good.  

Sure theres moments where the characters react to something and act like it's the first time they have ever encountered an idea, like changing things undoes their existence; surely coming to terms with that is part of the whole thing. 

I know not all the plot lines are great going forward, but overall I love how the mystery is rolled out."
Love Destiny,I really wanted to like it but I just wasn't pulled in after each episode. I don't know why. I then got sad after it was cancelled after season 3 and people told me it ended on a cliff hanger
Love Destiny,Loved this show
Love Destiny,It was fun. I‚Äôm surprised it hasn‚Äôt been rebooted/restarted.
Love Destiny,Yes
Love Destiny,"The season 2 episode ""17 minutes"" is in my opinion the most intense and interesting episode of television ever made."
Love Destiny,Seriously the show gets more amazing as the time goes on
Love Destiny,"You weren't pulled in by the 1st episode?! It was over for me, couldn't stop"
Love Destiny,Probably because they wrapped it with a conclusion. All the other shows on Netflix just randomly die after one or two seasons that have cliffhangers so people get pissed.
Love Destiny,[deleted]
Love Destiny,"For real. Jared absolutely sold the ""old soul in a young body"" in his performance.  I was so shook to know he was the >!oldest!< out of all the travelers."
Love Destiny,What happened to David broke me for a while. He didn't deserve that.
Love Destiny,"Yeah, I liked season 2 a lot but season 3 was not good."
Love Destiny,"I loved the who scifi aspect of the show, the agents and who they were up against and how it all worked

But all the relationship stuff felt like a mess to me. For all the characters."
Love Destiny,Whyyyy
Love Destiny,"Number 3 was what I kept thinking the whole show lol

The second she could string a few words together he was on it

I didn't like any of the character's relationships. The scifi stuff and the agents and time travel I thought was great.

But when they switched over to the relationship stuff everyone got dumb and selfish"
Love Destiny,"Sort of. It's open ended, but they do resolve all the ongoing plots and character arcs."
Love Destiny,"There is closure, they leave it open enough so that the show could've continued but it didn't end on a cliffhanger or anything."
Love Destiny,"I was planning to, but Netflix removed it in my country literally the day after I watched the pilot."
Love Destiny,"Been awhile, but my take.  Spoilers obviously.  The mission was absolute failure.  Grant effectively scrubbed the mission, before it began, knowing it ended in total failure.  The fact that Darcy and David meet at the end is more than just lipservice to shippers, it shows that the Director altered the program and neither of them are involved in the new mission.  Presumably this means new travelers and new hosts."
Love Destiny,That‚Äôs my take on it as well - I think the director send another people to take over the hosts though
Love Destiny,This show was brought back and given some closure by Netflix.
Love Destiny,Yet whenever a show blows up most of the time it‚Äôs from‚Ä¶ Netflix
Love Destiny,"You aren't kidding, there.  I have enjoyed other episodes more, but 17 minutes had me literally on the edge of my seat for what felt like 4 minutes, not 48."
Love Destiny,I‚Äôll keep that episode in mind!
Love Destiny,"Fantastic episode,  and my favorite use of the time loop trope"
Love Destiny,"I‚Äôm a stay at home dad these days, so I only really get to ‚Äúwatch‚Äù things in the middle of the night when everyone is asleep. I‚Äôm usually doing chores, so it‚Äôs more like I‚Äôm listening to programming and looking up now and then. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve missed out on a lot of good stuff by consuming media this way, unfortunately. I‚Äôll make a concerted effort to watch this show now that I know it‚Äôs generally considered to be well executed."
Love Destiny,"> wrapped it with a conclusion

Given the premise of the show, they could have easily transition that conclusion into another timeline."
Love Destiny,"Not really. The show had a following and they tried to make a big thing out of S3 getting made-- but it had varying reviews and was pretty clear the show didn't have a great chance to continue, even before S3 ever came out even getting a third season was a big strech.

FYI it was on Netflix all seasons, except in Canada, it was cancelled by the canadian company in S2 and netflix picked up S3, for no apparent reasons anyone can figure out"
Love Destiny,Yet for some reason I see comments every now and again of people complaining that Netflix cancelled this without wrapping it up. Not a clue what they're on.
Love Destiny,It doesn't have a conclusion IMO. Nothing about the original premise gets resolved and the events of the first three seasons are rendered meaningless if you see that as the conclusion.
Love Destiny,"I mean the issue was more that S3 was a huge stretch to get in the first place and they almost certainly knew that was it, its likely that was the ""gimme"" season, I'd have to suspect the show was already dead while writing S3 and it was officially cancelled, dead, never coming back, fairly quick after S3 release, which means it was probably cancelled long before release as show creators were probably given time to shop it around before."
Love Destiny,Fuck David is such a good guy.
Love Destiny,"The tactician getting tangled with her hosts child over and over again when she had so many perfect excuses to get rid of him by letting the father or cps take him... which would have helped her focus on the grand plan. Felt out of character, only there to cause unnecesary drama, understandable why they put it in, but really forced. Glad season 3 got rid of the kid."
Love Destiny,It‚Äôs one of those instances where you‚Äôre waiting for the next season but it took too long to drop and you forget what happened so you just never start it.
Love Destiny,"> The second she could string a few words together he was on it

Did he even wait?

(I loathed his character)"
Love Destiny,"Yup exactly this.  Also the ending shows that the twin towers never fell, showing that travellers started even further back, perhaps using a differrent transport method.

And yes without the original 001 traveller to fuck uo Darcy her host lived her life."
Love Destiny,"Netflix buys a hyped canceled show, gives it 1-2 seasons, and kills it without a doubt"
Love Destiny,"All the numbers in your comment added up to 69. Congrats!

      17
    + 4
    + 48
    = 69"
Love Destiny,"But didn't the end imply that the characters we followed were effectively done story wise? Another ""loop"" would result in a new cast or version of the same characters. I may be misremembering. 

Either way, it's set up to allow for a spin off or reboot. Which make sense considering the Stargate SG1/Atlantis/Universe team made this show."
Love Destiny,"You‚Äôre right, I completely forgot about the open endedness of the finale. I remember now I was content with the ending (I already knew it was canceled at this point) so I guess my brain just completely deleted the possibility of there being more."
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,This show desperately needs an HD remaster.
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,Weyoun 4.
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,"Watching through the best bits of the show again right now. Currently on Season 5.

The show is still a masterpiece. Characterization is great, everyone has shades of gray. Pretty much all the characters grow and change significantly during the show. You have story arcs that span seasons, flashback episodes covering the occupation, and excellent action episodes around the various wars.

Many episodes are poignant, thought-provoking, and/or touching.

By far the best Trek series for me."
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,"lol She was great. Forgot how good all the beeps and sound effects were in DS9, theyre soothing"
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,"what a show, still in my top five ever. Loved every character, even the ultra boring discount Fiennes Vedek Bareil"
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,Best Trek there is. I can‚Äôt believe people don‚Äôt like the ending. Sisko owed them that and more!
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,"This info about the Jem Hadar is meant to make them seem badass. But it really reveals a crippling weakness in their military design: almost nobody is all that experienced. A Star Fleet battle commander might have 40 years of experience.. across hundreds of situations and facing numerous types of enemy.  JH: We can fight at age 3 days. Yeah, I'm sure you're super effective knowing absolutely nothing and having practiced using no weapons, tools, ships, gear or studying the enemy."
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,"Sadly, that's a lot more difficult because DS9 was the first Trek show to extensively use CGI. So it wouldn't just be a matter of rescanning the original film and reediting it (already not a simple task), but many of the space battles would have to be remodeled. Some of the assets involved might even have to be rebuilt from scratch, due to changes in technology. 

They did a few scenes for the documentary ""What We Left Behind,"" which looked great, but it was apparently expensive."
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,The TNG remaster didn't really sell that well so that ship is sailed
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,"Eh. I'm old enough to have watched when originally broadcast, but recently bit the bullet and did a full rewatch a couple of years back.  

After awhile I didn't really care about the fact that it wasn't remastered.  DS9 is a masterpiece as-is, as far as I'm concerned.  TNG, DS9, Strange New Worlds, Voyager and fuck everything else except for TOS."
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,Unofficial ones exist.
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,When AI gets good enough you'll see all these older show get remasters en masse.
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,Fun fact: Jeffrey Combs was so good in this role that they invented the concept of the Vorta all being clones specifically to justify bringing him back after they'd already killed his character.
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,"> everyone has shades of gray

That is the best thing in shows. That's why I loved Stargate: Universe so much. Everyone was grey, there were no black/white characters. Black/white is such boring storytelling to me. Unrealistic."
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,Nothing like [warp core sounds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oobIAEhXuU) to soothe the soul.
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,"They're bred to know how to fight, so they can already shoot, punch, and strategise by day 3, which was shown in one DS9 episode. Their limited age is also a control mechanism: by dying earlier, there's less of a chance of them rebelling against the Founders. They remain loyal for the duration of their short lives and never question orders because they never have to learn that questioning orders might be in their favour. 

It's important to remember that everything the Founders built into the Dominion was about controlling solids. The Vorta were originally marsupials living in trees that were genetically altered to serve the Founders and the Jem'Hadar were made chemically depedent on ketracel white to the point where they would die without it. The Jem'Hadar not living long was a feature, not a bug."
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,if I were a billionaire I'd bankroll the hell out of it
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,Selling them for 80 bucks a season might well have had something to do with that.
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,A DS9 remaster is probably the one thing that could get me to sub to Paramount+.
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,I was hesitant about SNW and i still cant believe how good it was. Every episode I was afraid it eas gonna fall off the rails and it just didnt. I love anson mount and ethan peck
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,Lousy upscales don‚Äôt count.
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,"Only of certain episodes and scenes, right? No one's ever done the whole series afaik"
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,AI upscales suck ass
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,"That's not going to happen till someone figures out how to train the AI to understand 2D pictures as 3D scenes. Without this, all sorts of weird 2D artifacts will constantly pop up everywhere."
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,"He was great on DS9.  I loved him in The Frighteners, too."
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,"Jeffrey Combs is by far the most underrated Trek actor. He played at least three different iconic characters (Weyoun, Brunt [FCA], and Shran), plus a bunch of others, but was never a main cast member.

Wikipedia says Shran might have become a main character if Enterprise had gotten a fifth season, and now I wish Enterprise had gotten a fifth season even more than I did before."
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,"Got a hotspot on my damn tv because I put one of those 12 hour ""Engine Core"" youtube videos on in the background for a week straight before bed. Then I figured out how to turn the tv screen off and leave the volume on. Ahhhhhhhh yeah. Soothing."
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,"Punching is actually not that useful in a galaxy that has beams and torpedoes that destroy ships with thousands of troops on them in a few hits. And, ya know, guns. 

I didn't get the sense the Jem Hadar were all that loyal, at least not as we were told. In fact, Weyoun even admits this outright the ep that we meet him. If they were so loyal, there'd be no need for the White. But there is a need, isn't there? And we see entire units of Jem Hadar that did rebel in two separate episodes. On two other occasions we see JH defy their orders/superiors and do what they want. 

*The Jem'Hadar not living long was a feature, not a bug.*

Yes, I know. But that doesn't mean it was a sensible feature to add. It wasn't. It was fantastically stupid and self-defeating. Even in the 21st century, you don't win wars with legions of inexperienced, ignorant brutalists who are great at punching and stabbing or even shooting. Effective militaries of advanced societies have commanders that are experienced, knowledgeable, educated, and part of a free society that encourages and rewards independent thinking, creative solutions, etc., It has troops that are trained and taught by those with decades of experience. It ensures loyalty by having a society that values and nourishes them, respects and supports them.. not enslaves and degrades. The Dominion likes to take the long view, what happens over centuries or millennia. You know what inevitably happens to societies like the Dominion over time? They self-destruct like Soviet Russia, or weaken and shrivel into irrelevant, obsolete isolates like NK.   


The Ketracel White is also an exercise in incredible stupidity. The Dominion obviously has to produce this stuff, and produce it in absolutely massive quantities. The Dominion has to protect these factories at all costs... if their enemy takes them out, it's game over. I wonder who would be defending these facilities? Oh yes, we know, Jem Hadar would. All it would take to massively imperil the Dominion is one rogue JH group to take control of a facility, raid its warehouses, or destroy it out of spite. The White makes the Dominion more fragile, not stronger. Because the founders are arrogant morons who apparently have cultural PTSD. Right up to the very end they're convinced of nonsense about ""solids"" that isn't true, despite their massive and completely effective espionage and infiltration.. they remain ignorant fools, unable to understand the most basic things about the solids."
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,Wait seriously?
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,"There‚Äôs a full edition that‚Äôs AI-upscaled that isn‚Äôt horrible, but since it just used the existing releases as the source it can‚Äôt be as good as the scenes that the *What We Left Behind* remastered by getting the original film out of storage."
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,Re-Animator.
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,"I loved him on Star Trek Enterprise.  Whenever he is in Star Trek, he brings this magical charm."
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,"It's hard to call him underrated when he's so rightfully celebrated across the fandom. Still, any credit headed his way is deserved, pinkskin."
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,He was also the guy who Jonathan Frakes beat out for the role of Commander Riker on The Next Generation.
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,"> cultural PTSD

Well, yes. That's the point. The Founders distrusted all solids and quite literally wanted to subjugate the galaxy. They're not thinking of it from a 'hey, maybe we should give Jem'Hadar the ability to think because they'll be better strategists if they learn' because, to them, that's giving solids the keys to the Founders' downfall. All solids weren't to be trusted and had to be controlled.

It's also fair to say that the few Jem'Hadar who rebelled, much like that one that had mutated to no longer need ketracel white, were the minority. They killed their own over disloyalty. 

It's not stupid to the Founders, and that's why they ended up losing: they underestimated the Federation, Klingons, Romulans, etc."
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,"That was the original retail price, they went on sale for about 40 or 30 pretty quickly after release, but if you wanted to be a fan who supported the project, yeah, you were paying absurd prices at first."
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,"I guess it isn't cheap, or they thought superfans would pay it.

Either way I think the whole thing failed for them the second they were put on Netflix and company and no one had to pay those insane prices at all, even if at streaming quality."
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,Perhaps. But he is extremely underrated as an actor in general.
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior," *that's giving solids the keys to the Founders' downfall.* 

Yeah, except that they did that anyway. They did that the very second they decided their entire security and military apparatus would be 100% dependent on solids. You can't have it both ways. You can't have a force that is incredibly powerful and sentient and also have a force that can never harm you. That isn't how reality works. 

*were the minority.*

Probably so. But this might not matter at all. The Dominion uses several control mechanisms we see: genetic programming, hardcore indoctrination/socialization (""victory is life""), and ketracel white. You know why lots of mechanisms are necessary in the Dominion, but not necessary in, say, Star Fleet? Because the threat of loss of control is very real- and that's according to the Dominion itself. The problem is all of these mechanisms can and do fail. It makes no difference at all if it's a minority of troops because the Dominion has made itself so incredible vulnerable in many ways. It has a centralized population apparently on a single world. A single Dominion dreadnought, taken over by rebels even momentarily could annihilate the entire Link in minutes. A single group of rogue JH could destroy a White factory or warehouse... which then leads to a shortage, which leads to thousands or millions of troops being executed or going mad and turning on the Dominion. And since the Dominion decided to invade and make enemies of nearly every humanoid race in the galaxy, guess who's coming to pay a visit when catastrophe weakens their military strength? Everyone. 

*It's not stupid to the Founders,*

Nothing is foolish and self-destructive to the person or people who choose it. That doesn't mean it wasn't foolish and self-destructive. Hitler thought invading the USSR was a great idea. Japan thought bombing the US and half the pacific was a shrewd move.  They each had their reasons. They were still incredibly stupid or ignorant or both for not understanding the consequences of their actions of important facts about their situation and other civilizations."
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,">It's not stupid to the Founders, and that's why they ended up losing: they underestimated the Federation, Klingons, Romulans, etc.

And the prophets, tbf. They were instrumental in hamstringing the Dominion."
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,Very much agree. And also mad that he's not had a new character in the present live action shows. He could play an older Shran or his son in SNW!
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,"True. Though this is a bit just to further that story element and Sisko character development, not really an organic narrative element of the Dominion war. That said, the Dominion still would have lost. You simply can't wage war against an entire quadrant. Imagine 30 different worlds all locked in an existential battle, all of them working together and pouring R&D and resources into anti-dominion tech and weapons. The Dominion couldn't even manage to control Cardassia, a single race. Rebellion and sabotage bloodied its nose and tripped it up. They resorted to genocide, but this is a losing strategy.. you're destroying an economic base of billions meanwhile your enemies are deploying their own resources in full."

There re channels that still transmit it and I leave it on from time to time. While repetitive (episodes from early seasons are literally re executed with other characters in later ones. Same joke. Delivery. Everything) it's still nice
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,What is Hispanic America? Do you mean Latin America?
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,I watched quite a bit of this show until we eventually got our own washer and dryer.
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,Not in Spain.
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,This was always on at my abuela‚Äôs house in Puerto Rico when I was a kid. At least that‚Äôs how I remember it.
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,"I grew up in Brasil and used to watch this with my nanny. 
üéµLa vem o Chaves Chaves Chaves, todos amigos olhando para TV.üé∂üéµ"
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,Scorchio!
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,"Looks like a Mexican ""last of the summer wine"""
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,Ningu√©m tem paci√™ncia comigo‚Ä¶
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,"I was about to say, the author of Savage Detectives made a sitcom??"
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,My friend‚Äôs nick name growing up was Chavo
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,"This show brings me good memories, I used to watch it when I was 6. It aired at night around 8:00PM on one of the most known free to air channels in Mexico, before El Chavo, SpongeBob SquarePants aired.

I recently watched a couple of episodes and I personally didn‚Äôt find it as entertaining as I used to, some of the humor haven‚Äôt aged that well but that‚Äôs something you can expect from a 50 year old show."
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,"Is it still? I grew up watching it. I don't have kids, but I find it hard to believe that my nieces and nephews are aware of any of Gomez Bolanos creations."
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,I can still hear those gem curtains jingling.
El Drag√≥n: Return of a Warrior,Also amazing how the BR dub was kinda its own thing while keeping the spirit of the original and still managed to be iconic in it's own right.
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,I'm addicted to that show. It's sooooo good! I can't wait for season 4 to come out!
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,">It really pulled me out of the episode because it seemed like complete bullshit.

You made it to season 2 of the Good Doctor despite bullshit ""pulling you out of the episode""?  How did you make it through the first nine minutes of the first episode?  Or any of the minutes of any episode since then?"
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,If you apply the right pressure on the right vessel then sure. There‚Äôs a reason why if you get stabbed or shot you should put pressure on the wound. If you can limit the amount of blood flying out of a Artery that means the blood will instead continue to supply your vital organs with the necessary amounts of oxygen that they require.
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"The artery to the gallbladder is pretty small and the bleeding would take a while to cause hemodynamic instability. If they got something more significant, like right hepatic artery, you can put your fingers around the portal triad, called a Pringle maneuver, which should slow but not stop most significant bleeding so that you could find it.  There really isn‚Äôt anything you can do that will make the machines stop beeping right away LOL"
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"Side question...how often does stuff like this happen? (Accidental nicks, etc) Like, never, it‚Äôs infrequent and rarely ultimately a death, or all the time and we would be horrified the truth of what happens in there?"
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,It‚Äôs in season three.
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"No doubt, I can't even make it through the stupid commercials of that show."
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,They couldn't even get Boba straws right.
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"*overly dramatic, sentimental or repetitive music playing in the background*"
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,Can you do this with any type of crisps or does it have to be Pringles?
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,Actually the head doctor told her it happens often. That's why you practice what to do next. OP missed the part where they repair it.
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"I really wanted to like this show. It has all the pieces - a proven showrunner from another show I liked quite a bit, a solid premise, and a really good performance by the lead. But man, I *really* disliked it. It's just *so* heavy handed and predictable. It was almost insulting.

That's rad they're casting actors that actually have autism though. Although they'll probably just get buried by the alt-right screaming about virtue signaling."
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,So its autism all the way down?
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"That's awesome!

I also like the positivity of this The Good Doctor Show. Tons of shows nowadays are just negative."
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"For all five years of my retrospectively short time doing theatre, there was an autistic actor who was in almost every show and he was a joy to work with and so enthusiastic towards each role. I'm pleased to see this on a television casting level. :-D"
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"My wife and I enjoy the show.  I do think it has lagged a bit at times, but it has been interesting to watch the main character (and the supporting ones) change during the course of the show."
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,Why are all doctors in TV shows insane?
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,This is not new. Back in the day there was a TV series that had a main character that was autistic. I can't recall the show. 
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,I love this show. The best pilot show I've seen in awhile.
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,yea... mom likes the show but when she watches it i tend to put my headphones in and watch youtube to block the show out. Honestly i think part of the problem is..... i really hate to sound insensitive to autistic people but his voice is kind of irritating. 
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,I don't see the positivity in the show. The doctors are mean and crabby. Totally unrealistic. I wanted to like this show. And I liked the premise. But man it is just a downer to me. 
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,Because it is a TV show...
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,Are you saying that people with autism are insane...? What the fuck?
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"The character had autism? Or did the actor have autism. In this episode, the actor of the featured character has autism himself."
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,That‚Äôs high praise. Gonna add it to my watch list and check it out.
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,I thought it was a show about a doctor?
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,">i really hate to sound insensitive to autistic people but his voice is kind of irritating.

I don't think that's insensitive. It's a legitimate opinion, and it doesn't have anything to do with his autism anyway.

But yeah, I can see where you're coming from. He does have a distinctive tone of voice."
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"No he's saying TV doctors are always ridiculous assholes that don't ever learn interpersonal skills because they're *just so good, damn it*. "

Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"Well I for one got way too involved in your fanfic land of the Saddle Club, haha. I feel this too, it was such a nostalgic show to me - growing up with horses around where it was filmed in Australia and being born in the 90‚Äôs, the Saddle Club had a big influence on little me! Similar to the original Schoolastic books like the Pony Pals, Ghost Pony‚Ä¶ omg üò≠"
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"I would really love if they did a remake in the actual setting and years the books took place. Everyone wears the styles that were popular in the 90s, they ride in Vermont, it could follow the books a little closer as well."
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"I never saw the show unfortunately, but those books also inspired my love of horses at the age of 10. I had just suddenly moved to a very rural area, and the library was tiny. But I saw a row of red covers in the youth section, and even though I wasn't into horses, the selection was small. I read all 12 Saddle Club books (all they had) in like 2 weeks, and they basically changed my life. I'm 37 now and still have the same love for horses that The Saddle Club inspired."
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,Man this show was a big part of childhood and my friendship with my best friend at the time
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,There was a remake and a third season was done but it completely flopped so it wasn‚Äôt touched again sadly
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"I'd actually dig this as a drama, rather than a children's programme. 

Also, I am shocked to realize there were only two seasons. That show felt like a major part of my childhood."
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,I can‚Äôt improve upon this. It‚Äôs canon now
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"There was never a remake.
Only a third season with a new cast"
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"There was a third, but we don't like to admit it exists.

I think season 3 should have used the same cast as 21 year olds."
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,Ill contact the author and ask her if I can write the sequel novels ü§£ü§£
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"That‚Äôs what I meant haha, still counts as a remake"
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,Yeah the third was‚Ä¶ odd ü§£ some episodes can still be found on DailyMotion.
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,How does it ? It was a continuation of the story
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,It's all on stan
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,Because it‚Äôs a completely new cast and team playing the exact same characters. They remade the show rather than rebooting it with new characters within the same created universe. How is it not not a remake?
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"No, it's a reboot with mostly new cast.
The story continued on from the old one.
It's.even called season 3.

I speak with , about and engage with many people about this and you are literally the first person thats ever called it a remake


If anything, it maybe a reboot"
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"This is cool, nice of you to share it! I wouldn't have Night of the Doctor as the first thing though if it's someone's first time going through Doctor Who. I know it's chronologically the first thing that happens in the new series but it'd be better watched just before the 50th anniversary to preserve the twist from the series 7 finale, and it'd make a lot more sense."
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"I know it would have been a lot of extra work, but I wish you had included the classic seasons in the Doctor Who tab. It's the same show"
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"This is fantastic. I wasn't a huge fan of the alltimelines site (the site itself, the content was great), but I ended up using it when watching Arrowverse shows. This is much better.  Honestly, didn't know which way to read your file at first, but once I figured it out, makes a lot of sense. Thanks for posting this."
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,You put that together? How do you read it? Is each column across a different season? Wow. That's dedication. 
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"Wow. Good job. 

I'm not up on all the Star Trek shows but shouldn't Star Trek VIII: First Contact be sooner in the star trek list? Or maybe as a footnote."
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,I was just thinking the other day about whether this existed on the internet and here it is. Thank you.
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,wow this is very helpful ‚ô•
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"Personally, I'm not a huge fan of the original show. It's also *really* hard to find the more important episodes that are absolutely necessary to the plot; as well as the less necessary, but still fun, filler-ish episodes "
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"Took a couple weeks, but I'm happy with the results."
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"> How do you read it?

I'd like to know too, please! I'm a little lost."
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,It looks like it goes from up to down and left to right if I‚Äôm not mistaken
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,First Contact takes place well after TNG ends. Best way to know the general time period is the uniforms. The First Contact uniforms are the same as those in the latter half of DS9.
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"But that‚Äôs the thing, it‚Äôs not really a continuously moving story. With the exception of the *Key to Time* and *Trial of a Time Lord* sagas, every serial is standalone. Which is great, you can jump around. Sort of like this most recent series of the new show. Unless the Doctor was regenerating, there weren‚Äôt really ‚Äúarcs‚Äù or ‚Äúseason finales‚Äù back in the classics

But if you‚Äôre going to include original Star Trek in that spreadsheet, it makes sense to include the OG Doctor Who seasons too"
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"So from the way I‚Äôm understanding it is that it goes from the top of the first column to the bottom and then move to the second column from the top to the bottom, etc. Basically from top to bottom and left to right."
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,Tonight on Sexy Malpractice...
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,Should make a spin off from the patients perspective but make it a medical horror show
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,Meredith does some EGREGIOUS things that would get anyone else fired if she and Webber didn‚Äôt have this weird daddy issues thing going on.
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"The part that always got me was how many angry arguments would happen in the OR while a patient was open on the table. People would storm in and scream at the surgeon and the surgeon would scream back and this poor patient is lying there with their chest open, unconscious, but still hoping ""McDouchebag"" or whoever doesn't make his next cut all angry and shit. It's nuts."
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,Lol just wait - Seattle has an amazing number of natural disasters. Including a ‚Äúreally bad fog‚Äù that kills a ton of people.
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"Well if you‚Äôre just getting started, it also has to be the most dangerous hospital to work at in America."
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,It is like an adult medical Degressai
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"I was watching an episode the other day where the ambulances crashed into each other outside the ER and that guys neck burst. 

In the end they were rushing to get like 6 people into life saving surgery but there were only 2 operating theaters and one of each type of surgeon. 

Bruh surely a massive hospital in Seattle would have more than two operating theaters and more than one (insert specialty) surgeon

Edits. Series 4 episodes 9 and 10 for clarity."
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"Wait until you find out about the murder rate in Cabot Cove, ME on the show ‚ÄúMurder, She Wrote!‚Äù"
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"I think I got to season 6 or 7 before I tapped out. Was it the shooting season? I don't remember. The first couple seasons were fun medical drama. Then people start getting god damn *murdered*? More people die in this show than in a war movie.

Same reason I tapped out of ER. It's fun until you feel like an episode can give you PTSD because a character you like just gets slaughtered out of nowhere, and by increasingly ridiculous circumstances for such a mundane profession."
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"This is exactly why I stopped watching. After a bomb, a shooting, a plane crash, and a ferry crash, I was like ok this is enough."
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,And everyone and their mom has a tumor.
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"I tapped out after Sandra Oh left the show- Cristina and Meredith‚Äôs relationship was the heart and soul of GA üòî but Oh went onto do Killing Eve which she‚Äôs amazing in, so can‚Äôt say I blame her, she‚Äôs really making great choices with her career"
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"A little off subject, but did you ever see The Good Doctor?  Like every patient would have died if it weren‚Äôt for Shaun.  What type of hospital were they running before they hired him?!?!"
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"Not to mention the favorite sound of this series. Everything is calm and all of a sudden: BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP **Cue the dramatic music** BEEP BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP. 

Patient dies, oh well."
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,That show is like a crazy soap opera.
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"I watched a bit because my wife binges it. 
In the few minutes I saw there was a surgeon that sterilized a woman during a c-section and a doctor that sabotaged a patients artificial heart so he'd be eligible for a transplant. 
The head tells someone's estranged ex-husband about his ex-wifes medical status while she's not even admitted. 
In the meantime everyone has sex with just about anyone else. 

It's by far the most unethical hospital I ever witnessed."
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"I worked at a hospital.  None of this shit happened.  No one was getting laid.  Surgeons were a-holes.  Most of the nurses were older, married, and not interested in anything. 

It was not like a soap opera at all."
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"I‚Äôve watched every episode and I really just want it to end. I‚Äôm still watching it but only because if I don‚Äôt watch it now, I‚Äôll probably have this horrible curiosity whenever the show does end to see how. But seriously, I hope it ends soon. I‚Äôm so sick of it."
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"Thats because thyre more concerned with creating drama than getting some LOLs...

unlike SCRUBS where there is a little drama, but also a 2 minute song and dance about poop so i think it evens out."
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"I tapped out after the shooting episode, though my ex watched for longer so I caught bits of it. Mostly it annoyed me because the show wanted us to believe a single man with no tactical plan could wander an entire city hospital shooting people left and right and the entire city was powerless to stop him. 

Holding one OR hostage? Absolutely. Even making it through one wing of the hospital before security found him? Sure. But dude just wandered the hospital blasting people left and right and there were apparently no security cameras or security at all? Come on. 

Then again, this same show seemed to think a plane could fall out of the sky and absolutely no one would know because the head of surgery didn‚Äôt check his messages, so...."
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"To be fair, they did call George 007 lol"
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"You leave George O‚ÄôMalley out of this! He‚Äôs a saint! 
Also, it‚Äôs called Seattle Grace Mercy Death for a reason."
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,It reminds me of the new Hawaii Five O show. Watching it you'd think Hawaii is actually the most violent place on earth with triads and murderers on every other block.
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"Yeah. That‚Äôs with EVERY SINGLE DOCTOR/HOSPITAL series. 

I remember E.R. the show that put George Clooney on the map, there was a point when a fucking helicopter crashed on the hospital‚Äôs main entrance. 

The good doctor? Famous for having an emotionless autistic savant doctor that ends up fallin in love and having emotions in an earthquake that traps her girlfriend in rubble?

And Dr. House... don‚Äôt even get me started on him lol. 

It‚Äôs TV drama. It‚Äôs supposed to be fake."
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"Scarily,  ""Childrens Hospital"" probably has a better track record than Grey's."
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"Just watch Scrubs.  You will laugh, you will cry and it is more realistic than most other medical shows.  Plus JD and Turk have the best and most wholesome love story out of all of them."
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"*George that severs a major artery during a routine appendectomy*

I've literally been in the OR for this exact situation, except it was a Laparascopic Cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal). The doctor hit a major artery with the trocar (the first access point that allows the scope into the abdomen).

Unfortunately, the patient died very quickly after that...It happens. ALL surgery, no matter how routine, can have complications. 

But yes, Gray's Anatomy is a shitty representation of hospital life. To be honest, the first couple of seasons of Scrubs is probably one of the more accurate and funnier."
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,Don‚Äôt ever watch this show if your spouse is pregnant. They love taking out the kiddos. Damn emotions.
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"To be fair, it‚Äôs implied that there are tons of other successful routine surgeries going on, but we only see the dramatic ones. It wouldn‚Äôt be a very compelling soap opera if they only covered the hundreds of routine appendectomies and clipped minor aneurysms that go on every day.

I do agree that the amount of natural disasters and ‚Äúfreak accidents‚Äù that befall the main cast is absurd. I enjoy the show still, but it‚Äôs outrageous all the things that have happened to the long-running cast members. Meredith has died like 8 different times and comes out of it with zero disabilities and only minor PTSD that lasts maybe a year before the next major disaster strikes."
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"Grey's anatomy is a contrived soap opera that straight up disrespects its audience. 

I seriously don't get why it still has an audience after all the shit it has pulled."
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"The writing on this show is beyond lazy.  They was a character who had a story arc that resulted in her loosing her leg.  A season or two later, they never referenced the fact that she had only one leg, and could move around like nothing happened.  Hell, they even had a distance shot or two showing two, perfectly fine legs."
Doctor X Surgeon Michiko Daimon,"> The audience is told this is the best hospital in the state of Washington but I find it hard to believe that it would make the top ten in a third world country. 

Not to say that the hospital in Greys Anatomy is in a good shape. But I can imagine that the best hospital has a higher death rate than average"
Fleet of Time,"Ah Norm, everytime I hear him I'm reminded of that tragedy."
Fleet of Time,"I haven‚Äôt seen much of Season 3, but he was a wonderful addition to the cast and I really enjoyed his mini-arcs. I‚Äôm going to miss Norm, not just as the character but as the person themselves. They were truly a good egg."

Fleet of Time,"For those who don't know: Season Four is effectively in limbo and has potential to not happen. Disney is essentially going to wait and see how it does. If you want more Orville, share the show with everyone you know who MIGHT like it even a little. Please, I love this show."

Fleet of Time,Why is the Mucinex man‚Äôs mouth the picture on the left?
Fleet of Time,"I swear to God you all only remember the season finale and forgot season 3 wasn't fucking funny at all. The praise here is blowing my mind and has me concerned for all of your cognitive capacities. At least the finale reminded me how good it used to be.

Seriously was it the suicide theme lead in or the back to back ""steal their happiest life"" episodes for Gordon and Issac? Maybe Mercers abandoned pet child or torturing the sex change kid? Nah having her parent disown her was more fun than the torture. Lol

Super fun season.... Lol... It was trash.

Season finale was great though reminded me why I started watching. Rest was shit.

Establish the parody to spin into the drama... Not vice versa. They lost the formula."

Fleet of Time,I could believe this was a long con joke Norm was setting up. Making his friends tell the punchline for him after he died.
Fleet of Time,At least it was a draw.
Fleet of Time,"He wasn't telling people, I think he wanted to go out as ""Just regular old Norm"" instead of being mourned while he was still alive.  Also great Norm joke callback."

Fleet of Time,"It was sold as a spoof, but it never was one. Seth did that to get it through on fox, but its always been a serious show, with humor sprinkled in."
Fleet of Time,I kinda want it to increase the jokes though. The humour is what made it stand out from being a star trek clone.
Fleet of Time,"And the season finale was actually funny, they could switch to that tone whenever they want to."
Fleet of Time,I don‚Äôt really like season 3 so far. I wasn‚Äôt looking for it to become a serious sci-fi show and I think it has lost what made it unique.
Fleet of Time,Honestly the show would be close to perfect if it wasn't for Seth MacFarlane doing his typical schtick.
Fleet of Time,It was never a spoof.
Fleet of Time,Have you tried turning it off and back on?
Fleet of Time,https://mobile.twitter.com/TheOrville/status/1555682561304760321
Fleet of Time,"In the text, there's a link to a Twitter post with the video they didn't bother to try to embed in their article."
Fleet of Time,True. And he hasn‚Äôt been running Family Guy for a while now. Just doing the voice acting
Fleet of Time,Lucky he‚Äôs not just a family guy
Fleet of Time,He's no longer even just American Dad. Or The Cleveland Show. Both of which are/were excellent.
Fleet of Time,"Man, Fred is gone too."
Fleet of Time,I really wish people would stop posting this. It's like the only joke reddit likes of his.
Fleet of Time,"Does it matter that I‚Äôm watching it on Hulu?

It shouldn‚Äôt right since Disney owns it?"
Fleet of Time,"If Disney can't see how the syndication for STNG worked out, I couldn't possibly know what to tell them. If they did 500 eps the show would be immortal. 

If nobody cares about syndication any more, I has a sad face. Dang you streaming...."
Fleet of Time,"I don't have any ad breaks on Hulu (maybe the free version does or something, but Disney+ ain't free either)."
Fleet of Time,Semi regular. He played the voice of a slime character
Fleet of Time,Yes. It's very good.
Fleet of Time,"He started out as kind of a one-off joke, but then became an increasingly important character in season 1 & 2, and had a few lines in season 3 that he apparently recorded from the hospital, but no major plotlines in s3."
Fleet of Time,He barely had a minutes worth of dialogue in season 3.  That's why the tribute video is so short.
Fleet of Time,"I liked Alara a lot more than I ever liked Talla. Maybe I'm in the minority, but there was something fun about such a bubbly, optimistic character being the security chief and resident strong person as opposed to the ""gruff n tuff"" character having those roles, which I feel like has been done a thousand times."
Fleet of Time,She decided to leave the show
Fleet of Time,I'm sorry no one got your joke. I thought it was funny.
Fleet of Time,"Tell me you're not up on pop culture without telling me you're not up on pop culture.

(And because im just as awkward.... It's the character that he plays on The Orville)"
Fleet of Time,Well the username tracks
Fleet of Time,"The first episode of S1 had a lot of humor, but beyond that the show has never been a straight up comedy anyway. They've had serious drama in S1 and 2 too."
Fleet of Time,"It's no longer primarily a comedy, good job paying attention. It was sold as a comedy because it's Seth MacFarlane, but that wasn't his goal"
Fleet of Time,"It was EASILY the best season , in large part because they toned down the humour a bit. There were episodes this season I would put up against the best of TNG."
Fleet of Time,It‚Äôs almost as if the episodes were really good regardless of the more serious tone.
Fleet of Time,"For what reason? Do you normally like Trek and this is too different, or you aren't a space guy at all... opinions are great and all but elaboration would help us see where you're coming from."
Fleet of Time,"Well, yeah? I watched STNG when it was on first run. 

Please don't downvote them - this is a legit question."
Fleet of Time,‚Ä¶. You‚Äôve obviously never watched the show.
Fleet of Time,Yeah he was in Canada
Fleet of Time,He wasn‚Äôt really a main character to begin with.
Fleet of Time,"Probably had more lines, but VO is normally done near end of production. Was cool to see more of the race at the union hq. Would love to see their planet."
Fleet of Time,[It‚Äôs very pretty](https://gfycat.com/flatcheerfulbluefintuna). After this season it is now my favorite show ever. It really was so well done. Seth MacFarlane really outdid himself and I hope it gets renewed for another season.
Astra Lost in Space,"Statement from Estrin's family:

>‚ÄúZack Estrin was our everything. The best husband, father, son and friend. He loved to make everyone happy. He loved to make everyone laugh. He loved being a writer/producer and being a part of creating these shows that people enjoyed. But above all, he loved his family and friends. Thank you all for being a part of his life and ours.‚Äù

EDIT: Cause of death was cardiac arrest."
Astra Lost in Space,That's really sad. I thought the Lost In Space reboot was unique and had a lot of soul while staying true to a lot of the core themes from the original. Would have loved to see what else could have came out from him.
Astra Lost in Space,Sad when anyone dies at 51. Sorry I didn‚Äôt know who he was but my condolences to his family üíê
Astra Lost in Space,That‚Äôs super sad.  Does anyone recommend Lost in Space?  Always thought it looked amazing.
Astra Lost in Space,Damn. 51 is young.
Astra Lost in Space,"51, fuck, I'm 53."
Astra Lost in Space,"He actually had a pretty cool career. Prison Break, The River, Point Pleasant, Tru Calling, Once Upon a Time In Wonderland, The Whispers, and he got his start on Charmed and Dawson's Creek before producing that great movie ""Stranger Than Fiction"" with Will Ferrell. The guy made a lot of hours of entertainment that I really enjoyed watching. A lot of underrated stuff. This is really sad. RIP."
Astra Lost in Space,Oh wow. Lost in space in one of my inspiration to get into directing films. This really sucks.
Astra Lost in Space,That‚Äôs too bad‚Ä¶.way too young. He did a great job with the LIS reboot.
Astra Lost in Space,Natural causes at 51?
Astra Lost in Space,Too young. Rip
Astra Lost in Space,üôèüèª. At least Lost in Space was able to get by Netflix‚Äôs cancellation barriers and saw a proper end.
Astra Lost in Space,At first i thought this must be suicide because of the previous posts on reddit on how devastated he was. Must have been a stressful period for him. The body can only take this much
Astra Lost in Space,since when did reddit become an obituary?
Astra Lost in Space,weak
Astra Lost in Space,How does one die of natural causes at 51?
Astra Lost in Space,"Agreed. That series took me from ‚Äúreally, they remade what?‚Äù to binging (edit: bingeing? How do you spell that?) each season when released."
Astra Lost in Space,"Totally agree, and it was a show that my kids and I really enjoyed watching together, which can be hard to find."
Astra Lost in Space,"Totally agree, it‚Äôs been a fun reboot that really was fun to watch. Sad that he won‚Äôt get to finish the story he helped start. RIP"
Astra Lost in Space,"It's really good. The story is great, characters are great, but the VFX are on another level amongst its contemporaries. Lost in Space was a real gem that really didn't get the attention it deserved."
Astra Lost in Space,Tears are words the heart can't express.
Astra Lost in Space,Mostly it is loss which teaches us about the worth of things.
Astra Lost in Space,"Some of the backstory falls apart if you pull at the sci-fi, a few big things aren't answered.  But it's heart was always in the right place and I really enjoyed it overall."
Astra Lost in Space,"It's a decent tribute to the original show, down to completely nonsensical logic. Recommended to anyone who likes classic sci fi."
Astra Lost in Space,"It's a fun watch. It's definitely one of the better reboots out there. 

Sure it's a low bar, but still, it's pretty good. If you're already this interested, definitely try it out :D"
Astra Lost in Space,Tears are words the heart can't express.
Astra Lost in Space,"Not really, unless you have kids and are watching it with them. It looks good, but the story gets rather nonsensical very quickly. It's a good show for kids, who will enjoy the young characters, the robot and the cool effects and not worry too much about plot holes or characters acting in an illogical manner."
Astra Lost in Space,"I‚Äôm the first episode they keep zooming in on that ugly Judy‚Äôs face to be edgy. I‚Äôd you can stomach that, it‚Äôs worth watching."
Astra Lost in Space,"It‚Äôs pretty cool, kind of falls off by the last season, less  believable, but it finishes the story.
The Robinsons are a bunch of geniuses who are in constant peril and keep going on the edge of chaos on their genius ways, mad skills, and somehow sexy robot. The techno babble is convincing. Just ignore anything you know about Relativity, there‚Äôs no time dilation to speak of.
Parker Posey is brilliant as ever at making you uncomfortable, but manages a sympathetic villain as Smith."
Astra Lost in Space,Granddaughter and I watched the campy original show and the Netflix version and enjoyed bothüëç
Astra Lost in Space,"Yeah, just how is this happening?"
Astra Lost in Space,"Damn, haven‚Äôt heard anyone mention tru calling in maybe ever but I loved that one"
Astra Lost in Space,Turns out people get sick at all ages
Astra Lost in Space,"""Natural causes"" isn't a thing. Not even when you're old. You die from SOMETHING.

Here it likely means some sort of illness as opposed to suicide, accident, or homicide."
Astra Lost in Space,"I lost a boyfriend I loved dearly to natural causes at 31, it was a pulmonary embolism shortly after he returned from a flight he took. It‚Äôs crazy but not super uncommon for healthy young people to randomly be taken. Unfair isn‚Äôt even beginning to express how I feel about that part of life."
Astra Lost in Space,"I think you are confusing it with [the ""Final Space"" situation](https://collider.com/final-space-pulled-from-streaming/)."
Astra Lost in Space,Devastated about what?
Astra Lost in Space,Shut up
Astra Lost in Space,"Stroke, heart attack, unpublicized chronic medical issue, cancer, etc. Did your body kill itself? That‚Äôs natural causes."
Astra Lost in Space,"Natural means something medical like cancer or heart attack, and not from a gunshot, car accident, a multi story fall, Inigo Montoya's blade, etc."
Astra Lost in Space,Bad Jeans
Astra Lost in Space,"Unaddressed diabetes or irreversible heart damage. There was some woman castmember from the Elvis film that recently died at 44 due to full blockage in her arteries, but I don't recall her being obese or anything. Then there's the slew of athletes with either blockage or undiagnosed arrhythmia like Jason Collier, Neil Reed,  Yinka Dare, Reggie Lewis and Darryl Kile one of the few near recent MLB pros to die while still actively playing."
Astra Lost in Space,"My moms father died at 39 of a heart attack. It‚Äôs young and sad but that‚Äôs why we got to try and make each day count and good even when it‚Äôs a bad day, try and have some great moments"
Astra Lost in Space,"My brother has a heart condition that can kill him if he lifts something over 100 lbs, or if it just feels like it. He‚Äôs 40. That said, cardiac arrest doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean natural causes. Hookers and blow can cause cardiac arrest."
Astra Lost in Space,"You‚Äôre going to see a lot of people suddenly die who are over 45 in the next 10 yrs. Long Covid has all sorts of blood, artery, and stroke related issues. Seriously. It‚Äôs just gonna be the norm. Not saying I know this is related but it‚Äôs not unlikely."
Astra Lost in Space,Happens all the time. Anterior MI leads to ventricular fibrillation and its all over in 5 minutes unless you have good cpr and interventions to open the artery.
Astra Lost in Space,I had a heart attack at 34. Probably because of how much sugar I consumed despite being at a healthy weight and being active. Sometimes bodies suck.
Astra Lost in Space,"Basically all that means is ""did not die due to outside forces."" It's sad to have a heart attack at 51, but I have no idea what his medical profile or stress levels looked like."
Astra Lost in Space,"My father at 50, my uncle at 50-stroke/heart attack-which are natural causes in medical terms. For us the family they died too young."
Astra Lost in Space,"The story finished.  The last season finished the story (Will Robinson being huge hastened that).

It was such a great family show.  Something that's not seen much these days.  A show that is fun to watch by adults and kids.  They didn't decide to toss in some random boobs and the plot was easy to follow yet very interesting."
Astra Lost in Space,Classic serial movie trope with a family of Mary Sues. Check.
Astra Lost in Space,"Ditto. Point Pleasant was really cool too. One of the better network antichrist horror shows. I remember being really bummed when it got cancelled. It was during Fox's slash-and-burn-all-genre-series era. Dark times (for Dark Angel, lol)."
Astra Lost in Space,"Natural Causes means you died from something internal (ie cancer, heart disease, etc.)"
Astra Lost in Space,"Very sorry to hear that! 
Terrible. I personally am very afraid of cardiovascular arrest / stroke / aneurysm - related death or debilitation, and I wish that cardio system health was easier to access and part of a regular screening process. 

It is absolutely unfair, that as humans we proceed to pass along genetics with total abandon and that it can be so random. I knew a guy who was in excellent health and jogged almost daily, who died of the same thing. Meanwhile people who are obese and sit around smoking all day can live to 85."
Astra Lost in Space,You are totally right. My mistake thanks for correcting me
Astra Lost in Space,awwww üò∞üò∞üò∞üò∞ go stream on twitch
Astra Lost in Space,"Yup. Great Grandfather was 49, Grandfather 50, my dad 51. All heart attacks."
Astra Lost in Space,For some reason I always thought natural causes had to do with old age.
Astra Lost in Space,Who is Jean Renault?
Astra Lost in Space,Fucking Wranglers!
Astra Lost in Space,/r/boneappletea
Astra Lost in Space,Acid wash kills.
Astra Lost in Space,"> Long Covid has all sorts of blood, artery, and stroke related issues.

Any proof that this guy even had COVID?  It seems sort of crazy to put that out here like that.  To me, making a blanket statement like that is no better than saying ‚Äúthe vax has all sorts of blood, artery, and stroke related issues‚Äù so you‚Äôre going to see a lot of sudden death over the next ten years."
Astra Lost in Space,Yea you‚Äôre right I was thinking of a different show (the expanse) that left the story unfinished. Will and the robot going off on their adventures was a great ending (spoiler alert).
Astra Lost in Space,that kid really had a growth spurt
Astra Lost in Space,"Never actually heard of that one, I‚Äôll give it a watch, thanks homie."
Astra Lost in Space,Exactly that's what I meant. Didn't say it as well
Astra Lost in Space,Yea exactly! You hear a lot about running related deaths due to heart conditions they never knew they had etc. It's tragic.
Astra Lost in Space,"It's all good, I had it mixed up myself at first because the names are so similar."
Astra Lost in Space,üòò
Astra Lost in Space,[deleted]
Astra Lost in Space,"Christ. That‚Äôs terrible I‚Äôm sorry. Pancreatic cancer has taken my great grandfather, grandfather, and uncle. It‚Äôs sometimes frightening knowing that you can be predisposed to something like that. Take care of yourself."
Astra Lost in Space,I‚Äôm sorry to hear that. It‚Äôs a similar story with my mother; her siblings and both parents died at 46. Needless to say she was very happy to turn 47.
Astra Lost in Space,"My family is similar but with a 12yr gap. So for me it might be anywhere from 60-72. 
/remindme in 25 years"
Astra Lost in Space,"Yup! Great great grandma, great grandma, grandma all had heart attacks at 49. Grandma survived though. My mom had a heart issue but she very paranoid and had it checked out in her early 40s."
Astra Lost in Space,Do you plan to just live in a hospital for your 52nd year?
Astra Lost in Space,You have a time bomb in your chest.  Take care.
Astra Lost in Space,"> Any proof that this guy even had COVID?

40% of all adults have had COVID (as of June 2022) and 20% of those infected could specifically be diagnosed with ""Long COVID"" symptoms.

While there is no evidence of an association *in this specific instance,* a generalized comment that we may see a rise in sudden, unexplained issues related to our circulatory systems is something that IS supported by statistical and medical evidence.

As opposed to a claim about ""the vax"" which is supported by neither."
Astra Lost in Space,[removed]
Astra Lost in Space,"Have you read the expanse books? There‚Äôs a 30 year time jump‚Ä¶. There‚Äôs some people that say it will come back later, but it‚Äôs also a bit of a tough pill to swallow for a TV audience."
Astra Lost in Space,"Spoiler, but one that everyone would predict and still doesn't tell you what happened at the end."
Astra Lost in Space,"OH. I legitimately thought that the character had been like... ""Honey I Blew Up the Kid""ed for some reason which made the story go faster for some reason."
Astra Lost in Space,"Thank you. I do get my choloesterol checked. It‚Äôs fairly normal, surprisingly. A lot of those deaths, esp my dad was also due to smoking. I don‚Äôt smoke."
Astra Lost in Space,"As far back as anyone can remember no male in my family had lived past 63. Not a particular cause, it was more like a curse. My dad was the first to buck the trend. I‚Äôve been enjoying the extra time we‚Äôve had together."
Astra Lost in Space,Thank you. I was 16 when my dad died but my poor twin aunts were 2 when my grandfather died. They never knew him.
Astra Lost in Space,"Thank you. I do have other male relatives on my dad's side that are living past 50. That's a good thing. And much better health care exists today, no matter how much we complain about it. My grandfather would have lived in this day in age for sure."
Astra Lost in Space,"I‚Äôm pretty sure that more than 20% of Americans were vaccinated. The only real way to get good data on this would be to run a statistical  regression analysis on the cardiac health outcomes between populations with similar COVID infections but divergent vaccine adoption. I‚Äôd suggest U.S. and Sweden because we have similar infection rates but Sweden had very low vaccine rates. And if critics don‚Äôt like that (because Sweden‚Äôs diet tends to be better) pick another country like Canada v Sweden. 

The point is that this sort of research won‚Äôt get funding or publication under this sort of environment. But I suspect that we will start seeing the results of these types of studies looking backwards at the Pandemic in the 2030s‚Ä¶after the politics have died down."
Astra Lost in Space,[deleted]
Astra Lost in Space,"Ignore me if I‚Äôm prying, but have you been to a cardiologist? I‚Äôm curious what the protocol is for someone with a family history like this."
Astra Lost in Space,I do need to watch my weight but I move everyday. I get multiple 10 plus mile work days during the week and weights too. I‚Äôm trying!!
Astra Lost in Space,[removed]
Astra Lost in Space,"Relax, Freckles...you did fine."
Astra Lost in Space,"What has she been in that was better for comparison?

&#x200B;

She was fine to me. But people can be really hard on themselves."
Astra Lost in Space,She's certainly come a long way. In Quantumania she does a great job of playing someone that believes in science.
Astra Lost in Space,"Honestly, I didn‚Äôt notice anything."
Astra Lost in Space,"Season 2, when she is raiding the hatch food storage and shoving candy bars down her pants was some of the best acting on the show. ""Pretend like you've been trapped on a weird island with no access to chocolate and.... action!"""
Astra Lost in Space,Lol every time I see her I think about that time she was whining about how difficult life is for her because she‚Äôs so beautiful.
Astra Lost in Space,I mean she‚Äôs not very good in the Ant-Man movies.
Astra Lost in Space,The real crime here is the series of hairstyles she has had over the past two decades.
Astra Lost in Space,? Her character was unbelievably annoying but her performance was actually pretty amazing throughout

People are just doing what any informed person would do if people start worshiping someone who everybody at the time unanimously agreed was an asshole.
Drunk History - P√≥≈Ç litra historii,"Hmm, I haven't heard all of the Hamilton musical, but i assume it highlights his major achievements and shortcomings with a tragic conclusion with Burr the villain. 

I assumed this was Miranda's opportunity to do a ""Wicked"" style (which I think is the wizard of oz from the perspective of the wicked witch) take on his own creation. 

Also, Hamilton was a big deal Federalist, and we're in state's rights country know. "
Drunk History - P√≥≈Ç litra historii,I don't know but there are a few episodes on Drunk History about him.

Drunk History - P√≥≈Ç litra historii,You're downvoted for some reason but your comment is the sole reason I even clicked on this comments section.  It's one of the only Comedy Central shows I'll shut off as soon as I see it's what's airing.  It's abominably awful.  It's one of the least funny and worst things I've ever seen.

Drunk History - P√≥≈Ç litra historii,"I am pretty sure every show does that for insurance purposes.  I am not saying they aren't drunk, but having paramedics on scene proves nothing.  I choose to believe they are drunk, but I think they probably aren't and are just pretending.  They don't want people getting alcohol poisoning and such or not being able to tell the story."
The Alc√†sser Murders,Only A-Listers in the Building (not a complaint)
The Alc√†sser Murders,Paul Rudd and Meryl Streep was a combo I didn‚Äôt know I wanted to see
The Alc√†sser Murders,She already won The Emmy for that teaser
The Alc√†sser Murders,Hulu throwing shade at Netflix by making a third season of a show
The Alc√†sser Murders,"Gosh, what a fun show, can't wait!"
The Alc√†sser Murders,"I have to give them props. My initial reaction was, ""There's a THIRD season?""

And they immediately lampshade the elephant in the room."
The Alc√†sser Murders,Streep having fun is best Streep!
The Alc√†sser Murders,"They really turn around new seasons for this show fast, eh? Not that I'm complaining."
The Alc√†sser Murders,How are there people left in this building with all these murders!?
The Alc√†sser Murders,Release date?
The Alc√†sser Murders,"Now, throw in Harrison Ford as a grumpy old resident of the building."
The Alc√†sser Murders,i want this show to go on forever
The Alc√†sser Murders,Love it!! ‚Ä¶ Can‚Äôt Wait!! üòù
The Alc√†sser Murders,Hopefully the guest stars are better than Season 2 this time around. Michael Rappaport and Cara Delevingne made Season 2 a slough to get through. Amy Schumer wasn‚Äôt good either but at least she was only in it for a little bit.
The Alc√†sser Murders,I have had my account on pause for a year... It may be time for me to hold Netfux and get Hulu back for a while.
The Alc√†sser Murders,The best show on streaming is back!
The Alc√†sser Murders,Really looking forward to this. Any news on the release date?
The Alc√†sser Murders,"Is this the first season of this show to have been shot without any significant COVID restrictions placed on it? I do sort of think of this show as a COVID show (maybe THE Covid show?)

I wonder if that's going to have an effect on it. A lot of that quiet, low-key, almost podcasty charm of the show I think was due to those limitations causing the show to find creative workarounds.

It might be that even without those restrictions, they stay in that general shape because it just... works?

(although S2 did flanderize itself a little bit in a couple different ways. Still loved it tho)

edit: LOL what the hell - is this question getting downvoted because... a PANDEMIC actually happened? I don't get it. I honestly want to know."
The Alc√†sser Murders,Love this show and supporting my girl Selena. Can‚Äôt wait for S3! OMG cast for this season is amazing!
The Alc√†sser Murders,This is perfection. I just binged 2 seasons. First season is a visual treat. Definitely made for NPR listeners / New Yorker readers.
The Alc√†sser Murders,"Is this show good? Like actually good?  

Can I ask people who really like this show what *other shows* they really enjoy so I can see if it's a good fit for me?"
The Alc√†sser Murders,friendly reminder that she supports roman polanski
The Alc√†sser Murders,"I really enjoy this show but the ending to season 2 was a real let down. The acting performances were great and there is some good writing, but the plot ended up convoluted and messy."
The Alc√†sser Murders,I hate Meryl Streep. I hope she doesn't have much screen time.
The Alc√†sser Murders,"I'll watch, but season 2 was a 5 out of 10."
The Alc√†sser Murders,"Didn't think they could make it any better, and then they add a legend, Meryl Streep, and the funny, sexy, and iconic Paul Rudd to the mix. I can't wait to see where this season takes us"
The Alc√†sser Murders,"Season 2 was a farce.   They should have left it as a great mini series.

&#x200B;

Won't be watching this"
The Alc√†sser Murders,"When I saw that thumbnail, it took me a couple seconds to remember Robin Williams is dead. ‚ÄúHelloooooooooo!‚Äù"
The Alc√†sser Murders,"‚ÄúOnly on Hulu‚Äù, and by that they mean released 3 months later everywhere else on Disney+ but since the Hulu-D+ merge hasn‚Äôt happened yet I guess I have to sail the seas like with every Hulu show because I‚Äôm not waiting."
The Alc√†sser Murders,I gave up on this show like 8 episodes into S1 but it's been on my watch list for a while. This definitely seems more like a fall watch than a spring-summer watch
The Alc√†sser Murders,Awful
The Alc√†sser Murders,"I hope they put some more effort into the scripts again. Don't get me wrong, season 2 was as much fun as the first, but storywise it was all over the place."
The Alc√†sser Murders,"I only got into this show a couple weeks ago but binged the hell out of it. Didn't realize how much I missed Steve Martin and Martin short after growing up on their movies. Also, for the first time in my life I would consider myself a Selina Gomez fan (I missed the Wizards of Waverly Place boat by a year or two)."
The Alc√†sser Murders,"I wonder if 20th Television and Hulu are just sending a dump truck full of money to the cast or if it's a ""I'll take a pay cut to work with Steve Martin"" type situation."
The Alc√†sser Murders,"Uh exqueez me? You clearly hate B and C-Listers, not to mention the D-Listers. I‚Äôm literally shaking.

üòÜ

Edit: FFS I was joking"
The Alc√†sser Murders,I demand a cameo by Jiminy Glick.
The Alc√†sser Murders,They will throw in an oscar too
The Alc√†sser Murders,[Same energy](https://youtu.be/wZ5R1TZwKK0)
The Alc√†sser Murders,hulu canceled reboot after one season
The Alc√†sser Murders,"I know people are iffy on the movie, but she was so hilarious in Don‚Äôt Look Up. She was having so much fun with that role"
The Alc√†sser Murders,The cast made a instagram video where they treated her like a waitress/intern.  It was pretty funny.
The Alc√†sser Murders,"It is nice to have TV on a regular schedule and not the 2-3 year cycle that it‚Äôs often becoming. 

Suppose it‚Äôs a lot easier to do when most of the show is shot in the same couple of building sets"
The Alc√†sser Murders,Not really. We are still shooting this current season. It'll be mid to late summer before anything airs.
The Alc√†sser Murders,This and slow horses.
The Alc√†sser Murders,It doesnt honestly seem like a big thing to film like no car chases or explosions or cgi. The biggest thing is just scheduling really.
The Alc√†sser Murders,Presumably they're receiving regular resupplies from the same place the Midsomer Constabulary keeps getting all its ill-fated Englishmen and the various NCIS branches keeps getting all their dead naval officers.
The Alc√†sser Murders,Well I'm guessing prices are dropping because of all of the murders so that attracts people taking the risk
The Alc√†sser Murders,My guess is 3-4 months.
The Alc√†sser Murders,"One would think they'd include that with a trailer, no?"
The Alc√†sser Murders,I assume June or July
The Alc√†sser Murders,They need to save some A-listers for future seasons as well no?
The Alc√†sser Murders,Um‚Ä¶ did you see Meryl Streep in this teaser? That trumps all guest stars of every season of every show.
The Alc√†sser Murders,"I would say the writing and lack of jokes made season 2 a ""slough to get through"""
The Alc√†sser Murders,"Amy Schumer is just awful, I cringed everytime I saw her on the screen."
The Alc√†sser Murders,I'd say tiger king was THE covid show.
The Alc√†sser Murders,Honestly the closest thing I can think of in tone is Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. With a playful modern detective setting.
The Alc√†sser Murders,"I don't know how the upvotes and downvotes are going to go with my reply but it is the most okay-est show I think I've ever seen. It's really, honestly, okay."
The Alc√†sser Murders,"why don't you start with saying what shows you consider good, so we know if it's one for you or not? way easier"
The Alc√†sser Murders,"Season 1 was pretty good.  I describe it as a nice show to watch 

Season 2 was a mess of inconsistencies and the biggest praise I can give it was they managed to release the season pretty quickly after season 1."
The Alc√†sser Murders,"Season 1 was a fun ride but the ending was very unsatisfying (read: flat-out bad).

We couldn't get through three episodes of S2."
The Alc√†sser Murders,"I only like it to watch the Martins chew scenery.  I loved Steve in L.A. Story and My Blue Heaven, and loved Short in Innerspace and as Ed Grimley, the inventor of the dab.  Selena Gomez started out with wooden limited emoting skills but the Martins' infectious comedic chops warmed her up by S2.  It's not a sincere puzzle show where you need a notebook and a pen to take notes like Primer or the Scream movies.  It's a very ""Manhattan"" show for you to watch with your teen daughters.  It falls between Always Sunny stakes and Good Place wholesomeness.  I didn't watch this week to week, just waited until each season was over to binge it all in a day while under the influence. Hope this helps!"
The Alc√†sser Murders,"s1 was actually good

s2 was kind of a chore"
The Alc√†sser Murders,Hopefully she won't be in too many episodes like Amy Schumer in season 2
The Alc√†sser Murders,"Season 2 released each episode on Disney+ the same day they were released on Hulu (at least in Canada, and I assume most countries other than the US)."
The Alc√†sser Murders,I think it's the former. I read an article in Variety before the second season that said the two Martins were both making $600k per episode. Safe to assume they're throwing similar numbers at the big name guest stars.
The Alc√†sser Murders,have you considered your joke was bad
The Alc√†sser Murders,***Only***
The Alc√†sser Murders,I'm still mad about that one.
The Alc√†sser Murders,Probably
The Alc√†sser Murders,"Last season was last summer, so a lot better than most streaming shows nowadays."
The Alc√†sser Murders,Are you working on the show?
The Alc√†sser Murders,"I believe Slow Horses was originally purchased for 2 seasons, so they shot the first 2 seasons back-to-back. Then Apple renewed it for 2 more seasons, so they are shooting 3 and 4 back-to-back. It has certainly helped them release on an accelerated timeline."
The Alc√†sser Murders,"S1 and S2 [both began dropping in the summer](https://www.epguides.com/OnlyMurdersIntheBuilding/), so I'd agree."
The Alc√†sser Murders,Still plenty of A-listers
The Alc√†sser Murders,"I really can‚Äôt stand Meryl Streep. The whole siding with Weinstein, cheering for Polanski, and ignorance during her acceptance speech in 2017 has really soured me on her."
The Alc√†sser Murders,I don‚Äôt think that was filmed during covid.
The Alc√†sser Murders,Ooh thanks for the reply
The Alc√†sser Murders,Why would I do something the easy way?
The Alc√†sser Murders,"As in lame or somehow tr-tr-triggering? üò±

Either way it is what it is, it‚Äôs there and idc anymore"
The Alc√†sser Murders,I forget at times how easily offended some people are by the most innocuous things
The Alc√†sser Murders,"Totally agree about her support for Weinstein and Polanski, it's disgusting. But what part of that 2017 speech did you think was ignorant?"
The Alc√†sser Murders,">ignorance during her acceptance speech in 2017 has really soured me on her.

Oh, majorly.  Fuck her."
The Alc√†sser Murders,I don't know why you are downvoted.
The Alc√†sser Murders,I guess I meant it in the context of it was the show that we were all captive audiences for during early covid.
The Alc√†sser Murders,">	tr-tr-triggering

god this kind of humor is so predictable and pedantic. legit r/onejoke"
The Alc√†sser Murders,"The biggest thing that annoyed me with that speech was her saying tighter immigration would mean ‚Äúyou'll have nothing to watch but football and mixed martial arts, which are not the arts.""

Because mixed martial arts is an incredibly global sport and at the time more than half the champions were not American. In fact, right now in the UFC only three of the 11 champions are from the US. Also claiming it isn‚Äôt an art is pretty ignorant.

I did come up with a reason why she oddly attacked MMA though: days or weeks before her speech WME-IMG bought the UFC and it just so happens they‚Äôre also one of the largest talent agencies in Hollywood but she‚Äôs represented by their main competitor, CAA."
The Alc√†sser Murders,Because the Reddit hive mind puts her on some weird pedestal despite plenty of evidence that she‚Äôs self serving and a bad person. It‚Äôs the same thing with Alec Baldwin and I think it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre both publicly anti-Trump.
The Alc√†sser Murders,I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what the person was talking about. A lot of shows and movies had to make changes while filming to adjust around Covid restrictions.
The Alc√†sser Murders,"What is wrong with baldwin? I've seen a few reddit comments that toss shade at him, never heard what makes him bad though."
The Alc√†sser Murders,Yea. Re-reading it you are right.  Although I still wouldn't call it THE covid show as much as I would call it one of the shows who's production was disrupted by covid.
The Alc√†sser Murders,"There are a bunch of accounts of him being a pretty big asshole (not the Trump stuff, like to random people)."
The Alc√†sser Murders,"Of course he's an asshole, he's a Baldwin.  There are many famous people that are also assholes.  That's not worth treating him like Kevin Spacey."
The Alc√†sser Murders,"""[Meryl Streep] has the flu, and I hear she's AMAZING in it"""
The Alc√†sser Murders,This weird little show makes me so happy.
The Alc√†sser Murders,throwing multiple Oscar winners in it because why not
The Alc√†sser Murders,"She can be quite funny when she wants to (Devil Wears Prada, Adaptation, Death Becomes Her, Fantastic Mr. Fox) quite excited to see what her role is"
The Alc√†sser Murders,"No details on who she's playing yet.

Season 3 (Major S2 Spoilers):

>!Season 3 will pick up as Charles, Oliver and Mabel work to figure out who killed Ben Glenroy (Paul Rudd). The Season 2 finale saw Glenroy die onstage while performing in a Broadway play opposite Charles and directed by Oliver.!<"
The Alc√†sser Murders,I hope she is playing herself and lives in Sting‚Äôs apartment.
The Alc√†sser Murders,Love it. Now add Kevin Kline please and thank you.
The Alc√†sser Murders,I at first thought the title said ‚ÄúMeryl Streep Joins Only Fans‚Äù and a lot of confusing feelings came up for me.
Taste of Love,The prick turned up to court each day in a rented Rolls Royce. Not really sure what the message he was trying to make was.
Taste of Love,Gonna chime in on this one and say I have no idea how the people of Britain let this guy fucking win during his season. Like there were absolute pieces of garbage that season and he stood out the most. The show even allowed his now ex-gf to break up with him IN THE HOUSE on an episode after he had sex with another contestant LMAO.
Taste of Love,People are so stupid.
Taste of Love,I read that he made 40k from his OF around the time he posted the video. I hope he has to pay her every cent of it.
Taste of Love,Good. What a POS.
Taste of Love,[Every time I see this fuckwit I remember him shitting his pants in big brother when that giant opened the door.](https://youtu.be/-dJ-fRGSTEQ)
Taste of Love,What a gross thing to do.
Taste of Love,Holy fucking loser Batman
Taste of Love,"Saw him on 2 seasons of The Challenge and it was obvious he was a major asshole. He had some fun moments but he didn't know when to stop and took things too far.

It was rough watching some of the girls fall for his ""bad boy"" charm over and over (specifically Georgia and Kailah). 

In retrospect that scene where Wes and Bananas stuck a photo of Kailah's boyfriend up above her bed was probably a low-key effort to remind her she was about to cheat on her boyfriend for an absolute prick."
Taste of Love,Celebrity is quite a stretch
Taste of Love,Eww. He *drips* douchebag.
Taste of Love,Maybe Channel 4 can stick a camera up his arse so we don‚Äôt miss any of the action.
Taste of Love,"Not Georgia! She is so lovely ü•∫ 

...And even if she wasn't, no one should ever suffer this humiliation or invasion of privacy. The court ruled appropriately."
Taste of Love,I hate everything about this headline.
Taste of Love,"I have never seen this person, so I guess even winning Celebrity Big Brother doesn't make someone much of a celebrity."
Taste of Love,These guys trying too hard to prove their masculinity. What a joke.
Taste of Love,Good. Fucking loser
Taste of Love,I had to read that headline nine times before I stopped seeing George Harrison.
Taste of Love,Who and who?
Taste of Love,"Not long enough considering this dickhead's given her a life sentence, knowing that video will be online forever now because of him. Hope he's put on the sex offender register for life."
Taste of Love,Oh what a miserable fucking cunt this dude is. I hate him so much. He‚Äôs a true monster.
Taste of Love,"It‚Äôs crazy this shit stain got 21 months for posting a fucking video, versus that mega shit stain QB who only got 6 months for beating the shit out of his gf. It‚Äôs a very backwards, fucked up system we got"
Taste of Love,"For context, he will only serve half of this sentence and be on some bullshit probation for the remainder."
Taste of Love,"Not long enough IMHO, arrogant prick."
Taste of Love,Never heard of him.
Taste of Love,"If he‚Äôs put on the sex offenders register, will he banned from travel and social media? I really hope so would be nice for him to disappear from consciousness. 

Oh, and I hope prison is thoroughly unpleasant for him. But he‚Äôll probably be protected on the nonce wing."
Taste of Love,As he should. If not more‚Ä¶
Taste of Love,Oh my god that‚Äôs terrible.  Which website was it?
Taste of Love,[removed]
Taste of Love,"Isnt this how the kardashians got their start? They just did it in a sneaky ‚Äúoops, it got leaked‚Äù way."
Taste of Love,Nasty bastard
Taste of Love,What's really sad is if you watch the video of him showing up for sentencing there was still loads of girls wanting pictures with him
Taste of Love,"Disappointed that he turned out to be an actual prick. For what I saw when he appeared in those reality shows my GF watches, he was pretty hilarious. Managed to rub everyone the wrong way. Especially those idiots of the MTV Challenge shows who take themselves way too serious. But fuck him for putting this video online and he got what he deserves"
Taste of Love,"She looks like a Smut anyway, should have never made a video knowing it could get out."
Taste of Love,Link?
Taste of Love,Maybe don‚Äôt allow yourself to be videotaped for sex?
Taste of Love,Lame.
Taste of Love,Remindme! 2 hours
Taste of Love,20000 channels here
Taste of Love,"This is so stupid. Yes if somebody is murderer, robber, rapist, etc.. send them to prison. But this? Wtf this world is so soft lmao"
Taste of Love,"If two adults consent to recording themselves having sex, you pretty much give up any right to privacy given the risks involved of that video being made public."
Taste of Love,*Sigh*
Taste of Love,Money often brings out the trash that was hidden within. Hope he enjoys his three hots and a cot.
Taste of Love,See ya
Taste of Love,Loozah!
Taste of Love,Showing off the dick again. Some guys can‚Äôt help themselves.
Taste of Love,Good
Taste of Love,"Surely that should be ‚Äòcelebrity‚Äô Big Brother. Seriously though, why do we keep enabling biological waste like this numpty?"
Taste of Love,"How about we change the narrative on this:
""Convicted sex offender Stephen Bear sentenced to 21 Months......"""
Taste of Love,Dick head. Off to jail. Fker
Taste of Love,What a douche.
Taste of Love,"I remember him watching the, ‚ÄúThe Challenge‚Äù. I never liked him and always rooted against him"
Taste of Love,"Wait, I'm confused. His only noticeable claim to fame is being on Celebrity Big Brother? Wouldn't that mean he wasn't a celebrity? How the fuck did that happen?"
Taste of Love,"every brother is big in prison‚Ä¶

have fun."
Taste of Love,Whoa that‚Äôs awesome. I remember when people would literally post videos of themselves having sex with a minor unbeknownst to the other party the other party would be the one that got dragged and everyone else celebrated the poster. Happened to Paris Hilton.
Taste of Love,Picture checks out
Taste of Love,Disgusteng
Taste of Love,Neck tattoos‚Ä¶
Taste of Love,"What kind of asshols does that?  Just because they have a typical hot attributes of man, doesn't mean this! What a prick."
Taste of Love,Who is this guy and why is he well known enough to be considered a ‚Äúcelebrity?‚Äù
Taste of Love,Is *everybody* on Big Brother a steaming pile of shit?
Taste of Love,Both of them are a waste of space
Taste of Love,And he published non-consensual photos and videos with his ex. So well deserved!
Taste of Love,A smart rich person would go to rehab and blame it all in the demon liquor
Taste of Love,"‚ÄúI‚Äôm terribly insecure, please feel jealous of me‚Äù"
Taste of Love,Maybe he was trying to make sure that every single person who saw him loathed him. The crime itself probably was enough but he could have wanted the extra assurance.
Taste of Love,Trying to be an Andrew Tate alpha dude bro? Because apparently doing sex crimes is fine as long as you own luxury cars
Taste of Love,He‚Äôs probably a big Andrew Tate fan
Taste of Love,"Must have been trying to let everyone know what a massive cunt he is, as if his previous actions hadn‚Äôt already proven it to anyone watching. Not that I condone anything bad happening to him but maybe going to prison as a sex offender will show him the error of his ways, although being a high profile prisoner will probably afford him more luxuries than the average person would receive"
Taste of Love,How do you know it was rented
Taste of Love,Imagine the type of people who watch celebrity big brother and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll find your answer
Taste of Love,"People vote for the people they want to see more of next week. It's visual clickbait that ends up winning, not because we like these people, but because we like to judge them. 

So this weird symbiotic relationship exists where assholes try and be mega-assholes just to keep the eyeballs glued to their antics. And the viewers get what they want just the same. 

My word for 2023 is ""disengage"". Really I shouldn't even be reading a reddit thread about the guy, it is absolutely what he wants and will perpetuate this sort of personality proliferating."
Taste of Love,"Many idiots think of people like him as ""alpha males"" unironically... they think they are ""powerful"" and ""real men"" and other shit like that, since they believe themselves to be like that or worse, wish they would be like that, and thats why they vote for that.

Then you have some women that like ""bad boys"" i.e. assholes they think they can ""tame"", when we all know assholes will stay assholes....

Thats sadly how most of reality TV works, the biggest dicks and assholes always win, women and men.

I mean look at Francesca WhatsHerName from Too Hot to Handle on Netflix, she won, when she was not only clearly there for Clout only, but basically fucked over everyone, was a total bitch and basically sold herself for some internet fame... and she still has a huge following because there are too many idiots and lowlifes that love people like that as described above... people are insane."
Taste of Love,"In Australia when it first started the person who usually wins is just a genuine compassionate down to earth person with empathy.

Most have had good positive careers after it and in talk shows and are just good people.

How the fuck do these cunts keep winning now? Is that what people inspire to be like now?"
Taste of Love,"Well, this is the same show that produced Andrew Tate, so‚Ä¶"
Taste of Love,"Didn't watch celebrity big brother but did see him on The Challenge.

He came across as a ""douche with a heart""  

* He would cheat, but be honest that he cheated and show some remorse

* he would lie, but show some remorse for the lie

* he would act tough, but talk about it being a front

* (not a big brother thing but in the challenge he had a string never quite attitude even against much bigger people that made him popular)

On the challenge he played up a character  pretty well.  The bad boy with a heart of gold.  People eat that shit up.

The girl in the video met him on the challenge and ate that shit up.  People love an asshole who looks to have a soft center"
Taste of Love,None of these shows are chosen by the public. It is all decided by marketing and money.
Taste of Love,"This entire genre of media is fucking appalling trash, that's how. Its fans are just as awful."
Taste of Love,Area you trying to rationalize reality TV? Go touch some grass
Taste of Love,People are so ~~stupid.~~ horrible
Taste of Love,Which beckons the question why we‚Äôre giving them more publicity
Taste of Love,He‚Äôll probably be paying that in legal fees.
Taste of Love,Holy shit that guy is huge
Taste of Love,I don't understand anything that happened in this video
Taste of Love,The narcissistic wound in public format
Taste of Love,Lol! Just watched that. What a fucking pussy.
Taste of Love,"Ironically, after all his attempts at appearing Alpha, he looks just like David in Schitt‚Äôs Creek.

‚ÄúEeew, David.‚Äù"
Taste of Love,The Challenge is the show I know him from. Wes and Bananas teaming up for that was hilarious.
Taste of Love,"Ahhhh

Bear from the challenge....

He was fun on the challenge but being a douche on that show won't make you stand out. Pretty much all of them are douches

Him being a little guy who fought with a ton of heart is what got him fans."
Taste of Love,"I haven't got to this season yet, but I've seen Kailah and I hate hearing this. She's someone I hate due to a lot of her actions, but she's so pretty in exactly the way I like with dark hair and tats."
Taste of Love,"In the UK he sadly is. This trial was constantly reported on by our tabloids and even the BBC. 

This guy is a scumbag and should absolutely have no celebrity following, but some people live for following this stuff. See also Chris Brown still selling out tours."
Taste of Love,"The great natural culmination of Big Brother (the UK version anyway) was the blurring of the lines between celebrity and non celebrity Big Brother.   
     
When it started back in the late 90s, it was just some people in a house and you watched them on TV. It was the only reality TV there was. Pre-Facebook world, any ‚Äòsocial media‚Äô that existed was just bored teenagers listing their favorite bands.       
Then the celebrity one was a charity version of ‚Äòall in a house‚Äô only it was people who were known to the public due to being high profile in some form of entertainment (music, acting, sport, comedy, etc.).       
       
Slowly people started to realise that success on reality TV could be the gateway to ‚Äòa career in being famous‚Äô and being on other TV, so more and more people were less ‚Äòjust in a house‚Äô and more trying to achieve notoriety as a springboard to fame.     
And in the celebrity one it became seen as about tacky famewhores and associated with being ‚Äòwashed up‚Äô, so they were increasingly scraping the barrel of who was ‚Äòfamous‚Äô.    
The original meta-culmination of this was when they had a non-celebrity-pretending-to-be-a-c-list-celebrity on celebrity Big Brother, which then naturally made her a celebrity.    
       
But then the third act topped it, as social media became more universal and challenged broadcast TV in importance.      
Now you still have attractive young people who want to be famous (aka the people that go on Big Brother), but if they are serious enough about that to be a good Big Brother contestant, they already have a set of high profile social media accounts with many followers unrelated to their real life. They also likely also interact with similar social media personalities (and date similar) so they can all put it on their social media, etc. They‚Äôre already ‚Äòscene‚Äô if they‚Äôre hungry and importantly attractive enough to become scene, and therefore celebrities.    
       
So by the end both celebrity and non-celebrity versions was an indistinguishable collection of hot 20 something‚Äôs who had already got off with each other for likes and ad revenue on various media platforms. Only the celeb version would also have a washed up American star with poor mental health who needed the money for legal issues thrown in to interact with them.      
     
That‚Äôs the point that it became clear ‚Äòthe kids‚Äô make their own reality-fame these days and it was pointless to broadcast people who constantly broadcast themselves.       
       
Big Brother became a perfect window onto the changing nature of fame."
Taste of Love,"Ohhhh he posted Georgia...from the challenge

They were both fun to watch on the challenge.

(Yes total douche but everyone is a douche or recovering douche on the challenge. It's part of what makes the eliminations so fun)"
Taste of Love,"Hilariously, I‚Äôm pretty sure that the contestants are supposed to be celebrities before joining the show (that is, they aren‚Äôt becoming celebrities because of the show, they are supposed to already be famous). 

Of course, there‚Äôs no way to get a genuine celebrity with a real career to agree to do something like this, so the casting people have to go with a bunch of nobodies anyway. Checking Wikipedia, the people who were on that season are mostly from other reality shows for example."
Taste of Love,"The genre is circular. You are famous by being on reality TV and that feeds back in to the celeb side of reality TV. It just eats itself because no one else wants anything to do with it, because its beyond useless trash."
Taste of Love,"Just hoping this wasn't America's version of Celebrity Big Brother, which only ran opposite the Winter Olympics."
Taste of Love,"I saw him on the challenge.  Charismatic douche

Fit in well on the challenge as they are pretty much all douches or recovering douches."
Taste of Love,"I mean, his onlyfans and twitter is full of videos of him sitting on a huge dildo and fucking himself with objects. Can‚Äôt be more masculine than that!"
Taste of Love,I can't find it
Taste of Love,"If he posted it on his only fans, then it's not public so no it won't be online forever"
I Hear You,Definitely give it a shot.
I Hear You,You should definitely watch at least the first season. In a way it‚Äôs a complete story that really pays off and isn‚Äôt that much of a time commitment and you can decide from there if you want more.
I Hear You,"As everyone said, fantastic show. But, in particular, 407 Proxy Authentication Required in season four is one of the greatest television episodes of all-time, IMO, with a huge payoff. The writing, the performances, everything was perfect."
I Hear You,"Ugh, I want to watch this to the end but I‚Äôve already tried twice (once as it aired and again right around when it was finishing) and life just got in the way. 

I feel like if I watch season 1 again it will be too familiar."
I Hear You,"These questions are so stupid. ""Hey guys this show is widely regarded as one of the best tv shows of all time. Is it good?"""
I Hear You,Mr Robot is one of the few mystery shows that answers every single mystery and satisfyingly so. Watch it.
I Hear You,Not until you've finished your chores!
I Hear You,"""I keep hearing it's one of the best shows ever yet here I am still stupidly asking this question.""

FTFY"
I Hear You,Yes.
I Hear You,"You prefer shows with good writing, good acting and  character development.....?

&#x200B;

FUCKIN WERIDO."
I Hear You,"Severance and Mr. Robot are both among my favorite shows ever made, I would recommend anyone who's a fan of one of those to watch the other.

The thing about nobody in this thread elaborating on what makes this show great is that it's like dissecting a frog: you understand it better but it kills it in the process. Comparing the show to its influences absolutely ruins the plot. I'll lift the veil a teeny tiny bit, but only in spoiler tags.

>!To me, the story unfolding itself in highly unexpected ways, something something unreliable narrator, and the exquisite cinematography really pull you in!<"
I Hear You,"My all time favorite show, I made the mistake of dropping it at the beginning of season 2 after thinking it wasn't nearly exciting as season 1.  Only came back to it years later when I heard people saying that season 4 was even better than season 1, which I had a hard time believing.  Seasons 2 and 3 can be slow at time but they are all necessary to build up to season 4, if you can make it there you won't regret it. Every episode of season 4 is a banger, I consider the best single season of any TV show.  

The Leftovers is probably my second favorite show and while I wouldn't consider the two show similar, they definitely explore some common themes regarding human connection/loneliness."
I Hear You,"Yes 100%. It is a zeitgeist show. In 20 years, someone will ask what was 2017 like. Just watch Mr Robot. It‚Äôs not the plot points or anything like that. It is the style and the tone. Some of the best television ever made."
I Hear You,yes. it is one of the few shows that rewards you handsomely because the whole thing was planned out from start to finish. season 4 has payoff after payoff that was set up YEARS in advance. tbh it's everything TV should be
I Hear You,"If you like Kubrick, then for sure. Esmail loves artistic long shots (in a good way) with heavy and well written dialogue. 

I honestly regard it as one of my top three shows of all time. The other two being Dark and The Wire."
I Hear You,"Based on your favorite shows and your preferences I would say yes. My only caveat would be if someone might be triggered by raw elements like the depiction of mental illness, violence, trauma or if they‚Äôre looking for something that has lighthearted elements to reconsider it.

Edit for clarification: this was the case for me, love the show but when I binged it I found myself to be more anxious because I got an insight on the things I mentioned above even though I can typically handle darker elements."
I Hear You,"Yes, you should watch it."
I Hear You,"It's one of my favorite shows of all time. If you love Severence, there's no way you won't like it."
I Hear You,"I've tried three times to get into it,   I watch the first few episodes and tap out.      The main character is just so unrelatable,  unlikable,  and uninteresting to me....  and I like Rami Malek.      FTR  I loved Severance too."
I Hear You,"I think it was an amazing show.

However, while the show grabs your attention with its initial vigilante hacker plot, the story is fundamentally about the MC making peace with his mental trauma (which is incidentally why people tend to find season 2-3 weaker, since the vigilante hacker stuff takes a bit of a backseat), so if you enjoy great character development, an unreliable narrator (due to mental trauma) that makes you question what's real and what isn't, shrouded with a gripping vigilante hacker story line, then I do recommend this show.

Also, I'm a big fan of all the shows you mentioned (happy to see Le Bureau des L√©gendes get some love), and also a big fan of this one, so take that as you will.

I think the struggle with a lot of people is that while the show starts off as a vigilante hacker story, it starts to focus more on the psychology of the main character, which some people enjoyed less.

The final season is fantastic and the show has probably one of the most satisfying endings I've ever seen."
I Hear You,">I really like shows with great writing, good acting, and character development

You'll get those.

>What I don‚Äôt like is a ton of Flashbacks and OTT visuals, etc.

It has some flashbacks, but they're not a large focus from what I recall.

As for over the top visuals, any examples of what you would consider as such?"
I Hear You,Great show; the cinematography is second to none. I am debating a rewatch.
I Hear You,"It's not the fastest show, but it's one of my favorites. The mystery, the intensity, the characters. I personally never got bored with it. It's such a weird show but not in a bad way. I was curious to see what Elliott did next. I will say season 2 is way weaker though. Wouldn't say bad, just a bit annoying at times."
I Hear You,Just watch it. Everything leads up to an amazing finale.
I Hear You,"I personally loved it. Best shot show in all of television (particularly seasons 3 and 4), takes a lot of risks that have huge payoffs, emotionally satisfying, tense, and the literal best last 5 seconds of any show I've watched. If you like severance there's a very good chance you'll get into Mr robot. It sucks it didn't get the recognition I think it deserves outside of reddit."
I Hear You,"One of the best/satisfying finales in my opinion, whole series is a trip."
I Hear You,"Something real quick I'll add to this conversation. I love Mr. Robot for many reasons, most already listed in this thread. But a certain character that suffers from panic attacks is the only character I've come across the represents them in a way that feels accurate to my own experiences and I freaking love this show for that."
I Hear You,"yes, it is"
I Hear You,It's fine if you like tedious monologues about how people are sheep for drinking Coca Cola
I Hear You,"It‚Äôs a great show.

It‚Äôs not one of my best shows ever but it is definitely one of the best looking shows."
I Hear You,Great show. Hated the ending personally. Some people loved the ending. Worth a watch.
I Hear You,"IMO, it was alright. Way overhyped & pretty meh. Some parts of Season 2 are just cringey, such as the money burning in public and some other parts. Other parts are really great though."
I Hear You,"I normally like shows that Reddit likes and Reddit loves the show, but I hated it. It was so edgelord cringe that I had to stop watching."
I Hear You,"It's remarkable and totally underrated.  The ending is good, too."
I Hear You,Season one was good. But it went off the rails after that.
I Hear You,I thought it was pretty bad. I tried to sit through it because I was bored and sick at home or during lockdown or something. I finally gave up halfway through S2.
I Hear You,"Would definitely recommend. The first season can be a bit cringey in a few parts, specifically the first and last episode. It's a great show overall, season 3 is my favorite season of television. It's also one of the best directed shows I've seen"
I Hear You,I fucking love Mr robot. Go in completely blind. It's better than sopranos breaking bad and the wire imo.
I Hear You,It's good but it gets a little too up its own ass at some point. You can definitely tell when the awards started pouring in and the writers got a little too ambitious for their own good.
I Hear You,"I LOVE Severance. Cannot stand Mr. Robot. 

Personally i hate shows that go all-in on the unreliable narrator. Ret-conning events because the narrator lied does not mean you are being clever, it just means i shouldn‚Äôt trust anything i see, in that case why tf should i care.

I like using a puzzle analogy. A good mystery gives you puzzle pieces but doesn‚Äôt tell you what the picture looks like. You can tell which obvious pieces go together but not exactly what it means, as the story goes on the picture becomes more clear and you get an earned ‚Äúah-ha‚Äù. A bad mystery gives you pieces and the picture but when you start putting it together it flips the board and says ‚Äúhah got you! You‚Äôre so confused right now!‚Äù Then you just sit there staring at a giant mess until they just explain what the puzzle was all along."
I Hear You,"A counterpoint to the popular opinion. I liked the first scene, after that I lost interest pretty rapidly. I forced myself to finish the first season and even started season 2 but it's not a show you can watch while on your phone but because I wasn't engaged I was never giving it my full attention. Its simultaneously confusing with whats actually happening while the season 1 twist is very obvious."
I Hear You,"I mean it‚Äôs good.  I kinda get the feeling it‚Äôs what the boondocks saints was to my generation.

I think everyone would enjoy it more if they didn‚Äôt try to contextualize it with their personal plights.  But ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
I Hear You,It‚Äôs the best show I‚Äôve ever watched. Season 2 can be a bit of a slog but thats because it‚Äôs putting the pieces in place for season 3/4 which absolutely nail it out of the park. If you decide you just can‚Äôt make it through then that‚Äôs fine but you should still check out season 4 episode 7. Perfect filmmaking.
I Hear You,"season 1 is fantastic 

the rest completely miss the mark tho"
I Hear You,"I couldn't stand it. It's initially interesting, but got boring fast."
I Hear You,"Was one of my favorite shows when it was on the air, but I don't think it quite stuck the landing with it's final season. Most people complain about the 2nd season not really having a straightforward plot which didn't bother me at all. But regardless of whether it was that or the death of tv it had really bad ratings for the rest of the series and there were two actors that were probably not included in the last season for issues that happened off set that I haven't seen any coverage of even a comment from Sam Esmail or Rami Malek about."
I Hear You,Season 1 was probably the best series I ever saw- season 2 lost me
I Hear You,Started watching it. Guessed a big reveal about 2 episodes in. Checked to confirm if I was right and I was so I called it there.
I Hear You,"Familiarize yourself with Linux, and give it a season 

Once you see White Rose storylines, , give up."
I Hear You,"I enjoyed the ride and it was certainly pretty unique. It gets a little too convoluted which hinders the storytelling and not all the twists land as hard as they could.
I don't know if it ever is as purely fun as that first episode but it gets pretty close.
But worth the watch for sure."
I Hear You,"Mr. Robot is great, just be warned it's not happy in the slightest, as in ""we'll give you a puppy dog, shoot it in front of you, and then immediately move on like it never happened to rob you of the grieving process,"" type not happy. Not to mention all characters are fundamentally lonely and/or desperate to their core which doesn't make things any better. As a work of art and as a story the show is amazing, but just make sure you're in a good space before watching it.

I made the mistake of watching it right when the pandemic started. I was like ""Wow, the school I work is closed down, now I have time to catch up on all the shows I've been wanting to watch,"" and it really didn't do much good for my emotional state during that time."
I Hear You,If you can stand the main character (which I personally have a really hard time doing) it's worth a watch
I Hear You,"It's not bad, but not even close to being one of the 'best shows ever'."
I Hear You,"If you take your time with the show, there's so many rabbit holes and easter eggs in subreddit discussions. Just search by season and episode like S1E01 or S01E01.  


**There are no spoilers**, but the one I think about all the time is that the creator rendered an image as a sound at the beginning of a really intense episode. The image was the ""Hang in There Baby"" cat image. A fan's boyfriend was an audio engineer and immediately recognized what the sound was, and processed the audio back into an image.  


""There was a strange squiggly noise at the beginning of this episode. My boyfriend is an audio engineer and knew right away that it was the sound of an image being rendered as audio. He grabbed the audio and processed it and found the ""Hang in there baby"" cat. But what does it mean?"""
I Hear You,"Definitely. The story can get really confusing sometimes with all the subplots, but the atmosphere, acting, twists and the big reveal at the end are absolutely phenomenal."
I Hear You,I tried but it was so slow and boring as shit.
I Hear You,"Why are you seeking Reddit's opinion? If you're interested,  give it another chance!"
I Hear You,"yes, but the depressing outlook is contagious."
I Hear You,Absolutely. It‚Äôs one of the greatest shows ever done. S2 is generally regarded as the weakest but press on.
I Hear You,I binged a season or two of it. But it just got too weird for me so I dropped it.
I Hear You,"Sam Esmail knows what he's doing. This show has it all: killer cinematography, a superb soundtrack and score, delicious acting from amazing actors, a plot that hooks you from the start, memorable characters, innovative visual storytelling, a satisfying ending and incredible social commentary. Mr. Robot knew what it wanted to do and ran away with it. There is some growing pains on season 2 because season 1 was the buzziest show of the season, but the show is very good. One of my favorites."
I Hear You,"Yes dude! I had a completely similar experience. I watched the first few episodes back when the show was fresh and it kinda didn‚Äôt grab me. Also a lack of attention probably.

Then last year I gave it another try and wow. It is one of my TOP series of all time. It‚Äôs amazing."
I Hear You,"Mr Robot overall was a good show with moments of absolute brilliance and a slow start.  It was worth watching, though personally I think its a little overrated.  Particularly on this sub."
I Hear You,If you want to watch the performance that made a virtual unknown one of the most lauded actors in the world then yeh
I Hear You,Second season is a bit weaker but overall it is a great ride with some episodes being the best stuff made on TV.
I Hear You,It's a great show in my opinion due to the complexity of the characters and strong overall writing. As long as you don't long up the plot you'll definitely won't see some of the plot twist. Also by and large pretty accurate depiction of hacking and hacking methods. I would also mention that it's not a feel good show ie you'll feel the stress the characters go through.
I Hear You,Does it have less mistakes than Breaking Bad? No. Is it better? I think so. Cinematography and music are better than anywhere I can remember. It has a perfect one shot episode in season 3. It has a perfect silent episode in season 4. There's 407 which is probably the best episode on TV ever. Season 4 overall was amazing.
I Hear You,Why do you think it‚Äôs so good?
I Hear You,What makes it so good for you
I Hear You,"I recommend starting from the beginning. First season lets you familiarise with the world,  the characters and ends in an optimistic place. Season 2 is when I feel the show stops holding your hand and trusts you enough to go darker and weirder."
I Hear You,"And guy really wants to be convinced in the comments, lmao. Just use this time to watch the first episode, which is a very good pilot."
I Hear You,"tbf, reddit gigapraises the leftovers and to me it is not that good at all.

at a lot of times it made me go ""really? this is so stupid"" like when i was watching season 7-8 of TWD

im fully prepared for the downvotes."
I Hear You,LOL Ok. Didn‚Äôt ask if it was good. Asked if I should watch it based on my preferences. Completely different question
I Hear You,"That‚Äôs my first thought, like, just start the show, watch a few episodes and then you‚Äôll decide if the show is for you, I could understand this question regarding video games cause you have to buy them, but movies or TV show, it‚Äôs just silly"
I Hear You,*Tyrell Wellick has entered the chat*
I Hear You,agreed. Sam Esmail planned the whole thing out meticulously from the start
I Hear You,"I really don't know how people were satisfied with how White Rose and The Dark Army plot resolved. After spending so much time on White Rose outmaneuvering every other major player in the show, it was insanely disappointing to have her arc and the mysteries surrounding her plan to be answered with essentially that she's just crazy.

Elliot's personal trauma and how his mental health felt like it had been planned from the start, and was a very satisfying wrap up. E-Corp, White Rose and a lot of the mysteries felt like they never had a plan behind them."
I Hear You,">level 1Mnemosense ¬∑ 1 hr. agoMr Robot is one of the few mystery shows that answers every single mystery 

I don't think it's necessarily a good thing for all questions to be answered. It's best that some questions be left unanswered. See The Leftovers."
I Hear You,I‚Äôve heard ppl say The Walking Dead is one of the best shows ever & I hate it. So what‚Äôs your point? Lol
I Hear You,"That's it. It laid out mysteries through its run and it manages to answer many of them, while leaving others unanswered but that don't feel frustrating."
I Hear You,Counterpoint: It *is* one of the best shows ever.
I Hear You,I thought it was one of the worst endings I've seen. It felt like a cheesy cop-out to me. But I seem to be the minority on that opinion.
I Hear You,"Yeah I said in another comment seasons 2 & 3 really detracted from the series overall. If I could I'd condense the series into 2 seasons. There's a good story tucked away, it just gets dragged out way too long."
I Hear You,"I tried to watch it twice, once alone and once with my gf (she was also trying a rewatch). We both enjoyed season 1 and couldn't remember why we stopped watching independently of each other. The season 2 happened...  We had to keep pausing because it was killing our spirits..  Eventually we quit. I'm sorry, but if I need to slog though hours of boredom just to enjoy the later parts of your show, it's not a good show. I won't be attempting a third rewatch to finish"
I Hear You,"Maybe I'm misremembering here, but I'm pretty sure it only seriously retcons one thing and that one thing is possibly the greatest twist in the history of television. Mainly because it's something we all should have seen coming and was right in front of our noses the entire time, but nobody actually figured it out. That's the mark of an excellent twist."
I Hear You,"Great writing with a lot of different plot twists, they're actually correct with their tech, and it's just a good show overall. 

I was hooked from the first scene and spent a week binge watching the entire series during the first lockdown."
I Hear You,"Some of the best cinematography I've come across in a TV show. Even ignoring the great characters, acting, music, and story, it brings me joy just seeing the amount of creativity and passion put into the camera framing and movements."
I Hear You,"It's a show that seems to be about a very narrow topic at the beginning, but progresses to be about almost EVERYTHING. Even characters that are introduced as flat stereotypes are rounded out into complex humans trying to do the best they can, and the show explores big questions about the various crises of the modern age and what we as individuals can really do about them, if anything.

It's one of the rare shows where each episode builds on all the ones before to become even more thought-provoking."
I Hear You,Don't ask or read more about it. It fits with your favorites but knowing less is better for the full ride.
I Hear You,Very suspenseful and it felt like each episode had a distinct climax which kept my attention
I Hear You,"Not OP but I'll give you a break down of my thoughts on what makes it good:

1) Narrative format. Elliot ""breaks the fourth wall"" by speaking to the audience in voice overs, which results in some interesting dynamics and plays an important part in both the plot and his character development. It's probably one of the most effective uses in voice over narrative in TV since Wonder Years.

2) Direction. The direction of the show is just unique and also very effective. The camera shots, framing, angles, are all used to help influence our views, feelings towards characters, and understanding of what's happening. After season 1 there are some very well done scenes that make use of long shots and revealing of scenes as things unfold on and off camera.

3) Characters. Like Sopranos, these characters are treated very much like real people. They get into crazy situations and it *effects them*. We see how it effects them over time. They change, their relationships and dynamics to one another change, and all of this effects their choices and the larger plot. It's a psychological show, with a psychologist as an occasional character (like Sopranos), so it takes into consideration how the psyches of people work. And there are some *fascinating* characters, some who aren't even main characters, and they all have complicated depth.

4) Plot and story. Mr. Robot is a show that moves forward while still returning to past effects. The plot develops with each season, though season 2 is a little more character focused, and it kind of just keeps unfolding. But, essentially, the plot and story is all really about Elliot and Mr. Robot, which is why 1, 2, and 3 of my list here are handled so carefully. It needs those elements to work well for its story to be good. And so there's an attention to all of it that helps it become a well crafted story.

Overall, it's good TV because it's aware of its medium and craft and how to use those effectively. This also makes it a bit too ""pretentious"" for some, because it very much is trying to make an art out of it, it's aware of what it's doing. That's not for everyone. But I think if you enjoy character driven stories it's still good even if it feels a little too meta or pretentious at times.

It does use similar fantasy scenarios as Sopranos, where it delves into the mind of the protagonist like we do with Tony, but it really pushes on that farther and takes it up several notches. That can be too much for people when it happens, but it's not every episode either.

Anyway, that's what I think makes it good. It's firing on all cylinders and fits the genres I like. But your own tastes may differ."
I Hear You,"It pulls you in harder than just about any show I've watched. It keeps you on the edge of your seat for almost the entire series, kind of like breaking bad but much more engaging and fast paced. And it doesn't even have a massive buildup, it hooks you from the first scene and will keep you guessing the whole time."
I Hear You,Control is just an illusion!
I Hear You,"I agree with the OP. Season 1 was a thrill to watch. Personally seasons 2 and 3 get progressively worse, I'd call them boring and rudderless. Season 4, the final season has a lot of payoffs but I honestly don't know if it's worth it getting to that point slogging through the rest of the story. 

That being said all the characters feel very human. They're not simply plot elements, even the side characters. Everyone reacts according to their own beliefs and characteristics. There are consequences, intrigue and hidden agendas behind every action. At times the intrigue goes a little too deep as you can tell the writers got a little over their heads at times. 

It's really hard to say much about the series as it's kind of chock full of spoilers, though. Even making comparisons to other media feels a bit too leading. You really need to go into this show with blinders on. Just watching the first 15 minutes should give you a good feel for the vibe of the rest of the season though."
I Hear You,This is what I'm saying. How is spending all this time thinking about consuming media or shitting on media you haven't watched productive? Is your life just not meaningful on its own? Watch the thing and move on. Or don't watch the thing and move on.
I Hear You,You‚Äôre putting more effort into a Reddit post about watching it than it would be to just watch it.
I Hear You,People like different things though. I absolutely love some of your preference and don‚Äôt like others.  Only way to know whether you‚Äôll like the show is to check it out. There‚Äôs a chance you will like it but only you would know for sure.
I Hear You,Based on your preferences I'd say it's a MORE THAN definite yes.
I Hear You,"If you like hacking, unreliable narrators, thrillers, twists with payoff and breathtaking cinematography then yes you should watch it. The show doesn‚Äôt hold your hand though you do have to pay attention to it."

In the Bosom of a Thorn,"and that is why i dislike religion so much. because the people that are in religions are mostly weak minded people and they are easy prey for the ones in power.

also for any rape victim. i ask you this. would you feel more safe when the rapist is dead, or still alive and knowing he will eventually come out of jail?"
In the Bosom of a Thorn,"I tried to watch this documentary, but to me they also used the victims to sell their documentary.  The doc used full footage of the victims naked and did not blur out an parts. It just felt like re-taking advantage of women that were brain washed and cult abused. I had to end it."
In the Bosom of a Thorn,Is this a good documentary? I added it to my list because I've never watched a documentary in another language and I watched so many KDramas.
In the Bosom of a Thorn,Cool now do the Catholics of America
In the Bosom of a Thorn,The only thing crazier than Korean Catholicism is American evangelism.
In the Bosom of a Thorn,Do jehovah's witnesses next
In the Bosom of a Thorn,Religious people be like: ‚Äúcome to our church so we can molest u‚Äù
In the Bosom of a Thorn,IMHO I can‚Äôt wait for all organized religion to die‚Ä¶. The harm it‚Äôs caused far outweighs any good.
In the Bosom of a Thorn,Why are Koreans so prone to cults?? I can kindda see why the Chinese government ban religious cults the likes of falungong from arising.
In the Bosom of a Thorn,Don't have religion where you idolize the leaders. Having religion could even apply to those who claim to believe in science. The scientific methodology is one where you test to determine if a hypothesis is false or not false. Because it isn't false doesn't make it true. Science is akin to forever chipping away at a slab of marble to determine the sculpture underneath. True science can only determine correlation and not causality. Statements of absolute causality are not statements of science but of religion.
In the Bosom of a Thorn,Will this involves the moonies?
In the Bosom of a Thorn,Every single religion has coverups rarely do they self report!
In the Bosom of a Thorn,All religions are a sex and money scam. Every single one.
In the Bosom of a Thorn,Anywhere else to watch it? Canceled Netflix due to the new password restrictions
In the Bosom of a Thorn,"Cool.

Now do Evangelicals in the US.

EDIT: To be clear, I think this is a great documentary and I'm glad they won the right to air it.  I'm saying I'd like to see this trend of exposing gross religious organizations by documentaries funded and platformed by major media companies continue on."
In the Bosom of a Thorn,Unrelated to the film itself but I wish it had either been titled *In the Name of God* or *A Holy Betrayal*.
In the Bosom of a Thorn,Man Koreans are not gonna like this one lmao
In the Bosom of a Thorn,how about a documentary on american religious leaders?
In the Bosom of a Thorn,If any of those guys are gay they are probably only into white guys
In the Bosom of a Thorn,"How about sticking it to Scientology? Or the fundamentalist Mormons, et al. I don‚Äôt care about some ‚Äúleaders‚Äù in Korea. Go after the predators at home and I might be impressed."
In the Bosom of a Thorn,Netflix sucks haha
In the Bosom of a Thorn,[removed]
In the Bosom of a Thorn,"Good news, for sure, though I started watching this earlier this week and the production struck me as super odd. Might be a cultural thing, but the set design and editing is incongruous given the subject matter. 

Disclaimer: I only watched the first 15 mins of the opening episode."
In the Bosom of a Thorn,"Religion doing what religion does.  But people want to be lied to, so on it goes."
In the Bosom of a Thorn,The world is really fucked up.
In the Bosom of a Thorn,">3rd March

btw"
In the Bosom of a Thorn,"Yep. Was part of this cult before here in one their American branch and knew they we‚Äôre sketch since the beginning. Definitely members would manipulate to ‚Äúevangelize‚Äù people. It‚Äôs flat out sad how many people are brainwashed and devoted to this cult and the leader. Insiders think that the media is just persecuting him and acting as a ‚Äúdevil‚Äù to bring down the ‚Äúwill of God‚Äù. His 10 years of imprisonment acts as Jesus dying on the cross to save us from our sins. His sermons are so boring and majority of the time, he just talks about himself."
In the Bosom of a Thorn,"LPT: don't join cults, especially ones where the leader claims to be be God or claims to be speaking for God. Actually, just don't join any fucking cults."
In the Bosom of a Thorn,"Oh some one sued to stop it. I wouldn't have watched it otherwise but now, straight on to the list."
In the Bosom of a Thorn,Seriously though. Are there any NON religious sex cults?
In the Bosom of a Thorn,I hope this series continues to expose more cults in Korea.
In the Bosom of a Thorn,"I just want to ask if anyone else felt like this was fake or dramatized when first watching it? 

Not trying to be offensive because I watch sooo much true crime, something about this felt a bit staged (the interview, having the victim play an iPad video, film stalkers outside a hotel). I just didn‚Äôt want to get duped with a horrific story but being told by actors. Again, I am not saying the story isn‚Äôt true - it‚Äôs disgusting and I fucking hate religion. I especially seek out religious docs as I was brainwashed southern baptist as a kid. I hate to hear these stories! 

Just a vibe and didn‚Äôt see anyone else mention it."
In the Bosom of a Thorn,"r/Shincheonji_Korea
It‚Äôs a place to discuss about cults in Korea including JMS"
In the Bosom of a Thorn,"I still don't understand why the mother in episode 6 ""Baby Garden of Death"" didn't say her son was murdered in court, and still stuck to his heart failing? What was the point when the case had gotten that far and lied just to hate herself and wish death upon herself everyday? Did I miss something?"
In the Bosom of a Thorn,"After having just read the Pope John Paul II and the sex abuse cover-ups, I was really hoping it would be the Catholic Church."
In the Bosom of a Thorn,I would subscribe to a series where they did an in depth dive into every sect. If they find no evidence of a particular group they name drop them. I guess that would be an evolving form of journalism.
In the Bosom of a Thorn,"I say, do the USA next!"
In the Bosom of a Thorn,I know its a messed up system there and you only get real time if you dont have money in korea
In the Bosom of a Thorn,"religion is the only part of society that coddles adults for submitting their critical faculties to a cult and wailing on about how more important their imaginary stories are than anything else going on in the objective reality we share. And you wonder how this hasn't been a magnet and cesspool for literal millenia, grifting entire societies for private ""sacred"" time with the children of the community, huddled around a bunch of decrepit old perverts.  Theism is child abuse, pure and simple. You want to con junkies and people who are at the bottom of their lives and have had all their defenses beaten out of them? That's one thing. Indoctrinating children before they've developed any cognitive defenses against shitty iron-aged emotional injunctions can fuck. right. off."
In the Bosom of a Thorn,Reminds me of ‚Äúsilenced‚Äù about the sexual abuse and Kentucky sentences at a Korean school for the deaf.
In the Bosom of a Thorn,Do they have any history of this sort of thing?
In the Bosom of a Thorn,"Even though some viewers criticized JMS episodes for being too explicit, but in fact, those episodes were somewhat censored by the production team themselves. According to the director of the series, what was captured in those first three episodes was only about a tenth of what the victims actually suffered.


He said one of the reasons they brought the project to Netflix was to expose reality of those crimes. But even for Netflix, he had to watered down description of sexual assaults of JMS cause it was too upsetting for the viewers. Some of crew memebers suffered traumas for days after covering the case he said."
In the Bosom of a Thorn,"The first thing you hear in the documentary is an audio recording of a rape in mid-intercourse, with some old man voice asking if the victim had an orgasm.  I did see the first minute or so of the interview, but I decided I didn't really want to see how far it was going to go after that."
In the Bosom of a Thorn,"I was kind shocked they showed video of nude girls with blurred faces and unblurred bodies right after the stories of how he was raping teenagers. Aside from not being sure how old any of those girls were, it seems extremely exploitative of Netflix to just expose that to the public. It's fresh victimization even if only a handful of people know who they are."
In the Bosom of a Thorn,"I have friends who turned to them and haven't heard from them in years. After joining they only ever wanted to hang out with me at their church events -> indoctrinate me.

Oddly enough they also said that Catholicism was satan or something. I also remember them believing that the end of the world is soon."
In the Bosom of a Thorn,"I dated a woman for a short time who was a member of one of these cults in CA, only I didn't know it until I looked up the name of her ""pastor.""

Her ideas about certain things were just bizarre and didn't make sense with my understanding of most sects of Christianity."
In the Bosom of a Thorn,i did too! weird way to grow up eh! there were some good times though. i think about the people a lot.
In the Bosom of a Thorn,Midnight Mass on Netflix was a documentary üòå
In the Bosom of a Thorn,"You will find predators in every system, willing and able to abuse their power dynamics."
In the Bosom of a Thorn,"Religion is just a medium.  You can look at all the things that happened in Hollywood, that have nothing to do with religion to see that all it takes is generic promises from someone who appears to hold power to get some people to do things.

This isn't excusing people using religion in such a manner, just showing that religion is method, not the base reason these things happen."
In the Bosom of a Thorn,"its literally built off that. The entire premise is that you must believe something without evidence, without understanding even. simple blind faith is required at the root of every religion.

anyone willing to believe in that is obv going to be more susceptible to other ideas with no proof, esp when they believe these orders are coming from God. Even easier if you can justify any of your ideas with weird interpretations of a text like the bible. And once you get some believers, their entire families usually get brought in"
In the Bosom of a Thorn,"For real. Over the last 10 years I've noticed more and more how awful religions can be. People use this *coughChristianscough* as an excuse to do awful and hateful things. I get it that not all religious folks are bad, but it's difficult to not be jaded."
In the Bosom of a Thorn,An extra pernicious part is how religion will make a point to call the parts of you they use to exploit as a ‚Äúvirtue‚Äù
In the Bosom of a Thorn,"Reminds me of Tool‚Äôs song, ‚ÄòOpiate‚Äô"
In the Bosom of a Thorn,If anyone prefaces their morality with religion.  There is zero morality.
In the Bosom of a Thorn,Name?
In the Bosom of a Thorn,Is this related to the unity Church?
In the Bosom of a Thorn,"You can change it to Korean audio with subtitles, but yeah it's annoying because then any English audio will be in Korean if there is any."
In the Bosom of a Thorn,just put the CC on then
In the Bosom of a Thorn,"You can change this in the audio settings, FYI."
In the Bosom of a Thorn,"I can‚Äôt do any dubbing. I have tried but when I see the words not line up with the mouth, my brain just cringes and I have to turn it off"
In the Bosom of a Thorn,That‚Äôs what I want to know! So many and so similar around the same time!
In the Bosom of a Thorn,Saying JMS and those cults are Christianity is like saying Trump is a far left liberal.
In the Bosom of a Thorn,Conformist societies fall easy prey to this kind of crap (see MLM schemes)
In the Bosom of a Thorn,"You'd assume, but no. Smaller, more modern ones. 

I wouldn't be too surprised if Netflix did try to do something on the Moonies and ended up being much more hamstrung than this."
In the Bosom of a Thorn,I feel so sick watching the former victim reliving the scene where she waved mops to jms. This documentary weirdly focuses on male gaze
In the Bosom of a Thorn,Its a good documentary  but its pretty hard to watch. The first 5 min of the 1st episode has a sound recording of a rape. It gets pretty gory too.
In the Bosom of a Thorn,"Pentacostals too. I've only heard testimonials from friends who have left churches of those denominations, but they definitely had wild experiences"
In the Bosom of a Thorn,Then do a series. All American religions.
In the Bosom of a Thorn,Organized religion is sinister sh!t.
In the Bosom of a Thorn,"Or that Koreans are much better about reporting cults, rather than trying to hide shit?"
In the Bosom of a Thorn,Do you think Chinese have freedom to make such documentary?
In the Bosom of a Thorn,üôÉ
In the Bosom of a Thorn,Well it‚Äôs made by Netflix so I‚Äôm gonna assume no
In the Bosom of a Thorn,You showed them.
In the Bosom of a Thorn,"*Keep Sweet, Pray, and Obey* and *the Keepers* are both pretty interesting"
In the Bosom of a Thorn,"Give Jesus Camp a watch if you haven‚Äôt already, gave me some un-invited flashbacks."
In the Bosom of a Thorn,"Dude, delete this. There are tons of documentaries on US evangelicals and the shit they get into.  This just shows you're too lazy to look before posting."
In the Bosom of a Thorn,The only problem with that is that its too many documentaries too little time to make them. They already have a small mountain. The supply overtakes production regardless of demand.
In the Bosom of a Thorn,There's actually a ton of them.
The Outsiders,"Oh yeah it was gorgeous to watch, and not just the scenery. The atmosphere was so good, the tension so strong, every scene left you feeling exactly as it should do.

Plus it had a really good cast, especially Ben Mendelsohn, Bill Camp and Cynthia Erivo (I know its been said many times before, but damn she was awesome), really the whole mini-series exceeded my expectations and I'm something of a King fan."
The Outsiders,Loved that show. The music was incredible as well.
The Outsiders,"Sometimes it got a bit slow, but the visuals kept me hooked the whole time."
The Outsiders,"Absolutely loved that final shot of one of the last episodes where Ralph is nodding like ""okay...this is really real..this is happening"" as he looked over at Holly.

The music and scene really got me hyped, then the little ""the series so far"" kind of trailer cut they did for the finale/ending episode was really well done."
The Outsiders,"I think the cinematography falls off a cliff kinda after episode 4 or 5. There a scene where she‚Äôs in the bathtub and they are just quick cutting and shit trying to create an almost jump scare inducing environment. This is done while she is just googling scary photos lmao. 

The whole last episode with the characters being pinned down by the gun fire from the cop on the rock is shot and edited so poorly too especially when he gets bit by the snake"
The Outsiders,Really? I couldn‚Äôt get past the fact that every other damn shot was out of focus
The Outsiders,I loved Bill Camp in everything and I liked him here but Mendelsohn and Ervio were fantastic. I will also say Mare Winningham was fantastic as well.
The Outsiders,"The gun fight was definitely confusing, I couldn't work out where everyone was, who was in cover, etc."
The Outsiders,"Oh yeah I agree, she really was.

She certainly gave a lot to that role."
The Outsiders,You went to cinema
The Outsiders,Saw it last night.  Looks like a winner.  I have XFINITY with 2000 channels and it annoys me that WGN has no HD channel.  What's up with that?!
The Outsiders,"Salem, Manhattan, WGN has been in this business for a while.

Other than that, sure, Outsiders is very much worth watching.  A darker Justified without any of the light humor touches.  Fantastically well acted, scripted, and filmed.  It is awfully good,  Could have done without the Farrell's Pigeon English, a heavy Kentucky accent would have been more than enough, frankly the constant need to try and translate is distracting."
The Outsiders,WGN's first original series was Salem. Manhattan was second. This is their third original. Just an fyi.
The Outsiders,They also produce Salem so this is their third venture into original scripted programming
The Outsiders,"Oh yeah, I saw commercials for this and thought it looked pretty good. I forgot it started this week, but luckily WGN plays repeats of their shows pretty often, so I should be able to catch it soon."
The Outsiders,The Pilot was great and I had no idea WGN was still on the air. 
The Outsiders,"You lost me at spoiler free thoughts.  Seriously, I don't get the fanaticism that people have with that topic."
The Outsiders,"I read your comment before watching the show, and it just made certain things stick out like a sore thumb, that much worse. Overall i enjoyed it, but the last 15 mins had some ridiculously dumb stuff happen that I can let slide once, but probably wouldn't keep watching if the show consistently had things like it happen."
The Outsiders,"Damn man, that's awesome.  Where did you guys film?  I was thinking Georgia but I couldn't pin it down."
The Outsiders,"Damn, that's a bummer.  I'm on Verizon and they have a HD channel here so I'm not sure what to tell you.  Glad you liked it though!  A lot of times, pilots start of very shaky before finding there footing but this show knew what it was doing and came across very confidently.  Great acting, direction and cinematography.  I loved the bluegrass too.  It just felt very sure of itself.  Which I imagine, is a credit to the veteran crew working on it.  
In that way it reminded me a lot of The Wire's pilot which also felt like you were being tossed into this universe with it's own dialect and hierarchy and you were left to figure it out because things are already happening from the first minute."
The Outsiders,For a while means two years. Still infancy for a network that is technically not a full time network. I believe it's still considered a superstation. Meaning it's a regional station (Chicago) that is broadcast nationwide. 90% of its programming is syndicated reruns of other networks shows and Cubs games. 
The Outsiders,"I think he meant that it was the one that is going to put them on the map, like what Mr. Robot did for USA network. Or what The 100 has done for CW perhaps, you get the idea though."
The Outsiders,"Huh?  It's a brand new show, the pilot aired 24 hours ago, I felt it was better to give people a chance to see it for themselves before opening up a discussion and ruining for others.  Why do you take issue with that?"
The Outsiders,
The Outsiders,"The bluegrass, yes.  They don't know how to read or write but they sure do know how to hook up a home made electric guitar made out of a cigar box to a car battery and rock out ZZ Top style."
The Outsiders,"It's not a pilot. WGN doesn't do pilots. They do direct to series. That means they didn't even have a typical pilot process where you shoot it, evaluate it, reshoot scenes, maybe even recast parts... If anything I think the episode was solid but was missing a lot of small beats or connective tissue that would have made it excellent. That's the risk you run when you don't have time to fix stuff. You're already shooting episode two at that point. "
The Outsiders,"Yeah, this is kind of what I meant.  Thank you.  I know it isn't literally their first show, the same way Mr. Robot wasn't USA's first show.  Still though, I should've chosen my words better.  "
The Outsiders,How did Mr Robot put USA on the map? Because it's the best show they've had so far? USA has been around for a long time. 
The Outsiders,Huh?  Do you have a link for any of that?  How does the show get greenlit? A sizzle reel?  Isn't the first episode still a pilot episode?  I've also never heard of a network going back to reshoot scenes from a pilot or recasting parts.  
The Outsiders,"> USA has been around for a long time.

Not only that, USA is consistently ranked one of the top cable networks in viewers. USA was on the map long before Mr. Robot."
The Outsiders,"Game of Thrones pilot was directed by Tom McCarthy (Spotlight) and it was such a mess they had to recast key roles (Emilia Clarke and Michele Fairley replaced the original Catelyn and Daenerys) and reshoot half of the pilot with Tim Van Patten. That's an extreme and well known instance, but it's far from the only one. Had they been on a network with a more traditional schedule and gone direct to series, they would not have had the time to fix all that stuff and would have been stuck with a terrible first episode. It's my personal feeling that Manhattan and Outsiders (and maybe Underground) all suffered a bit from going direct to series, it really just accelerates everything. And yes they do use sizzle reels, the creator of Outsiders did one and now everyone that gets picked up for development at WGN has to do one. We just did one, although we are fighting hard to go to pilot and not series."
The Outsiders,Perhaps they are just on a better map now?
The Outsiders,"I've done a couple, I mean I've worked on, not been the creator of.  But what's the benefit as a show runner to go to pilot first?  Is it more like betting on the strength of your show in the short term vs getting a lower outright deal in going right to series?  Thanks for the explanation though.  "
The Outsiders,"To be honest going direct to series is considered more exciting because going to pilot still means you might not make it to air. If a network is making a direct to series order then your show is going on, barring some monumental disaster. If going straight to series it's common to get a green light and then set up a writers room before shooting the pilot script. They'll want scripts for several episodes in shape to shoot before going into production at all. It's become more common in the last couple years. The thinking by networks/studios is that if they are going to make a financial commitment they'd rather be much pickier about what hey acquire in the first place. Instead of developing twenty shows and ordering pilots for six or seven, they'll develop two or three and then give a series green light to the one they like the most. "
The Outsiders,"Right. That makes sense, so why would you push for a pilot in this day and age when it's still not a guarantee to get an order, wouldn't you want to get a direct to series order?  "
The Outsiders,"Because we want to make the best show possible. 

EDIT: Love Reddit, where you get down voted for literally nothing."
The Outsiders,if you've seen the beginning you've seen the end
The Outsiders,Honestly in 2 seasons I feel like the plot didn't go anywhere. 
The Outsiders,Outsiders like the book The Outsiders?
The Outsiders,The first season is amazing. Loved the ending.
The Outsiders,"I know this is an old post but have you finished both seasons? I'm sad they cancelled it after season 2... it's one of the best shows I've seen in a while, one of my reasons being the concept is extremely unique. Also Kyle Gallner is hot haha."
The Outsiders,http://m.imdb.com/title/tt4816626/
The Outsiders,"nope, I actually went on IMDB to check cuz I thought the same lmao"
The Outsiders,I can't wait to see what is going to happen. I haven't heard anything about a season 2. I'm hopeful.
The Outsiders,"Fantastic show, wish they had kept it going. It‚Äôs been a while but finished both seasons and felt they ended on a high point."
The Outsiders,Thanks 
The Outsiders,I really enjoyed the first half of the season but it really fizzles out by the end. If they‚Äôd trimmed it by a couple episodes it would‚Äôve been great.
The Outsiders,"To me, it felt like a really long episode of The X-Files, and while it definitely started stronger than it ended, I enjoyed it the whole way through."
The Outsiders,"Great show.   Without spoiling too much, something big happens early and they fail to match that sort of epicness later on."
The Outsiders,"It‚Äôs good, but I got super frustrated when they literally did the exact same episode like 4 or 5 times in a row."
The Outsiders,Ugh I hated this. It was two amazing episodes and then a whole bunch of nothing.
The Outsiders,I will never understand the hype for this show. First two episodes were great after that you have some meandering middle episode finished off by a lackluster finale. I mean el cucuy seriously?!
The Outsiders,"Man, I thought this show *sucked.* Had about three episodes worth of story. Shit ending."
The Outsiders,"Wasn't a fan at all. One of the worst shows to come out of HBO recently IMO. Like most people said, first two episodes were pretty solid but the rest is a big yikes from me."
The Outsiders,"Just me, I far preferred *Mr. Mercedes* (Peacock), which adapts the Stephen King Bill Hodges trilogy, over *The Outsider.*  It's also where Holly Gibney originated as a character."
The Outsiders,"It was OK

The first couple of episodes were great, I was enjoying

The middle was pretty boring, can't  remember which episodes exactly but about ep3-ep7 were boring and just dissapointing as well

The last couple episodes were good enough

It's fine for a one time watch but I wouldn't watch it again and it's not a show I would recommend to people

Ben Mendhleson is great BTW, love him in Bloodline

Also it's a shame Jason Bateman wasn't there for longer because he is great as well"
The Outsiders,"That's... honestly extremely surprising. I thought it had a very promising beginning, but took a sharp turn for the worse from the first or second episode and had a miserably bad ending. It really isn't worth people's time, in my opinion. It's probably the worst HBO show I've seen, by some distance."

The Outsiders,ùêºùë°'ùë† ùë†ùëú ùë°ùëüùëñùëùùëùùë¶
The Outsiders,Good to hear. It is on my watch list. I think I will have to watch it next
The Outsiders,"Mendelsohn really should get more leading roles.  The Outsider was great, like a long arc of good, creepy X Files episodes."
The Outsiders,I just finished the whole show today. Man it was definitely one of the best shows ever made!
The Outsiders,Ending was hot shit tho
The Outsiders,I dropped it after 3 episodes and never looked back.
The Outsiders,"The first few episodes are fantastic, but it goes a bit off the rails. Mare Winningham is also great."
The Outsiders,Show falls off a huge cliff after episode 2 and never recovers
The Outsiders,Was not a miniseries. It was an ongoing series that got canned after the first season. A real shame.
The Outsiders,"I felt that it was a great show, until the last episode or two."
The Outsiders,"How had you not heard of it?

It was everywhere for quite some time."
The Outsiders,"I watched it, but it really felt like it was missing something. Although I feel that way about a lot of Stephen King stuff"
The Outsiders,How dare they hook me in with two great episodes and make me watch eight episodes of nothing after that?
The Outsiders,"The first two episodes are great, then it started going downhill and was damn near unwatchable by the end."
The Outsiders,"Well, Stephen King is famous for disappointing endings‚Ä¶"
The Outsiders,"That's kinda like everything Stephen king does imo.

Amazing world building but lack luster endings.  I think the only film based on his works I liked is the mist and that's because the director changed the ending


I had to Google if ""from"" was done based off his work so I would know how interested I should be on the series"
The Outsiders,"The book was the same, first half amazing and the ending disappointing and boring.

Edit: the ending was rushed too. One moment it feels like the story is going to a new place but it abruptly ends instead."
The Outsiders,My thought too. 2-3 episodes too long.
The Outsiders,Same. Last 2 episodes were when it got worse in my opinion.
The Outsiders,"The last two episodes were a bit slow and blah. Other than that, it's one of the best shows ever made"
The Outsiders,"I didn't think the show was trying to match that epicness, but instead unravel it."
The Outsiders,Unfortunately yes. Cast good but kind of petered out.
The Outsiders,"I dunno, the ending of the penultimate episode knocked me off my ass."
The Outsiders,I wanted to see the trial. I found that to be the most potentially interesting question the show posed.
The Outsiders,"I know exactly what you're meaning, and I'm soooo fucking mad at how early that was. It was a pivotal event that was nearly halfway through the book, and should have focused more on the investigative side of things."
The Outsiders,"What, you're not a fan of two characters driving somewhere while giving increasingly longer monologues about what amounts to nothing?"
The Outsiders,"Yeah weird seeing someone praising this show it seems like the vast majority loved the beginning and were intrigued but ended up hate watching it just to get to a conclusion  

They really could've cut out 2 entire episodes and made the show far better paced"
The Outsiders,I mean pretty much everyone thought it peaked at episode 2.
The Outsiders,"Thought the same thing, was very okay after episode 2.  Seemed like they could have shortened the series by a couple episodes as a lot of it felt like it was just stretching itself out too thin.  It did have some good moments here and there, but overall I wasn‚Äôt impressed.  Weak ending imo too."
The Outsiders,If only the finale was lacklustre. I thought it was far worse than that. It might be one of the weakest endings I've ever seen.
The Outsiders,"There isn't any hype for it, because it sucked."
The Outsiders,El cuco.  The villain isn‚Äôt Tony Ferguson.
The Outsiders,"Yes, I thought Holly was portrayed much better in Mr Mercedes as well."
The Outsiders,"I meant of all the shows I've randomly decided to watch without knowing anything prior about them, this one was the best."
The Outsiders,"Seriously; just change a couple words in there and you can apply that to almost literally everything King has ever written.

The guy is an all-time great and one of my personal favorites, but he just *does not* know how to end anything satisfyingly."
The Outsiders,Then there's HBO...
The Outsiders,I don‚Äôt know if I even finished the book
The Outsiders,I felt that too.    I was waiting for another wow moment and it didn‚Äôt come.  Still enjoyed it
The Outsiders,Still worth watching imo.
The Outsiders,Mayor of Kingstown did something similar
The Outsiders,You literally just described some of the best parts of Season 1 of True Detective.
The Outsiders,But lately all I see is praise for it lol
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,"Interesting. He's never hosted SNL before, and this makes him the fourth Office alum to host (after Steve Carell, Rainn Wilson, and Ed Helms). Be neat to see him step back into comedy."
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,Im excited for whatever Office parody they think up. The Japanese Office with Steve Carrell was incredibly funny.
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,He's gotta do the Jim face just once for old times' sake.
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,I cannot wait to see Randall Park on SNL!!
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,fuck yeah dua lipa
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,Why are all SNL posts absolute cesspools
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,Yay! Interested in seeing whether Krasinski sinks or swims (betting on swims) and can never go wrong with live Dua Lipa!
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,Both of these things are extremely appealing to me
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,This didn‚Äôt age well.
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,Someone ask him why season 2 of Jack Ryan sucked so bad.

Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,The perks of being famous even though you are not either funny or an amazing actor.
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,Aaaannnnddd I won‚Äôt be watching that.

Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,If he hasnt contracted  the mexican beer virus by then
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,It‚Äôs funny that all three of the office people you named actually tried out for SNL and got rejected
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,"> Be neat to see him step back into comedy.

SNL is comedy?"
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,"Given the Coronavirus situation, hopefully they do a work from home bit/version of The Office."
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,$20 says an ‚Äúaudience member‚Äù asks him some sort of ‚Äústupid‚Äù question and then he does to face to the camera.
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,I wonder if SNL will have a skit of him struggling not to be Jim in an action packed world
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,I wanna see them do a office parody sketch. Here‚Äôs hoping they get other cast members to come back for it
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,"Second Asian host of the season, after the December 14th episode."
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,"Because people apparently can't live without complaining about how SNL and Pete Davidson just aren't funny on EVERY FUCKING POST.

We get it! Nobody's forcing you guys to watch it! Nobody's forcing you to comment on these posts either!"
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,You may sound like an asshole but you have a point. Your show starts to lose me when you have 6 people invade the Venezuelan equivalent of the White House in a helicopter in broad daylight and singlehandedly kill everyone there and overthrow the Venezuelan government
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,Someone should ask you why you thought season 1 was worth watching.
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,why is this written like a trump tweet
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,A quiet place 2 looks terrible? Just curious what makes you think that. Did you like the first one?
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,That just means you are getting old.
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,She's pretty huge so sounds like a you problem
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,The perks of being an asshat where he can be voice his stupid opinion on a public forum.
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,"I thought 13 Hours was surprisingly good ‚Äî especially after watching it with a veteran.

I also liked A Quiet Place but it wasn‚Äôt really swayed too much one way because of his acting I guess. He did write and direct it."
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,Cool.
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,Thanks for sharing.
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,I mean the musical guest is not usually that important. Often times they don‚Äôt even appear in the sketches. It‚Äôs the host I‚Äôd be interested to see.
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,"Despite your being wrong, *A Quiet Place Part II* comes out March 20."
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,"I don't see any evidence that any of them tried out for SNL.  The Carell thing is a popular internet myth, since his wife was on SNL.  Carell actually auditioned and got the Dana Carvey Show, not SNL."
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,How did Steve Carell and Rainn Wilson get rejected while Pete Davidson did not?
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,"Totally, yeah. And then later on two of them became correspondents on the Daily show prior to the Office (although I think Ed Helms did some bits during his Office years)."
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,"And Steve‚Äôs wife, Carol, bragged about making SNL everyday on she visited the set."
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,was that?
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,Edgy
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,"Lmao. The downvotes make this even funnier. 

Imagine genuinely believing anything late night was comedy"
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,That actually seems very likely. They‚Äôve been leaning heavily into Coronavirus humor recently.
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,"Bet you they'll do that thing where audience members ask questions but it's just a series of cameos from Office cast members. I'm thinking it'll be Jenna Fisher, Ed Helms and Mindy Kaling."
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,Jack Ryan except he's playing Jim instead.
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,They did a crossover Office/Hobbit parody with Martin Freeman. Maybe an Office/Quiet Place or Jack Ryan crossover?
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,actually they just had a young asian american comedian host on leap day
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,"Agreed, god I dont give a fuck about the current rando's SNL opinion"
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,"The Pete Davidson hate is weird to me too. Like, he‚Äôs not great in sketches, but his weekend update bits are hilarious. He‚Äôs more of a standup, so that‚Äôs where he gets to shine."
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,"Wow, it actually reads like Donald Trump tweeted that. Made me laugh lol"
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,saw the commercial during SNL.   Not my type of film.
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,"Well, at least us old people got David Byrne last week."
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,[deleted]
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,Any recommended songs for someone curious about her?
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,[removed]
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,Probably his strengths are writing and directing but i find it mediocre and not smart writing. Hollywood likes mediocre hit making films sooo... personally don't like his personality. He tries too hard to be funny and he is so smug. His humble brags are not humble.
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,host is new james bond.
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,[deleted]
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,"I don't know anything about Wilson and Helms trying out for SNL, but Steve Carell has joked about how he auditioned for the show but lost the spot to Will Ferrell. 

If you have a Hulu subscription, load Season 31, Episode 1 of SNL, which is the first time Carell hosted. He made the audition joke in his opening monologue.

I don't know if the joke is a lie or not, but you mentioned evidence that any of them tried out for SNL, so there you have some."
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,"No one truly knows why Pete Davidson has been cast on SNL, least of all Pete Davidson."
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,Carell and Wilson never auditioned for SNL.
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,Steve Carell auditioned the same time as Will Ferrell and Cheri Oteri.  So tough competition that year.
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,"Well they didn't audition at the same time, for one thing. They're all up against different people, and different people (or the same people looking for different things, at different points) were in charge of casting.

I can't really see Steve Carell or Rainn Wilson as part of the regular weekly lineup of SNL. Ed Helms, sure. But I just can't see the other two as regular cast members on SNL."
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,Because they are genuinely funny people and SNL isn't funny in the slightest?
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,Carrel and Wilson‚Äôs dads didn‚Äôt die in the World Trade Center
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,Steve Carrell's wife is Carol Carrell?
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,"> Imagine genuinely believing anything late night was comedy

70 years of successful late night comedy vs. one guy who claims that late night comedy doesn't exist."
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,Because everyone knows comedy rests between the hours of 8:00pm and 6:00am.
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,Imagine typing this out and not realizing how stupid you are.
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,People take SNL personally.
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,So the same thing they did with Steve Carell?
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,Whoever plays Kevin needs to be there.
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,"That's gold Jerry, GOLD!"
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,I've watched SNL since the first season and I like it.  Can I have one?
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,"tbh, its nice to see a white guy get this much hate. Seems like Reddit is channeling energy away from attacking women or POCs, or even worse, women of color. /s"
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,"So it doesn't look terrible, it just doesn't look like something you're interested in. Those are very different things."
Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,They just had David Byrne on last week.

Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,"Bill Hader saw him do stand up and told Lorne Michaels to let him audition. Then they picked Pete over Dan Soder.

And there's absolutely nothing saying Rainn Wilson auditioned for SNL.  Considering his background was places like Arena Stage and the Roundabout, not Second City, it's not surprising that he never auditioned for SNL."

Midnight Misadventures With Mallika Dua,"If the joke is the same as the not joke, is it really a joke?"
Stay Tuned!,eye warship satin?
Stay Tuned!,Maybe don‚Äôt cast Jeffrey Jones though.
Stay Tuned!,"It's a safer proposition financially for Morgan Creek Entertainment to use their rights to television remakes on their old franchises such as Robin Hood Prince Of Thieves, Ace Ventura & Major League, etc... than to do film reboots of them. They made a bunch of money from a couple hits & then absolutely lit it on fire from Mid 90's-2001 when they went into Music & then upped their film production schedule with mostly bombs like Battlefield Earth. they haven't had many money making hits since 2000 domestically. Almost all of their income comes from the rights to The Exorcist franchise these days."
Stay Tuned!,The movie wasn't bad.  It definitely showed off John Ritter's abilities as a *farceur*.  His talent was so wasted on Three's Company...
Stay Tuned!,I loved this movie when I was a kid.  So many plot opportunities here.  Color me stoked!
Stay Tuned!,He loves her! He‚Äôs a putz.
Stay Tuned!,Watched this movie as part of a quarantine movie night with the family. It's great.
Stay Tuned!,"Alright I really loved that film, it was quite imaginative.

Considering how TV has come along since it came out, I'm just imaging the opportunities they have to play with now. 

Perhaps as a twist of irony have the leads played by two actors who have been in movies but this is their first major TV role (it might not work for practical purposes I know many have mentioned the style is so different that transitioning that way is more difficult, but it would be fun if they pulled it off)."
Stay Tuned!,Please make sure this is good!
Stay Tuned!,"With the state of tv now (dramedies, anti-heroes, adult animation,  
streaming, binge watching etc) there is lot they can riff on. This should be interesting"
Stay Tuned!,"I was just telling my wife about this movie the other night, it was one of the few VHS movies I owned and always thought it deserved a sequel/reboot/exploration of the idea."
Stay Tuned!,"Oh wow, I COMPLETELY forgot about this movie, but I do remember loving it when I was a kid.  Weird lol."
Stay Tuned!,Start me up!
Stay Tuned!,I reference this and no one ever gets it
Stay Tuned!,Driving over Miss Daisy.
Stay Tuned!,Excrement!
Stay Tuned!,"It's a shame he turned out to be a pedo.  He was a really exceptional character actor in the 80s and 90s, could have had a hell of a career if it wasn't for that."
Stay Tuned!,My thought as well. It's the perfect time to do something like this because there's just so much TV to work with.
Stay Tuned!,I hope we get something contemporary like this but they could set it in the 90s or earlier. I think it would work much better as commentary on the current state of TV though. What is a TV show right now? The definition has expanded and it‚Äôs broader than it was when the movie was made.
Stay Tuned!,"Can someone just film the opening with the Deliverator, so it exists on screen, somewhere?"
Stay Tuned!,[deleted]
Stay Tuned!,Welp good luck at paramount. Can‚Äôt see this getting the development attention it needs there
Stay Tuned!,I could not even *begin* to cast this as a live action adaptation.
Stay Tuned!,"Some exec finally got to the end and was like, wait, this 14 year old girl is ready to get her back blown out by this 30 year old massive dude, and as soon as he sticks his dick inside her he passes out because her pussy has an anti rape device, and she's pissed she forgot even though he essentially kidnapped her?"
Stay Tuned!,"my disappointment is immeasurable

and my day is ruined"
Stay Tuned!,I have been waiting *decades* for Snow Crash and Neuromancer to make it to the screen.
Stay Tuned!,"I didn't know there was an adaption in the works.  One of my favorite all-time novels.  Eh, I don't have my hopes up high, now that it's at Paramount."
Stay Tuned!,Maybe Joe Cornish circles back after Attack the Block 2?
Stay Tuned!,That was like the one show I was most interested for on HBO Max. I know it wasn't guaranteed but damn.
Stay Tuned!,HBO Orginal > HBO Max
Stay Tuned!,"But given all the chatter about Meta, isn't now the time?"
Stay Tuned!,"Passing on snow crash, which would have been an amazing attack on ""meta""... Very poignant... But keeping strangeness like ""Raised by wolves""?

The one problem with snow crash was the tone shift when it went from the comic basis to when the protagonist starts monologuing. It could be a great show, it just needs a lot of clean up."
Stay Tuned!,[deleted]
Stay Tuned!,"A Novel with great ideas but terrible writing. Boring, long winded diatribes."
Stay Tuned!,It‚Äôs ok because Facebook is adamantly going through with their adaptation.
Stay Tuned!,"What I'm really looking forward to is the part where the villain rapes our 15-year old heroine, but it's all ok because she liked it in the end.

/S"
Stay Tuned!,I just want to see the depleted uranium gatling scene
Stay Tuned!,"Well, shit."
Stay Tuned!,I read that book twice but I can't remember anything about it
Stay Tuned!,"Poor Cornballs, he struggles to get stuff into production."
Stay Tuned!,"The rape scene could be a significant part of why it is not happening. If HBO had  a way to adapt that without going completely off the rails I would love to know how. YT would need what I think would be an impossible set of attributes to cast. Other scenes would be catnip to casts and crews, careers could be made off this, if you can clear that hurdle.
Animation wouldn't appeal broadly enough.
Unless you can get James Cameron to decide Snow Crash and Seveneves could bookend another Avatar style franchise. He has the F*** You Money and teams to do it. An adult actor voicing and motion capturing YT might be our only hope."
Stay Tuned!,Ima need some YT skateboarding through some burbclaves too...
Stay Tuned!,"> Can someone just film the opening with the Deliverator

Whenever I want to feel bad about my writing I read the opening with the deliverator. It's so fucking funny and well written."
Stay Tuned!,"Yes please.

He belongs to an elite order."
Stay Tuned!,"I reckon it might be possible to cut scenes from other moves and then modify them using stunting like stable diffusion. 
Might reread the book and have a stable at it..."
Stay Tuned!,"Not like a video game, that will have trailers, gameplay videos, a vague release date, and THEN get cancelled."
Stay Tuned!,whoever bought the rights should be fired. This is more impossible to adapt into a worthwhile mini series then pretty much anything else in sci fi.
Stay Tuned!,"Paramount needs a hit and scifi is one of the battlegrounds. Might still happen.

Now, if we *want* that adaptation to happen is another story entirely, lol."
Stay Tuned!,They want cheap shit to put on.
Stay Tuned!,Yeah it would be perfect for a animated mini-series or series depending on episode length.
Stay Tuned!,I thought I was the only one. I've always envisioned snow crash as an anime or animated series.
Stay Tuned!,Neal Stephenson knows how to write women
Stay Tuned!,The biggest problem with Snow Crash is going to be making it feel original because of how much has taken from it for everything else over the years.
Stay Tuned!,"That whole long section about language would have to be adapted in a more interesting way. I haven't read the book in a long time but I feel like it went on forever. Of course, that's the part that Stephenson must ha e liked the most. That's what all his books turned into.

I think diamond age could be interesting. I always loved it."
Stay Tuned!,"Any time creative people get together to make something there‚Äôs a chance it will result in something special. 

With adaptations and remakes at best you get a great new version of something you love, but at worst you get a spike of interest in the source material that brings in new fans who otherwise may never have known of it. 

Much as people whinge about it, there‚Äôs no real downside to remakes and adaptations. Maybe you‚Äôll get M Nights Avatar, but you could also get Carpenter‚Äôs The Thing. You‚Äôll never know until they take the shot."

Snow Crash has some epic scenes that would be amazing to see on screen."
Stay Tuned!,Well she does deliver the pizza for him in the burbclave.  So you should get a twofer.
Stay Tuned!,"If you ever want to feel great about your writing, check out my post history."
Stay Tuned!,"Why do you think it would be so difficult?

There's a lot of exposition about Sumeria etc with the librarian. That might have to be trimmed way back. 

The rest is lots of action, though, in a lot of great settings. Keeping it coherent might be a challenge, but who need coherence? The TV mini series could give out homework assignments at the end of each episode:

> Before you watch S01E05, read chapters 8-10 and 13 of the *Snowcrash* book."
Stay Tuned!,"> Paramount needs a hit and scifi is one of the battlegrounds. Might still happen.

They are making six Star Trek shows"
Stay Tuned!,Now I am wondering if anyone ever did it as a graphic novel.  Cause if they did‚Ä¶I want to buy that.
Stay Tuned!,"I mean, capitalism is as capitalism does in that regard.

Cyberpunk was started earlier with William Gibson. A meta verse existed with Dan Simmons in Hyperion. I feel like snow crash was riding on a pop culture resurgence in Japanese medievalism also.

It did combine a lot of these elements into a great original story but I haven't seen it used too distinctly in pop culture, especially the deep dive into language and mind mapping which was amazing for me when I read it."
Stay Tuned!,Also the dudes name is Hiro Protagonist. Even ironically that‚Äôs a bad bad name.
Stay Tuned!,Diamond Age is my favorite. Would enjoy seeing that adapted to film.
Stay Tuned!,"I don't disagree w remakes/adaptation, just feel like its a tough story to capture on screen. A story BASED in the world would fare better in my opinion. With every strikeout there's a rougher chance of a proper adaptation"
Stay Tuned!,"I know it's not an ""epic"" scene, but I would love to see Ng.  That visual of his brain and what's left of his body in a plastic medical bag with tubes and wires everywhere in an armoured car, and then we shift into that weird serene Vietnamese country house, with the low evening light being cut through narrow vertical blinds, I picture it just being cool and red, very vaporwave, the only hint of another colour is the clear blue globe floating a few inches above his low wooden desk... Oh I love it."
Stay Tuned!,">Snow Crash has some epic scenes that would be amazing to see on screen.

I have to admit I'd also like to see some folks being introduced to Reason, too..."
Stay Tuned!,I demand bruce lee themed street gangs.
Stay Tuned!,They need a hit show
Stay Tuned!,"‚ÄúThrow enough at the wall and something might stick‚Äù has been the seeming plan for the Trek franchise for years now. 

To sadly kinda mixed results.."
Stay Tuned!,I'd love to see an updated Space:1999 with Alpha a wreck from years of use and travel and battles and a few dozen desperate survivors barely hanging on.
Stay Tuned!,"Upon looking for a graphic novel version, I guess the book was originally planned as a graphic novel illustrated by a computer graphics artist."
Stay Tuned!,"You could argue cyberpunk started earlier but I agree Neuromancer was what really set it off. For me the 3 pillars of cyberpunk are Neuromancer, Snow Crash, and Ghost in the Shell. But if you made something like that now people would accuse you of ripping off the matrix."
Stay Tuned!,Yet Nolan used it anyway.
Stay Tuned!,"I just started this book and yeah the naming is egregious. Hiro Protagonist for one, but also; the crip named T-Bone, and a Japanese rapper named Sushi‚Ä¶??"
Stay Tuned!,"Pretty sure it wasn't just his brain, but his severely crippled body."
Stay Tuned!,Now I want to reread the book for the nth time.
Stay Tuned!,Yellowstone is a hit show
Stay Tuned!,They're making Halo....
Stay Tuned!,Because a property that has lasted 50 years on tv and in cinemas in a dozen iterations?
Stay Tuned!,Yet another reason why they won‚Äôt end up making Snow Crash
Stay Tuned!,"I‚Äôd put Blade Runner in GitS place if you‚Äôre only using three pillars, since GitS was *heavily* and directly influenced by BR."
Stay Tuned!,"It would definitely be compared to it... There's a lot of genres that are repeated from story to story. 

You do it right and it might get compared more to ready player one, since they're self aware in both and the economy is transcendent... But it's different enough that, again, if your do it right, it won't matter."
Stay Tuned!,And it‚Äôs by far his worst movie
Stay Tuned!,Welcome to Neal Stephenson
Stay Tuned!,"US rappers they be fussin and bitchin, ask for rap protectionism"
Stay Tuned!,It was pretty funny 30 years ago.
Stay Tuned!,You‚Äôre a roll model for us all.
Stay Tuned!,"True, but previous commenter probably meant that Paramount *Plus* needs a hit show. Paramount let Yellowstone go to Peacock for streaming."
Stay Tuned!,"no one really cares about Star Trek anymore, it's a very niche fandom"
Stay Tuned!,"Thats completely fair. & I'd agree with that. I'd probably just add a 4th pillar. When I said ""you could argue cyberpunk started earlier"" I was thinking about Bladerunner and Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"
Stay Tuned!,"> There's a lot of genres that are repeated from story to story.

There's very few truly original stories that don't borrow from archetypes. Writers don't grow up in vacuum and invent everything they do. They all have influences.

Snow Crash seems like something really hard to do right. The right line of campiness/serious storytelling is a tight rope to walk. The deliverator opening is one of my favorite opening passages ever but how do you translate that to screen?"
Stay Tuned!,His worst movie‚Ä¶so far!
Stay Tuned!,Neal Stephenson is a smart guy. He went to The Big U.
Stay Tuned!,"Lol it‚Äôs ‚Äúbooin‚Äô and hissin‚Äô‚Äù but yeah. 
I still can‚Äôt get over ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Sushi K and I‚Äôm here to say, I like to rap in a different way.‚Äù

Pretty analogous to the book; overly generic to the point where even the interesting parts lose value.."

I See You,[I can't see fuckin shit outta this thing](https://youtu.be/FWsnPx0wgcw)
I See You,"There's a funny moment in season 2 that refers to this that I can't unsee when I watch the episode. In ""The Marshal"", when Cobb Vanth first appears in the armor, he orders a bottle and two shot glasses from the bartender. He goes over to the bar and when he reaches for the bottle and glasses, you can see his fingers fumble around with the shot glasses a bit to figure out where he's gonna situate his grip, like he can't exactly see them."
I See You,Reminds me of what Levar Burton reported from Star Trek about the visor. Except I don't think he could see anything at all. Ironic given its a cure for blindness for his character IIRC.
I See You,Can confirm. I 3d printed a copy of his helmet. Even without the black lens your field of view is severely restricted. Looks badass though so whatever
I See You,"This is the way.


*falls down hole*"
I See You,"As a casual watcher I didn't even know if he was in the suit, he could've just done the voice"
I See You,"Why do I get the feeling that the helmet should have an internal AR/VR setup, to deal with low/star/nolight conditions. combined with targeting link to their weapons. If you‚Äôre going to spend $$$ on clones, you might as well bite the bullet and decent kit too."
I See You,Any hole?
I See You,I've got a hole for him to fall into
I See You,There‚Äôs too much fucking shit on me
I See You,"Well if last of us taught us anything, falling into a hole is step 1 to finding love."
I See You,I wonder how the stuntman does it!
I See You,"So, he can't see...the way?"
I See You,Wish he‚Äôd fall into my hole üòî
I See You,"Obviously THIS is why they are always saying ""This is the Way""


Because they are trying to tell each other which way to walk, since no one can see anything."
I See You,Glad to know nothing has changed in helmet technology since the Force Awakens. Adam Driver said he and the stormtroopers spent their downtime on set walking into walls and talking to inanimate objects.
I See You,[Basically Pedro.](https://youtu.be/J4Fv3LFGCgo)
I See You,"I know he's on the path to fix his honor or whatever because he had removed his helm, but if they're going to be moving away from the lone wanderer western feel into I guess some medieval esque power struggle, I'd be fine if they wrote in somehow that he takes his helm off more. They got the emotional payoff in S2 with keeping his helm on mostly forever up till Grogu at the end."
I See You,"I very much enjoy that there is a Venn diagram where the overlap is people who cosplay as Mando, HEMA armorers, and people with actual body armor experience and the thing they all have in common is knowing that Mandalorian armor is wildly impractical. 

It looks cool as hell, but yeah, you can‚Äôt see shit, you can‚Äôt move well, and if you‚Äôre not Pedro Pascal you‚Äôre worried about breaking something you‚Äôve poured a ton of time and money into."
I See You,"Hi! I guess unofficial member of the 501st Legion here!

Can absolutely confirm. I spent most of my childhood either in a Jawa costume or wearing a 501st Legion t-shirt at the parades working as a 'spotter'. The visibility in basically \*all\* of the Imperial and Mandalorian armors is so bad that it really is like trying to look through a mailbox slot. In fact, our troopers very lovingly call them their 'buckets'.

Not to mention, hot as hell. I can't even begin to describe how many times I had to help our Darth Vader change the batteries in his helmet so the CPU fans that kept him cool wouldn't die during a 4th of July parade."
I See You,"""If there's a hole, I'm gonna fall into it"" Pedro really serving the thirsty gays"
I See You,I hope it‚Äôs my hole üòà
I See You,"So he's probably asking ""is this the way?"""
I See You,"""We ain't found SHIT"""
I See You,[deleted]
I See You,Function follows form.
I See You,_Heresy! He does not follow the teachings of Mandalore. He is not Mandalorian!_
I See You,This is the way.
I See You,"Every Kamen Rider / Super Sentai actor ever: ""First time?"""
I See You,"Oh no, what‚Äôs happening to me..üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüßéüï≥Ô∏è"
I See You,"Sounds like

""I have a new series that is also successful and I'd like you to kindly get your shit together""."
I See You,Just had a flashback to the ‚Äúouttakes‚Äù from the Jango Fett Bounty Hunter game.
I See You,"Unless there was some enhanced imaging behind that, yeah no fucking shit."
I See You,"If you look closely at some of the close up shots, his nose is being squished by the helmet too. Its pretty funny once you notice it lol"
I See You,If you've ever worn a replica one you'd know you can't see anything.
I See You,We ain't found shit!
I See You,"Yeah, I agree. With a Mandalorian helmet on I can't see shit either."
I See You,"Not going to lie: that armor looks awesome on him (and whoever his stand-in/stunt double is).

It gives him such an idealized masculine profile with a very broad set of shoulders and chest, narrowing to the waist, and then thicker thighs all in a way more pronounced than you see in Stormtrooper armor, or Boba Fett's armor."
I See You,"Of course he can't see out of it, he's in a recording booth five hundred miles away."
I See You,"I mean, I kinda understand what he's saying, but with either my Jango or Boba Fett helmet you use the vertical part of the visor to see what's immediately in front of you. Once you learn how to walk with it on you can do stairs even. More importantly you feel cool when wearing it, who need to see what's in front of them really"
I See You,I hate that it‚Äôs not even him in that suit most of the time.
I See You,"I think we all think the Mandalorian helmet was a nice idea. But, not pointing any fingers, but it could of been done better. So how about no Mandalorian helmets this time, but next time we do this we go full regalia."
I See You,whoa weird! i said the same thing at the orgy last week.
I See You,[deleted]
I See You,"Use the force, Mandalorian."
I See You,Imagine being the stuntman fighting in that helmet.
I See You,That is why all these fancy sci-fi helmets would need a pretty good HUD inside because stumbling around half blind aint fun.
I See You,"- use the force, Pascal. For each square foot"
I See You,"Let‚Äôs get all the actors who‚Äôve played characters in costumes that they couldn‚Äôt see/hear/move in, get em back into their costumes, and put em all in a big fight scene! I nominate Keaton Batman."
I See You,‚ÄúThere‚Äôs too much fuckin shit on me‚Ä¶‚Äù
I See You,‚ÄúListen. I think we all agree the Mandalorian armor is a good idea!‚Ä¶‚Äù
I See You,"I love him more and more with each passing second. He seems like a humble, kind man, enjoying his great success. I do hope he is the real deal. He sure looks like it."
I See You,‚ÄúThere‚Äôs too much fucking shit on me!!‚Äù
I See You,I really need the audio from this interview.
I See You,That magazine cover is damm cool.
I See You,"I mean it's a cool looking helmet, and I'd like to imagine that in universe there is a whole camera/hud system that lets you see everything around you...

But in reality that helmet is almost completely useless for a modern soldier/merc/bounty hunter to function. Very little visibility, awkwardly shaped, and it looks like it would make an ideal sniper target on a sunny day.

(It might work better as a jousting helm with the right armor though)"
I See You,This is the way
I See You,"Hard to see a GD thing from his recording studio hundreds of miles away, I imagine. 
His stunt double doesn‚Äôt seem to have this issue, oddly enough."
I See You,"Mandalorians: ‚ÄúI can hardly see in this thing.‚Äù  
Republic: [Makes helmets that model the Mandalorian helmets].  
Empire: [continues this].  
Luke: ‚ÄúI can hardly see in this thing!‚Äù"
I See You,We‚Äôve known this since 1977 when a stormtrooper hit their head and a blast door and they left it in the movie xD
I See You,OSHA calling
I See You,"Yeah, I don't think the visor are aligned with his eyes."
I See You,"That‚Äôs the problem with all these helmets, they‚Äôre supposed to be this insanely cool bit of tech , like the guy in the helmet in that verse would have complete sight and sensory info plus more than a human could see being presented, like Ironman.  But the actors are inside a tin can"
I See You,"‚ÄúThis is the waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!‚Äù

\- Din Djarin falling down a hole"
I See You,"Use the Force, Pedro."
I See You,What hole did they dig this up from? I remember seeing this for season one.
I See You,He needs a guide dog lmfao
I See You,I kinda suspected this from the way the mandos throughout the series look like they‚Äôre about to fall down a flight of steps‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs this hesitancy to the confidence of their gait.  Rewatch and you‚Äôll pick it up‚Ä¶ any long shot of Mando walking and you can see it.
I See You,Grace Randolph is probably gonna say this means she was right all along
I See You,"""This is the waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyy"" 

Pedro falling into that hole."
I See You,He has some great fight choreography scenes so I'm shocked he did those in the armour
I See You,"""This is the wrong way"" Pedro after turning the wrong corner for the 11th time"
I See You,Release the outtakes!
I See You,Welcome to the life of most www.501st.com volunteers in costume...
I See You,If I were him I would tell them to let a stunt actor wear the costume and he can dub in the dialog. His career is really taking off now and he might be able to get away with it. James Earl Jones didn‚Äôt play Darth Vader but only did the voice.
I See You,"""If there's a hole, I'm gonna fall into it!"" ~Pick up line for a man drowning in poontang"
I See You,WILL SOMEBODY TURN ON THE LIGHTS?  I CAN'T SEE SHIT!
I See You,Guess it doesn‚Äôt help when you don‚Äôt have the fancy space cameras and HUD it‚Äôs supposed to have in universe. It‚Äôs basically a jouster‚Äôs frog helmet.
I See You,"When my wife read that if there's a hole he was gonna fall into it... she agreed ""He's going in a lot of holes"""
I See You,"It's a pretty terrible role, actually. I can certainly see why he took it, but now that Last of Us is taking off, I bet he'd be happy to pass it on to someone else. Frankly, it could be anyone under that armor, and we'd never know. Pedro can just do the voice like Brendan Fraser did in Doom Patrol."
I See You,This is the way
I See You,Then he can marry Ron Swanson.
I See You,Even in-universe it looks terrible. Whenever they show his POV like when he‚Äôs aiming his gun it looks like he‚Äôs trying to see through toy binoculars
I See You,"I guess a paycheck is a paycheck, but why would an actor take a job where he does nothing but walk about and you can‚Äôt even see him until the last episode. Sorry: SPOILER ALERT"
I See You,Pedro Pascal ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs A Hole: I‚Äôm it.‚Äù
I See You,*pant wheeze* I can‚Äôt breathe in this thing!
I See You,They couldn‚Äôt imagine a vr headset and camera
I See You,Maybe boba needs the darkwalking stick
I See You,Ok so he is hitting the end of interest on the role?
I See You,I‚Äôm still convinced he only wears the armor when he‚Äôs in a scene where he takes his helmet off
I See You,How often is he actually in the costume.  Cmon.
I See You,"Good thing he‚Äôs probably barely ever actually in the suit when the helmet is on.  

EDIT: if you guys actually think Pedro Pascal is in the suit and not just doing mostly voice work then you‚Äôre delusional."
I See You,"Isn't Brendan Wayne the guy wearing the armor? I would expect Pascal to wear it only  in the episode he took it off. Or maybe in some celebrity appearances for promotion and fundraising.

Ps:Brendan is John Wayne's grandson which  probably explains why the mandalorian's walk resembles the duke's."
I See You,"So does someone hold his hand and walk him across set saying ""this is the way"" the whole time?"
I See You,Let's be honest here. The vast majority of the time it's surely not him in the armour?
I See You,Not like he‚Äôs in it much.
2 Weeks,How'd the Resident handle Emily's departure?
2 Weeks,>!died in a car accident iirc.!<
2 Weeks,"What‚Äôs a shame, according to Zach and Donald on the podcast ‚ÄúFake Doctors, Real Friends‚Äù, is that some of the original songs had to be replaced with others because of copyright. At the time the contracts for the music were written, streaming had not existed and was not written into the royalty agreement. I‚Äôd love to see the show with all original songs again like I did when it originally aired on NBC."
2 Weeks,Medical guy here. Scrubs was one of the most realistic programs about medicine. I loved it when it was on.
2 Weeks,"Yeah it always feels like you just got blindsided when a comedy show throws an emotional episode in the mix. Interesting how many of the more emotional episodes focus around Dr Cox. Another memorable one was ""My Fallen Idol"" I think is the name, when all the organ transplants go south and Perry just goes in a downward spiral and JD tries so hard to help him."
2 Weeks,"For a kooky comedy, it sure knew how to hit you in the gut now and then.

[Like this time.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e__1KU7lg-4)

[Or this time.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbEkKa-W55s)

And spectacular use of music throughout the series. Unfortunately the versions that are streaming right now sometimes have different music, because of rights."
2 Weeks,‚ÄúWhere do you think we are?‚Äù
2 Weeks,"Scrubs is probably my favorite show of all time.

Maybe a weird comparison, but if you like Scrubs, I recommend Crazy Ex Girlfriend. It kind of scratches the same itch for me. Goofy, flawed main character who has silly daydreams/fantasies/inner monologue, and it kind of toes the line between being a comedy and handling more serious subject matter."
2 Weeks,"After the 8th season, skip the 9th season and start Cougar Town, it was Bill Lawrence's next project. It is just as zany and it carries on the tradition of having a sappy pop song montage in each episode. Also most of the cast of Scrubs cameo throughout the show."
2 Weeks,"If you liked Scrubs, I recommend a show called ""Psych"". I really liked both."
2 Weeks,Release it in HD already!
2 Weeks,"It's easily my favorite show. Good balance is drama with like actual character progression. Great balance of laughs and cries. The music was always so well picked out to really feel the moment. (Though it's pretty hard to get a version with the original songs nowadays as many had to be changed in later releases) if anyone knows good places to find versions with the of soundtrack please comment it. It's easily my most watched show. Honestly I don't even hate season 9, though I wish they had just called it a spinoff. I think it would have been received way better even had they of just been honest and called it a spinoff."
2 Weeks,Happy Endings kind of scratched the Scrubs itch for me.
2 Weeks,"I did the same thing lol.

I watched the first couple of seasons when it was out and loved it but lost track of it.

It‚Äôs a great sitcom and the musical episode is truly extraordinary.

Didn‚Äôt care about the final season but the previous season ender was perfect."
2 Weeks,Hospital Playlist (kdrama) is the only thing that comes close to Scrubs for me. It's more drama than comedy but has a similar wholesome vibe and amazing friendships.
2 Weeks,"I listen to a lot of podcasts at work, so when I saw Zach and Donald's podcast about the show, I thought I'd check it out. The podcast is pretty good. I've been watching one episode a week, keeping up with the podcast. 

The podcast is better than the show, IMO. I'll keep watching it for as long as they do the podcast, though."
2 Weeks,"I‚Äôm in the middle of watching for the first time but my opinion is totally different.

It‚Äôs good, yes, but the constant dream sequences are obnoxious and add nothing to the show and just says to me they‚Äôre there to pad out the run time. And the fact that he actually does it in the middle of conversations is insane.

And then the constant narration of characters is annoying the hell out of me."
2 Weeks,"Trash trash trash.  I hate it.  JD has one of the most punchable faces.  Cox is the only good character and he‚Äôs a sexist douchebag.



It‚Äôs overrated trash and not even a bit funny"
2 Weeks,I have been waiting to rewatch it for a few months but it is not available in streaming in my country atm.
2 Weeks,"Curious, did you watch the show on Netflix?


If so, would be really interesting if you can find the version of show from the DVDs and look up which scenes had the songs changed cause there‚Äôs quite a few and see how different the experience is"
2 Weeks,"There is an [incomplete list of the changes here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scrubs/comments/2lmf7h/ive_made_a_list_of_dvdnetflix_song_differences/). Some are pretty significant. 

The only official release with the original music is the original DVDs, or a seven seas rip of them."
2 Weeks,We did learn that the new songs were picked by Randall Winston aka Leonard the security guard with a hook for a hand and big giant afro / Death.
2 Weeks,That's fascinating!
2 Weeks,The music really did make a huge impact on the show. To have some of them yanked and changed is like ‚ÄúGarden State‚Äù having its soundtrack completely changed.
2 Weeks,Thanks to ‚ÄúThe Real J.D.‚Äù!
2 Weeks,"My Lunch

JD had been trying to get Cox to have lunch with him all episode."
2 Weeks,That killed me ngl.
2 Weeks,My Screw Up. The way they misdirected the audience for most of the episode made the twist at the end hit way harder! And rewatching it made you realise they planted hints all throughout the episode!
2 Weeks,"Ah yes I watched the original scene where JD and Elliot get off to ""Dreaming of You"", shame they changed it too.

Still can't get over that S3 moment."
2 Weeks,knew what the links were without clicking
2 Weeks,"Such a gut punch. I was sat in my living room and my housemate came downstairs to get food, and thought someone had died üòÖ and I said ""YES, ON THE TV!"". And he looked and went ""Welcome to the Scrubs club"" üòÇ"
2 Weeks,"I would have said Cougar Town for the silliness, scrubs cast cameos and it sort of existing in the same universe"
2 Weeks,I did the same. üòÅ
2 Weeks,More like skip to season 2 of cougar town. I gave up on the first season twice until a friend told me to push thru; the rest the show was so good
2 Weeks,Thanks! I'll have a watch when I can.
2 Weeks,I believe it is on Disney Plus. Although Scrubs deserves a remaster cause the early ones were shot on film.
2 Weeks,Ended too soon :(
2 Weeks,Yea S9 was shite but wasn't the worst. Just wish they could have ended it better but in a way it's not so bad.
2 Weeks,I mean...they're completely incomparable.
2 Weeks,"I'm sure back in the day it would have been funnier, but I still think it's aged well. Obviously if you're not a fan you're not a fan."
2 Weeks,"I watched it on Disney+.  


Tbh I'm not gonna do that."
2 Weeks,"Even the DVDs have different songs than the original broadcast, though in comparison to the streaming version much less songs were changed."
2 Weeks,"Surprised they replaced Colin Hay, I did watch the scene maybe years ago with him following JD around and my friend said he's had his music in it a bit. Plus growing up Men At Work was popular here because of the show."
2 Weeks,Didn‚Äôt he also play Snoop Dogg intern/resident?
2 Weeks,"You're right, My Fallen Idol was the next episode continuing with Cox's downward spiral & coming to work drunk."
2 Weeks,"I mean, I thought it ended great with the S8 finale - wrapped up a bunch of stuff and left the future open-ended. The show creator considers S8 as the final season of Scrubs as well, and has said that he would‚Äôve preferred S9 to have premiered with a different name."
2 Weeks,"Ah season 8 finale is the scrubs finale to me. Season 9 is the spinoff, Scrubs: Interns. The season 8 finale is too good to be ruined. Just thinking about JD walking down that hallway and then seeing his future unfold before him gives me chills every time. I don't cry often but I cried like a baby at the end of that episode. Scrubs premiered when I was 11 and ended when I was 18, it really was the tv show of my teenage years."
2 Weeks,They apparently are making a reunion episode or movie.
2 Weeks,"I hated it when it aired too.  Just not my type of show.


My wife watches it on repeat so I‚Äôve actually seen a bunch of it.  I think it‚Äôs just plain terrible"
2 Weeks,"No, but a kinda funny story I heard is that Snoop Dog intern was just an extra that Zach Braff told to say a line when Zach Braff called him that name. I don't think anyone else knew it was going to happenn.

There were a ton of extras like that that were kind of brought into the show over time."
2 Weeks,That's Snoop Dogg Attending.
2 Weeks,"Which might be one of my all-time favorite episodes. When he says, ""JD, thank you"" it's the most sincere he's ever been towards JD and the first time he actually uses his name since the first season."
2 Weeks,"Season 5 kills it with the emotional episodes (I mean all seasons are good). 

Jiggly Ball humanizes Kelso. 

My Extra Mile shows JD's growth and also the impact of positivity and the butterfly effect it can have by being an example to others. 

My Way Home is just an all time classic great Wizard of Oz parody. 

And as discussed, My Lunch/My Fallen Idol are two of the most emotional/powerful in the show."
2 Weeks,"I rewatched the last episode today and cried again, it's so fucking powerful. One of the best show endings for me, next to Breaking Bad."
2 Weeks,Oh really?
2 Weeks,"And it's such a simple gesture. Just a pat on the shoulder, but using his actualy name made it such a huge deal"
2 Weeks,"No - they just want to make one, they just need to have everyone to have their schedules align"
2 Weeks,"""Mobile and only mobile"" was clearly the worst decision Katzenberg and Co ever made."
2 Weeks,"wow Quibi was April 2020, feels like it was ages ago."
2 Weeks,I can watch quibi on Roku? I‚Äôd like to watch the new Reno 911.
2 Weeks,It‚Äôs amazing what changing something to free and attaching it to the #1 streaming device does to popularity.
2 Weeks,And yet I‚Äôve seen enough quibi ads to last a lifetime.
2 Weeks,People don't realize Roku is the sleeping giant of streaming. They basically lead the industry in streaming hardware by more than double the market share of the nearest competitor and have a committed user base.
2 Weeks,"I just wanna state for the record as someone who worked on a few Quibi shows: 

Literally nobody who got funding from Quibi believed it would work besides the founders lol"
2 Weeks,"It's a little sad because Quibi did legitimately have some great original content. 50 States of Fright was great, Wireless was good, they had exclusive rights to the Reno 911 revival, etc.

It's just that restricting it to mobile devices was never going to work out in the long run and the whole portrait/landscape thing(some shows would give you completely different camera angles depending on if you held your phone in portrait or landscape) was never really anything more than just a cute gimmick.

On the other hand though, Quibi did push one gimmick that I think could really work for some shows and I think other streaming services should try to adopt it: The 5 to 10 minute time slots. Some of their shows specifically benefited from being a series of shorts."
2 Weeks,"I've watched some Reno 911 and Die Hart. The latter because it sounded so absolutely terrible I felt like I had to watch it, but it warms up a few episodes in. Being bald works way better for Travolta."
2 Weeks,I don't know what these words mean
2 Weeks,So 2?
2 Weeks,You ever see two homeless people fighting?
2 Weeks,I only watched Reno on quibi and then I only watch Reno on Roku. So I can pretty confidently say I‚Äôm statistically insignificant right?
2 Weeks,Probably because nobody wants an app called Quibi
2 Weeks,I like how they try to blame their failure on the panorama.  People watched more tv than ever last year and your stupid paid mobile portrait mode platform still failed.
2 Weeks,"Wasn't Quibi a shady business scheme? They figured out that they could skirt certain union rules by making shows a certain way and then when the platform contract expires resell them for full value. A show on Quibi was considerably cheaper to produce than on tv or Netflix. In 5 years, they could resell all those shows to other networks for profit. It was never about the streaming"
2 Weeks,Searched Quibi on LinkedIn and they dont have any jobs posted.
2 Weeks,i know ive been plowing through the new Reno 911 eps on roku.  now im just waiting for the ron funches game show to appear... anyone know if thats coming any time soon?
2 Weeks,TIL quibi was around for more than two weeks.
2 Weeks,I‚Äôm just glad the content that was made is now available (and for free). My friend directed Die Hart and now I finally get to watch it. I like the guy and all‚Ä¶but not enough to subscribe to Quibi.
2 Weeks,I lowkey already forgot quibi existed until reading this
2 Weeks,[deleted]
2 Weeks,I actually watch one episode of this ‚Äúoriginals‚Äù. I was curious of when and how Roku made this. Now it all lines up. They bought Quibi films.
2 Weeks,"I don't think we have to pretend that Quibi wasn't the worst business model ever attempted in the streaming media market.

You can't argue your product into a market share, it has to actually be something people want.  This wasn't it."
2 Weeks,"I don't know if ""the flipping"" is a roku original or funny or die or part of this but it's hilarious"
2 Weeks,"7 minutes at a time.

What a dumb fucking idea."
2 Weeks,"I‚Äôll be the one to say it, I miss Quibi. Not because it was a good value or a good service, not even a good app to be honest, but because Roku took away the one innovation that Quibi had which really felt like something new and fresh.

As some of you may remember one of the biggest advertised features of Quibi was the fact that you could view shows in either portrait or landscape. At first My thought was ‚Äúno duh I can do that with any video‚Äù, as I thought that it just meant scenes were blocked to keep all the action in the center of the screen. But then when I tried it it turns out that the vertical version is an entirely separate video stream, often featuring split screen or other effects to make up for the different aspect ratio. Again I thought ‚Äúneat but who cares‚Äù, until I was watching Reno 911. I noticed there was a scene where a character was watching something on their phone and a prompt popped up telling me to turn my phone.

I tried turning my phone and suddenly the scene switched to the livestream that the character was watching. By rotating my phone back and forth I could switch between camera angles on the fly, and after going back and checking out other episodes it seems like almost every episode of Reno 911 had at least one scene that had alternate streams. Sometimes it was what the person was watching on their phone, sometimes it was what a camera in the scene was recording, sometimes it was dashcam or bodycam footage, but it would always show unedited live view of whatever that camera saw. It was such a brilliant idea and it was so wild that Reno 911 of all things was the only show (at least of the ones I watched) that really did anything with that feature.

The Roku app doesn‚Äôt have that feature, it just plays everything in landscape, and while it may not have ever been used to the fullest extent it was a truly original and innovative idea that could have allowed for an entirely new way of video storytelling. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôll always kind of miss Quibi even though for the most part it was a dumb idea with even worse execution."
2 Weeks,It‚Äôs bcuz nobody wanted to watch a show let alone a whole series on their phones. I‚Äôm Glad roku bought it. Thanks
2 Weeks,Both roku original and quibi draw 400 times more viewing in 2 days than my streaming service ‚Äúhotdoghub‚Äù rip hotdoghub
2 Weeks,Is anyone gonna talk about the animated face on the thumbnail? Some uncanny valley vibes coming from it
2 Weeks,What's quibi
2 Weeks,I mean it's free and available on my TV OFC I watched. The stuff from Quibi I watched on Roku isn't super great but It's entertaining so far
2 Weeks,Makes sense since I've literally never even heard the word Quibi before.
2 Weeks,Dummy was pretty funny and very meta.
2 Weeks,"I'd take more seasons of a few of those shows.

Fugitive was cool - you'd have to do a different story obviously, but I liked it.

The sex doll one was hilarious - give me more of that.

The home improvementy one? Fuuuuuck yes. That was awesome."
2 Weeks,Did Quibi even last more than 2 weeks?
2 Weeks,"Cool, cool, Roku.   Just let me know when you start streaming Quibi's pandemic-version of The Princess Bride.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home\_Movie:\_The\_Princess\_Bride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Movie:_The_Princess_Bride)

https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/06/the-princess-bride-homemade-fan-film"
2 Weeks,Gotta say I just loved Dummy. Hilarious
2 Weeks,"I worked post on one of their originals (which never aired) . I couldn‚Äôt understand why they wanted the content horizontal 16:9 and vertical‚Ä¶made for poor framing choices, tons of pan and scan, all so that a user can have the smooth experience of watching in portrait and landscape. It was the stupidest looking thing and time consuming as fuck to prepare. I remember days before delivering realizing I had to change the vertical crop to be even bigger because of the new ‚Äúdivot‚Äù in the latest iPhone. Those guys were making the shit up as they went."
2 Weeks,Was Quibi's lifetime more than 2 weeks?
2 Weeks,"""Those seven-to-10-minute running times happen to line up well with Roku‚Äôs ad breaks.""

Wait, Roku's originals have 7-10 minute ad breaks???"
2 Weeks,I was kinda pissed they didn't pick up Nice Ones. That premise would be hilarious for seasons to come
2 Weeks,Roku is great. I love that I can use my phone as a remote.
Kiss The Series,"So this proves (again and again) that HBO has the recipe for good television drama.

Why can't any of the other networks figure this out?"
Kiss The Series,Nothing to add besides: I‚Äôm just really glad this show ended up in the right hands. Could have turned out very differently somewhere like Netflix or Paramount
Kiss The Series,I knew it was going to be big but jesus it could potetentially become HBO's biggest show if it keeps this up.
Kiss The Series,"I hope the success behind TLOU will give us better adaptations. Seriously, there‚Äôs no excuse in bad shows with high budget."
Kiss The Series,[removed]
Kiss The Series,"I don‚Äôt love everything HBO makes, but most of the tv I really love is made by HBO"
Kiss The Series,"I started watching it alone, now I watch the episodes with a group of 6. Definitely spreading through word of mouth because I tell everyone I know to watch it"
Kiss The Series,"Details

>The penultimate episode of ‚ÄúThe Last of Us‚Äù Season 1 reached an impressive 8.1 million viewers on Sunday night.

>According to Warner Bros. Discovery, that makes Episode 8 the series‚Äô most-viewed thus far. Previously, that title belonged to Episode 3 with 6.4 million viewers, though the company did not make data available regarding the audience size of Episodes 4-7.

>The 8.1 million viewers who tuned into Episode 8, titled ‚ÄúWhen We Are In Need,‚Äù contributed to a 74% increase from the viewership of the series premiere, which drew an audience of 4.7 million people and was HBO‚Äôs second-most watched debut in over a decade."
Kiss The Series,Can we just note fungus in the end saved him. Penicillin?
Kiss The Series,"HBO treating The Last of Us as prestige television. Great writers and creatives on board to adapt the game properly

EDIT: Praise Druckmann!"
Kiss The Series,[removed]
Kiss The Series,"I've never played the game but I'm enjoying the show and it's been moving, but ""I got you baby girl"" is what finally made me burst into tears."
Kiss The Series,"I am watching this show with MY GRANDMOTHER. It‚Äôs so crazy to me that in this day and age we can bond over something of a shared interest! Me, knowing exactly what happens and seeing her watching in suspense is always a great feeling for me. She adored Sam and Henry and was like ‚ÄúI hope they make it through‚Äù when they approached the sniper on the street. I was just sitting there silently and she‚Äôs like, ‚Äúyou know what happens don‚Äôt you?‚Äù She was devastated but the >!bloater ripping the head off!< had her so intrigued, also realizing >!David and his group were a bunch of cannibals!< had her so hooked it‚Äôs amazing. Thank you HBO for creating something we could bond with in a way that I never thought!"
Kiss The Series,Bella Ramsey crushed it this episode. What a powerhouse.
Kiss The Series,That episode was INCREDIBLE!!!
Kiss The Series,I‚Äôm so glad Amazon or Netflix didn‚Äôt get ahold of this show. So refreshing seeing people actually give a fuck about the original material.
Kiss The Series,"Ever since I played the game for the first time way back in 2013 I knew it was one of the best stories I‚Äôve ever been told and it just makes me so happy that so many people are experiencing this amazing story for the first time, I certainly didn‚Äôt expect that it‚Äôd come close to Game of Thrones/House of the Dragon which is arguably the biggest TV show of all time."
Kiss The Series,"Damn amazing number, shame it has to compete with the Oscars for the final episode."
Kiss The Series,"It was nearly a 1:1 of this section of the game, and masterfully acted. A+"
Kiss The Series,[removed]
Kiss The Series,"It's pretty good, I'll admit I had my doubts but the 74% is for sure word of mouth. Everyone around me told me it was üî• and now I'm suggesting it to others. It makes sense."
Kiss The Series,"I haven‚Äôt watched a single episode, I haven‚Äôt seen a single spoiler, and on March 12th I‚Äôm binging every fucking episode and I can‚Äôt wait!!!!"
Kiss The Series,Wonder how long it‚Äôs gonna be until other networks/streamers announce their own zombie/zombie-adjacent shows to ride the hype.
Kiss The Series,"This was a great episode.  I ended up rewatching the [video game playthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AaaGoWfOhY&ab_channel=CouchSoup) with commentary from Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson.  They did a great job capturing the story.  

Fun fact!  Troy Baker makes a cameo as James in the tv show!"
Kiss The Series,I remember the time when 8.1 million views meant cancellation of the show
Kiss The Series,ELI5: are people not watching the rest of the season and just watching episode 8?
Kiss The Series,Happy for Sony and Naughty Dog.
Kiss The Series,Been such a great show so far. The best video game/movie adaptation.
Kiss The Series,"As someone who was wildly impressed back in 2013 with the game and the story. I‚Äôm just as excited to see the show doing so well, people that worked on the show seem to have enjoyed their time together, and it has kept the heart of the story. Well deserved praise for The Last of Us."
Kiss The Series,Video game dialogues are top but I like how ‚Äòsort of close‚Äô they are to it compared to the game.
Kiss The Series,Netflix totally gonna pivot some shows to one episode a week. Their shows hit and the conversation is gone in a week.
Kiss The Series,"Amazing production for both fans and those new to the series. Not only did they stay true to the story‚Äôs themes but the deviations they‚Äôve introduced seem to augment them instead of reduce them.

I can‚Äôt help but imagine if Henry Cavrill and Sapkowski were able to work with HBO instead of Netflix‚Ä¶"
Kiss The Series,And this isn‚Äôt even counting all the people pirating it!
Kiss The Series,"I was in the real town they filmed that in a few weeks ago, was cool to see it."
Kiss The Series,It‚Äôs sooooo good! Like saut√©ed portobello good!
Kiss The Series,It‚Äôs a good show
Kiss The Series,"That was an intense episode.

Having Joel up and running and killing 3 men seems a bit of a stretch when he was bed ridden minutes before."
Kiss The Series,[removed]
Kiss The Series,Good stuff
Kiss The Series,Best episode yet
Kiss The Series,"Forgetting the game exists, after watching the walking dead for however many seasons I got through I absolutely got worried they were going to stretch this ""villain"" out and then remembered it's the last of us lol. It was nice not having a drawn out enemy that just gets worn out too fast."
Kiss The Series,"I just want to throw out there that between episodes of TLOU, I started watching Station Eleven, another post-apocalyptic drama and I‚Äôve never seen anyone mention it but if you haven‚Äôt seen it, it‚Äôs excellent. Very different from TLOU; slower, less action but engrossing. The base story is about an acting troupe that makes a living circling lake Superior going from one small community to the next performing Shakespeare. 

Maybe I just missed it when it first came out and I‚Äôm late to the viewing party or maybe it just got overlooked. Either way, if you are looking for something to watch when the credits roll on Joel and Ellie, it‚Äôs out there."
Kiss The Series,"Any recommendations for single player PS games that focuses on story and isn't open world?

I don't really have time anymore to sink it big open worlds, I love TLOU part 1 & 2 because the story is so good and so tight. Would love to play something similar."
Kiss The Series,"My only complaint with the show is I think they're going too fast. Instead of 9 episodes, it should have been at least 15. A lot of the moments in the game that in my opinion are crucial to character development and the development of the relationship between Joel and Ellie have been skimmed over, or cut entirely, and honestly I don't think the point their relationship is at in the show makes sense within the context of what's actually happened in the show. I think it would have benefited from a slightly slower pace that told more of the story. But that's just like my opinion man."
Kiss The Series,Ellie was a BOSS in this episode!
Kiss The Series,"Bella Ramsey did an awesome job this episode. Lots of high emotion and fight choreo scenes.   
  
And then I watched Pascal take care of a different, greener adopted child right after. Dude‚Äôs having a dad year."
Kiss The Series,The finale few minutes were pretty amazing in that episode üëåüèª
Kiss The Series,Some people are going to be real upset when it doesn‚Äôt drag out for 11 seasons like TWD.
Kiss The Series,This episode was the most intense 50 minutes of tv. Absolutely marvellous.
Kiss The Series,"As much as I wanna see the new ep so bad, I really thing weekly premiers are the way to go"
Kiss The Series,[removed]
Kiss The Series,RIP to all the haters that said Last of Us was B-tier story at best if it was filmed.
Kiss The Series,I am trying so hard to like this. apparently I'm the only one who thinks it's average.
Kiss The Series,"Every week, a friend texts me that The Last Of Us must have been one interesting game‚Ä¶ almost as if he‚Äôs insinuating that what‚Äôs in each episode wasn‚Äôt part of a pretty rich series of games. And every week, I reply ‚Äúyup, it‚Äôs a fantastic story that they‚Äôre adapting brilliantly!‚Äù"
Kiss The Series,"So lucky to have had such a wonderful adaptation of such a treasured game and story to so many people. I have my own nitpicks and I agree that they are having to speed through some sections but I genuinely don‚Äôt think people realize how good we have had it. Brilliant acting all around, showrunner who loves the source material, original creator heavily involved, original composer doing the score, beautifully shot ‚Äî a dream come true compared to most adaptations (let alone game adaptations)"
Kiss The Series,Yeah I mean it's one of the best shows I've ever seen. Deserves all the praise.
Kiss The Series,"I love it. Theres a lot of content out there, a lot of good content even, but this show is great."
Kiss The Series,I love this show!
Kiss The Series,I'm ready to be hurt again...
Kiss The Series,what delicious numbers
Kiss The Series,10million by the end! Let‚Äôs do it!!
Kiss The Series,"I can't get the original game out of my head, but when they use a similar scene, it's incredible."
Kiss The Series,She went into beast mode and I loved it!
Kiss The Series,It was a great Episode!
Kiss The Series,Crazy good episode
Kiss The Series,This is by far one of the best shows I‚Äôve ever seen. I love what they‚Äôve done with it and how they make things a little different from the game to keep you guessing. Everything about this show is amazing. I‚Äôm so glad they knocked it out of the park.
Kiss The Series,"Bellas performance in episode 8 was incredible. 

‚ÄúTell them Ellie is the name of the child that broke your fucking finger!‚Äù"
Kiss The Series,Last night episode was so fucking good
Kiss The Series,Its really not that good..but i guess enjoy?
Kiss The Series,Episode 9 is gonna have more than 10M and gonna surpass House of the Dragon season finale numbers.
Kiss The Series,Why tho? That dialogue is ass
Kiss The Series,"Anyone else think it was way way over rated? I quit pretty quick. Episode one was good and sad. After that I thought it was lame and felt really cheap for HBO. 

Just my take"
Kiss The Series,Shit is so good
Kiss The Series,"my biggest issues with it are the 

1) goofy ahhh kathleen episode and the ending action scene

2) the time skip being in the new spot was altogether worse for the pacing and character development

3) the impalement scene was weaker in the TV show"
Kiss The Series,"They had to make up for episode 7.  What a, predictable, snooze fest that was. Ep. 8 kicked ass tho"
Kiss The Series,The worst part of this show is the astroturfing.
Kiss The Series,This Pedro Pascal guy is having a great start in acting. Maybe HBO or even Disney might give him more roles in the future.
Kiss The Series,"Sorry this show is overrated. It‚Äôs fine, but people acting like it‚Äôs the next Sopranos or something."
Kiss The Series,"It's a good show.

Let's see how they handle... Well... You know.

Honestly if they deviate for a bit it probably wouldn't make people hate them... But they gotta do it right... 

Either way, they gotta do it right.

Edit: Jesus Christ, what's wrong with you people. We're discussing a tv show why are you people so damn vitriolic. I didn't even state how I felt about the show doing one thing or another, just that I hope whatever they do that they do it well."
Kiss The Series,"I gotta say, I never enjoyed the gameplay of the original game, but I am loving being able to enjoy the story without dealing with the gameplay!"
Kiss The Series,"Lazy question.

But as someone that hasn't played the games.

Wil the show follow the entire game series and then just stop, or is it loosely based and will it divert from the games to create a season 5-6-7-8 etc?

If it's even known"
Kiss The Series,I can‚Äôt believe my eyes how insanely accurate the sets are. It‚Äôs incredible
Kiss The Series,Netflix so jelly right now.
Kiss The Series,What a fantastic fucking episode.
Kiss The Series,"Whatever the HBO recipe is, never change it. My all-time great dramas is like mostly HBO at this point."
Kiss The Series,"See, this is what happens when a production company makes an actually good show"
Kiss The Series,Love the show!!
Kiss The Series,"I see a lot of comments saying ‚Äúsee this is what happens when‚Ä¶‚Äù and crediting some cocktail of budget, faithfulness to the source material, etc, but really i think it‚Äôs just well-written and well-acted. The writers wrote a compelling show, HBO probably used many of the same technicians and film crew as they have in other successful shows, so that was done well also."
Kiss The Series,This was the best episode of the show ü•∫‚ù§Ô∏è
Kiss The Series,"Such a GREAT episode üëè 


Well done , and I NEED more .
This is coming from a person that‚Äôs NEVER played the game before."
Kiss The Series,That end scene had me ugly cry
Kiss The Series,Well ! It‚Äôs a really good show for one thing ! And it‚Äôs really well made ! And the characters are amazing !
Kiss The Series,I just watched all of the episodes this week. The numbers are obviously because of me.
Kiss The Series,I‚Äôve loved this series I do wish there were more zombies though
Kiss The Series,I've absolutely loved the show but feel they're making a mistake by moving things along so quickly in order to follow the events of the game.
Kiss The Series,"Don't get me wrong, I am loving the series, but am I the only one wishing there was more conflict with the cordyceps? It is like they skipped the whole first few years of the outbreak and went full bore into the Walking Dead equation where the main conflicts are coming from humans trying to survive against other humans with differing views on how to advance society as it fights to regain its hold over the World."
Kiss The Series,"Is this episode better than 7, my God that shit was boring. Just had to skip it."
Kiss The Series,"If they lost the flashback scenes with bill and Ellie.(make them bonus episodes inbetween seasons, it‚Äôs been done) and replaced them with scenes from the game they obviously skipped over, this would be 20/10 game adaptation.

Ready for the rate downs, fight me."
Kiss The Series,"One episode a week is the correct recipe. Giving each episode the respect it deserves. Just like back in the days shows‚Ä¶
Releasing a show like this all at once is a crime. We all watch one, talk about it and the word of mouth just makes it even more special. #hatebinge"
Kiss The Series,Well I hope everyone‚Äôs enjoying it at least.  I didn‚Äôt get anything out of this one.  Just seemed like more of the same zombie stuff to me.
Roonpi Secret Love,"Legion takes place from David's point of view and is not necessarily what actually happened.  Always take his outlook as the best possible outlook for him. The only narratives that may be taken at face value are those which do not involve David from his own perspective.  Yes Farrouk took advantage of David's ""situation"" but without spoiling any more, if you see David happy and dancing, you should question the authenticity of the narrative. What he wants is not necessarily what we are seeing. All is explained later in the series."
Roonpi Secret Love,"I think this might not be the show for you then. Which is okay.

Maybe as you said, just read a summary and be done with it.

The final seasons are very ""show, don't tell"", and leans a lot into making us feel rather than pushing the plot forward, so if you don't enjoy the stylistic elements, this might not be the show for you (anymore)."
Roonpi Secret Love,"I believe they use the musical dances and numbers to portray psychic or astral plane activities and attacks. In most cases at least. Which adds a more interesting layer onto them. For example, the scene with Lenny dancing to ""Feeling Good"" in season 1 is Farrouk dancing through David's mind and memories.  Showing how much fun he has causing chaos and destruction inside David's mind.

I'll say they lean heavier into it season 3 though.  There's one moment where there's a long montage of people travelling through the desert to music that keeps going on and on. Then it cuts to commercial with nothing happening and it actually made me laugh outloud.

S2 also has an amazing astral battle set to a duet of ""Behind Blue Eyes"".

I actually loved the dancing and music in the show though. And I loved that it was how they portrayed psychic battles."
Roonpi Secret Love,The dance scenes are stylized fight scenes. Because without them it‚Äôs just two people staring at each other.
Roonpi Secret Love,"The show was great overall, yes, but I did feel like after season 1 they were trying to be weird on purpose, not because it actually helped the story or anything, just for the sake of being out there. Felt a little like Hawley bought into his own hype."
Roonpi Secret Love,"I was in a similar position to you, but it was my partner that lost interest for the same reasons in season 2 - so I eventually watched it solo

but what I can tell you is that you should definitely persist and its definitely worth it!"
Roonpi Secret Love,It's not a secret what the dancing represents. It's pretty on the nose actually.
Roonpi Secret Love,"You don't understand the show or the characters, lol. I don't think you are going to like the rest of it.."
Roonpi Secret Love,"choreography as storytelling is a thing that you're missing, clearly.

you call it 'pointless' and 'no progressing the plot', but that just shows that you lack understanding of how choreography can tell a story.

you can either keep being blind to a new way of accessing information, or you could open your mind to something you've not understood."
Roonpi Secret Love,I couldn't stand that show....
Roonpi Secret Love,For me Season 2 and 3 should have been merged into one season. It was great.
Roonpi Secret Love,Yeah this might not be the show for OP.
Roonpi Secret Love,That desert scene was s2‚Ä¶
Roonpi Secret Love,"From a summary of s2 ep1.   
""He tries to find Farouk telepathically, using an amplification chamber created by scientist Cary Loudermilk to increase the range of his abilities, **but instead relives a memory from the nightclub of a strange monk and a dance battle with Oliver and Lenny Busker""**

No, you just THINK it represents something.  I guess this show is perfect for you, fool. Idk what the name for it is, but its just 'character porn'. The main characters are dancing, and thats enough to entertain you. I guess my problem is I did not want to watch a musical."
Roonpi Secret Love,[removed]
Roonpi Secret Love,"> dance battle 

They're using a dance battle to represents a psychic battle because how do you represent that interesting style without people just holding fingers to their heads."
Roonpi Secret Love,[removed]
Roonpi Secret Love,looooooooool he made reddit send me the suicide hotline tips or whatever
Roonpi Secret Love,"lrn2read

""relives a memory""

do you know what a memory is?"
Roonpi Secret Love,Yes classic horror is great but nothing can compete with the absolute terror that I got when watching cats
Roonpi Secret Love,"It‚Äôs a one off special
I‚Äôll give it a shot"
Roonpi Secret Love,Laura Donnelly is totally Krysten Ritter's doppelganger.
Roonpi Secret Love,"Another month, another ‚Äúthis Marvel project is totally different‚Äù puff piece."
Roonpi Secret Love,Why is everything now a ‚Äúlove letter‚Äù. Why can‚Äôt movies just be good movies in their genre?
Roonpi Secret Love,"Well, to be honest, Monsters vs Aliens was a love letter to classic horror as well, but that movie flopped immensely.

Something I don't get, because it's definitely one of my favourite animated movies."
Roonpi Secret Love,So it's not storyboarded by Kevin Feige to have them fight in a CGI clusterfuck battle where everything is grainy and brown at the end? They actually restrained themselves?
Roonpi Secret Love,The critics of every Marvel show be like: best thing ever/ one of a kind!!!
Roonpi Secret Love,It‚Äôll be standard Marvel fare.
Roonpi Secret Love,"I get that it's a reference to the classic wolfman, but if WBN actually looks like that full-time, I'm going to be disappointed. I hated how the werewolf looked in Penny Dreadful for the same reason. It just looks stupid. Give me some 9 foot Werewolf the Apocalypse CGI action"
Roonpi Secret Love,Was this even a comic or just something they came up with?
Roonpi Secret Love,I feel like Marvel has no identity or purpose at this point in its lifecycle. A complete love letter to classic horror isn‚Äôt what anyone goes into a marvel product hoping for.
Roonpi Secret Love,I don't know if I can buy genre hype around any MCU property after they spent months hyping up Multiverse of Madness as a horror movie when really it had about 30 seconds of Evil Dead inspired shots peppered throughout and none of them were particularly scary. Even the final action set piece which absolutely could have been played for horror given its content was mostly portrayed like any old pow-wizz-bam final fight.
Roonpi Secret Love,I remember when Marvel used to write love letters to me and not the woke werewolf agenda.
Roonpi Secret Love,I'll wait until Mystery Science Theater 3000 watches it.
Roonpi Secret Love,"Truth be told, as clever as I thought the homages and love letters to TV that Wandavision had, I'm not really going to watch them again for a while. Hawkeye though will be a Xmas tradition, Loki when the mood strikes, Falcon and Winter Soldier when I need that extra Russo actiona thriller vibe, even though it really does need a longer middle section in Europe."
Roonpi Secret Love,[deleted]
Roonpi Secret Love,Is this the werewolf Thor slept with?
Roonpi Secret Love,Marvel taking shots at the Monster Verse
Roonpi Secret Love,This movie is trying to be intentional schlock. It's a boring void between Ed Wood and Resident Evil.
Roonpi Secret Love,well if it is something good and not like the recent mcu stuff then cool
Roonpi Secret Love,Dollars to doughnuts it'll just be aesthetically pleasing and not even remotely scary.
Roonpi Secret Love,I just don‚Äôt understand what the fuck this show is and why it‚Äôs a Marvel project. The MCU is just such a mess these days.
Roonpi Secret Love,Of it‚Äôs a secret screening then why do we know about it
Roonpi Secret Love,"Yes, but ""Jellicle By Night"" was rejected for being far too disturbing."
Roonpi Secret Love,I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôre talking about the movie but low key cat sitting is hella stressful for me
Roonpi Secret Love,I‚Äôm not watching it until we get the Butthole Cut.
Roonpi Secret Love,I hope Tom Hooper got at least one ironic horror award out of that movie.
Roonpi Secret Love,Try it on mushrooms.
Roonpi Secret Love,ü§£ü§£
Roonpi Secret Love,"Mixed with a bit of Eva Green. 

She's sooo good in the Nevers she has me pumped for this. That and this being directed by Michael Giacchino."
Roonpi Secret Love,"Winter Soldier is a political thriller, Ant-Man an Ocean‚Äôs style heist flick, Thor 3 a buddy road trip in space, Black Widow and espionage thriller, Moon Knight an archeological horror, etc etc.

All statements and claims by Fiege over the years.  I may still enjoy the MCU but it‚Äôs just getting old.  It‚Äôd be like an fast food chain saying a new item taste like nothing else on the menu (despite being of the same quality anyway)"
Roonpi Secret Love,"I take it you didn't watch the trailer for this then....This one actually is different, in part because it's a special not a movie or show so they allowed a bit more freedom with this."
Roonpi Secret Love,If (insert whatever) is worse than the last Marvel Project then it‚Äôs only somewhat different.
Roonpi Secret Love,"We need more hate letters. Fuck spoofs and homages, give me spite flicks."
Roonpi Secret Love,"From the trailer alone, it's clear that ""a good horror movie"" is not really enough to describe the vibe because it omits the most unique aspect of it, the fact that it is genuinely an homage (or ""love letter"") to Universal Classic Monster movies in a way that the vast majority of horror movies are not. This is one of the few times this is actually a ""love letter""."
Roonpi Secret Love,"They can be, but when good movies have callbacks and homages to previous good movies then the term love letter makes sense."
Roonpi Secret Love,Pre-selling it as a ‚Äúlove letter to classic horror‚Äù get a massive group of movie goers to buy into it whether or not the movie is dogshit (no pun intended).
Roonpi Secret Love,"I'd like to see the headline ""Good movie released!"""
Roonpi Secret Love,"It's just a cliche thing to say, chill."
Roonpi Secret Love,"Reminds me of my youth. Every fantasy novelist was ""the new Tolkien"". I don't want a new Tolkien, I want another author as great as him, not a washed out copy."
Roonpi Secret Love,You're expecting originality.
Roonpi Secret Love,It‚Äôs a nicer way of saying ‚Äúderivative.‚Äù
Roonpi Secret Love,"It‚Äôs just another way to say homage, it‚Äôs not that deep"
Roonpi Secret Love,What do you mean it flopped? Didn‚Äôt it have a big opening weekend and at least made its money back and then some?
Roonpi Secret Love,I thought that was more classic sci-fi than classic horror?
Roonpi Secret Love,"So I know this might be the most obscure reference I've ever made but here I go anyway:

""I hear they really muszzled Joss Whedon's creativity this time so I guess it could turn out great.""

(Might not be the 100% accurate quote either...)"
Roonpi Secret Love,I genuinely can't think of a Marvel movie that ended in a brown and grainy CGI cluster fuck?
Roonpi Secret Love,People criticize the movie industry for continually pushing out shallow overhyped mediocrity and ignore that they keep doing it because critics are happy to praise it.
Roonpi Secret Love,Looks like what? I don't see any pictures of the Werewolf in the article.
Roonpi Secret Love,"It's a comic, it's the comic where Moon Knight first appeared, actually."
Roonpi Secret Love,And yet it‚Äôs the first Marvel release I‚Äôve looked forward to in about two years.
Roonpi Secret Love,"Granted, that speaks to spectrum of source material they have to draw from. 

By no means am I holding my breath for Werewolf by Night but it‚Äôs nice to see them at least attempt to expand their brand identity"
Roonpi Secret Love,I just want more Marvel content that doesn‚Äôt feel the need to shove jokes into every scene
Roonpi Secret Love,"This is just a one-off Halloween special, based off an existing comic. Marvel was never exclusively about superheroes, they‚Äôre an entire company."
Roonpi Secret Love,"I think you might underestimate how many Marvel fans out there also really love horror.  And considering how popular horror comics remain, it would be weird if Marvel didn't dip it's toes in horror from time to time."
Roonpi Secret Love,"Hi. Mod of r/HorrorComics here. While there is far better horror content than what Marvel ever offered, there is some quality fun to be had with film adaptations and I know a lot of people that are looking forward to seeing this.

Werewolf by Night may be a significant detour from the superhero stories of the MCU to date but it would be silly for Disney to ignore the fun, schlocky horror content from the 60s and 70s."
Roonpi Secret Love,Full with you on Hawkeye. Really nails the NY Christmas vibe
Roonpi Secret Love,its a one-off special
Roonpi Secret Love,"Just to help clarify, it‚Äôs not a show. It is a one-time Halloween special that will be about an hour long. It‚Äôs based on the Marvel comic book character, Werewolf by Night."
Roonpi Secret Love,You don't understand why a Marvel comics character is a Marvel project? What is confusing about this?
Roonpi Secret Love,It's just a short film. Michael Giacchino (the award winning composer) wanted to do some more directing and pitched this to Feige. Feige liked the pitch and let him work on it. It's a Marvel project simply because the title character is literally a Marvel comic book character.
Roonpi Secret Love,Ya‚Äôll be really fiending to see James Corden‚Äôs asshole.
Roonpi Secret Love,You just perfectly explained the state of the MCU. Thank you.
Roonpi Secret Love,It might all be fast food but I'd give you a funny look if you told me your McNuggets tasted exactly like your Big Mac.
Roonpi Secret Love,31 flavors of vanilla.
Roonpi Secret Love,It's like Taco Bell using the same 5 ingredients 20 different ways.
Roonpi Secret Love,"For most cinemaphiles the MCU will always just be ‚ÄúSuperhero movies‚Äù, but for many comic fans like myself, it is a panoramic display of genres infused into the superhero motif, and we love it all. But it was always just a matter of time before it wore out it‚Äôs welcome with general audiences, just as westerns did back in the day of their long proliferation. 
I just hope that it hangs on long enough to build a master mosaic of films and shows inspired by the comics I loved to carry me out, and that we get just a few more masterpieces before it finally, inescapably, flames out."
Roonpi Secret Love,"I guess it is like comics then, you might be reading the issue of a certain character, then an special event happens, then you have to read the issues that affect your character interacting with characters you might not like or be interested much."
Roonpi Secret Love,"I will say this project was much more stylized than those other ones. It was more similar to Wandavision, not something made for movie theatres."
Roonpi Secret Love,"I‚Äôll believe it when you see it. You can create a trailer that promotes a film/show/whatever into looking like lots of genres. You could make Casablanca look like a bro-y comedy if you focused on Captain Renault and added some appropriate music. I‚Äôll believe Marvel had made an actual classic horror when I see it, not when yet another credulous outlet says do."
Roonpi Secret Love,John Carpenter thinks Darren Aronofsky's horror films are proof that he actually secretly hates the horror genre.
Roonpi Secret Love,"So, you want Shrek"
Roonpi Secret Love,Isn't that 'The Boys'? Making fun of superhero tropes.
Roonpi Secret Love,The Boys is a hate letter to all superhero and their corporate overlords.
Roonpi Secret Love,"I won't lie, this is kind of why I like almost all the Scream movies. The self-deprecation of this latest film on some almost wildly meta levels if you think too much about it, was just enjoyable. It was a hate filled love letter to itself and the genre while also just being a pretty good movie imo. 

In the end, I think the best ""love letter"" type movies are the ones made by filmmakers who just liked those movies, but aren't *trying* to make an homage. Like someone playing with the style instead of just trying to make/re-make classics in part or on the whole"
Roonpi Secret Love,It‚Äôs just effortless writing for these clickbaity reviews of media. They‚Äôre not providing any valuable insight. They just repeat buzzwords that people like to generate ad revenue.

The Confrontation,"**Making the series**

> And although the duo have worked together on 10 projects, beginning in 2011 on the first season of ‚ÄúAmerican Horror Story,‚Äù ‚ÄúDahmer‚Äù wasn‚Äôt an immediate yes for Peters.¬†

>¬†‚ÄúIt was a real struggle. I was really thinking about it and trying to process it. I went back and forth a lot,‚Äù he says. Ultimately, it came down to working with Murphy again, someone he trusted and knew understood his process.¬†

> Similar to his mental transformation, Peters also had to physically change quite a bit over the course of filming; he took on a no-carb, no-sugar diet to drop 15 pounds in the beginning...

> When they wrapped, the yearlong editing process began. For the first time, Peters was an executive producer and went through every single take.¬†

> The work didn‚Äôt stop until the show came out. They didn‚Äôt do any marketing or publicity for the series, something Murphy says was due to the material being too heavy. Critics didn‚Äôt receive episodes early. No one knew how it would perform.¬†


> Coming four years into Murphy‚Äôs five-year, $300 million deal with Netflix, it quickly became his biggest hit, with more than 1 billion hours viewed over the first 60 days.¬†


**Victim Backlash**


> That popularity came with backlash. Relatives of Dahmer‚Äôs victims spoke out, upset they were not involved; Murphy says he reached out to around 20 families but never heard back. So, he relied on his ‚Äúvery large research staff,‚Äù who worked around the clock for 3.5 half years.¬†


> ‚ÄúI was never interested in Jeffrey Dahmer, the monster. I was interested in what made him. I think that the fact that all of the characters in this are seen as true humans makes some people uncomfortable. I understand that and I try not to have an opinion on that,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWe always tried to center everything on the victims.‚Äù¬†


**Netflix‚Äôs LGBTQ Tag** 

> When the show was released, Netflix listed it under the LGBTQ tag, which up until now, was used to label uplifting stories about the community. After significant backlash, the tag was removed.¬†


> ‚ÄúI think that it got the tag, one, because of my involvement. I‚Äôm a gay man, so most of my stories deal with some sort of LGBTQ thing and I do that selfishly; when I was growing up, I had nothing [to look to],‚Äù Murphy explains. ‚ÄúMy mission statement has been to talk about those stories and those characters and unearth buried history.‚Äù¬†

> Murphy gets why people weren‚Äôt happy with the tag ¬≠‚Äî ‚ÄúMany people in the community want to uplift. I understand that,‚Äù he says ‚Äî but he doesn‚Äôt agree.¬†


> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about homophobia,‚Äù he adds. ‚ÄúI have a saying: ‚ÄòMy job as an artist is to hold up a mirror about what happened.‚Äô It‚Äôs ugly. It‚Äôs not pretty. Do you want to look at it? If you do, watch it. If you don‚Äôt, look away, and sometimes, some of this outrage is directed at the frame of the mirror instead of the reflection. I try and say, I really understand why you‚Äôre upset about the inclusion of that. I understand it, but I also disagree with it personally.‚Äù¬†


**Future projects**


> After such a heavy lift, both Murphy and Peters aren‚Äôt sure what‚Äôs next‚Ä¶ or so they say. Seven days after this interview was completed, ‚ÄúMonster‚Äù was renewed for the second and third seasons. While Murphy wasn‚Äôt able to be reached for comment on what that looks like, it doesn‚Äôt seem like Peters will be jumping to be part of it.¬†


> ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to take a little break from darker roles and explore the light,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt would be interesting to me to play something that is a little closer to home, a little more mundane and to explore the details of those kinds of experiences.‚Äù¬†


> Murphy also claims he wants some time to himself, which may be difficult now with more ‚ÄúMonster,‚Äù ‚ÄúFeud‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Watcher‚Äù on the way.¬†"
The Confrontation,"I'm not a fan of the series but I do agree on the LGBT tag. Seems to me Dahmer's victims were mostly LGBT, so it's not solely about his sexuality being portrayed as a ""part of the community"" kind of thing but more about the fact that it historically changed something for the LGBT community, created fear, especially in this area. But I disagree with the fact that it should have a LGBT tag because Murphy is a gay man. Though I'm willing to get other opinions."
The Confrontation,"The reason I understood it from the families perspective is that this story has been done over and over and over and over again. What is there left to say? Most who would watch this show already knows most of the details. At some point let them rest.

Take on one of the million crime stories that haven't been beaten to death. Read a book about Jesse Pomeroy this weekend, how about that instead?"
The Confrontation,">""We always tried to center everything on the victims""

Something that irked me about the series is that he says this, but it doesn't really ring true when you look at the liberties taken with the events.

I accept that biopics, historical films or anything about true events in film/TV add fictional elements to make a coherent narrative or to explore a particular theme. But if it was really all about the victims, you'd think he'd be interested in actually representing who those people really were at the very least?

Probably the most memorable episode of the series appears to show the ""perspective"" of one of the victims in some detail. Tony Hughes, who was portrayed in this episode was indeed deaf in reality, and was killed shortly after meeting Dahmer. But the episode suggests a relationship between him and Dahmer lasting weeks, multiple dates and a romance that never happened. It's complete fiction, all for the sake of delivering an emotional gut punch to the audience when the inevitable ending rolls along.

Imagine dying in such a horrific way and decades later millions find out about you through a Netflix series that portrays some invented romance story involving you and your murderer. It's fucked up."
The Confrontation,"I really don‚Äôt understand the backlash from people, they didn‚Äôt make Dahmer seem like a hero in anyway shape or form and really showed how the community and police dropped the ball. Tragedies like this are going to be made into documentaries and biopics because there is a demand for it. I‚Äôm sure people watched this show and had no idea Dahmer did all these terrible things."
The Confrontation,"Ryan Murphy just gives big narcissist energy. It feels like he‚Äôs decided that it‚Äôs fallen to him to be the voice of all of these terrible stories that he‚Äôs decided need to be shared, fictional or otherwise. His presence is chafing at best, and his name on a production immediately makes me distrustful of its authenticity. Won‚Äôt be watching Monster."
The Confrontation,"Poor evan. He owes his career to ryan so he will never tell him no, even at the expense of his mental health and happiness."
The Confrontation,"While I think the victims families are entirely valid, I do think this is an important story to tell in today‚Äôs world. Yes it‚Äôs been done over and over, but as others have pointed out, there are a LOT of people who had no clue about him and it‚Äôs really important in todays online hookup culture we know how to watch out for ourselves and others.

Most importantly, though, the crux of the story is about how police didn‚Äôt care to do anything because these were people of color. THAT is the key takeaway here and that kind of shit is still going on in 2022.

All that said, I probably wouldn‚Äôt have made the show if I were in their shoes."
The Confrontation,"It was a really well done. I also thought it highlighted just how these assholes prey on the vulnerable and those who society cares little about. 

It was also the best Dahmer media I‚Äôve seen.

If you don‚Äôt like it, don‚Äôt watch it."
The Confrontation,"It's pretty fucking homophobic to be angry about the LGBT tag. Like, being gay is not a thing that exists only for good people. It's a neutral characteristic. If you start to judge people to decide if they're gay or not, then you are a fucking hypocrite. Same goes for the tag as well. LGBT means that it portrays people that belong in the LGBT community. Sometimes these people are bad. Portraying a gay person as bad is not homophobic. Portraying a gay person as bad because they're gay or to slam the LGBT community is."
The Confrontation,"Why is this bad but something like Schindlers List, Titanic, People vs Oj Simpson, World Trade Center, Mindhunter, Zodiac, and others not?

 I'm genuinely asking, not being sarcastic, I wonder what the line is. I'm not defending the show I'm genuinely interested on people's thoughts on depiction of horrific true events, I'm not sure what I feel."
The Confrontation,"Isn‚Äôt it supposed to be informative about the gay culture of the time and how much homophobia afflicted everything at the time. Does everything LGBTQ have to be positive? Isn‚Äôt it kinda interesting to learn about the bad? 

I might be obliviously wrong but shouldn‚Äôt some stuff be taught so you get insight in how the culture evolved and was oppressed? I find it interesting at least."
The Confrontation,"The fact that everyone is talking about it (here, there and everywhere) makes this series worthwhile. This is the purpose of art, to generate debate. It is, undoubtedly, very successful. Evan Peters' performance and dedication was amazing. I understand that the families of the victims may not like  this series, but there is no way to control a case that has gained such notoriety in the media... there are several series and films about the countless cases of true crimes, psychopaths, murderers. It is the portrait of human life, shown in the art of cinema to make the public think and reflect."
The Confrontation,People who earned a shit ton of money from series exploiting the families of victims stand by their gigantic money making machinr.
The Confrontation,I thought it was very well done. Evan Peters was amazing
The Confrontation,"I don‚Äôt understand backlash at all. This is one of the Netflix best show. Way to go.

LGBTQ tag could be only in shows where gay community is portray in a good light?"
The Confrontation,"The show was very good, I was aware of Dahmer beforehand but didn't know all the gruesome details, and it was made in a way that was very respectful to the victims and their families. Totally underserved backlash."
The Confrontation,"Good. True equality can't just be making stories about how every LGBTQ character is a victim/martyr/perfect. LGBTQ people are just people, just like everyone else, and are perfectly capable of being evil, too."
The Confrontation,"In this ""need to know"" age, I struggle when real people who knew victims or were family members cannot be left in peace when people like Murphy choose to revive horrors better left buried. I believe Mr. Murphy is lying through his teeth when asked whether family members were contacted. He legally does not have to, after all, and can make a buck without them. He does not care in the least that he is hurting people in the quest of his art. They don't count because, ummm, he is doing the public a service by telling the true story. Or something.

And yup, the series is a blazing success, with Golden Globe nominations, and yup, Dahmer is a Halloween favorite, once more torturing families. Gee, thanks Ryan. I'm so excited for you."
The Confrontation,eat shit Ryan Murphy
The Confrontation,Stand by it all you want. I‚Äôm still not watching it. I will be throwing similar sideeye at any future Ryan Murphy true life serial killer shows.
The Confrontation,Of course they do‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.money money money! Money.
The Confrontation,"I personally just don't like the true crime trend in general. They all have the same message - the US police force is terrible and likely wont solve your murder. 

These shows always focus on the individual but never seem to point out it isnt the same in other countries. It makes these people seem clever or evil when the reality is just that American society doesn't really look after its citizens. 

Dahmer like many killers is just a broken piece of shit that a healthy society would filter out early on."
The Confrontation,"There was absolutely no reason to make this series. Just do a documentary, not a fictionalized version with an actor known to be dreamy to the demographic that would watch this.

And his victim of choice was underage boys because he didn‚Äôt like body hair."
The Confrontation,I don't love a lot of RM's work but I thoroughly enjoyed this and thought the tone was perfect and deeply sympathetic and focused on the victims I a way I didn't expect. The realism did make me super uncomfortable but that's a win for me. I'm not a victim of his or of something remotely similar though so I can only comment as a viewer who appreciated how well it was made.
The Confrontation,The LGBTQ tag backfired epicly this time!
The Confrontation,I don't know what it is the victim's families wanted with involvement. Rewrite the script?
The Confrontation,"I really like Evan Peters and think he did a great job but tbh I didnt really like the show. Never finished it but I really didn't want to, wasn't even a ""oops forgot"" thing too..

Doesn't usually happen for me but something about the show just didn't sit well with me, not really sure what."
The Confrontation,"Translation: ""We made something that gave us attention and made us money, fuck everyone."""
The Confrontation,"Gross, I‚Äôll never support anything either of them are in.

It was a shameless cash grab and it‚Äôs clear no one wanted to be involved"
The Confrontation,"I remember once seeing My Friend Dahmer in a lgbt movie display and being taken aback a little bit, sure it‚Äôs a great movie about a gay man but not a movie about a great gay man and really stood out amongst all the much more celebratory movies around it."
The Confrontation,Such a good show
The Confrontation,Good. The woke bitches making this a problem need to stop fucking crying.
The Confrontation,Well then fuck them.
The Confrontation,"We live in a strange time.

If you depict rape in a medieval fantasy show you get widespread criticism, boycotts and backlash, so much so that the show creators apologize and change things

Make a show that actually happened to people about horrible murders and re-traumatize the victims families...

Who cares, still making season 2, guaranteed #1 on Netflix!"
The Confrontation,No interest in Dahmer. ‚Ä¶ An early Murphy dir. feature I saw was Eat Pray Love with Julia Roberts. Liked it a lot. ‚Ä¶ Good meditation-ish film.
The Confrontation,"Ryan Murphy's goal has never been to 'scare' people, it's to 'upset' them.  It's the cheap jump scare of the 21st century.  If I can't genuinely scare you, I'll do my best to offend you....and then pretend that I didn't."
The Confrontation,What a crock of shit! DAHMER is a fantastic show and Evan Peters knocked it out of the park! There was already documentaries and more out on DAHMER and to be honest and as unfortunate as it might be he is part of our history the same as many other horrible things
The Confrontation,"Even though Evan Peters is my dream boo, I feel like I‚Äôve read and watched enough about Jeffrey Dahmer. Also I don‚Äôt want to have confused sexual feelings about my dream boo."
The Confrontation,Did evan get rhinoplasty??
The Confrontation,"Honestly, RM made some decent points. His read on the LGBTQ tag drama was off though. The story was about a gay man & his relationships, it was also about both intimate & institutional homophobia.

For better or worse, Dahmer was a member of our community - that's just reality - and we need to come to terms with that."
The Confrontation,"I think the tag got misinterpreted. People immediately thought the tag implied Dahmer was some sort of lgbt icon, and were understandably offended. The social issues at play in the series weren‚Äôt apparent in the marketing, so that was lost on people. The tag also landed around a time when some influencers were half-joking about how hot Peters was as Dahmer, and how they would submit to whatever he wanted to do to them.   

A film about systemic racism would get a tag about civil rights, black voices, black history, etc. Dahmer was very much a story about lgbt rights in America at the time. His killing spree was enabled by homophobia at every turn. So the tag seems fitting after having watched the show."
The Confrontation,"Generally, that tag is used for stuff created by the LGBT community or with a story about that community. I get what you're saying, but it's still sort of gross tagging something like that solely because the victims are part of that community.

Edit: I'm not seeing a bunch of Exorcism movies in the Faith section of Netflix."
The Confrontation,"Yes!

I remember when the Dahmer story broke the news. I remember reading about it in the newspapers. I read everything about it...because it was insane.

They never made it clear how much racism and homophobia enabled him to keep killing. I never understood how significant this was until watching this series.

This series definitely deserves the tag. 

It might be ""bad optics"" on the surface level...but watching the series was an eye-opening experience about the wrongs inflicted on the black and gay communities at the time."
The Confrontation,"This was the first Dahmer tale to highlight the racism and homophobia of the Police force to my knowledge, not painting Dahmer as a genius, moreso that they looked the other way due to the nature of the victims. I think that‚Äôs a pretty important part of the story to tell."
The Confrontation,"On the contrary, I was caught completely off guard at just how many people had no idea who Dahmer was and what he did until that show came out. I understand I'm older and most of pop culture is driven by younger people, but I just assumed Jeffrey ""The Gay Cannibal"" Dahmer was just baked into public consciousness like Jack the Ripper or something.

I was baffled that just how many people legitimately had no clue about any of it until this came out."
The Confrontation,"Bundy and Dahmer are like the gateway drug of the true crime genre. I think the series was made to appeal more to casual audiences, who might be familiar with the name but aren't hardcore into true crime. 

The series was very popular, so can you really blame Netflix?"
The Confrontation,"Right, but that's almost the exact reason why I feel like it should be LESS of a big deal. I personally, have a fairly popular (for my area) murder/suicide in my family and I've just come to terms with it the best that I can. I can't make it go away and would never naively assume that just because it's not talked about that I would forget it. Realistically, there is no ""healing"" whether it's strewn about in pop culture or not."
The Confrontation,"I thought I knew about Jeffry dahmer but apparently I didn‚Äôt know anything about him.  I thought he murdered college girls but it turns out that was Ted Bundy, had no idea he was even gay.  Just because you have seen and know about his story doesn‚Äôt mean people in general have, which explains it being the #1 show on Netflix for a couple of weeks.  It was also a really well done show, which is another reason I enjoyed watching it, and I‚Äôm sure there are probably millions of others just like me, which is why it was so successful.  Not to mention it came out during the perfect time around Halloween where people enjoy watching fucked up shit.  Wednesday would‚Äôve been a perfect Halloween show too but apparently it didn‚Äôt matter it came out after so maybe it would‚Äôve been just as successful."
The Confrontation,"I am not a true crime fan, so I had no idea, while not surprised, about the racism and disregard when the neighbors were reporting issues. I really only watched it because I love Even Peters, and it was heart wrenching to see what the neighbors and victims went through. I agree that it‚Äôs an injustice to the victims families to constantly dredge up the trauma, but I learned a lot. The biggest take away is how diligent communities need to be, because police surely aren‚Äôt."
The Confrontation,"Right, I‚Äôve heard about this story so much I had no desire to watch any of the recent shows about it. There‚Äôs plenty of other stuff to make shows about, let‚Äôs move on."
The Confrontation,"Honestly when this came out I was wondering why hasn't there been anything done on Jeffrey Dahmer in the past. Outside of the Family Guy and late night talk show jokes of him being a cannibal. 

Never even knew of the the previous films that were made."
The Confrontation,Maybe the show would have been more interesting if we got a ‚Äúafter imprisonment‚Äù story. Him talking to detectives about why serial killers are the way they are. I listened to a podcast about it and it was pretty interesting stuff. His murders? I‚Äôve seen so many renditions of it already.
The Confrontation,"FWIW the show had a lot of inconsistencies with what actually happened in real life. I liked the show, and understood that it wasn't a documentary... But, some of the changes they made were weird and kind of misrepresenting the victims >!like Tony and Dahmer's relationship, which never happened like that and they were acquaintances at best IRL!< From that POV, I understand the criticisms (especially from the victim's families). But, I personally think that responsibility fell on Netflix more to market and present their product in a more transparent light (like, addressing that there were artistic interpretations to the show. And I certainly don't think that the show SHOULDNT have been made as a result."
The Confrontation,"> they didn‚Äôt make Dahmer seem like a hero

Hero? No.

Glamorous? Well, he was one of the most popular Halloween costumes this year."
The Confrontation,"I (27, M) had only heard vague references about the Milwaukee cannibal. I had no idea the extent of his crimes, the abhorrent response of the police, the fact he was gay.. really any of it. Thought it was well done while also being incredibly disturbing. I can also definitely see the families of the victims point of view and empathize with them as well"
The Confrontation,"> I really don‚Äôt understand the backlash from people

Did you understand the backlash to depictions of fictional rape in Game of Thrones and other shows?"
The Confrontation,"The series felt like a moneygrab book adaptation to me, like the story was just a vehicle for portraying gratuitous violence. They wanted to turn the victims' murders into entertainment. It didn't seem to offer any perspective or message. They just thought it would be cool. I can see why there would be backlash to that."
The Confrontation,"The tag, according to Netflix, celebrates LGBT culture. 

So no, I would argue the tag was not at all relevant according to Netflix's own interpretation of the tag they created."
The Confrontation,"> LGBT means that it portrays people that belong in the LGBT community.

It means that it‚Äôs of particular interest to an LGBT audience. LGBT people can of course enjoy this show as much as anyone, but having LGBT characters doesn‚Äôt automatically make it resonate with them. 

I don‚Äôt think this is a hill worth dying on, but I agree that people who make use of the LGBT search tag aren‚Äôt looking for something like this."
The Confrontation,"One difference is those other works don't center the killer in quite the same way. Dahmer tries to make the story about his victims too, but it takes some unfortunate creative liberties in doing so, and it's still fundamentally about him."
The Confrontation,"Based on this explanation, something like Cuties would be ok. Which it isn't."
The Confrontation,">LGBTQ tag could be only in shows where gay community is portray in a good light?

Well since the tag says it's for things which ""celebrate LGBT culture"", yeah pretty much."
The Confrontation,Same reason you wouldn‚Äôt call it a romance movie
The Confrontation,didnt Dahmer eat LGBTQ people? I think that would make them victims
The Confrontation,"You most likely never knew these families before this Dahmer series exploded like it did and they won't thank you for your attention to them either no matter your intentions. They never would have known this series would be released until people on social media couldn't stop talking about the victims and the family members portrayed in the show. It doesn't matter what your 2 cents are, they don't need you to speak for them or feel bad for them. They prefer you don't mention anything about this case."
The Confrontation,"Don't make a show about it, basically."
The Confrontation,who tf downvoted this harmless opinion?
The Confrontation,"They got their money before the show was made. Don't you know how Netflix works. Look up how much the director and writer for Squid Games made and you'll be shocked at how much he really got despite the fame the show got not to mention the cast and crew who got less than he did. Granted Netflix was risking a lot of money to greenlight these shows but the outcome and response by viewers astounds the creators, cast, and crew especially when the content is controversial just as much as the general public feels. RM can't realistically pay anyone outside of the cast and crew due to the contract with Netflix. It's a shameless cash grab for the families who demand compensation after more than 30 years when they already got about $10 million each for immediate family members after Dahmer's trial and sentencing. You need to do more careful research on Netflix and Dahmer because you look like you know nothing and repeating what every edgelord keyboard warriors has been saying like a broken record. Nobody is listening to that."
The Confrontation,"Well, not all gay men are great, you know."
The Confrontation,"You think the same people compain about one thing and ""accept"" the other? It doesn't work like that.

Also families of the victims didn't Need to watch the show."
The Confrontation,"Yeah, I never really understood the backlash against the LGBTQ tag specifically. And if we‚Äôre gonna be honest, for other marginalized communities (especially BIPOC communities), we don‚Äôt get to pick and choose how we‚Äôre represented in the media. I can‚Äôt tell you how many stories that highlight so much negativity are made about stories from the Black community all the time. Yet, no one has made any attempt to remove those stories from the ‚ÄúAfrican American history‚Äù tag. That‚Äôs just part of our history, and it needs to be acknowledged, good or bad. 

The fact of the matter is that despite the fact that this is a negative story, this event DID affect the LGBTQ community and DID involve homophobia. You have to take the good with the bad."
The Confrontation,"The problem is that some people just want to display the good and forget the bad exist. We all have both, every group has good stories and bad and people need to understand that, you shouldn't generalize and most don't. The fact that this Dahmer story is a perfect example how homophobia basically allowed this to happen is really important for people to see."
The Confrontation,Is that exactly what RM is saying here?
The Confrontation,">Generally, that tag is used for stuff created by the LGBT community

Like Ryan Murphy?"
The Confrontation,"Personally, I feel like it can be in the LGBT section because it has a lot to do with it. I feel like the sections are pretty ambiguous anyways and random things get put in random sections. But you make a good point about the exorcism not being in the faith section. In my opinion it could be and it would make sense. I haven‚Äôt seen anyone actually have a good argument against your point."
The Confrontation,"Jeffrey Dahmer no matter what a monster he was, was still a gay man. Lots of episodes take part in gay bars. It may be exploitative but they get the atmosphere/tone of those gay bars right, its fairly accurate. You can‚Äôt pick and choose depictions. Similarly films about slavery are still Black history."
The Confrontation,">> Generally, that tag is used for stuff created by the LGBT community or **with a story about that community**. I get what you're saying, but it's still sort of gross tagging something like that solely because the victims are part of that community.


‚Ä¶but it is a story about the LGBTQ community, so by your definition, this series would fall under that tag. Dahmer was a gay man. Most of his victims were gay BIPOC men. Homophobia was one of the main institutional systems that prevented Dahmer from being caught multiple times. It‚Äôs a negative story that features real people from the community, but it still affected the community regardless.

And like I told someone else here, those of us who are in other marginalized communities don‚Äôt get to pick and choose how we‚Äôre represented in media. Good or bad, we have a TON of stories that fall under the ‚ÄúAfrican-American history‚Äù or ‚ÄúBlack history month‚Äù tags that no one in Hollywood would remove. A lot of us don‚Äôt like seeing new Emmett Till movies come out every other year, but it‚Äôs a story that still needs to be told. If it affected the community, then it affected the community, period. It‚Äôs just one of those things where you have to take the good with the bad, and hope that people learn from the history."
The Confrontation,"Systemic homophobia enabled his crimes. 

The series raises awareness of how homophobia enabled his crimes."
The Confrontation,">solely because the victims are part of that community.

And the star, and the creator.."
The Confrontation,"To add to this, it‚Äôs also the first major depiction to put some focus on how Dahmer hunted people of color because he knew the police wouldn‚Äôt look in to their disappearances much. 

This story also put a good bit of focus on the black neighbor and the black survivor that ultimately brought justice to Dahmer‚Äôs doorstep."
The Confrontation,"Well that's also a very American viewpoint. Netflix has a huge market that is not the US, and I can imagine that there's way more non-US people that don't know anything about serial killers in the US.

I'm a 30 year old man and I didnt know anything about American serial killers if it weren't for TV shows about them."
The Confrontation,"I didn't know who he was, but I'm also not American."
The Confrontation,I‚Äôm one of those millions of people.  Why does it baffle you lol
The Confrontation,"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs baffling. I was a teen when Dahmer was caught, and all I learned was that he was a cannibal. Personally, that was enough information for me‚Ä¶ it was disturbing enough as it was, didn‚Äôt want to go further down that rabbit hole and discover more horrid stuff."
The Confrontation,"The only reason I knew anything about him was he was crazy and a serial killer, because of the HIMYM episode with the Dobler-Dahmer theory. I then went and had to google."
The Confrontation,"So if netflix decided to make a show about that murder/suicide without asking any of your family, you'd have no reaction?"
The Confrontation,All of that was in there.
The Confrontation,It really wasn't. A handful of assholes tried it and rightfully got called out.
The Confrontation,What was there backlash over that for? Was it glorifying/promoting it?
The Confrontation,No
The Confrontation,"I'm not sure if you watched it but there was actually very little gore or violence, which I really appreciated. They showed the absolute bare minimum required in order to get the point across about what Dahmer did. Considering the subject matter and Ryan Murphy's other work, I would call it downright restrained."
The Confrontation,"Gratuitous violence?

Did you watch the show?"
The Confrontation,"certain genres in Hollywood are pure exploitation,  not sure why Dahmer has to be seen under a different light. It's still exploitation, same as many, many war movies denouncing that war is ugly while at the same time celebrating the violence of it because it sells"
The Confrontation,"I just want to point out that the description Netflix gave the tag was ""celebrates LGBT culture"""
The Confrontation,Yeah I understand that- it gives him recognition and fame that he doesn't deserve- I personally haven't much interest in the show- I find the subject matter too unpleasant to spend an entire series with. I think its a difficult thing- depicting real things- and the lines aren't always clear between exploitation and something creatively worthwhile
The Confrontation,"I worded my comment badly, then. My point was that you can't just say ""this isn't our community!"" just because the character is deeply flawed."
The Confrontation,"He also ate completely straight people too, just for the record. A handful of his victims had children of their own."
The Confrontation,That seems fair. Doesn't matter if they make Dahmer the villain. This show was clearly and shamelessly made to appeal to the huge audience that loves to gawk at real life murder drama. I'd be bothered too.
The Confrontation,The audience for true crime stuff is huge. Demand creates the supply.
The Terminal,What are the odds the author actually watched the show? So far 3 episodes in and its fucking great
The Terminal,"‚ÄúThe Terminal List‚Äòs plot defies logic‚Äù


The series is based off a fictional book. And the author  was heavy involved in the series. 

This is just another horrible review. 

Honestly, why are movie critics still a thing? 

Then have people in the comments trashing it before even seeing it. SMH"
The Terminal,35% RT critic score 93% audience score‚Ä¶ Bingo. Anytime I see that it‚Äôs a must watch for me. First Ep was great!
The Terminal,Serious action man Pratt doesn‚Äôt work for me. I prefer goofball who switches between being the butt of the joke and delivering the joke. I just can‚Äôt take him seriously
The Terminal,"Must have been too busy perfecting his Mario voice to deliver in this one, oh well"
The Terminal,"Does great comedic acting on tv show. 

Studio hires him for a semi comedic leading man role in super hero movie. 

Then he‚Äôs now just a leading man leaving all comedy behind‚Ä¶.and IMO it‚Äôs shit. Not good."
The Terminal,Not understanding the hate. I'm 4 eps in and it's been good. Doesn't feel outlandish. Which makes sense being the guy who wrote it was a seal. Touches on some very credible issues. And end of the day this is an action series and the action is very visceral and paced well IMO. No complaints here.
The Terminal,"Chris Pratt's streaming movies have all been bad.

""We need to take you all into the future to fight a war!""

""Why don't we just solve the problem now in the past?""

""NEVERTHELESS We need to take you into the future for reasons!"""
The Terminal,what's with Pratt doing these bad action films with Amazon. They must be paying him a lot.
The Terminal,"Rt: 38% critic , 91% audience 

Another great show and another great example of critics not knowing shit. 

I‚Äôm glad I stopped taking critics seriously.


‚Äî‚Äî

Edit: Update

Rt: 40% critic, 95% audience"
The Terminal,[deleted]
The Terminal,"My headcanon is that Ryan Reynolds gets all the comedy/action dude  direct to streaming roles, leaving Pratt to scoop up the sloppy seconds. I will not be accepting questions at this time."
The Terminal,"3 episodes in, and it's not too shabby.

Though I continue to be irritated by suppressors being shown to be whisper quiet."
The Terminal,"If people are wanting a good action series on Amazon, I would like to direct you to Reacher over this.  Trust me, Reacher is better and they are adapting one of the god tier books for Season 2 so its gonna be even better next year.  
  
Edit : The second season is based on Bad Luck and Trouble."
The Terminal,"This show was amazing lol, have people even watched it?"
The Terminal,"His skill is in his comedic timing and everyman 'likeablity' (although the more abs you have the less that applies) - totally mis-cast as a gruff, military tough guy imo, as he doesn't really have much range."
The Terminal,Lol it was a perfectly fine bingable show with some cool moments I was actually shocked when I saw just how bad the reviews were. I finished it in 2 days and was entertained the entire time
The Terminal,"I don't really care about Chris Pratt, but I do want to see Taylor Kitsch in better shows and movies than this."
The Terminal,"They‚Äôre trying so hard to make him the new ‚ÄúIconic Leading Man‚Äù like Tom Cruise and The Rock and they‚Äôre failing time and time again, I doubt we‚Äôll see him in much after around 5 years or so"
The Terminal,Much better than the recent Netflix movies
The Terminal,"Chris Pratt hasn't done good work since GotG 1. He left the best parts of him behind with ""Andy"" from Parks and Rec."
The Terminal,I like this show so far
The Terminal,8.2 on IMDB. Seems good to me.
The Terminal,Just binged it straight through.  Great show
The Terminal,"Wait, whats wrong with Jack Ryan and Reacher. Especially reacher, I thought people liked that series ??"
The Terminal,I still think its cool. Taylor Kitsch is why I will like it. Idk why but Taylor just kills it in every military role he plays for me
The Terminal,This show is beast.   Whoever don‚Äôt like it can go watch some king of queens type shit.
The Terminal,IMDb viewers give it a 8.2/10‚Ä¶. Haven‚Äôt seen it yet but sounds like the antipratts have arrived
The Terminal,I feel bad for Taylor Kitsch in this. He has had some bad luck with choosing roles. He is good in all of them but the overall thing has been bad for one reason or another and it's never him or his fault.
The Terminal,"Just watched this where it gets to the MRI scene and laughed out loud as two assassins walk into the scanner room with a tonne of metal on them

Unless they were using completely non magnetic metals for their guns, knives and kit then it wouldn‚Äôt really have gone down they way it does

Even when we leaves the room there is a sign that says ‚Äúalways on‚Äù"
The Terminal,He has also said he doesnt like to be Called Chris all of a sudden.
The Terminal,"Okay, this has to be the most off base review I've ever read. If this isn't the best show in the small screen right now then I must just be an idiot."
The Terminal,"93% audience score, 30% reviewer score. When can we all just agree to stop using review sites, and the ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù reviewers can go and get real jobs?"
The Terminal,I‚Äôm so tired of these copy paste action flicks that have been the same since forever. I will always pick quality over quantity but due to the creative block in Hollywood we are receiving the latter. It‚Äôs so tiresome watching these major movie studios purchase IP that has potential only to squander it in the end.
The Terminal,"The Terminal List was awesome and Chris Pratt shined. I really liked it, and clearly a lot of other people did too because it has a 90% audience rating on Rotten Tomatoes despite the critics panning it."
The Terminal,Reddit just rooting for Chris Pratt to fail now. Geuss he's a long way from the GotG love.
The Terminal,"A lot of you don‚Äôt know Jack Carr envisioned only Chris Pratt to play the part when Jack wrote the book. Chris also liked the book and agreed to do it. And apparently they have a bunch of military guys on set so they make it realistic. So if the bad reviews are because he‚Äôs not doing super cool unrealistic stuff, then that would make sense."
The Terminal,Almost no one has seen this show yet and there are so many people on here saying it‚Äôs bad.  It‚Äôs not even released yet.  I don‚Äôt understand why all these people post opinions as if they saw the show when they clearly didn‚Äôt.  Did everyone in these comments go to a screening?
The Terminal,The show is incredible.
The Terminal,I love this show so far. Pratt is killing it. Critics can eat shit
The Terminal,The show was actually pretty good I enjoyed it. The only thing I didn‚Äôt enjoy was the show being filmed so dark. Like half the time the dark scenes were barely even able to be seen
The Terminal,"Y'ALL ARE TRIPPING, THE SERIES WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!"
The Terminal,"""*...we‚Äôre served up huge helpings of red-meat masculinity, hardheaded jingoism and heavy-handed symbolism. (Oh, and lots and lots of American flags.)*""

This is exactly the point. This is exactly the audience the book was written for, and it makes sense that the TV version is just that, but for the illiterate.

Not saying I approve, because I'm not the target audience for this, but a little awareness wouldn't hurt anybody."
The Terminal,I really liked it! Not sure where the hate is coming from.
The Terminal,Shows good y‚Äôall are just stupid
The Terminal,This show was fucking great.
The Terminal,OP counting his circlejerk-fueled karma knowing he was probably wrong. Tool.
The Terminal,show was badass
The Terminal,I always take these reviews with a grain of salt.  Because I thought Bright was awesome.
The Terminal,"I don‚Äôt know, I think it looks very badass. Of course I‚Äôm biased as a fan and reader of Jack Carr."
The Terminal,"They were filming one or more episodes in my neighborhood last year, got to meet him briefly when he came out and said hi to everyone."
The Terminal,8 rating on IMDb apparently? Shilled?
The Terminal,"Just got done with the second episode and I think it‚Äôs pretty fucking good, this coming from a guy who just saw the new Jurassic park which was a reeeeeeal stinker so I have no love for Chris but this article seems like they would have said this shit about the series anyways because he‚Äôs become so controversial recently"
The Terminal,"What a terrible review. This series might completely suck, but the author‚Äôs personal bias shines through brightly. Poorly written, chock-full of buzzwords, it reads as someone who hates action reviewing action. 

You have to get way too far into the article to actually discuss the show. It‚Äôs lazy."
The Terminal,It was good. Good enough for me.
The Terminal,Y‚Äôall are faded if you don‚Äôt like Pratt in this. From his forearms handling to his mannerisms he nailed it.
The Terminal,Enjoyed it a lot.
The Terminal,I quite liked it - Revenge story done right.
The Terminal,I love when things aren‚Äôt even out and people decide to shit on it. Read a book or go outside instead of complaining all the time. And yes I see the irony in what I‚Äôm doing.
The Terminal,The book was awesome and I‚Äôve been looking forward to the show. I won‚Äôt let the tvline.com deter me from seeing it.
The Terminal,In the simplest terms; If you don't like this series then it wasn't made for you. I'm excited for it honestly. Especially since the author was allowed quite a bit of leeway with the graphic violence adapted from the book.
The Terminal,"I really enjoyed terminal list. Lots of good action scenes and  a decent story, reminds me of 24."
The Terminal,This Chris Pratt hate is weird.
The Terminal,[deleted]
The Terminal,Chris Pratt got muscles but hes no tough guy.
The Terminal,"Those locked elbows in the thumbnail, oh you already know it‚Äôs gonna be great."
The Terminal,"Pity. The books are great.

EDIT: After watching five episodes of the Terminal List, I have to come back to this post. The person who wrote the article is a fucking idiot. The show is fine. It has some really good moments and the rest of it has enough good rhythm that you watch and you don't get bored."
The Terminal,90% liked this show yet 41% on rotten tomatoes LOLLL they need to just go back to cnn and cheer for Biden
The Terminal,Idk why people don‚Äôt get it. He was only good in Guardians and Parks. The Jurassic movies would have made a billion with any competent actor. Everything else he leads is not enjoyable.
The Terminal,[removed]
The Terminal,You guys all definitely determined your opinion before watching the show‚Ä¶
The Terminal,"Two guarantees when it comes to Chris Pratt movies:  
1) Hollywood journalists will make every effort to dunk on him as he‚Äôs pretty much been labeled as a Republican. 
2) the movie won‚Äôt be very good"
The Terminal,"It‚Äôs actually a great show, clearly designed for a certain audience, everyone I‚Äôve seen trashing it seems to not understand some on the nuances this show perfects. It‚Äôs a 10/10 for me"
The Terminal,"He‚Äôs trying to do Burt Macklin, FBI seriously now?"
The Terminal,Lol Reddit doesn‚Äôt like Pratt anymore
The Terminal,"Oh, put your shirt on, already"
The Terminal,"Why is Chriss Pratt and Michael B Jordan in every stupid action movie nowadays? They both suck at it, too serious with no charisma at all. Why do studios not stick them with the stuff they're actually good at?"
The Terminal,"Show is not too terrible if you don't expect it to have much in common with the book.
Probably be better if you have not read the book at all."
The Terminal,did the colors seemed muted for other people too when watching it in HDR? or is it something to do with my TV?
The Terminal,"Perfectly fine show. Not amazing, but not terrible either. I enjoyed it. The flashbacks got annoying. Some of the plot was iffy. But overall entertaining. I sometimes enjoy watching the unstoppable man/women on a revenge mission complete with a happy ending. It's an easy watch. These critics and journalists should be more upfront about being biased. Or simply not review something that they hate before even watching."
The Terminal,I started the book and have to say I thought it was pretty bad. Maybe I should give the whole thing a chance but it‚Äôs seriously jingoistic in a way I found kind of off putting and I have a lot of tolerance for it (I really like Jack Ryan and Reacher). The prose isn‚Äôt great and the author does little to hide his right wing conspiracy thoughts about democrats and Benghazi.
The Terminal,"If this critic doesn‚Äôt like it, it must be a fantastic series, I, for one will be glued to this series"
The Terminal,"Oh please. It‚Äôs probably fine, no worse than that last action film he made for Amazon. Critics just love to dogpile on Pratt because he dares to be Christian and speaks openly about his faith. 
Boo hoo. 
This is a stupid popcorn action flick, not Shawshank Redemption or The Godfather. 
Lower your expectations accordingly."
The Terminal,"wait why so much hate. I just finished Episode 1 and thought it was REALLY solid all around (directing, casting, action, script, etc). maybe it will fall off but so far so good"
The Terminal,"Untrue . I just finished watching it , and Wow . What a great adaptation to a book that I never read.  Honestly you forget it's Pratt he's so bulked up and deadpan , but he really pulls it off. Congrats Pratt for finding another level."
The Terminal,"Just binged it, straight through.  Loved it.  I enjoyed as much as Jack Ryan on Prime and probably more than the Jack Reacher series."
The Terminal,???????? This was great.
The Terminal,Review makes the show sound badass. Can‚Äôt wait for it.
The Terminal,"to be honest, I hadn't heard of this show before reading this. 

I've added it to my queue now, this review made it sound awesome.  I mean, you had me at ""crude bursts of graphic violence"", you can stop selling it."
The Terminal,I really enjoyed the books and I think Chris is going to do a good job portraying him. The character isn't your quintessential juiced up version of a seal that many movies like to show. From what I've seen and read he's tried to make it as authentic as possible.
The Terminal,I have a hunch this writer doesn't support Elon Musk buying Twitter either.
The Terminal,"Everything about Chris Pratt's career+public persona after getting Guardians of the Galaxy seems like it was engineered in lab to produce ""relatable action hero guy"". It reminds me when Hollywood tried to make Jai Courtney a thing (loved him in Spartacus, no hate) but Chris Pratt is actually getting booked in everything"
The Terminal,"In fairness, he‚Äôs been railroaded and hated for almost no reason at all other than he isn‚Äôt outwardly woke. He won‚Äôt be cast in anything good for a while"
The Terminal,Anyone make the mistake of seeing all of (or some of) The Tomorrow War? It was SO bad. He absolutely cannot pull off a lead role in an action film. He is the comedian in an ensemble. Full stop.
The Terminal,We all know not to listen to ANY movie critics after the Dave Chappelle rotten tomatoes incident. Watch a movie and judge for yourself friends. Don‚Äôt listen to biased online movie critics with an agenda
The Terminal,"The book is pretty good, so I'll check this out. Book is straight up violence with a dash of plot to keep it moving."
The Terminal,New Jurassic World Movie was absolute Raptor shit.
The Terminal,That photo. Oof.
The Terminal,But does Tom Hanks ever make it out of that airport ?
The Terminal,Listen to the latest episode of smartless. This is his ex green beret/navy seal (or something) best friend‚Äôs script and Pratt is producing. Didn‚Äôt sound like a good recipe.
The Land of Hypocrisy,"Hosts so far this season: Miles Teller, Brendan Gleeson, Megan Thee Stallion, Jack Harlow, and Amy Schumer. 

I love Brendan Gleeson but hes not exactly super popular in America. Looking at that list it's not surprising at all to see Chappelle pull the highest numbers."
The Land of Hypocrisy,"""he police, ain't he?"" Barber skit was great."
The Land of Hypocrisy,The way he says ‚Äògod damn‚Äô cracks me every time
The Land of Hypocrisy,It's almost like people like Chappelle
The Land of Hypocrisy,The black heaven skit was one of the last times I remember actually laughing out loud at SNL since the last time Chappelle hosted.
The Land of Hypocrisy,"Why is ""it's almost like"" such a common refrain in this thread? It's fucking weird. CTRL+F that shit, it's everywhere."
The Land of Hypocrisy,‚ÄúFuck yo dragon!‚Äù
The Land of Hypocrisy,"Honestly, my favorite episode of the season so far. Most all of the sketches were on point"
The Land of Hypocrisy,He should bring back The Chappelle Show-just do it on SNL.
The Land of Hypocrisy,[deleted]
The Land of Hypocrisy,"I have to admit, it was the best episode of the season so far."
The Land of Hypocrisy,"Interesting framing here by Tony Maglio at IndieWire (btw: really shitty clickfarm, IndieWire. You're not getting news from there. You're getting Geek Culture hackwork rewritten from actual news releases found somewhere else)

1. the rating provided (0.90) is strictly for the 18-49 demo. Granted, pretty solid representation of who SNL is trying to court, so it makes sense, but it's still a qualification.
2. the viewer number (which isn't explained at how it arrived there, it's just given) is about 500k higher than the previous leader for this year, Amy Schumer (weird how ""it's almost like people like Schumer"" wasn't a common refrain there, LOL) and as the IndieWire article points out (with no real backup or clarification) is behind both Jake Gyllenhaal AND Will Ferrell's outings, according to Maglio (who, again - sucks at this).

As it turns out, compared to other guests from the past calendar year, Dave Chappelle was a full point better than Kim Kardashian (3.8 rating), dead-even with Kieran Culkin (4.89), and behind guests including:

Jonathan Majors (4.97), Billie Eilish (5.16), Paul Rudd (5.15), Arianna DeBose (5.05), and Willem Dafoe (4.97).

That Chappelle's episode got to 4.8 isn't that remarkable. The large preponderance of guests for SNL's previous season also hovered around that same range, and his jump from Schumer's hosting job isn't particularly remarkable, either.

Again - in 2005, this would have been the hottest episode of SNL ever. But in 2022 it's just run of the mill. It's not remarkable, not in the way IndieWire is framing it."
The Land of Hypocrisy,It almost like the people screeching on Twitter and reddit aren‚Äôt representative of most people
The Land of Hypocrisy,His opening monologue was fantastic.
The Land of Hypocrisy,Can‚Äôt believe how canceled he is.
The Land of Hypocrisy,Nice going for a cancelled man.
The Land of Hypocrisy,lol hilarious this is 56% upvoted rn
The Land of Hypocrisy,"Yet another cancel culture victim, oh wait"
The Land of Hypocrisy,Someone please cancel me too
The Land of Hypocrisy,And he will still complain about being cancelled.
The Land of Hypocrisy,"You‚Äôre allowed to laugh, you‚Äôre allowed to cringe, your allowed to have complicated emotions about numerous topics. Dave isn‚Äôt the devil, and neither are you if you like him, or dislike him."
The Land of Hypocrisy,I think Chappelle should revisit why he left the Chappelle show.  Then apply that to his jokes on Jews as well as his attacks on Trans people.  Somehow he is disconnecting them.
The Land of Hypocrisy,"Even my wife laughed at it, and she has trouble understanding a lot of humor. Dave‚Äôs delivery on most of his stuff is fantastic, even if he‚Äôs a bit of a polarizing figure. She liked the Megan episode too.

It hasn‚Äôt been bad this season, imo, some skits have bombed but it happens."
The Land of Hypocrisy,"Every time someone gets through an attempted cancellation, the people who desperately wish it worked pretend it's evidence there's no cancel culture.

The NRA should start pretending people surviving gunshot wounds prove guns aren't lethal."
The Land of Hypocrisy,The show felt like an unaired episode of the Chappelle Show.
The Land of Hypocrisy,"Wow, *so* cancelled."
The Land of Hypocrisy,Highest viewership in nearly 4 years and some of the best ratings in roughly 20 (that‚Äôs what some article titles say I have not read any of them beyond the titles)
The Land of Hypocrisy,BLACK STAR
The Land of Hypocrisy,The monologue timing with the chain is so good.
The Land of Hypocrisy,they got the most viewers when someone funny was on the show? I don't think i can explain that.
The Land of Hypocrisy,No shit. It‚Äôs almost like‚Ä¶ the show has terrible writers and has had them for years now
The Land of Hypocrisy,Imagine that
The Land of Hypocrisy,"Should really say Dave Chapelle and Black Star. I know he's the main draw for a lot of people, but I'm sure the first appearance back for a legendary group like them also drew some people (like me)."
The Land of Hypocrisy,And it still blew. SNL is far past its prime.
The Land of Hypocrisy,I'm just thinking about how this guy complained about getting cancelled.
The Land of Hypocrisy,My potato hole.
The Land of Hypocrisy,He‚Äôs a god damn legend for that monologue
The Land of Hypocrisy,"Chappelle will always be funny. If you can‚Äôt take a joke, don‚Äôt listen. No one is forcing you. Crazy idea, I know."
The Land of Hypocrisy,But reddit hates him and was saying he‚Äôs cancelled?ü§îüò±
The Land of Hypocrisy,It was refreshing to see SNL be funny again for an episode.
The Land of Hypocrisy,Chapelle is a national treasure
The Land of Hypocrisy,Another cancelled comedian struggling to make a comeback. What a shame. /s
The Land of Hypocrisy,Because he's actually funny.
The Land of Hypocrisy,Ricky Gervais next
The Land of Hypocrisy,The world needs more comedy.
The Land of Hypocrisy,"""That my friends is the sound of applause!"""
The Land of Hypocrisy,Imo Chappelle and Gleason had the only good SNL episodes so far this season
The Land of Hypocrisy,Love to see it.
The Land of Hypocrisy,If there‚Äôs a favorite American past time it‚Äôs watching hasbeens slowly burn themselves.
The Land of Hypocrisy,Biggest ratings of a bad season.
The Land of Hypocrisy,Bring back the chappelle show
The Land of Hypocrisy,Wow those writers sure did cancel him
The Land of Hypocrisy,"Dude did a 15 minute opening monologue and killed the audience the way Netflix stand up specials do in 1 hour

Every post about Dave Chappelle gets brigaded hard af by people who are still butthurt about the Netflix shit."
The Land of Hypocrisy,"Oh gee, it‚Äôs almost like outrage is manufactured to increase viewership and thereby increase ad revenue."
The Land of Hypocrisy,Didn‚Äôt the season just start lol
The Land of Hypocrisy,No one watches snl unless someone like chappelle is on.
The Land of Hypocrisy,That 13 min monologue was really funny.
The Land of Hypocrisy,Funniest SNL in a long time. Brilliant
The Land of Hypocrisy,Damn you believe how cancelled this guy is
The Land of Hypocrisy,Yeh because he is actually funny
The Land of Hypocrisy,"It was a great episode. But just like clockwork there were a million articles talking about him being antisemitic or whatever which is absurd...but even more absurd than that was an article I saw bashing him for not addressing his Trans stuff...I'm sorry WHAT?!?! How can the man win? He mentions it, you're mad cuz he won't shut up about it, now it seems he's moved on and you're mad that he's not still talking about it. Get real."
The Land of Hypocrisy,Again proving that Reddit‚Äôs opinion is the minority
The Land of Hypocrisy,They not gonna like this
The Land of Hypocrisy,"The number of articles that pop up every time Dave Chappeles name is even whispered is incredible. 1% are positive. The rest are clickbaity let‚Äôs cancel the mofo because They once heard him say something they didn‚Äôt agree with or heard someone say they heard him say something they thought someone might disagree with. Solution is simple. If you don‚Äôt like him, don‚Äôt watch him. Don‚Äôt buy the sold out tickets for his shows."
The Land of Hypocrisy,Fuck cancel culture.
The Land of Hypocrisy,"Reposting my reply to another commenter for visibility, but to the numerous commenters ridiculing Chapelle as an antisemite, please rethink your knee-jerk outrage-conditioned response.

In his monologue, Chapelle said that he's been to Hollywood, and realistically, there are a ton of Jewish people in leadership positions in all of corporate, especially in Hollywood. He implies that coming to that realization is, arguably, a natural one. He goes on to imply that there are ""non-conspiratorial"" reasons this might be the case. Then he explicitly says that Kanye pointing it out in such a random, incendiary way (DEATHCON 3) IS HOWEVER PSYCHOTIC.Chapelles monologue is a masterclass in social commentary, storytelling, and comedy. I don't think it's as simple as what these naysayers are trying to make it out to be, i.e Kanye evil! Chapelle evil! Chapelle is antisemitic! I don't think that's what Chapelle is trying to get across at all. He's commenting on a situation and making fun of the ridiculousness of it as well as some of the veiled truth of it.

&#x200B;

*""HO HUM... What about where he said a group of jewish people was a coincidence and nobody should talk about it? ISN'T HE AN ANTISEMITE?"" asks a mouth breathing troglodyte.*

&#x200B;

That is in fact the point of the joke. It's edgy humor. He isn't sitting on either side of any fence, except perhaps the fence of reason. Think about it. He dunks on Kanye, then admits that Kanye used to say some funny and insightful things in the past. He dunks on a black republican calling him a mouth breather, then dunks on the democrats because they were being salty losers. He says Trump was a star for being so radically honest about the corrupt system, then dunks on him for being a grifting, evil colluder. DUNKS ON THE RIDICULOUSNESS OF  ANTISEMITIC CONSPIRACY THEORIES, THEN ENDS HIS MONOLOGUE BY BEGGING THE SHADOWY POWERS THAT BE NOT TO STEAL HIS JOB. He's a comedian. If you're this upset that he's making fun of Jewish people in such a lighthearted way, while simultaneously making fun of the ridiculous people that are spouting antisemitic rhetoric, you probably shouldn't consume any more media because you lack the level headedness and critical thinking capacity to digest it and think for yourself.


Further edit for the subsequent mouth breathing troglodytes: 


Chapelle is literally making fun of holocaust deniers during his monologue. He says Jewish people have been through horrible things all over the world and he goes on a long tangent saying black people have been through their own fair share of problems and Kyrie in particular wasn't anywhere near the Holocaust when it happened. And this next part is how you know for sure thay it's satirical. He says Kyries not even sure the Holocaust happened. *That's the punchline.*

It's funny because Chapelles essentially saying that someone doubting whether or not the Holocaust happened is absolutely ridiculous. It 100% happened. He's calling Kyrie the worst kind of idiot here.

Chapelle leads the listener on a wild goose chase of ups and downs, implying that maybe black people shouldn't be blamed for the Jews problems. Then he ends his mini monologue by fully implying that of course they CAN AND SHOULD be held accountable, especially in the case of an idiot like Kyrie that probably denies the Holocaust even happened."
The Land of Hypocrisy,"First time I‚Äôve even watched a clip from SNL in years, granted it was online and not the show itself. Great job Chapelle, that monologue was heavy duty! Saying a ton of wild shit and they still can‚Äôt cancel him"
The Land of Hypocrisy,Makes sense he‚Äôs a hilarious comedian and his writing on the Chappelle show was fantastic
The Land of Hypocrisy,This was the best episode in recent memory.
The Land of Hypocrisy,Chappelle is fantastic. The fake outrage is goofy as shit.
The Land of Hypocrisy,He crushed that intro!
The Land of Hypocrisy,"How many posts have we seen complaining about Chapelle being cancelled, literally dozens, and here he is breaking records for viewership.  Someone is full of shit."
The Land of Hypocrisy,Black Star is why I watched.
The Land of Hypocrisy,I thought he got cancelled or something?
The Land of Hypocrisy,Best episode
The Land of Hypocrisy,True
The Land of Hypocrisy,You go Dave!
The Land of Hypocrisy,"That was the great most authentic, honest and real monologue I‚Äôve ever seen. Dave Chapelle would make an incredible leader."
The Land of Hypocrisy,Dave Chappell becoming what Eminem thought he was. ‚ÄúNow this looks like a job for me cuz we need a little controversy‚Ä¶ cuz it feels so empty without DC‚Äù  neHNeHNEHnEhNEh
The Land of Hypocrisy,Hate watching?
The Land of Hypocrisy,Epic
The Land of Hypocrisy,He loves making jokes at the expense of literally everyone!! Which is why I love him.. Oh wait except for Muslims..weird..but I still do genuinely love his comedy
The Land of Hypocrisy,I honestly didn't find his monologue that funny?
The Land of Hypocrisy,"I don't get it. Chappelles Show was one of the funniest shows on television. He had some monumental specials back in the day. These days, I dunno. And its not being offended or thinking you can't tell jokes about certain subjects. It's just the last couple specials I saw (that double special he released on Netflix a few years back) was fucking boring. I don't find him edgy, I just find him dull now."
The Land of Hypocrisy,This is your reminder that most of America is normal.
The Land of Hypocrisy,People just tuned in for the monologue
The Land of Hypocrisy,"It‚Äôs so funny how all I saw were posts bashing him. Then (since I would never watch SNL) I looked it up and it was masterful comedy. 

I wonder if the 4.8m viewers included YouTube and other apps.. I‚Äôm betting it does. And how many viewers actually watched all of the SNL episode?"
The Land of Hypocrisy,Dave Chapelle is the man.
The Land of Hypocrisy,It was that good!!
The Land of Hypocrisy,The GOAT
The Land of Hypocrisy,And he has been canceled?  Ok
The Land of Hypocrisy,Because there was real comedy on for once.
The Land of Hypocrisy,"Oh wait, I thought he got cancel cultured! /s"
The Land of Hypocrisy,"Every single time he comes out with a special or gets on stage there are people who get outraged at his jokes, or websites pretend to for clicks. He hasn‚Äôt said anything egregious and for people to act like he does all the time is ridiculous. I‚Äôm glad SNL decided to have him out there because I‚Äôm all for cancel culture if someone deserves it, but he hasn‚Äôt done shit and people need to chill because nobody gives a shit."
The Land of Hypocrisy,So much for some of the writers boycotting this episode LMAO
The Land of Hypocrisy,And it was fucking hilarious.
The Land of Hypocrisy,Dave Chappelle is the GOAT.
The Land of Hypocrisy,Antisemitism is indeed very popular
The Land of Hypocrisy,Dave Chappelle is hilarious
The Land of Hypocrisy,"Dave Chappelle is probably too good to be on SNL anyway.  
That man is a comedic genius while SNL  has turned into shit in the recent years.  


Who the fuck even thinks Miles Teller, Brendan Gleeson, Megan Thee Stallion, Jack Harlow, and Amy Schumer are funny?"
This Evening,this is truly one thing I look forward to all year.

This Evening,LOVVVVE Charlie. He's like a modern David frost. 
This Evening,Is there gonna be an uncut/extended version?
This Evening,"Great show, but Barry Shitpeas and Philomena Cunk are not my cup of tea"
This Evening,As an American I like lemonade
This Evening,"Can't wait to see how he's going to try and bring up the so-called ""fake news epidemic"" whilst avoiding how the BBC were arguably one of the biggest perpetrators."
This Evening,I wonder if he'll even be able to include the George Michael and Carrie fisher stuff.  So much has happened in just the past few days 
This Evening,This and The Big Fat Quiz of 2016 are my week after Christmas guilty pleasures.
This Evening,Me too. Watching him blast 2016 is going to be really cathartic.
This Evening,Cox: Yes.
This Evening,He also wrote the most infamous episode of Brass Eye.
This Evening,"Despite all of this, I still think his TV Go Home website is his finest work."
This Evening,Fuck.   Thanks for this.

This Evening,i'll ask Charlie. 
This Evening,Cunk did a pseudo documentary a couple of years ago about Shakespeare.  Fantastic.
This Evening,I actually prefer Shitpeas to Cunk
This Evening,For some reason I'm really attracted to Cunk? 
This Evening,What fake news did the BBC make up?
This Evening,I really don't think he minds roasting the BBC at all.
This Evening,"Carrie fisher died less than 2 days ago. Seems unbelievable to think they could write, record and edit a new segment, have it signed off for broadcast *and* integrate into an already completed show in a single day"
This Evening,Big Fat Quiz was a massive let down for me this year... 
This Evening,I have left reddit due to privacy invasion issues. The admins need to take this issue seriously that someone isn't spied on or stalked by people just because those stalking him/her happen to know a few mods or admins.

This Evening,No he didn't. That was Chris Morris.
This Evening,Which one was that? Drugs?
This Evening,"TV Go Home was before my time but I love his books (collections of his Guardian columns), Wipe programmes, How TV Ruined Your Life, You Have Been Watching (panel show), and So Wrong It's Right (radio show). I should check out the TV Go Home archives at some point."

This Evening,"Sorry, but I'm just worried. 

We'll be scared together."
This Evening,"Mine too D: Like, the only part of my plans. Well, besides the 2 new episodes of The Grand Tour"
This Evening,Thank you!
This Evening,Awesome.
This Evening,"Maybe, but BBC has been cutting off VPN providers of late. Be easier to grab it on usenet. "
This Evening,Be sure to say hey.
This Evening,That was in May this year.. how is time moving so slow for you and how do I make it do the same for me?
This Evening,She has another special straight after 2016 Wipe as well
This Evening,"Cunk on Christmas is on tonight, right after 2016 wipe."
This Evening,There's Cunk At Christmas straight after.  
This Evening,At a guess it's probably because of how attractive she is
This Evening,"Yes, she is awesome."
This Evening,Can't take my mind off the mole
This Evening,I've noticed people refer to anything as fake news when it doesn't fit their agenda.
This Evening,"Yeah he's always been very openly critical of the BBC whenever they messed up, both on social media/in interviews and on tv (even on BBC programs). He's not one to censor himself because he doesn't want to piss off the money men. 

(and, to be fair to the BBC, they have generally always allowed comedians being openly critical and mocking them on their own networks)"
This Evening,They just need to add a screenshot and voiceover line
This Evening,yeah it was shit. So many times where they were reaching for jokes and just fell flat on their face. Richard Ayaode seemed genuinely sort of bored with it.
This Evening,"I thought it was great! I normally watch for Mitchell and Ayoade, but this time even people like Romesh and Mel were funny!"
This Evening,Me too. It really wasn't as funny or tongue-in-cheek as it had been in years past.
This Evening,"They aren't as well known or popular in Canada, and a lot of people around here don't really ""get"" British humour... so yes, I do know what guilty pleasure means, and I believe I used it correctly."
This Evening,On IMDB he did get a writing credit for the Paedogeddon special. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0330093/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_wr#writers
This Evening,"Paedogeddon, I think they're referring to."
This Evening,"May this year?? Wow.

> how is time moving so slow for you and how do I make it do the same for me?

You'd have to nearly die and be very ill for a few months, so you probably don't want to do that :/
"
This Evening,But attractive in a strange way. 
This Evening,"Things like poor journalistic practice or misleading presentation of data (so, inevitably, any news outlet a given person dislikes) get lumped in with ""fake news"", when the phrase is actually meant to refer to those Macedonian websites like ""The Denver Guardian"" that would just make things up."
This Evening,"Agreed. The amount of times I've seen BBC newsreaders announcing stuff like 'the BBC have been found complicit in...', 'the BBC has come under fire for...' etc 

The have a duty to be open about their failings."
This Evening,"Even that would need to be signed off by the BBC for broadcast. And remember the show would already be fully edited. If they want to add a 10 second photo of Carrie fisher, they need to go through the show and find ten seconds to remove. "
This Evening,"It's weird that the funniest moment didn't involve a comedian, when Mel Giedroyc wouldn't shut up about Crossrail."
This Evening,Maybe because noel fielding wasn't on his team? It was a lack of talent that ruined it! 
This Evening,"Watching a Hannah Montana marathon would be a 'guilty pleasure', watching mainstream shows isn't."
This Evening,"True, but that's not the same as writing the whole thing, contributed would've been a better word. It could've been only a tiny part."
This Evening,It's never something simple is it. 
This Evening,I think loving her humour goes a fair way towards making her more attractive too.
This Evening,Exactly. 
This Evening,"No. Romeshs dead dad was the best part. Crossrails was second.

Nothing was third cause it was quite a shit episode. "
This Evening,"Mel was really good. Compared to the other token non-comedians (Mel B, Claudia Winkleman etc) they've had, she absolutely nailed it)."
This Evening,Mel is a comedian though. Her and Sue were in Footlights together.
This Evening,"""It's weird that the funniest moment involved Mel"" bzzt wrong she's always amazing on BFQ"
This Evening,It's a guilty pleasure if you wouldn't be proud to admit it.  It has nothing to do with being mainstream.
This Evening,It would be if the show isn't mainstream in the area. The world is bigger then just your country.
This Evening,But I can't read.
This Evening,Humour is always top of my list and she does it effortlessly! 
This Evening,"Oh yeah, you're right. Maybe the third was Jimmy Carr making fun of himself for being a tax cheat?"
This Evening,I didn't consider Mel to be a non-comedian guest. She and Sue were in Footlights together.
This Evening,"I love Mel, I think she brings great humour to any show she's on, some of her WILTY stories have been epic!

And her Eurovison commentary is....dare I say....better than Graham, she's a true super fan of the show!

I've never laughed once at Richard Ayaode in anything he's been jn' I never get the praise heaped on him."
This Evening,[deleted]
This Evening,"I think that's a little played out, though, he's made that joke a fair few times. Well, maybe played out if you watch his other shows. 

Nothing will beat the 8 Out of 10 Cats episode the week it happened. Sean Lock has a go at him for it, then later someone says ""Everyone in the country is watching tonight to see Jimmy's statement, even the Queen will be watching"", looking down the camera to say ""Good evening, Your Majesty, enjoy the show."" Then Sean immediately looks into the camera and says ""Good evening Your Majesty, you tax-dodging bitch."""
This Evening,"Huh, you're right. I definitely have her mentally categorised as ""TV presenter"" rather than comedian though."
This Evening,"My claim isn't that a show from a different country is a guilty pleasure. My claim is that something that is mainstream somewhere, isn't necessarily mainstream somewhere else."
This Evening,"You're replying to a chain discussing whether a show is a ""guilty pleasure"" or not, so your claim would be irrelevant."
This Evening,"Actually, I was replying to: 
> Watching a Hannah Montana marathon would be a 'guilty pleasure', watching mainstream shows isn't.

So how is my response irrelevant?"
This Evening,"Wait a minute, to the comment you just quoted, you replied with:
> It would be if the show isn't mainstream in the area. The world is bigger then just your country.

Here you are saying that a show can be a guilty pleasure if it isn't mainstream in the area you are in, in which case my original comment to you still stands. Are you sure what your point is?

"
This Evening,"[Claim A](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/5kx3cr/bbc_two_charlie_brookers_2016_wipe_on_this_evening/dbrnph5/): watching x is guilty pleasure, watching mainstream y isn't.

in Claim A: guilty pleasure and mainstream are mutually exclusive. 

[My response](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/5kx3cr/bbc_two_charlie_brookers_2016_wipe_on_this_evening/dbrrulg/) is that something can be both a guilty pleasure somewhere and mainstream somewhere else. (since different cultures etc). 

------------------

[Claim B](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/5kx3cr/bbc_two_charlie_brookers_2016_wipe_on_this_evening/dbrtgwf/): Why does x being from a different country make it a guilty pleasure?

[My response](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/5kx3cr/bbc_two_charlie_brookers_2016_wipe_on_this_evening/dbru479/) is that I never claimed such a thing. I merely pointed out that something can be both mainstream and a guilty pleasure, based on claim A that these are supposedly mutually exclusive terms. 

Basically this was to explain to you that you misinterpreted my first response. There is nothing in my post that indicated that shows being from another country are by definition non-mainstream. 

---------------

[Claim C](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/5kx3cr/bbc_two_charlie_brookers_2016_wipe_on_this_evening/dbse30u/): You're replying to a chain discussing whether a show is a guilty pleasure or not. 

[My response](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/5kx3cr/bbc_two_charlie_brookers_2016_wipe_on_this_evening/dbsx93b/) is that my reply to Claim A was warranted and on topic. 

---------------

[Claim D](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/5kx3cr/bbc_two_charlie_brookers_2016_wipe_on_this_evening/dbszn36/): Are you sure what your point is? 

My response is that if a show is mainstream in country A, it doesn't have to be in country B. Therefore something can be both a guilty pleasure and a mainstream show. 

"
This Evening,"Your response to claim A was that something IS a guilty pleasure if it is not mainstream in the area (countries are areas, and you also said that ""the world is bigger then just your country"" indicating that you were talking about countries). That is incorrect.

A show can be non-mainstream, and could be considered a guilty pleasure or not."
This Evening,"Claim A: Watching a Hannah Montana marathon would be a 'guilty pleasure', watching mainstream shows isn't.

My response: It would be if the show isn't mainstream in the area. The world is bigger then just your country.

Note the 'it would be if' part, whereas you make that part into 'something is'. 

ex: Watching HM would be guilty pleasure, watching GoT isn't. 
In Madeupistan, GoT isn't mainstream, thus can be a guilty pleasure. (don't know why this is formatted the way it is) 
---------------
 
He makes a claim, and I gave an example that disproves that claim. You then go ahead and misinterpret my post.

Also, thanks for the downvotes, but as you probably know, it means nothing. 

I'm done discussing this with you. Have a good 2017."
This Evening,"Don't even try to claim that isn't what you said.

In the English language, with that sentence in reply to the one above, you are saying that a show is a guilty pleasure if it isn't mainstream in the area. Plain and simple.

>It (the show) would be [a guilty pleasure] if the show isn't mainstream in the area.

If somebody says to me that they think the food on their plate looks like it will be horrible to taste, and I replied with ""it would be if it was burnt"" - what I am actually saying is ""burnt food tastes horrible"".

In this instance it would be:
>It (the food) would [taste horrible] if it was burnt."
This Evening,"How is this confusing? 

GoT is mainstream so can't be a guilty pleasure (according to the guy I first replied to)

In Madeupistan, GoT isn't mainstream, therefore it CAN be a guilty pleasure. 

How are you not getting this? edit: Nevermind, I don't care to be honest and this time I will not reply any further.

> If somebody says to me that they think the food on their plate looks like it will be horrible to taste, and I replied with ""it would be if it was burnt"" - what I am actually saying is ""burnt food tastes horrible"".

Analogies only work if they are analogous. Yours isn't.
"
My Pride,"There are reasons [GRRM regularly rewatches the show](https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2020/09/10/c-c-claudius-aka-i-clavdivs/).  I do, too.  It's also why I kind of huff a little when folks call *Rome* the greatest historical tv show of the period they've ever seen. :D

There isn't much that's on the same level, but Dennis Potter's ***Pennies From Heaven*** and ***The Singing Detective*** (not on streaming, afaik) to me are god-level tv; they can both tear your guts out. Both also got remade as movies. Avoid the *Pennies From Heaven* movie (unless you're a Steve Martin fan or need to see Christopher Walken dancing; but it's Hollywood supremely not-getting the source material); the *Singing Detective* movie remake is better since Potter did most of the screenplay himself before he died, but it's still softer than the original tv series, even with Robert Downey Jr. in the lead. I also liked Potter's later work, like *Lipstick on Your Collar* (*very* young Ewan McGregor), *Blackeyes* (very young Gina Bellman)*,* and *Karaoke/Cold Lazarus* \[where Albert Finney stars, and Ian McDiarmid gets to play someone other than Palpatine :-\]*,* but most think they're weaker series.

Also god-level tv is Alan Bennett's ***Talking Heads*** (also not on streaming, but probably youtube-able), can also slay you with nothing but monologues and insanely great actors (including Bennett himself). I'm pissed off as hell at [PBS for promising us](https://tellyspotting.kera.org/2020/10/19/talking-heads-revamp-celebrates-masterpieces-50th-on-pbs-in-2021/) only two of [the 2020 BBC remakes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww6Oex3MI90), rather than the full dozen (and not the two that are the new ones!), and then not even delivering those. (If you want a taste of the remakes, [here's some clips](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08ftkkx/clips)).

A show that shares two stars with *I, Claudius* (Sian Phillips and Patricia Quinn; Livia and Livilla) and that had *Doctor Who* folk behind the camera (Verity Lambert and Waris Husein) is the Pankhurst/suffragette biodrama, ***Shoulder to Shoulder*** (can't find it on streaming)***.*** Phillips plays mother Emmaline Pankhurst, while Quinn plays daughter Christabel; Angela Down plays Sylvia Pankhurst. Possibly the first time a UK tv show had a primarily female cast.

Phillips also was in an adaptation of ***How Green Was My Valley*** **(1975)** \[again not on streaming I can find\] that was kickass, since the entire cast was actually Welsh. Phillips primarily spoke Welsh up until the age of 18 when she went to London to pursue acting. Her Beth is monumental. BTW, other trivia: she was married to Peter O'Toole around the time she was in *I, Claudius,* and to SF fans, she'll forever be known as the Reverend Mother in Lynch's *Dune.* :) She's still around and acting, btw. I last saw her in *C.B. Strike* on HBO Max and she's apparently been cast in Season 2 of *Good Omens*).

And then there's ***Tenko*** (Britbox in the UK, but not in the US)*,* an ITV drama about British women in a Pacific theatre POW camp during WWII that always killed me.

Mid-80s (so not quite the mid-70s of *I, Claudius)* there's ***Brideshead Revisited*** (Freevee, Tubi, etc.)*,* based on the Evelyn Waugh novel. It stars a very young Jeremy Irons and Anthony Andrews, and the background cast includes Laurence freakin' Olivier. (If you can find Olivier's 1983 *King Lear* from around this time period, it's pretty great, too. [The cast is to die for](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087561/reference/). John Hurt plays the Fool, Diana Rigg is Regan, Leo McKern is Gloucester, Robert Lindsay is Edmund to David Threfall's Edgar, it's a parade of stars).

And I always always was a sucker for *any* John Hawkesworth historical drama (mostly via *Masterpiece Theatre),* so ***Upstairs Downstairs*** (Britbox; the show that *Downton Abbey* wants to be, but kind of misses by a mile), ***The Duchess of Duke Street*** (Amazon Prime)*,* ***The Flame Trees of Thika*** (Acorn)*,* ***Danger UXB*** (AcornTV)*,* and ***Sherlock Holmes*** (Britbox) all come under that heading.  Hawkesworth's *Sherlock Holmes* (where Jeremy Brett plays Holmes and either David Burke or Edward Hardwicke is Watson) are of particularly interest if you like *Sherlock,* since it's incredibly sublimely obvious that both Moffat and Gatiss were rabid fans of that show (and the books) and that the show freed them from ever having to do a ""faithful"" adaptation of the stories and let them go their own way.

One other little dramedy that I *adored* from this time period is ***Flickers*** which [you can find on Freevee](https://www.amazon.com/Part-1/dp/B07CVJVFM4). Possibly the first thing I ever saw Bob Hoskins in. It's written by Roy Clarke, and it's about a Cockney entrepreneur who wants to get a film studio off the ground in the days of silent film. It also stars Frances de la Tour.

BTW, if you want to see what the actor who played Claudius looks like now that he's *actually* in his 80s, Derek Jacobi is one of the stars in Sally Wainwright's dramedy [*Last Tango in Halifax*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IN4gS00ZnT8) (Netflix). Very atypical role for him to play a Northern gaffer :), as he typically gets ""posh"" roles. Like his appearance on *Doctor Who* (s3e11, ""Utopia"") or *The Crown* (s3e8 *""Dangling Man"").*

In the US, after the success of shows like *I, Claudius,* there were also historical drama miniseries aplenty like ***Roots*** (HBO Max) and ***Shogun*** (not on streaming, but starred Richard Chamberlain and Toshiro Mifune, and is about to be remade by FX on Hulu) that might also be worth looking for.

My Pride,Bit of a different tone but you could try the original BBC adaptation of House of Cards.
My Pride,"This is one of the best posts I've seen here. I too adored *I, Claudius* as well. For anyone who is interested in an another extremely good older TV series, I'd like to recommend 1979's *Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy*. Imo, it's one of the best espionage stories ever put on film."
My Pride,"Honestly, the books (there are two) are significantly better... perhaps me having already read them and loved them diminished how much i liked the series..."

My Pride,I liked the series but casting Brian Blessed as Octavian was such a weird choice.
My Pride,The show is a masterpiece but I didn't particularly like the ending tbh. The whole plan of picking Nero because Claudius knew Nero would screw up and Britanicus can swoop in and restore the republic is just so out there.

My Pride,"Why it scared the bejeezus out of me that it looked for a while like we were going to get [a movie with Leonardo DiCaprio as Claudius, and then later that Jane Tranter had signed on to remake it for HBO/BBC](https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a324321/i-claudius-to-be-remade-by-hbo-and-bbc/)."
My Pride,The show is practically a who's who of any British actor that went on to do interesting TV/film stuff in the 70's and 80's. You will notice a lot of familiar faces appear as the series progresses.
My Pride,"It actually adapted both of the Graves novels: *I, Claudius* and *Claudius the God.*  The screenplay was by [Jack Pulman](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0700474/), and at the time, the production drew a lot of critical flak for using modern idiomatic English in a historical drama, rather than ""period speak"", but it's what Graves did in the books, riffing off Suetonius.

I also fondly remember the 20th (or maybe 25th) anniversary *Masterpiece Theatre* special where Alistair Cooke called it ""a brilliant piece of pornography""; John Hurt on  Caligula: ""He's sort of the Method actor's nightmare, isn't he?‚Äîhow do I identify?!‚ÄîYOU CAN'T!!""; and Derek Jacobi fondly reminisced about how Peter O'Toole (married to Sian Phillips at the time) had come to the set and watched some of it, and pronounced, ""It's not going to get very good reviews‚Äîbut *millions* are going to watch it.""

It was, essentially, the *Game of Thrones* of its day. :D"
My Pride,"I thought so too at first, but his force of personality won me over."
My Pride,"I didn't love the Sybil prophecy parts either, it was an overly deterministic reading of Julio-Claudian history. Thankfully it's only a small part of the show."
My Pride,"‚ÄúRosie Fingers of Dawn‚Äù ‚Äî I don‚Äôt get the reference to Claudius. Was this an episode, or another show?"
My Pride,Love that line.
My Pride,"Niiiice! I don't think I've seen *Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy* since it originally aired.  Hopefully there'll be enough response that BBC4 will follow-up with *Smiley's People,* where you can (barely) catch a glimpse of Alan Rickman in a tiny walk-on role.

It always cracks me up how in the recent film adaptation of *Tinker Tailor* Gary Oldman isn't playing Smiley so much as he's playing Alec Guinness playing Smiley. :D"
My Pride,"Threads is also incredible. It's a mini series which very realistically displays what happens if a nuclear detonation happens on UK soil.

It's bleak in all the right ways. Earlier than this is the Quatermass experiment 2+3. They're done on a short budget but the storytelling and acting is amazing."
My Pride,"You're welcome! British TV was my obsession in the '80s/90s as a kid in Southern California when I was addicted to *Masterpiece Theatre*.  Nice to know my ancient knowledge :) can come in handy for a newer viewer.

One of the reasons why the tv of this period works a specific way is mostly because there wasn't a lot of money spent on production, because PAL and NTSC would be roughly equivalent to 480p resolution these days in 4:3 aspect ratio. TV was seen as the much cheaper secondary cousin to theatrical film.

All these shows were shot on (analog) video; or a mix of film (exteriors) and video (interiors).  And if film *was* used throughout (say, *Brideshead Revisited* or *Sherlock Holmes)* it was 16mm, not 35mm because broadcast resolution was so low.  And a lot more of the budget went into the writing and casting.  So you get this magical combination of very high levels of writing with very high levels of acting, but with sort of crap production quality \[see also Neil Gaiman's [*Neverwhere*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB0N01U0XR4) (which was the basis for the novel, btw, not the other way around)*,* where he says even using the real lions in Trafalgar Square ended up looking like cheap props\]*.*

And unlike US tv at the time, UK television tended to be shaped by a single writer for a shorter-run series (e.g., John Mortimer and *Rumpole of the Bailey,* or Jack Pulman writing all of *I, Claudius)*.  The standard season length was 13 episodes, usually broadcast  in two blocks of about 6 or 7 episodes each.  IOW, what streaming shows are doing today.  And it was PBS importing this stuff over on *Masterpiece Theatre* that gave rise to the miniseries in US tv.

And a lot of the television writers of this period were also successful novelists or playwrights in their own right, set to adapting classic literary novels. For example, the 1980 BBC adaptation of *Pride & Prejudice* was done by Fay Weldon, and there's an adaptation of Jerome K. Jerome's *Three Men in a Boat* that was done by Tom Stoppard.

Also, Terry Nation mentioned that back then the BBC would have a much larger budget for casting so that casting directors could comb through every drama school and regional production to find unknowns that would be perfectly cast for a specific role.  He reckoned that the 1987 *Vanity Fair* was the last production that did that. I'd have to agree: it was *perfectly* adapted and cast. (BTW, the screenwriter was Alexander Baron, who also came in as a ringer to write the pilot episode of Hawkesworth's *Sherlock Holmes* (""A Scandal in Bohemia""), and is possibly the *only* adapter I know of who actually got that *Jane Eyre* is not *Wuthering Heights* and that bits of it are supremely funny with his 1980s adaptation (the one where Timothy Dalton is Rochester). It's the **only** adaptation I know of that *kept* the lines: ""Am I hideous, Jane?"" ""Very, sir: you always were, you know."")

My Pride,"I hadn't considered that in the end of S3 >!Logan sells the company because he sees no child as worthy of taking over, rather than a simple self-serving protection against having nothing. I interpreted his action as rather being that he went from wanting the best for his kids to feeling he owes them nothing!<"
My Pride,"Not much of an arc really. He starts as a dick to everyone, and ends as a dick to everyone. The character doesn't change. 

Don't get me wrong, I love the acting and writing on the show, but there's very little arc to Logan."
My Pride,K.

My Pride,"Farscape was filmed in Australia and aside from the main guy was an entirely Australian cast.

There are absolutely good Australian actors, the characters in the major roles were great. 

Back when Farscape was filmed there were not that many Aussie actors, the best ones went overseas, or had consistent acting parts in other shows.

They were really scraping the bottom of the acting barrel for minor parts."
My Pride,"I was intrigued as to who this guest star was. I tried to look it up, but ""Back and Back..."" is episode 3 [according to IMDB.](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0187636/episodes/?season=1), and the plot summary doesn't seem to reflect the events. Ah well."
My Pride,Nice review. You are putting a lot thought and effort into your Farscape reviews. Ignore the haters and keep up the good work!
My Pride,Just chiming in that I'm reading these and enjoying them.
My Pride,"This may be my bad, but the episode order I've discovered has a wierd amount of disagreement. IMDb is probably showing episodes based on when they aired, but re-releases use the show creator's stated chronological order. This is the order I'm watching in. 

The synopsis you're seeing is literally the first 3 minutes of the episode lol, my guess is they wanted to avoid spoilers. They start off seeming like an innocent alien researcher and his assistant on a ship 'mysteriously' falling apart, but the malfunction is actually due to the weapon on board which is also causing the flash forwards that John has.

And the actor playing the alien is named Lisa Hensley."
My Pride,Thanks! Yeah I wouldn't hold IMDb as the truth.
My Pride,"By the way, any other millennials totally shocked to find out Mr. Salt and Mrs. Pepper have FOUR kids now? I remember what an absolute event it was when they had Paprika! And that was like 80 years ago. 

People in the comments really riled up about a show about a blue dog that they don't even watch anyway."
My Pride,Disgusting
My Pride,"Here is my take on this, this show is for 3-5 year old children. These kids should be learn to count and spell. Not what gender they should be. I don't care if you are left or right wing, but as a human being this shouldn't be shown. Also why are we even teaching kids about gender. We should not push our beliefs and  behavior onto to kids to make them feel pressure into being gay or lesbian. This is what wrong with us as people we are telling kids that are 4 years old that it's fine to like the same sex. When they should be learn mathematics and reading. This isn't the blues clues I grew up with, were the blue clues was a detailed and comprehensive educational curriculum. That taught kids what they need for school,  it turn into this political show. I am fine with your choices and life decisions but pushing them onto a kid is not right. Also I understand they show holidays during Christmas  that are celebrated such as Kwanzaa and that's fine. But this is not correct in any way shape or form."
My Pride,"That's unsurprising. I remember back in the original run, the Christmas special included a bit where Steve and Blue visited their neighbors to learn about other holidays such as Hannukah and Kwanza. It's nice to see that tradition of introducing kids to lifestyles different to their own is continuing two decades later."
My Pride,"Wow thats amazing! I haven't seen anything this explicit (for lack of a better word) in how joyfully celebrated queer people should be in any form of mainstream media, and honestly I wasn't expecting the first one to be a preschool show, but this is awesome! Smiles the whole way through the video. This is how you introduce and start to normalize the idea of LGBT in youth. And not just gay and lesbian, which I feel like shows like to focus on and shy away from gender topics. But this puts them on the same pedestal.  It's inspiring and amazing"
My Pride,"Glad to see the revival still has the spirit of the original, this short was easily the most bluntly gay thing ive ever seen in a kids show, and to a young target audience no less. I think they did an amazing job. Funny, people would say ‚Äúhow is my kid going to understand this‚Äù and like I think Blue‚Äôs Clues just made it incredibly easy for a 3 year old to grasp lol."
My Pride,this is abhorrent
My Pride,Gross trash
My Pride,"This is terrible. Why are you pushing SEXUALITY onto kids? This is for children aged 12 and under, they don't need to learn ANY of this stuff yet."
My Pride,"Great wholesome message and it seems like a big deal to have kids' shows finally acknowledge that we exist. 

But goddamn this song is annoying."
My Pride,Nick has been far superior to MOST children's media companies in terms of lgbt and social issues.
My Pride,Degenerate.
My Pride,Wow I‚Äôm tearing up at this. This was my favorite show growing up and seeing this then would have meant the world to me‚Ä¶it still does.
My Pride,"Look. I'm not even a conservative and this is pretty bad. Telling kids that same sex parents exist and are okay is fine and dandy, but the messaging doesn't need to be forced down their throats, nor should it be pushed alongside with symbolic imagery of an organization most known for rioting and burning down cities. 

To make myself and my stance clear, BLM and largely the LGBTQ+ movement have noble causes, and anyone should see that at face value, what good person wouldn't want everyone to feel okay with who they are and to be treated equally by law? But the methodologies of shoving it in your face, calling you an oppressor if you don't jump onboard with it and celebrate, or rioting and looting when things don't go how you want it aren't cultures that I would certainly want any kids I have exposed to before they can even think for themselves. 

It should be easy to treat kids with some respect on serious matters like this rather than trying to brainwash them into being a political ally, hell, they literally say ""allies to the queer community can love their queer friends so proudly"". It sends bad messages to the children and completely alienates them unless they convert. I say leave these lessons to people who can approach these things like Mr. Rogers did, such that they can address these subjects with a little more dignity and respect for the developing brain of a child.

Blues Clues' Pride Parade is nothing more than political indoctrination for developing children and falls on it's face actually trying introduce it's core concepts to children. Children's entertainment should be held to a higher standard than this by parents."
My Pride,"When I was a kid I was ashamed of being gay because I was afraid of the bullying and homophobia.

Today, I am ashamed of being gay because society will associate me with this kind of people.

You guys have your head so far up your own ass and have so much little self-awareness that you really think forcing your sexuality/gender on everyone's face including toddlers is going to make society like or respect you? If the LGBT community intentions was to make homophobia worse and more widespread, congratulations! You guys are doing an amazing job"
My Pride,"Meh, those types of families do exist, so the kids in those families shouldn't feel bad about it."

My Pride,"It was poorly executed.... A better way would have been for a character's parents, whether it be 2 dads or 2 moms, to have a rainbow themed shirt or something and introduce it that way, be it through a character asking a question about the rainbow or something related. This is just obsessively weird and unsettling, something clearly written by adults so they could put forth their own agenda. It just discredits the great efforts made by LGBT+ groups to normalise LGBTQ+ relationships when people do weird stuff this."

Lavender,70's era is a lot closer than the slavery era. Black people still have a stigma attached to them. Right now many people are calling for violence towards both minorities. We haven't quite evolved yet.

Lavender,"Nooo :( He had a young kid too. Such a funny guy -- I was just laughing at this [clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRb6RUVeLhQ) the other night after finding it years after it was on the air. The interactions between Rob, Black and Drama were the best. RIP do work son.

edit: in the clip they were making fun of Drama for calling himself a ""boy of the night"" lol"
Lavender,"I will always remember his ""manpon"" aka toilet paper stuck in his asscrack in case the wiping didn't do the trick. RIP Black you made me laugh many, many times. "

Lavender,People don't know how much Rob and Big meant to us as kids.. RIP
Lavender,"He moved in to my apartment complex in Dallas a few years ago while his house was being built. I approached him one day while walking the dog. He was a typical I don't want to be famous type, he ranted like crazy using loads of profanity in front of his young daughter.
He was pissed about people noticing him, but what blew my mind was he has both of his cars parked out front both repping his brand. 

RIP"
Lavender,Damn...
Lavender,I'm pretty sad about this. Rob&Big was one of my favorite shows when I was younger
Lavender,"Rest In Peace Big Black, the man had some dance moves. I remember watching ""Black Lavender"" mann"
Lavender,"I'm really sad about Big's death, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't see it coming. He had the worst diet of all time. There's an episode of Rob & Big where Rob tries to get Big on a diet and it ends with Big coming to see Rob with like three bags of Burger King that he eats all right there"
Lavender,"I didn't know he had a 9 year old daughter...

Damn,  man.  Rip. Reruns of his shows were the last decent things still playing on MTV and I stopped watching MTV for the most part around the time that they stopped making new episodes. "
Lavender,Man. Shit is just sad. I loved that show and Big Black was just too funny. Larger than life.
Lavender,"Damn this is sad news. Chris moved to my home town Allen, north of Dallas after Rob n Big fell off the air. I came across him multiple times. One time while skateboarding he drove by telling us to never stop skating. He was a humble dude who lived a low key life style after his show. RIP, and wish the best for his family and daughter. "
Lavender,"Rob and Big helped me break through a major depression period in my life.  One day after spending weeks in bed self loathing and being an overall miserable person, I decided to finally try to find some good, quality entertainment and try to do something about my depression.  I binge watched the ENTIRE series of Rob and Big in one sitting.  Episode after episode, I found myself coming back and remembering what it meant to live, to be happy and to have quality friends in life, among many other things.  I know this sounds strange, but depression never get's cured in any conventional way.  It takes a personal mental breakthrough, and this show helped me get to that point.  This is a tragedy I won't soon get over. RIP"
Lavender,"I had so many of his shirts and hats when I was in HS. I topped the scales at 364 lbs.  I'm happy I lost weight, 157lbs. "
Lavender,He was honestly the only reason I watched the show. RIP
Lavender,When my wife was younger she used to do drugs. One time she was on shrooms while watching Rob & Big and peed all over herself in the middle of the living room in front of everyone proclaiming that her water had broke and she was giving birth to Big Blacks baby. 100% true story... We are making arrangements now to pay respects to her babies daddy. On another note- this is extremely sad. I absolutely loved him and that show üòû
Lavender,I won't believe it until I see something from Rob.
Lavender,Fuckin terrible :(
Lavender,"RIP, Rob an Big was my favorite show growing up. They always had so much fun. Big was definitely a role model in a way for me, he'll be missed."
Lavender,Wow I totally forgot about that show. Gonna have to watch some clips on youtube now 
Lavender,"Fair winds and following seas, brother. We've got the watch now."
Lavender,"Out of all the recent celebrity deaths this is the one that actually has me feeling loss. 

RIP from a friend you never knew. "
Lavender,"He died too young and things like this are a reminder of my own and everyone's mortality. I remember watching his shenanigans on tv back in the day and can't help but look back on the past with some fondness. I'm 31 but it's so bizarre seeing different famous people I used to enjoy watching getting old or dying. I don't know much about this man, but at least he always seemed to be happy and found success for the short time he was here. I'm going to try to enjoy my life and pass on good memories to my family so that people will remember me fondly when I go. "
Lavender,"Rob & Big were a HUGE part of my teenage years. I wore my Rob, Big & Meaty shirt all the fucking time. Not to sound like an asshole, but typically when celebrities pass away it doesn't bother or upset me. I mean, it's not like I personally knew them. But for some reason, this genuinely bummed me out.

Rest easy, Black Lavender."
Lavender,"Rest In Peace, Big Black. Many drunken hours in college watching Rob and Big with my buddies and laughing our asses off. ""How you gonna say I ate 9 burritos, son!?"" "
Lavender,"I hate to say it, but I feel like he probably suffered something related to his weight / over eating. "
Lavender,"Rest In Peace big black, you helped me go through some hard times growing up in high school, watching you on tv always gave me that laugh I needed. Angels await you in heaven big dog!"
Lavender,Literally just cried when I heard the news. One of my fav shows was Rob and Big. Rest in peace Chris
Lavender,You can never be too big. RIP black lavender

Lavender,"RIP man, honestly he lost a lot of weight from Rob and Big to Fantasy Factory so this sucks. :("
Lavender,He's after the dirty girls in the sky now 
Lavender,I'm actually more sad about this than I would have ever expected. 
Lavender,"I still remember the episode where they get a random turtle and train it for a turtle race. They put it on a conveyor belt at a grocery store. I still laugh thinking about it today.

Lavender,[MAN I DON'T RECOGNIZE THIS DUDE RIGHT NOW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPAoQUOV1eA)

I remember coming home and crashing on the couch after a long day and watching Big until he had me in tears. What a kind man and a great human being."
Lavender,"I still refer to them as ""Riblets"" thanks to Big Black. RIP."
Lavender,"Just want to throw out there that I met Big Black when I was about 14 at slam city jam. Pretty sure it was before the Rob & Big days, right after The DC video. He was super nice and very sweet. He was doing a meet and greet, and was taking photos, selling merch Etc.

He put one of his shirts that was his size (like 3XL) on me, and snapped a photo with me. It was on a disposable camera. I have the photo somewhere im sure, but I doubt Ill be able to find it.

Anyways. Moral of the story was that he was an incredibly kind dude. He was honestly so sweet, and seemed really happy to meet everyone. Granted, he was pretty newly famous at the time, but he seemed very genuine nevertheless. 

RIP Big Black. "
Lavender,"Yo man. Rest in peace. 
You were as big as a star as Rob was for me. 
You were an idol of protecting the people you love. 
There IS no Rob without you Chris. 
Rest peacefully you gentle giant.

If you live alone, by all means, it's your life. But when you have a spouse and especially kids you need to be there for them. Playing Russian roulette with an unhealthy lifestyle leaves them to suffer the consequences of your unhealthy lifestyle."

See You in Time,"There's a funny moment in season 2 that refers to this that I can't unsee when I watch the episode. In ""The Marshal"", when Cobb Vanth first appears in the armor, he orders a bottle and two shot glasses from the bartender. He goes over to the bar and when he reaches for the bottle and glasses, you can see his fingers fumble around with the shot glasses a bit to figure out where he's gonna situate his grip, like he can't exactly see them."
See You in Time,Reminds me of what Levar Burton reported from Star Trek about the visor. Except I don't think he could see anything at all. Ironic given its a cure for blindness for his character IIRC.
See You in Time,Can confirm. I 3d printed a copy of his helmet. Even without the black lens your field of view is severely restricted. Looks badass though so whatever

They got the emotional payoff in S2 with keeping his helm on mostly forever up till Grogu at the end."
See You in Time,"I very much enjoy that there is a Venn diagram where the overlap is people who cosplay as Mando, HEMA armorers, and people with actual body armor experience and the thing they all have in common is knowing that Mandalorian armor is wildly impractical.

See You in Time,"Hi! I guess unofficial member of the 501st Legion here!

Can absolutely confirm. I spent most of my childhood either in a Jawa costume or wearing a 501st Legion t-shirt at the parades working as a 'spotter'.

In fact, our troopers very lovingly call them their 'buckets'.

Not to mention, hot as hell. I can't even begin to describe how many times I had to help our Darth Vader change the batteries in his helmet so the CPU fans that kept him cool wouldn't die during a 4th of July parade."

See You in Time,"Yeah, I agree. With a Mandalorian helmet on I can't see shit either."

It gives him such an idealized masculine profile with a very broad set of shoulders and chest, narrowing to the waist, and then thicker thighs all in a way more pronounced than you see in Stormtrooper armor, or Boba Fett's armor."
See You in Time,"Of course he can't see out of it, he's in a recording booth five hundred miles away."
See You in Time,"I mean, I kinda understand what he's saying, but with either my Jango or Boba Fett helmet you use the vertical part of the visor to see what's immediately in front of you.

See You in Time,"I think we all think the Mandalorian helmet was a nice idea. But, not pointing any fingers, but it could of been done better. So how about no Mandalorian helmets this time, but next time we do this we go full regalia."
See You in Time,whoa weird! i said the same thing at the orgy last week.
See You in Time,[deleted]
See You in Time,"Use the force, Mandalorian."
See You in Time,Imagine being the stuntman fighting in that helmet.
See You in Time,That is why all these fancy sci-fi helmets would need a pretty good HUD inside because stumbling around half blind aint fun.
See You in Time,"- use the force, Pascal. For each square foot"
See You in Time,"Let‚Äôs get all the actors who‚Äôve played characters in costumes that they couldn‚Äôt see/hear/move in, get em back into their costumes, and put em all in a big fight scene! I nominate Keaton Batman."
See You in Time,‚ÄúThere‚Äôs too much fuckin shit on me‚Ä¶‚Äù
See You in Time,‚ÄúListen. I think we all agree the Mandalorian armor is a good idea!‚Ä¶‚Äù
See You in Time,"I love him more and more with each passing second. He seems like a humble, kind man, enjoying his great success. I do hope he is the real deal. He sure looks like it."
See You in Time,‚ÄúThere‚Äôs too much fucking shit on me!!‚Äù
See You in Time,I really need the audio from this interview.
See You in Time,That magazine cover is damm cool.
See You in Time,"I mean it's a cool looking helmet, and I'd like to imagine that in universe there is a whole camera/hud system that lets you see everything around you...

But in reality that helmet is almost completely useless for a modern soldier/merc/bounty hunter to function. Very little visibility, awkwardly shaped, and it looks like it would make an ideal sniper target on a sunny day.

(It might work better as a jousting helm with the right armor though)"
See You in Time,This is the way
See You in Time,"Hard to see a GD thing from his recording studio hundreds of miles away, I imagine. 
His stunt double doesn‚Äôt seem to have this issue, oddly enough."

See You in Time,We‚Äôve known this since 1977 when a stormtrooper hit their head and a blast door and they left it in the movie xD
See You in Time,OSHA calling
See You in Time,"Yeah, I don't think the visor are aligned with his eyes."
See You in Time,"That‚Äôs the problem with all these helmets, they‚Äôre supposed to be this insanely cool bit of tech , like the guy in the helmet in that verse would have complete sight and sensory info plus more than a human could see being presented, like Ironman.  But the actors are inside a tin can"
See You in Time,"‚ÄúThis is the waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!‚Äù

\- Din Djarin falling down a hole"
See You in Time,"Use the Force, Pedro."
See You in Time,What hole did they dig this up from? I remember seeing this for season one.
See You in Time,He needs a guide dog lmfao
See You in Time,I kinda suspected this from the way the mandos throughout the series look like they‚Äôre about to fall down a flight of steps‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs this hesitancy to the confidence of their gait.  Rewatch and you‚Äôll pick it up‚Ä¶ any long shot of Mando walking and you can see it.
See You in Time,Grace Randolph is probably gonna say this means she was right all along
See You in Time,"""This is the waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyy"" 

Pedro falling into that hole."
See You in Time,He has some great fight choreography scenes so I'm shocked he did those in the armour
See You in Time,"""This is the wrong way"" Pedro after turning the wrong corner for the 11th time"
See You in Time,Release the outtakes!
See You in Time,Welcome to the life of most www.501st.com volunteers in costume...
See You in Time,If I were him I would tell them to let a stunt actor wear the costume and he can dub in the dialog. His career is really taking off now and he might be able to get away with it. James Earl Jones didn‚Äôt play Darth Vader but only did the voice.
See You in Time,"""If there's a hole, I'm gonna fall into it!"" ~Pick up line for a man drowning in poontang"
See You in Time,WILL SOMEBODY TURN ON THE LIGHTS?  I CAN'T SEE SHIT!
See You in Time,Guess it doesn‚Äôt help when you don‚Äôt have the fancy space cameras and HUD it‚Äôs supposed to have in universe. It‚Äôs basically a jouster‚Äôs frog helmet.
See You in Time,"When my wife read that if there's a hole he was gonna fall into it... she agreed ""He's going in a lot of holes"""
See You in Time,"It's a pretty terrible role, actually. I can certainly see why he took it, but now that Last of Us is taking off, I bet he'd be happy to pass it on to someone else. Frankly, it could be anyone under that armor, and we'd never know. Pedro can just do the voice like Brendan Fraser did in Doom Patrol."
See You in Time,This is the way
See You in Time,Then he can marry Ron Swanson.
See You in Time,Even in-universe it looks terrible. Whenever they show his POV like when he‚Äôs aiming his gun it looks like he‚Äôs trying to see through toy binoculars
See You in Time,"I guess a paycheck is a paycheck, but why would an actor take a job where he does nothing but walk about and you can‚Äôt even see him until the last episode. Sorry: SPOILER ALERT"
See You in Time,Pedro Pascal ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs A Hole: I‚Äôm it.‚Äù
See You in Time,*pant wheeze* I can‚Äôt breathe in this thing!
See You in Time,They couldn‚Äôt imagine a vr headset and camera
See You in Time,Maybe boba needs the darkwalking stick
See You in Time,Ok so he is hitting the end of interest on the role?
See You in Time,I‚Äôm still convinced he only wears the armor when he‚Äôs in a scene where he takes his helmet off
See You in Time,How often is he actually in the costume.  Cmon.
See You in Time,"Good thing he‚Äôs probably barely ever actually in the suit when the helmet is on.  

EDIT: if you guys actually think Pedro Pascal is in the suit and not just doing mostly voice work then you‚Äôre delusional."
See You in Time,"Isn't Brendan Wayne the guy wearing the armor? I would expect Pascal to wear it only  in the episode he took it off. Or maybe in some celebrity appearances for promotion and fundraising.

Ps:Brendan is John Wayne's grandson which  probably explains why the mandalorian's walk resembles the duke's."
See You in Time,"So does someone hold his hand and walk him across set saying ""this is the way"" the whole time?"
See You in Time,Let's be honest here. The vast majority of the time it's surely not him in the armour?
See You in Time,Not like he‚Äôs in it much.
Demons Path,"> L'amica geniale

It has an English title that people know. Why are you like this?"
Demons Path,"tl;dr?

2017 - Quite a few big budget/big name shows that we rarely ever talk about today.

2018 - I was doing a lot of online gaming this year... but let's be honest, it was a pretty weak year compared to the previous 5 years.

2019 - One of the hardest decisions I've ever had to make."
Demons Path,"Just FYI, this is not ""listing"".  üôÇüôÇüôÇ"
Demons Path,"2017 - twin peaks: the returnnnnn

Also not a fan of demon slayer tbh"
Demons Path,"I'm always gonna put the original titles. lol. And this title is easy to memorize bruh, it's Italian not Japanese. üòÖ"
Demons Path,"Many people here do not live in an English-speaker country, so they're much more familiar with La casa de papel, Dix pour cent and L'amica geniale than Money Heist, Call My Agent and My Brilliant Friend."
Demons Path,"Lmao, didn't even ""list"" them in your TLDR.     Nothing wrong with what you wrote(I image, I didn't read most of it), just not titled so the reader knows what to expect."
Demons Path,lol bruh. a listicle with words in between each selection is still a listicle.
Demons Path,"Guy put a lot of effort in this post, and you are complaining because he didn't just post a low-effort list? And you guys are even downvoting this?

This sub disgusts me so much. I also have experience with making long and detailed posts that I put a lot of care into, and getting downvoted to oblivion..."
Demons Path,"You said you were ""listing""."
Demons Path,Sorry.    I don't know what came over me.    I apologize.    No sarcasm.
Demons Path,"ü§¶ *jesus christ, the users on this subreddit never cease to amaze me*

I AM LISTING! Listing isn't just limited to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Having a summary for each thing that you listed, is still *listing*!

This post, it's a list! My pinned ""Top 25 TV shows of 2021"" post, it's a list! Those Buzzfeed articles telling you the 10 best books to masturbate to in the summer and whatnot, they're lists!"

Demons Path,What We Do in the Shadows is the best new comedy in ages.
Demons Path,"Succession, Chernobyl, white lotus"
Demons Path,"Ted Lasso,  Succession, A.P. Bio .. there's quite a few out there."
Demons Path,"Corporate, I Think You Should Leave"
Demons Path,"1. Kingdom - The film was disappointing
2. Vinland Saga
3. Chernobyl
4. Succession
5. Fruits Basket (2019)
6. Squid Game
7. The Boys
8. When They See Us
9. Invincible

A bit of a mixed list. I started to try more Korean series and they are pretty good."
Demons Path,The Other Two is top tier
Demons Path,"Succession, mare of East Town, Ted lasso, the boys, Yellowstone, Dave, perry Mason, altered carbon, the righteous gemstones, marvelous Mrs Maisel, dead to me, you, watchman, chernobyl"
Demons Path,"What we do in the shadows, reservation dogs"
Demons Path,"Succession is my current favorite, can't wait for Season 3!"
Demons Path,"My Brilliant Friend isn't a miniseries. There were 2 seasons and a third will be broadcasted sometime early next year, I'm hoping for this year. There are more seasons to come to going by the books. The show is ongoing and is not over yet."
Demons Path,Loved **My Brilliant Friend** and **ZeroZeroZero**
Demons Path,I wanted to like Succession but was really put of by the shaky cam from episode 1. Is it worth me trying again? I coped with 2008 and I promised myself never again.
Demons Path,"Sex Education, hands down."
Demons Path,"I know it only started last week, but I'm blown away by Foundation. I've watched it 3 times this week."
Demons Path,"Looking through my past few top 10 lists: Haunting of Hill House, My Brilliant Friend, Pose, Watchmen, Ramy, For All Mankind, Mrs. America, Devs, The Circle, The Queen's Gambit, Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist, The Mandalorian, The Good Lord Bird, Reservation Dogs"
Demons Path,Pen15
Demons Path,What we do in the shadows is a hidden gem. Filmed like the office but with vampires. Pretty entertaining.
Demons Path,"Primal, Ted Lasso, Every single marvel show, The Mandalorian."
Demons Path,Derry Girls. Scenes from a Marriage. Ted Lasso. Crash Landing on You.
Demons Path,I think it's a great thread
Demons Path,Hands down. The whole ensemble is fantastic.
Demons Path,HBO gang!
Demons Path,White lotus was terrible
Demons Path,"Yeah, Corporate really doesn't get mentioned enough.  One of the better Comedy Central shows in quite a while. Good to see someone else liked it too."
Demons Path,"I'm sorry about that it's a typo. üòÖ Obviously some copy and pasting was done here. As you can see I put ""2 seasons (ongoing)"" and still for some reason have ""miniseries"" beneath it. My bad lol."
Demons Path,Crazy how these two are so different and yet they are also on some of the best shows I saw in 2020-21. I stumbled across Brilliant Friend on a work trip in the hotel room and ZeroZeroZero led me to Gomorra which was probably my favorite of the three.
Demons Path,üíï
Demons Path,I found that really annoying and distracting as well. Sometimes I was on the verge of motion sickness and had to take breaks. But either I got used to it or it stopped/decreased because I can't remember being bothered by it throughout and I made it through both seasons.
Demons Path,Definitely Primal. Hard to believe how good it is honestly.
Demons Path,Did you watch the 3rd episode?
Demons Path,The prevailing theme I've seen with this attitude is that it's usually from the kind of people White Lotus was satirizing.
Demons Path,"If that is true, perhaps some people don't like seeing themselves portrayed harshly again and again and made to feel shame."
Demons Path,What kind of people would that be? I‚Äôm a Black woman with a working class background.
Demons Path,"I've seen only a few of the shows you've mentioned. The Promised Neverland, season 1 and Crash Landing on You were both great. Love + Death + Robots was okay. Perhaps because it was a bunch of disconnected stories, I haven't bother to finish it yet.

While I don't know if 2019 truly stands out from other years, I will add the following shows from that year:

* Swamp Thing
* Hanna
* Doom Patrol
* Carnival Row
* The Boys
* Pennyworth
* Beforeigners
* Evil
* Deadly Class"
Demons Path,"I agree but for my favorites are a bit different than yours. I really liked the Mandalorian, Watchmen, His Dark Materials, The Imagineering Story, and The Boys. 2019 was also a pretty good year for movies too but that's a different topic lol"
Demons Path,"Thank you, discovered Dead Pixels from this and will try it esp as I loved Mythic Quest"
Demons Path,"This one was in my drafts for a while. I didn't even bother proofreading or anything so sorry for any bad grammar or misspellings.   
  
But you get the point, 2019 was an incredible year for TV shows, and to further add to that point, I didn't even add the 2nd seasons of **Dark**, **Succession**, and **Vida**; or the final seasons of **The Affair**, **Mr. Robot**, **Legion**, and **You're the Worst**, which all came out in 2019 and were all great. And of course there was **Dickinson** (*one of my favorites as you can tell*), **The Boys** and **Sex Education** as well. Fuck! It's like every TV writer and producer was on Adderall and molly that year, because the sheer amounts of creativity that came out of the television medium that year was just insane!   
  
p.s. I watched a French sci-fi romance series a while back, pretty sure it was 2019. It was about a man who found a time-travelling box in his basement/garage, and travelled back and forth from past to present trying to save the relationship he once had with the love of his life. I thought it was an interesting way to do a time travelling series, but I can't for the love of god remember the title. üò©"
Demons Path,Holy shit. 100% forgot that Watchmen was 2019. lol.
Demons Path,You're welcome. üòä
Demons Path,"I loved ZeroZeroZero,It was amazing"
Demons Path,"Yellowstone

Ozark

The Queen's Gambit"
Demons Path,"Ah, I see you've finally ended up watching *Veneno*! I'm glad you enjoyed it as much as I thought you would. It really is an incredible piece of television that too few people watched. I'd say it's my favourite miniseries for sure, eclipsing *The Haunting of Hill House* which previously held the top spot. I can't wait for whatever the Javis choose to do next!"
Demons Path,"What we do in the shadows, is it too soon for reservation dogs"
Demons Path,"So this was initially going to be 'Best 15 TV Cinematography of All Time' *or something like that*, until I realized how complicated it actually is to write about visuals in TV shows, especially for shows I haven't seen in a while, so I decided to spend yesterday evening writing this up instead (*might still finish the cinematography one too though*). 

  
Anyways, share you thoughts! What do you think of the list? What shows do you think deserve to be there that are not? And of course vice-versa, which of my choices do you find unworthy? 

  
p.s. P-Valley is the show I feel guilty for not putting on the list. Either way, go watch P-Valley on Starz guys!!

Demons Path,Why is Game of Thrones not there?
Demons Path,I love korean drama serial... giving importance to their cultural and family affection...
Demons Path,Ozark was released 2017 I'm sure. I love The Queen's Gambit!! Never seen Yellowstone though. üòê
Demons Path,"Yea loved Veneno from start to finish!! Second episode is definitely my favorite though, easily one of the single most touching and poignant TV episodes I've ever seen!

I almost forgot you were the one that recommended it to me. Thanks a lot! lol."
Demons Path,üòäüíï
Demons Path,Because it's shit?
Demons Path,This is a list of newer shows that premiered between 2018-2021
Demons Path,2018 - 2020. ü§∑
Demons Path,"Yeah, I had no problems with the first few episodes. I loved them actually. I‚Äôm all about the world-building and learning about the characters. Then in episodes 3-4 the story explodes. I can‚Äôt wait to finish the series tomorrow. "
Demons Path,"Wow, thankyou for this. Just finished the show and my mind is racing about, trying to solidify what I just watched and this has really helped. I think I underestimated Emma Stone's ability to carry a film, Jonah Hill portrayed someone witha mental illness wonderfully and sympathetically and like OP said, Justin Theroux continues to be one of th ebest comedy actors of the time. 10/10 for me. Cannot wait to rewatch it."
Demons Path,"Really loved this show and your description of it being a blend of those 3 other shows is spot-on.  Another thing I loved is the fact that there is so much background detail that can potentially be easter-eggy.  For example, some of the things I saw in the 'real' world leads me to wonder if the world that we're seeing that is 'real' isn't actually another one of those simulations and Owen is the participant in the particular world and that explains his schizophrenia....all the weird things he's experiencing are the little glitches(blips) in his current simulation.  For example Grimsson, the alternate version of his brother that he sees.  Grimsson seems to appear and disappear in a way similar to the way that Annie appeared and disappeared when Dr. Fujita was directly interfering in the simulation to try to separate them.  Additionally, there's often seen in that world in the background the rainbow that is the pharm country's logo in things like random paintings, decoration, etc.  It gives a 'somewhere over the rainbow' vibe that the current world *is* somewhere over the rainbow.  Also, IIRC Owen comments that his perfect never-ending fantasy if he got the lost chapter was something along the lines of driving in a car really fast with Annie (I think he mentions people are chasing them) and he's just got such a huge grin on his face that it hurts, but he's so incredibly happy.   And...what do we see happen in the last episode?  

I just love it when shows pull these kinds of 'what if' open-ended things into their work."
Demons Path,I agree with you that the series look great and classically ‚Äúfilmic‚Äù. People can prefer one or the other with digital or film (and I know this was shot digitally) but it looked gorgeous and as if it were shot on film.
Demons Path,"I had a question about the editing.  I noticed that sometimes a scene ended with a pan and it wasn't centered on the character but it wasn't centered on something important to the story (unless I missed something and that's definitely possible, I didn't bother go back and rewind whenever this happened).  I was expecting the pans to end on the things that related the dream world to reality or vice versa but they just seemed to end at random times."
Demons Path,[deleted]
Demons Path,Post on cinematography yet no pictures. 
Demons Path,"I'm just going to comment hear about maniac because I want to o watch it and see what your breakdown later.

I love when people talk the meta behind movies.

Thanks for sharing op"
Demons Path,"The whole film vs digital thing is 100% for people who have no idea what they're talking about; just like with audio. Not just perceptually, but scientifically proven; ""digital"" is superior to ""analog"". As much evidence supporting it as climate change. "
Demons Path,"I just added one! Sorry for the length, I pretty much just wrote it after I finished the show and started seeing complaints about how people struggled to get into it based on the first two episodes. "
Demons Path,"It was more just me gushing about how I liked the overall look as opposed to specifics, like the use of anamorphic lenses, which not too many shows do. "
Demons Path,Digital is not superior to analog. Nor is it inferior. They just capture the image in different ways. It's like saying watercolors are superior to pastels.
Demons Path,I just mean that it looks like how movies typically looked back in the day which is an aesthetic I enjoy. I also enjoy plenty of digital stuff (Fincher and the like).
Demons Path,I'm curious. Why is making digital look like film a good thing?
Demons Path,"All digital is trying to do for the most part is emulate the look of film, they've been playing catch up and have sensors that try to take in a similar amount of information as film stock. Film print, especially high quality ones such as 70mm still pump out a lot more colour, black and overall image detail then digital is able to. Digital has come a long a way and you're able to get some stunning images, they're easier to film in, but mastering for the most part still has to be capped at 4K whereas 70mm can be scanned at 12K and 70mm IMAX at 16K. 

It might change soon though, this current generation will largely grow up with mainly digital shot media which will define 'cinematic' for them, whereas I assume a majority of us grew up with pre-2002 films which were almost all film, so that's defined 'cinematic' for us and anamorphic lenses were used on films such as the Indiana Jones trilogy and it's how you get the in camera lense flare effect. 

It also depends what you're shooting, if you're aiming for cinematic you want to look like film, if you're doing something completely different then maybe a more digital looking image suits better.

Personally I think in terms of movies it's important to retain that sense of cinema, especially with TV and Movies blurring in terms of quality and writing. Filmmakers who decide to keep using film and high quality film like 70mm and 70mm IMAX keep that grand sense of cinema alive.

EDIT: I don't hate digital guys, sorry if I came out with that impression, what filmmakers have done on digital is incredible, I mean look at Deakins, or Lubezki. It's a small visual preference for me, especially when it comes to high quality prints and texture preferences. But what's most important is what in-camera. Sorry if I gave off that vibe I was a digital sucks guy, "
Demons Path,"Okay, I'm still curious.

Digital is not being pushed to emulate film. One of digital's great advantages is how it retains detail in underexposed regions of an image (likewise, its biggest disadvantage is probably clipping on the highlights). It's only being pushed further in that direction. Ergo, away from the ""filmic"" look.

Or maybe you're referring to DI's trying to emulate that look in post. Sometimes there are artistic reasons for that, but sometimes digital benefits from the non-film look. Roger Deakins and Anthony Dodd Mantle have both found ways to give digital its own look without having to emulate film, and both have been wildly successful with it.

Also, I'm sure you know this, but anamorphic lenses can be mounted on digital cameras. In big-budget releases, they often are. 

I'm also curious as to why you think film is inherently superior when the namesake of your username, David Fincher, hasn't shot on film in 10 years."
Demons Path,"You couldn't sound more pretentious if you tried. Sure, film can be scanned at a higher resolution, but the thing that you are omitting is that most of the movies that were shot on film were shot on 35 mm which usually taps out at 4K.

Even then, most films shot on 35mm were finished at 2K. Finishing in 4K is a very recent phenomenon which largely happened due to advancement of digital cameras. Most of the ""cinematic"" looking movies in this decade have been shot digitally. 

In the past 20-30 years, not many movies have been shot on 70mm let alone on IMAX. 



"
Demons Path,"I just replied to another guy about this. I don't hate digital, I'm sorry if I gave out that impression at all. What filmmakers have done with digital is incredible and with most films it comes down to what's in the camera. I have a small preference for the texture of film and higher quality film stocks and the range in some areas (like the highlights, although hdr seems to solve most issues anything).

&#x200B;

I've always felt in the evolution of digital the goal was to emulate, which was representative in the sensor sizes, I've seen many big budget releases using anamorphic but I felt i don't see it as much on TV which is why I pointed it out. For me personally I prefer film but that doesn't make me stickler for digital like Nolan, I think Fincher's films are beautiful and he did a lot for digital in the feedback he gave for the cameras when working on Zodiac iirc.. When it comes down to it cinematography is whats in the frame, the format is secondary."
Demons Path,"I said digital is great and my preference of film is just my opinion in terms of look. I have huge respect for digital, I've never shot an anything else but the goal was always to recreate that look of flm. Also most films shot on 35mm wouldn't have been mastered at 2K because digital mastering arrived with digital projection, so films before that would go out on 35mm prints. 

I never said digital looks bad or not cinematic, in fact most of time it's what you do in-camera that counts. Roger Deakins and Fincher have been shooting on digital for a while now and their films look incredible. It's opened up a lot of possibilities. "
Demons Path,"On that last point, I will agree.

Personally I prefer filmmakers who lean into what makes digital unique, and give it it's own look: Michael Mann, Inaurritu, Boyle, Malick. 

Unfortunately, that's all too rare these days. "
Inside the Real Narcos,"I just binged this last night, very fucked up situation. The 3 episodes really take the audience on an emotional rollercoaster.

The documentary itself was really well made & I liked the subtle electronic soundtrack.

Idk if I'd agree that Larry is brilliant, I think he is just an asshole with an inherent knack for manipulating people by browbeating them into submission after lovebombing them. He's like an abusive partner, but more sociopathic."
Inside the Real Narcos,"It was a hard watch once it started to turn for the worst.

The fact that some of them weren't just intelligent but like top 1% intelligence is pretty insane.  Harvard and Columbia grad another Columbia grad. He turned their minds into mush.

Given his really unknown reason for having pretty legit political connections..not to mention his methodical brain washing and torture techniques..

Would not be surprised if he didn't at some point work at a CIA dark site or some shit.

Just find it hard to believe that he just
 naturally knew how to do that.. and that it would work. He obviously had done a job on his own daughter too. They didnt give much info on here so I done some research and yea.

The orchestration of it all.. getting so much money.. just reeks of some nefarious dark op in a third world country type shit


Also the fact he can't be analyzed. That is not natural."
Inside the Real Narcos,"Idk I think Isabella started changing her tune when she realized she was facing significant jail time. I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs defending him as much these days. Her sentencing is on the 22nd. I think she plead guilty though, so she probably got a deal and will most likely get probation.

It was sad in the beginning when her and Felicia were both defending him really hard after he got arrested. You could see how broken and brainwashed they were."
Inside the Real Narcos,[deleted]
Inside the Real Narcos,Thank you for this recommendation!
Inside the Real Narcos,College coeds fall under the spell of the old man from Metallica‚Äôs ‚ÄúEnter Sandman‚Äù video.
Inside the Real Narcos,just watched it. what the actual fuuuuuck?! these poor people!
Inside the Real Narcos,Man that Felicia chick went from being a doctor to becoming a fucking lunatic. Very sad
Inside the Real Narcos,Larry most definitely was a Cia employee and he was high up in republican party. Which is why I feel when he got out of prison he felt so betrayed he tried to create an army to take down Bernie. The government needs to look into this guy ties to top republican officials
Inside the Real Narcos,"My takeaway from Larry is he is a good listener. 
He spent a majority of his ""sessions"" Just letting these ""forgotten"" Poor kids just talk to him. 

Then he would identify their insecurities, and core issues, and manipulate it. He would then allow their irrational brain to make up (coerced)fantasies and blame. 

Followed by love bombing and then taking it all back and blaming the victim cycle."
Inside the Real Narcos,Also believe that Bernie and Santos dad did know each other and Larry knew that. Back in the 80s Bish Sr. As head of cia and other Cia officials allowed cocaine into America for profit. Larry was likely a trained Cia intel officer and setup Santis dad to deal in new York under Bernies protection. Once he was arrested and Bernie failed to protect him he decided to to do all this as revenge. Betting even sending Talia to Santos to meet in first place. Classic Cia honey trap
Inside the Real Narcos,"He was also the most textbook perfect abusive partner to especially Felicia as well on top of it, when she explained their relationship in detail it really framed in my eyes how someone who was doing so incredibly well with her life ended up with all that. He was very all around an unreal sociopath"
Inside the Real Narcos,"That hits the nail on the head I don't think I could have described this man any better. I was really wondering how these students allowed this to happen. Watching the documentary you would have thought that this man had their families held hostage the way they were so agreeable. I just don't understand how the students didn't report this girl and her father the moment he started sleeping in their living room, I would have kicked this fat prick out of my dorm the moment he wanted to stay."
Inside the Real Narcos,"If you pay close attention, you'll see that out of the house of 7 students, he was only able to manipulate 3 - Isabella, Claudia, and Dan. (Santos was not a *clean* manipulation because of his desire to be connected to Talia.) So then we should focus on the shared characteristics of the people who fell under his spell. I'd argue that the ability to be manipulated has much more to do with a person's history of being forced to obey authority or give up agency. This is not an exceptional case - Larry is just an example of a person willing to use other people's weaknesses against them."
Inside the Real Narcos,"Only thing I thought was interesting in that scene after Larry has been a jail a bit, Isabella seemed more with it compared to Felicia, who honestly seemed like a dazed child. She didn't seem particularly out of it, just understandably worried her days of being Larry's little queen may have lead to a prison sentence."
Inside the Real Narcos,"I wonder if Isabella changed her tune and actually believes Larry is evil now, or is just putting on a show to get leniency."
Inside the Real Narcos,Anyone think it's interesting that Felicia faced no charges? Do you think she participated in the crimes and was granted immunity for testifying? Or do you think she did not participate in the crimes? The documentary didn't make it clear - they only showed bad acts by Isabella.
Inside the Real Narcos,thats the part that threw me !! they had such conviction about homeboy...
Inside the Real Narcos,This guy is way worse than any of those ppl.
Inside the Real Narcos,Success lies in the hands of those who want it.
Inside the Real Narcos,Yes! He def had ties to Giuliani and Trump (Larry was involved with Felix Sater and flew to Russia to deal with him). Sater was Donald Trump‚Äôs original conduit to Russia. Sooo much corruption.
Inside the Real Narcos,You sound like you're in Larryland
Inside the Real Narcos,"Where did this info come from?  You can‚Äôt just say things like this without some sort of verification. Santo‚Äôs dad was a CIA  backed cocaine dealer? C‚Äômon. I seriously doubt that Larry was ever a CIA agent, there‚Äôs no way he would have been able to keep that quiet. He‚Äôs such a narcissist that he would have told everyone how important and special he was."
Inside the Real Narcos,"Relevant questions that the documentary didn't answer: 

1) what did the Rosario father do for a living? 

2) did the Rosario family have any documented contact with Kerik? (Felicia said yes but documentary didn't investigate)"
Inside the Real Narcos,"What about the idea that Felicia may have played a role of bamboozling the bamboozler??! I have a background in mental health and I know that anyone who has spent any time on a psychiatric ward has had their life threatened - IN PERSON - so the idea that Felicia, who completed multiple years of highly-competitive schooling and was in the 2nd (?) year of her residency psychologically broke in half and moved across the country after being threatened makes little sense to me. The speed of her brainwashing as well as how quickly she came out of it was also odd, as was the lack of evidence that she committed any crimes. Maybe the documentary just didn't show that footage, or maybe Felicia knew not to complete certain acts while under Larry's control? 

So yeah, Larry could've honeypotted Santos, but then Larry himself may have gotten honeypotted. Overestimated his abilities!

Sidenote: I found it super annoying that Felicia made claims about how easy it is to comprehensively manipulate a person's memory but provided no scientific or clinical evidence to back her claims. She is a highly educated professional so that was irresponsible of her and it was irresponsible of the documentary team to not fact-check her claims."
Inside the Real Narcos,He was her hunny bunny.
Inside the Real Narcos,This reminded me of the NXIVM Cult. I have no fucking clue how people can be so gullible. Lol.
Inside the Real Narcos,"You are absolutely right. This documentary was particularly interesting to me because I am of the same nationality as the three siblings (Dominicans). A big part of our culture consists on abuse (including physical) and respecting authority unconditionally. You can look it up, but around the 50s 60s ish the Dominican Republic had a brutal dictatorship. The Rosarios parents seem about my parents age and my parents grew up during this dictatorship. It impacted the culture in a way that Dominicans look up to authoritative people. I see it in my family, very intelligent people mostly comprised of accountants, doctors, nurses and lawyers and they have most fallen prey to some form of abuse or scam."
Inside the Real Narcos,"""Clean"" or not,.he was able to get Santos to defer any kind of critical thinking skills and to create a full dependence within just a few months. The relationship with the daughter was just an entry point just as much as depression or any other in thst Larry used."
Inside the Real Narcos,"According to my experience, Isabella is an accurate representation of what a traumatized person who identifies with her abuser looks like. The damage is on the inside, psychologically, and it's difficult to observe. 

Felicia acted more like a caricature of a traumatized person. All of her trauma is apparent in her behavior, her tone of voice, etc., but that is not the usual clinical presentation."
Inside the Real Narcos,The scariest part to me was knowing that she was a doctor and had other humans under her care at some point. Yikes.
Inside the Real Narcos,fair point
Inside the Real Narcos,"I‚Äôm not sure if it was a documentary on Hulu, or the one on Peacock about the same situation, but Felicia refused to take money from Claudia and didn‚Äôt wanna be a part of that even though she was aware that it was happening. Isabella, on the other hand was the bookkeeper. She would sometimes collect the money. She would also help launder the money, and she participated, or was at least present when Larry found out that Claudia was trying to escape his sex trafficking and tortured her. Larry and Isabella spent the night in Claudia‚Äôs hotel room while Claudio was strapped to a chair, repeatedly suffocated by having a plastic bag put over her head, beaten, dumped with cold water etc. in the audio clip, you can hear Isabella telling Claudia to stop being so dramatic and stop faking. During this night of torture, Larry and Isabella order food to be delivered to the room, sit down and eat, and then the torture begins again. It‚Äôs really sick and horrific and she definitely crossed the line into perpetrator. Felicia was not present for any of that."
Inside the Real Narcos,"What makes you say that? Keith Raniere harmed dozens of more people. He just came off as ""gentler."""
Inside the Real Narcos,"Read about Larry's background. You can definitely believe that there may be more to this story without siding in any way with Larry. He is absolutely a bad dude, but he had a lot of bad dude friends too."
Inside the Real Narcos,well played
Inside the Real Narcos,my biggest question is about Talia - wtf happened to her? she just brought him into their lives and dipped out?? how did we not get any follow up info
Inside the Real Narcos,"1. The nymag article explains they owned a travel agency and grocery store. 
2. Felicia was brainwashed just like others to say Kerik was involved. There is no proof of that."
Inside the Real Narcos,Did Felicia spend time in a psychiatric ward??
Inside the Real Narcos,Her giggling during that unnerved me greatly.
Inside the Real Narcos,"Ahhhhhh, makes sense!

Do you have any thoughts about Felicia saying that she met Kerik or that her family knew Kerik? Considering their family's history and that we don't know what the Rosario father did for a living, could that be true?"
Inside the Real Narcos,"Considering the suggestion that Felicia was completely under Larry's control and was sleeping in the same bed with him and Isabella, it seems strange to me that she would have the presence of mind to play no role in their primary method of making money? I also wonder how it could be possible that she wasn't involved in distributing drugs (e.g., adderall) to the group - including Claudia - considering her medical background?"
Inside the Real Narcos,He didnt use terrorist style torture tactics. Like pulling someone's tongue such pliers. Hitting them with hammers. All while force feeding adderall so they cant sleep for says until their minds turn to mush. I mean abuse is abuse sure.  Maybe it's because you actually see physical abuse in this documentary. The other group hid it a bit better.  All these manipulative bastards like to have cameras watching them tho. Scientologists keep theirs top secret. Kinda makes you wonder how bad it could get there.
Inside the Real Narcos,"Yeah, the left a lot out about Talia. For example, how did she and Isabella meet? Why did the documentary include a diagram that showed Talia sleeping in a bedroom with Isabella and her father? Was Talia involved in any encounters with Dan? I think the filmmakers said they didn't include info about her to protect her privacy - not sure why that same concern didn't apply to Claudia . . ."
Inside the Real Narcos,"Did Felicia say she was brainwashed into saying Kerik was involved? Because she was willing to say that Larry manipulated her memory involving her dress, but I don't remember her stating that she believes that Larry planted her memories of Kerik."
Inside the Real Narcos,"She was a psychiatry resident, I believe in her 2nd year. She should've been in psychiatric wards as well as other types of mental health facilities all the time. Since there was no indication that she was specializing in child psychiatry, then she would've been around adults with mental illness, which would've exposed her to all types of psychoses as well as personality disorders. A simple threat to one's life does not tend to shake anyone who has experience providing mental health care."
Inside the Real Narcos,"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs true. The Kerik thing was partly Larry‚Äôs obsession that Kerik was out to get him and also a reason to blame the parents. He needed to accuse the parents of something bad to keep the kids away from them and not trust them. 
I liked the documentary but I found it missing some information. The NYmag article explains: ‚ÄúThey operated a small travel agency and a grocery store in Washington Heights and had saved enough to buy a home in the Bronx.‚Äù"
Inside the Real Narcos,Oh course their parents didn‚Äôt know him.
Inside the Real Narcos,"To be honest, I am unsure about that part, however, I‚Äôve been reading more on this case and Larry overinflated small facts such as being in the army (he was only in the army 3 weeks. My guess is that he got people to harass Felicia and make her believe that."
Inside the Real Narcos,"She was under his influence, but in the documentary, she said that she had enough of herself still left to refuse that. There is also a recording which is played in one of the documentaries where Larry tells Isabella that Felicia is too weak to do what needs to be done, and Isabella offers to do it.  

Regarding the drugs, I was wondering if he was putting it in there food since he had locks on the refrigerators and told them that people were going to poison in their food so that‚Äôs why the locks were there  he basically controlled their meals and in the videos from wind Felicia is with him she‚Äôs extremely skinny, and when she gets out, she starts to gain weight back. so I wonder if he wasn‚Äôt solely responsible for slipping drugs into their food. I have no idea if that‚Äôs even possible. In the videos, she seems manic and not at all in control so I don‚Äôt know if she could have affectively distributed drugs, especially given her paranoia that she was being poisoned. 

It definitely seems like Felicia went off the deep end, but Isabella stayed very methodical throughout the situation. They responded differently to this horrible situation."
Inside the Real Narcos,"As far as I know, Keith Raniere did use many torture tactics - some practiced on dozens of people and others practiced on only 1-2. For example, Keith enforced sleep deprivation and calorie restriction on many members of NXIVM. I believe both of these practices have been used as torture tactics. He also carried out more extreme ones on specific people; for example, not letting a woman leave a small room for over a year, which I think could be considered to be solitary confinement as a form of torture. Keith also allegedly poisoned several of the women he was intimately involved with, which then developed into cancer. From a New York Post article -

‚ÄúThe deaths of Jeske and Cafritz, meanwhile, were attributed to cancer that developed after both women lived with Raniere in his Halfmoon, NY, home. Jeske died in 2014 at 63, Cafritz in 2016 at 57. Tests on another woman who spent time in the home and subsequently developed cancer revealed unusually elevated levels of ¬≠bismuth and barium. Parlato believes they all had been ¬≠poisoned. ‚ÄúKeith was handling their treatment. He was managing their diet. He was controlling the refrigerator,‚Äù Parlato alleged. Jason Kolowski, a forensic consultant interviewed for the documentary, said hair samples from the women revealed a ‚Äúchronic ¬≠exposure‚Äù to the heavy metals ‚Äî and speculated that it may have come from rat poison.‚Äù 

I don‚Äôt know if these are technically ‚Äúterrorist-style torture tactics‚Äù but it sure sounds like they could be, to me."
Inside the Real Narcos,So true! Also why did Talia leave the apartment? Did she cut contact with her dad? It‚Äôs also very interesting Talia was the one who found that dorm house for them. Did she do it knowing her dad was going to live with them once he got out of jail? Did her dad ask her to befriend these kids purposely? Was she dating Santos just to get him to follow her dad?
Inside the Real Narcos,"The thing to keep in mind with emotional abuse is that even the smartest person in the room can be taken down by a masterful manipulator, of which he was. His trend was that he seemed to prey upon those who had a lacking in their lives, he appealed to that need to be parented and cared for.   


He love bombed her in the beginning of their relationship and also he had connection with her younger siblings as well which I am sure they confirmed anything Larry said to her.   


She also mentions that during the time he was breaking her down she was exhausted with lack of sleep, this was a consistent tactic he used on all of them to break them down.   


Also keep in mind that this did not happen overnight, Larry was breaking these folks down over days, months, and years. He was really good at manipulating and making them all feel like he was their only source of help."
Inside the Real Narcos,She came out and said he manipulated her and planted untrue memories. The fact that she made up with her family implies she knows the Kerik thing didn‚Äôt happen. If she believed her parents were involved with Kerik why would she reunite with them? Why would she reunite with her siblings if she believed they poisoned her because kerik told them to. The whole thing is clearly a lie made up by Larry.
Inside the Real Narcos,Thank you for that context! I didn‚Äôt make that connection watching the Hulu doc. Starting the Peacock version now which has clarified different pieces of the story.
Inside the Real Narcos,"I think the fact that he's documented as only being involved in the military for 3 weeks is super interesting . . . that fact suggests that within 3 weeks he did something so disturbing as to be immediately discharged, or that within 3 weeks his involvement in the military was taken off public record."
Inside the Real Narcos,"So Felicia was manic, paranoid, went off the deep end, and believed what Larry told her, but she also felt comfortable saying no to him? And she had energy to bleach the floors and shovel dirt, but not go to Claudia's to pick up money?"
Inside the Real Narcos,"I knew of some of those situations..not all.

You don't normally see actual footage of it either ...which is why I probably overreacted a bit at the time.

Also since then with further research scientology is probably definitely the worst because of what they do to kids and families alone. With all the additional other stuff of the other 2 as well."
Inside the Real Narcos,"That's not how emotional abuse works - manipulation of this manner does not work on most people, even for a short amount of time. This is evidenced by the fact that Larry couldn't even manipulate most of the 19-year-olds living in the house. 

So you also didn't hear Felicia say that she suspects that Larry implanted the idea that she knew Kerik when she was younger?"
Inside the Real Narcos,You're welcome! I'll have to check out the Peacock doc too. I'm finding this whole thing so fascinating.
Inside the Real Narcos,"No. No one, other than Larry, knew Bernie Kerik. That‚Äôs what makes this story so batshit crazy. Why would Bernie Kerik conspire with nine year old Felicia‚Äôs parents to poison her and these other kids ten plus years in the future. The fact that some viewers couldn‚Äôt tell that the whole thing was made up by Larry is quite disturbing in its own right."
Inside the Real Narcos,"According to the documentary, yes. I mean I don‚Äôt know these people personally, I just watched two documentaries about the cult yesterday lol. It definitely seemed from the videos and recordings that Felicia was more unhinged and manic and Isabella was more methodical, calm and thus controllable. There were recordings where Larry would command Felicia to do something and she would scream ‚ÄúNO‚Äù and sprawl out on the floor- he broke her mentally for sure, but it seems like he broke her to the point that she literally couldn‚Äôt function. Her saying that she had enough of herself left to say no may just be how she recalls the situation."
Inside the Real Narcos,"I think Felicia as a victim grew to love Larry but she never changed her moral compass to be a bad person. Izzy on the other hand truly become his right hand person and in doing so, became evil herself."
Inside the Real Narcos,She said it was all lies. She clearly said that he implanted fake memories and lied to her. Why do you believe Kerik was involved? There‚Äôs zero proof.
Inside the Real Narcos,"I don‚Äôt know what your experiences are but that is how emotional abuse works. You find ways to love bomb the person and then you make them rely on you. If you watched the third episode, she talks about how he would break her down and she would panic, but he would also be the only one to build her up so she could only rely upon him. That is textbook emotional abuse. Also, she did talk about how the memories were implanted in her head. All of the kids talked about this. And there are others who were impacted and manipulated and emotionally/physically abused by him. Are you in support of what Larry did? Because it does feel that way"
Inside the Real Narcos,It really is fascinating. The Peacock doc introduces additional roommates/victims. üòì And includes victim testimonies.
Inside the Real Narcos,"You're mixing multiple things together. The poisoning story is separate from the question of whether or not Kerik had any interaction with the Rosario family in the past. In the documentary, Felicia states that her family knew Kerik, and Felicia did not claim that Larry planted that idea (unless I missed a statement in the documentary that someone else can point out). 

Sorry to disturb you. Some of us are what they call ""active consumers"" and we get inquisitive when details don't line up. And just in case it's not clear - Larry is a bad dude regardless of whether Kerik knew the Rosario's. If Kerik did know the Rosario's though, it would make Santos' chance meeting with Talia a lot more interesting."
Inside the Real Narcos,"Felicia couldn't function and went along with all of Larry's insane ideas - including sharing a bed with Larry and Isabella and allowing her younger brother to hit himself every time she made a noise - but she knew not to collect money from Claudia? And if Larry broke Felicia to the point of not functioning, what allowed her to come out of it so quickly? And if Isabella maintained a better level of functioning, why did she not also come out of it quickly?  

In my experience, Isabella is what a traumatized person who identifies with her abuser looks like. The damage is done on the inside, psychologically, and is not readily observable in her behavior. Isabella appears methodical probably because that is part of her personality, and also because she sincerely believes that Larry is a trustworthy person who improved her life."
Inside the Real Narcos,"The documentary did a good job of showing her questioning some things, and not others as she was healing from this traumatic experience. It wasn‚Äôt an all at once thing where she decided everything he said was lies. It was a process."
Inside the Real Narcos,"A very important thing for people of all ages to understand is: you can ask questions about something that seems odd/ strange/ unpredictable to you without taking a stance about that thing's general qualities.

For example, you can question your country's president's decisions without making a statement about whether the president is an ""all-good"" or ""all-bad"" person. You can inquire about a friend's choices of behaviors in a given context if you think their explanation of their behavior doesn't add up - this doesn't mean you are making a general conclusion about your friend. You may watch your boss do something unfair to a coworker you don't like, and you can identify the boss' act as unfair while maintaining a dislike of your coworker. We all are capable of such complexity in thought - isn't it amazing??

It is ok to not believe everything you are told at face value, even stuff you are told on a really good, high-quality documentary. You can ask questions until you feel comfortable that you have the necessary information to draw a conclusion. It is also ok to realize that different people require different amounts of information before drawing a conclusion."
Inside the Real Narcos,Excellent.
Inside the Real Narcos,"Poisoning was connected as he once convinced F her parents poisoned him because of their connection to Kerik.

Can‚Äôt believe anyone would believe any of the families were connected to Kerik. And they just happened to later meet the guy obsessed with Kerik? Ok"
Inside the Real Narcos,"Human beings react differently to abuse. It seems like Isabella was his right hand person and stayed steady throughout. Felicia went off the deep end and maybe he couldn‚Äôt rely on her for stuff. It is interesting that Felicia wasn‚Äôt sentenced, it prob has to do with not being present when Isabella and Larry abused Claudia. Isabella also was the bookkeeper so clearly involved."
Inside the Real Narcos,She may not have cared about what happened to her but didn‚Äôt want to participate in literally torturing Claudia? What‚Äôs so hard about that to understand exactly?
Inside the Real Narcos,"This is all valid and true. I think my issue is is that it feels like you‚Äôre almost victim blaming these folks when in reality all we‚Äôre seeing is a documentary we are not seeing all of the information that happened to them in their situations. I also would strongly discouraged from saying that even someone with her schooling, and yours, would be immune to emotional and psychological manipulation and abuse. 

How these things manifest in peoples lives are going to be different. We can look at the information presented to us, but again, we don‚Äôt know the totality of it. I am more inclined to believe that she was able to be manipulated simply, because sometimes even those of us trained, let her guard down. It sounds like she let her guard down and the fact that he had had a history with the family probably also helped grease the wheels a little bit. He did do a lot of things that are textbook. We also saw in the documentary, the physical abuse that they encountered. 

As an aside, I do find it interesting that this seems to be the topic you were the most focused on. I‚Äôve seen your user name pop up and a couple of different forms, but just solely about this. Is there a vested interest in this for you?"
Inside the Real Narcos,"I find it ironic that Felicia was so easy to be manipulated when she was still working at a hospital in LA despite that fact that she was studying to be a forensic psychiatrist, and all of Larry‚Äôs games were being played over the phone. The fact that she couldn‚Äôt recognize what he was doing tells me she picked the wrong area to specialize in."
Inside the Real Narcos,"Yes, I have a vested interest in making sure that people remain critical about the content that they take in, especially when the content is presented in a manner that results in the viewers sympathizing with a specific storyline. It should remain a rare occurrence that you walk away from any single piece of \*journalism\* with a feeling of certainty.

I also am committed to helping people remain vigilant about taking in scientific-sounding information when there is no accompanying scientific evidence. I find this especially egregious when it involves people who have the education to know better, as is the case with this documentary.

I feel the need to comment so much on this particular documentary because my background puts me in the position to understand the weaknesses in the documentary and I know most viewers do not have the same background. I'm playing my role pointing out things that are presented as ""true"" or ""fact"" and saying, ""what is the evidence behind that fact? Did they present the evidence? If not, then we should investigate whether that claim is accurate.""

The best quality documentaries reach the standard of investigative journalism. This documentary presents itself that way, but it did not meet the standard. People need to know how to think about that."
Inside the Real Narcos,"True, but the doc made a point of showing how she was in a grueling schedule and getting no sleep, etc. so very vulnerable. Plus she may have been drawn to this field since she had her own psychological issues to work through."
Inside the Real Narcos,"I think that‚Äôs just it. It is a documentary and we‚Äôre only seeing a slice of life with these particular participants. There was another story that came out last year about the same thing give a bit more background information. 

I think my reservations with some of your responses is that it seems as though you are unknowingly discrediting the victims, and potentially siding more with the perpetrator. When we have visual evidence, as well as corroborated stories from multiple people as to how he acts. What is there a potential for a gray area, yes, that could happen with any documentary. Would I go so far as to call what these victims have experienced as being incorrect no because again we are only getting a small portion of their life. I am inclined, based off of video and audio that was captured by Larry, to agree with the stories that they are telling.

I am not disagreeing that we shouldn‚Äôt be critical of the media that we consume, but I feel like with this particular situation there is enough evidence to corroborate to ascertain that the stories that the victims are telling are true. It does seem so wild to assume that someone like Larry could be as destructive, but again look at people like Manson , he had people believing him even after they had been arrested and even after they were put into prison. People can be that manipulative and people can be that destructive."
Inside the Real Narcos,"This is the scariest part of the entire documentary in my opinion. If a Harvard / Columbia psychiatry resident can be drawn in like that, I feel like it could happen to anybody."
Inside the Real Narcos,"Your reply illustrates the problem of not paying attention to the details. Have I ever suggested that Isabella's story was false in any manner? Or Santos' story? . . . No, I've only suggested that I found Felicia's story odd. My concerns are with Felicia's story as told by the documentary, and with the accompanying claims about memory manipulation. I, of course, do not know what the full true story is, but my education and clinical experience tell me that something about Felicia's story - as explained by the documentary - is strange.

At the very least, every viewer should understand that Felicia is a highly educated physician in training, and someone in her position should never make broad claims about memory manipulation without providing scientific evidence. Her choice to make those claims - and the documentary team's decision not to fact-check or speak with a single expert (and in fact they should've spoken with multiple experts) - was unscientific, unethical, and it implies broad consequences. Many people will walk away from the documentary believing that someone could comprehensively manipulate their memory within a short period of time - do you realize how problematic that is?"
Inside the Real Narcos,"I actually never said anything about you, saying that Isabella‚Äôs story was incorrect. From my responses, it was always from the viewpoint of how you viewed Felicia story. Another thing of note Felicia is and was trained as a psychiatrist. She mentioned several times in the documentary that she was doing her residency for psychiatry. So it would stand to reason that she would have some insight on what she‚Äôs talking about.

I also did a little bit more digging on my own, and found out that Felicia was studying to be a forensic psychiatrist. And one of the interviews she gave. She mentioned that she was under a great deal of stress with her residency, and that Larry would keep her up very very late into the night. She alludes to this in the documentary as well. Those two things alone can make someone, even the most highly educated, feel susceptible. She also mentioned that she knew of his relationship with her brother and sister, and how good they seem to be doing and she had met Talia and really liked Talia . So all of these things helped to keep her guard down even farther. She was being loved bombed and didn‚Äôt realize it and so if you add all of these things together, plus the gaslighting that she endured for about a decade it is not out of the ordinary for her to have been susceptible to what she was susceptible to.

Also, as far as your comment with cult experts, there are cult experts that are trained in psychiatry and psychology. And there is a Socioapathy for cult leaders, and how they target the people that they do wind up manipulating. I don‚Äôt know if what happened at Sarah Lawrence could truly be called a cult, but his actions were that of a narcissistic manipulator, who was able to manipulate multiple people at once. 

I don‚Äôt specifically know if the documentarians failed by not having experts to question peoples claims because it was more about hearing from these people and hearing their stories. If someone were that invested, it would be on them to do a bit more research, but all of the documented evidence is out there, and it was pretty well researched before it came out. as someone who is a big fan of the documentary genre, I didn‚Äôt see this is being unethical or problematic because they were just telling a story. I also did have the one advantage of watching another documentary that spoke a bit more about the facts of the case, and less about the victims retelling of stories. yes it was done in a very flashy way and we didn‚Äôt get 100% of every story but I think that‚Äôs just the nature of the genre in and of itself. We never fully gonna get the story from anyone participate because we weren‚Äôt there for their daily life."
Inside the Real Narcos,"Relatedly, people should be wary of input from so-called ""cult experts"" who have no research training or advanced education in our current understanding of memory. Anyone can call themselves a ""cult expert"" and make all sorts of claims - we should all demand that self-proclaimed experts provide scientific evidence to back up their claims.

For example, you may hear a cult expert say something like, ""anyone is susceptible to cult programming."" That's a big claim and it is a claim that is difficult to prove scientifically,. We should all learn to ask, ""can you explain the research studies that have demonstrated that anyone is susceptible?"" The person making the claim should be able to point to research studies that have used cult programming techniques on samples of people and found that the programming worked on all sorts of people with all sorts of personalities and background characteristics (the best case scenario would be a sample randomly drawn from a population). We should also all know that one study is never sufficient - replication is required in all fields of science, and more replication is better. Until you see that evidence, then you should withhold your conclusion about whether or not it is true that everyone is susceptible to cult programming. (This same reasoning also applies to the claim that anyone - especially any adult - is susceptible to control through emotional abuse.)"
Inside the Real Narcos,Sounds good.
Inside the Real Narcos,The filmmaker made a choice to tell the story through the lens of the victims‚Äô experience. It‚Äôs a specific framework of storytelling. Not every documentary has to have experts and authorities weighing in. Another documentary on this topic can do that.
Inside the Real Narcos,Thank you! I personally appreciated this approach because it made it more impactful than experts talking about what happened to them
Inside the Real Narcos,that‚Äôs ironic given (partly) what the show is about‚Ä¶
Inside the Real Narcos,¬øD√≥nde est√° la plata?
Inside the Real Narcos,Good old Hollywood accounting by Hollywood guys.
Inside the Real Narcos,What is this?  AMC?
Inside the Real Narcos,"he made that dreadful Robocop remake, he deserves to pay for that. Jk, this is shit if real"
Inside the Real Narcos,"I think there is a lot of shady shit going on at Netflix and other streaming services when it comes to money.  
   
It's very hard to define profits, revenue etc. And much easier to conceal/move some stuff that it would be for traditional theater/broadcast releases."
Inside the Real Narcos,o plomo
Inside the Real Narcos,"I mean, he wanted to make that Robocop film match Narcos and his Tropa de Elite movies (those films are brutal btw).  Gritty realism and extreme violence, social themes, and cops versus criminals are things he has long explored well.  In typical Hollywood fashion, the studio execs stamped down on Robocop, much to his frustration."
Inside the Real Narcos,Netflix didn't produce Narcos though.
Inside the Real Narcos,"They were/are the main distributor, so most of the money goes through them or is affected by their statistics etc.  
   
But like I said, I was talking about streaming in general."
Inside the Real Narcos,"It's a long article, here's where it says the problems start:

>At some point during the third season of Rick and Morty, multiple sources say Roiland simply stopped showing up ‚Äî and when he did turn up in the Burbank offices, he‚Äôd typically avoid the writers room. In fact, Roiland‚Äôs colleagues often knew he was there only because they could hear his dogs. Or they‚Äôd hear his remote-control toy car, which had a microphone on top of it, zooming around the office. At least once, Roiland sent it into the writers room, says a source. ‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt have seen him in weeks, and then you‚Äôd see the car come in, which was insane.‚Äù Roiland would make exceptions to bring through famous fans, of which Rick and Morty has legions; at various points, his visitors included Kanye West, the comedians on Impractical Jokers and porn star Riley Reid, who gifted the room a succulent.

 
>By that time, Roiland had a girlfriend, who became a fianc√©e, and he would talk openly about their penchant for threesomes. ‚ÄúIt was something we just ignored because it was disgusting,‚Äù says an insider. Multiple sources say it was also during that period that Roiland sent a female employee a ‚Äúreally creepy‚Äù text, late at night, requesting that she come to his home (they declined to name the staffer). ‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt want to run it up the flagpole,‚Äù says one of the sources, ‚Äúand then it was just this really fucked-up, awkward thing.‚Äù

His Relationship with Dan Harmon:

>In the meantime, the relationship between Harmon and Roiland had grown so acrimonious that the show brought in a mediator to try to salvage what was once an inspired partnership. And though those efforts were unsuccessful, the pair was able to put aside their differences enough to secure a massive, 70-episode renewal from Adult Swim in May 2018. The pact, which ensured that the show would run for several more seasons, appeared to reward Rick and Morty for its precedent-smashing ratings for Adult Swim; by season five, the Emmy-winning series was reportedly generating hundreds of millions in merchandise revenue alone.

>In the years since, Roiland‚Äôs involvement on Rick and Morty has largely been relegated to voicing characters, for which he‚Äôd take no direction and record from his home. In fact, it has been years since anyone can remember him stepping foot in the show‚Äôs writers room, even when it‚Äôs been virtual. Recently, a similar situation has occurred on both Solar Opposites and Koala Man, according to multiple sources. On the former, which he co-created, he had, until mid-January, voiced one of the show‚Äôs leads. ‚ÄúHe knew the power of being the voices,‚Äù says a source, noting how Roiland had revealed early on that he believed securing key voice roles would safeguard him from being fired one day. On Koala Man, on which he‚Äôs simply an executive producer, he was given a character to voice in the show‚Äôs third episode but, per two sources, the writers almost blew their deadline waiting for him. The character was killed off at the end of the episode."
Inside the Real Narcos,Who knew that Dan Harmon would turn out to be the affable one?
Inside the Real Narcos,"The Roiland and Harmon part was pretty interesting, had no clue they had such issues with each other. I wonder if there was a single event or just what was discussed in the article that strained it?"
Inside the Real Narcos,"Sounds like Rick and Morty losing Roiland is not really going to effect that much, get a new voice actor or two and maybe they‚Äôll actually show up and take direction. Could overall be a net positive for the series."

Bangkok Love Stories: Hey You!,"I have quite a few throughout my years of watching TV shows, but my overall favourite would have to be Naomi and Emily from Skins, season 3 - 7.

They're undeniably one of the greatest relationship stories coming out of Skins. Even if you were to separate all the Naomily-related scenes from everything else in the series, it'd still make a fantastic romance movie/miniseries, one that's well-developed, taking us through flowery heart-warming days to gloomy and heart-breaking ones. It starts out as a cheesy and maybe even clich√© '*gay girl have crush on straight girl*' plot, but I think what made this one work from the get-go is that the series established that these 2 already had some 'awkward history' before the point where they see them first. Obviously the inevitable happens, but the subtle intricacy I think most viewers might not have noticed with Naomi and Emily is how both girls used each other as bridges to 'get away' from their complicated home lives. With Emily being seen as nothing more than her sister's shadow by her family who doesn't accept her for who she is, and Naomi whose mother comes and goes as she pleases and seemingly doesn't care about what Naomi wants, both girls were able to find themselves with each other.

Both Naomi and Emily's character development were done within the bounds of their relationship, and it is quite impressive when you see how much they changed throughout the series. A great relationship doesn't come without relationship drama though, so by the end of their story they'd gone through tender, heartbreaking, gut-wrenching, sweet, emotional and even sadder moments. Everything was executed perfectly; from their lustrous and tender lake scene, to the dark and gloomy tone of Emily's monologue on the edge of that rooftop, to Naomi's touching confession of love at the end of their school days, to the very poignant hospital scene where one girl is devastated about possibly having to see the love of her life for the final time, while the other feels the same about breaking her heart again."

Bangkok Love Stories: Innocence,"> I can't wait to watch these scenes

yea if you're planning to watch the series just know it's 6 fucking season long (plus 1 epilogue season). and there are a lot of stories that rage from great to absolutely fucking terrible. lol. 

I have a lot more favourite romance stories too. Trigonometry is another great one. It's about a polygamous couple."
Bangkok Love Stories: Innocence,GLENN AND MAGGIE***
Bangkok Love Stories: Innocence,"Honestly, the thing that really sells me with that show is the incredible chemistry between the main cast. I can look past low budget sci-fi easily when there is a crew of characters that really fucking run with what they're working with. And everybody in that show is giving 110%. The body switching episode remains in my top 5 favorite sci-fi moments of all time for that very reason."

At√© que a morte nos separe,Yes and they should also offer DVD commentaries on the alternative audio tracks

The Chromecast with Google TV and Apple TV (unsure about Fire Stick and not in USA, so no clue about Roku) all have the interface that gives you options to watch across most streaming services and catch-up-TV services.

At√© que a morte nos separe,"Hey random reddit reviewer,

I've been using your reviews for several months now (since quarantine began really). You write a lot of them, so they're a great litmus test for if a new tv show is worth the time investment. even if I enjoy watching some schlock a lot more than you.

Please don't let these naysayers down your spirits. Even if some might be struggling to understand why you would rate non-schlock 100%-attentive shows so highly. There's more scripted content these years then ever before, so when someone starts naming their favorite shows that aren't part of the broader talkoshere, they get worried that they haven't invested their time in the cream of the crop. 

My favorite new show this was probably We Are Who We Are. I have had Desenfranadas on my netflix queue for so long theyve changed the name of it to something else, so I'll need to catch up to that one.

One last point; I think a lot of people here think everyone derives enjoyment from run-of-the-mill comedy/fantasy/sci-fi big budget monstrosities/""guilty pleasures"". I can find things to like in these, like the soundtrack and the production values, but I truly look foward to tv shows that try something different. Your guides have been a great source of that.

Cheers,
Fellow avid tv show consumer

At√© que a morte nos separe,Interesting list and write-up. Haven't seen or heard about these shows much but I'll definitely check out those Netflix shows. Thank you.
At√© que a morte nos separe,"Everyone's ganging up on you because you aren't a normie (welcome to contemporary US television audiences). I want to say keep on trucking. Every art field has a lot of xenophobia in US mainstream culture, but maybe none more so than television. I looked at several top critics' picks this year that had a top twenty with nary a pick outside the US/UK.

Surely someone outside the US/UK has made quality television. I mean, the critics that have looked at movies have done the bare minimum and found at least a few year in year out. And all television really is is a bunch of short movies that follow some sort of theme or idea.

All of that said, while you give luscious descriptions I don't know if many of these things interest me. I'm kind of done with the post-2010's melodrama and Rich People Problems stuff. Tower of God and ZeroZeroZero sound cool, though."

At√© que a morte nos separe,Am I the only one who feels like nothing good aired this year besides What We Do In The Shadows? I blame COVID.
At√© que a morte nos separe,You should watch Normal People on Hulu. It'll end up on your list.

At√© que a morte nos separe,"I like that OP sticks to their guns, but some of their choices are not great to me.

Desenfrenadas in particular I found just laughably bad in how clumsily it tried to present real meaningful subjects but fell terribly short with its transparent privileged fantasy idea of what struggle in the ground looks like. It takes checklist, cliched characters that it thinks will benefit from a taste of ""real life"", but the test it makes them endure, beneath the thin layer of modern coating is terribly old fashioned and cliched too and it doesn't realize ever seem to realize its vision of reality is just testament that no one involved has ever gone on a crash course road trip in places like the ones it depicts. I found the all the leads (besides lucia bracho, who is the best, deserves better than this and I hope gets a vehicle soon) wooden, stiff, perpetually-instagram-posed and unlikable.

Also, it didn't help that it's just the exact kind of ""nuMexico vibe"" mexicans like me are extremely tired of.

And even after all of that, it just doesn't have a great structure. I had to hyper sweep the show for a sort of documentary job and it has a lot of cracks. 

But I also thought my brilliant friend s2 was great, even if it fell quite a bit shy of S1 for me, which I just adoooored. So we're a bit in tune maybe."
At√© que a morte nos separe,"OP is of course free to like whatever they like, but I think the reason people are giving them grief is more because they give off a really strong vibe of pretentiousness.

As someone who grew up listening to music well outside the mainstream and being mocked for it, I can totally relate to that."

Yea as i said I'm hella biased against this show. It's something i didn't particularly enjoy... but can't necessarily say it's *bad*. I don't know, maybe it's because it kinda reminds me of my favorite film franchise 'The Before Trilogy', acting like a cheap imitation of that. Or maybe because of the sex scenes that reminded me of Fifty Shades of Grey... or idk, I just wasn't feeling it. 

> Just skimming your posts shows how much of a insufferable snob you are

Why? üòï Because of that one line? It ain't that serious man it's all for fun and it's all opinionated. Me saying that is just how I felt at the time, I went on to love a lot of show focusing on straight couples, some of which are even on this list."

The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"If they had decent writers, they wouldn't need to reboot 'Matlock' at all, and instead have Kathy Bates perform as a completely new and compelling character.  

More nostalgia bait for... well, I don't know who, exactly.  I'd think that the bulk of the original 'Matlock' demographic may no longer be around anymore."
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"so it's more of a *harry's law* reboot then, where kathy bates also played a lawyer back in 2011. I hate legal dramas but the first season was great fun, had a good lead and side characters, one played by brittany snow.

then they had to fuck everything up in the second season, even brittany couldn't make it watchable anymore. looks like I somehow still managed half of it, I could've sworn I ditched s2 after a couple eps. then it got canceled. this is on cbs (harry was nbc), so it's bound to go on for 12 seasons."
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"> In Matlock, written by Jane the Virgin creator Urman and inspired by the classic TV series starring Andy Griffith, after achieving success in her younger years, the brilliant septuagenarian Madeline Matlock (Bates) rejoins the work force at a prestigious law firm where she uses her unassuming demeanor and wily tactics to win cases and expose corruption from within.


> Andy Griffith starred as the folksy lawyer on the original Matlock, which ran for six seasons on NBC and then another three seasons on ABC.



Kathy Bates is a great actress, so I‚Äôm going to check this out. But this constant gender-swapping the past couple years really shows the lack of any creativity in Hollywood.

If they can‚Äôt come up with new interesting female characters, then they should remake/revive female-lead TV shows like ‚ÄòAlias‚Äô , ‚ÄòCharlie's Angels‚Äô, ‚ÄòMurder, She Wrote‚Äô, ‚ÄòTerminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles‚Äô, ‚ÄòDamages‚Äô, ‚ÄòXena: Warrior Princess‚Äô, ‚ÄòDark Angel‚Äô, ‚ÄòThe Bionic Woman‚Äô, and ‚ÄòBuffy the Vampire Slayer‚Äô"
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"The Matlock name means absolutely nothing to people anymore, and the plot doesn‚Äôt even sound like Matlock. This all sounds like a joke about how Hollywood is out of ideas, not something they‚Äôd actually do."
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"I thought that said ""Gender-Swap Robot"" and I was so interested in seeing Kathy Bates solving crimes as a robot that could instantly swap its gender."
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,It better Star Jimmy McGill
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"So when do we get ""Barbara Jones"" with Meg Ryan?"
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"I never watched Matlock, 100% something my grandpa watches (I can hear the theme song in my head rn). I will not watch this either, but happy for Kathy Bates to get consist work."
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,I'm too young to remember Matlock so when I first heard about it I was thinking of Columbo (my older sister used to make me watch reruns after school).  Now I can't stop thinking of Kathy Bates playing a bumbling Columbo
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"> they wouldn't need to reboot 'Matlock' at all, and instead have Kathy Bates perform as a completely new and compelling character.

I'm betting someone pitched an original legal series, and then a studio executive had the idea to slap the Matlock brand on it."
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"Doesn't matter, the TV executives remember it. And if they think they can sell it to somebody, anybody, they'll take the shot at it rather than actually trying something new. It's the same formula which has had network TV running in smaller and smaller circles for decades."
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"> I'd think that the bulk of the original 'Matlock' demographic may no longer be around anymore.

Matlock was on the air until 1995."
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"I enjoyed Harry's Law a lot. I remember everyone being shocked that it was cancelled, especially since it was doing really well in the ratings. If I remember correctly, NBC was trying to get a younger audience and pulled the show because their audience skewed older, which made no sense to me."
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,The idea of ‚Äúgender swapping‚Äù anything is so stupid.
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,I wouldn't mind seeing Alias rebooted.  That show was so good at the start with it's original concept then devolved into a complete mess.
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,">inspired by the classic TV series

Then it's just the name, and not really the traits of the character they are reviving.

**rejoins the work force at a prestigious law firm**

Matlock didn't work for a firm, he had his own practice. It was just him and his daughter--and then his other daughter--and their PI. Why do they need to make this ""a team"" show by having he work for someone else? This is a habit when rebooting TV shows. They did it with MacGyver & Knightrider, too.

I wouldn't say Matlock was brilliant, either. He was more clever. Also, Matlock wore boring suits, and ate hotdogs, and that's what makes Matlock Matlock.

Also, why the alliteration by naming her Madeline? Matlock's first name was Ben."
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,Presumably with some kind of adapter dongle.
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,That would be way cooler than zombifying Matlock.
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,This reboot will be free of any and all chicanery.
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"The Simpsons used to have a running gag where all the old people in the retirement home want to do is watch Matlock and they react violently if they don‚Äôt get their way. 

They dropped it because even in the late 90s, Matlock had zero cultural relevance with anyone under 70."
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"Yes.  That was *28 years ago*.  It debuted on TV in 1986, which was *37 years ago*.  

If you were 45 when 'Matlock' went off the air -- which strikes me as on the young side for the target demographic, which largely would have been Andy Griffith fans -- you're 74 today.  

Andy Griffith fans who were 65 when the show started are over 100, if they're still alive.  

Seriously, how many people in their 20s and 30s were watching 'Matlock' in the mid-90s?  I sure as hell wasn't.  It was considered an ""old person's show"" back then.  

Thus, my comment about how the original core demographic may not be around anymore."
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"the second season had a bunch more old fucks, so no wonder it mostly appealed to older viewers. nothing wrong with that, it just shouldn't have surprised them. they shouldn't have changed anything, season 1 was fine as it was."
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,I'd be interested in seeing a reboot of Alias as long as they stick to spy stories and avoid alien storylines.
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,Cool. That doesn't change the fact that Matlock was on the air less than 30 years ago and to suggest that it's an impossibility for anyone alive to have seen the show is simply foolish.
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"> you're 74 today. 

Unless you are suggesting that there is no alive over the age of 73 I don't see the relevance.

> Andy Griffith fans who were 65 when the show started are over 100, if they're still alive. 

Uhh... that's a completely different show. Outside of the fact that Andy Griffith played both parts there is no relevance.

Although I will point out that shows like Matlock and Andy Griffith continued to air after they ended, hell you can still watch the Andy Griffith show on OTA channels. I'm 45 and have watched, and enjoyed, both shows.

> Seriously, how many people in their 20s and 30s were watching 'Matlock' in the mid-90s? I sure as hell wasn't.

I love baseless speculation based on personal anecdotes."
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"Well good thing the poster never said there's no one left alive that has seen Matlock. He said the bulk of Matlock's demographic is probably dead by now, which given the numbers involved, is likely true.

I've seen people pick fights over stupid shit on reddit, but picking a fight over whether Matlock had old fans or not takes the cake."
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"> picking a fight over whether Matlock had old fans or not takes the cake.

That's an odd take on this thread. I do not doubt that Matlock had an older audience, the only thing I did was point out that the show was on not that long ago.

I also have to point out the fact that you are here, picking a fight over the age of the Matlock audience. A little self-awareness can go a long way."
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"It's final episode was in the last century, and we are almost a quarter of the way through our current century. That's a long time."
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"It wasn't that long ago. 

Are you done picking a fight over the age of Matlock's audience yet?"
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"No one‚Äôs picking a fight over the age of Matlock‚Äôs audience. It‚Äôs a fact that they were very old in 1995 and between now and then, the majority of people watching the show have passed on to the next life.

What we have is someone who didn‚Äôt know the age of Matlock‚Äôs audience (you) who decided to jump in and try to ‚Äúwell actually‚Äù another person, then moved the goalposts when they were shown to be talking out of their ass."
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"> What we have is someone who didn‚Äôt know the age of Matlock‚Äôs audience 

I do know the age of Matlock's audience as I am 45 years old and remember it being on air.

> 
> who decided to jump in and try to ‚Äúwell actually‚Äù another person

Literally the only thing my original comment said was that the show was on the air until 1995.
> 
> then moved the goalposts 

I have not moved any goalposts. I do not think a large number of original Matlock fans are alive, but I do believe that it is a larger number than the person I originally replied to was suggesting. That's it.

> No one‚Äôs picking a fight over the age of Matlock‚Äôs audience

> ...

> talking out of their ass.

It's amusing that you claim to not be picking a fight and then go on that little rant afterwards. You seem to be very worked up over this and I have no interest in arguing with you. I will not be replying to anymore combative comments on your part."
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"Ok, Dung Inspector."
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"Still trying to pick a fight, huh?"
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"I thought you were done replying, Dung Inspector. All I said was okay."
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,> picking a fight over whether Matlock had old fans or not takes the cake.
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"You‚Äôre still on that? Move on, man."
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,> picking a fight over whether Matlock had old fans or not takes the cake.
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,It's clear that this person isn't arguing in good faith.  The username should be a good indicator of the quality of discourse they're going to provide.
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"Tbh, I was glad they got rid of the subtitles."
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"I loved that they actually made the whole suit for the big guy and he did Kathleen right by the video game. No CGI used at all. 

Also, who didn't know Henry would do that????"
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"Actually they ended up using CGI for the final cut for better movement for it, and ended up using the suit as reference. So what you ultimately saw was CGI."
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"I have to say, one of the things that's impressed me since even the first episode is they didn't reduce Gordon (Reiser) to just being this foil to Hannah (Bloom) that's constantly in the wrong. They could've relegated him to being nothing more than an out-of-touch villain constantly standing in Hannah's way, leaving her to figure out how to deal with it in exasperation. 

But, instead, they allow his character to have some victories. He's still out-of-touch in a lot of ways, but the show still shows that there's value in his experience, and that he *does* know what he's talking about a lot of the time when it comes to comedy and how to handle the actors. And, likewise, it allows Hannah to be flawed in a way where she has to accept that she doesn't know everything.

It definitely creates a much more interesting dynamic between the two than if Gordon was always in the wrong, and Hannah was always in the right. They both have things to learn from each other."
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"This show keeps going in directions that I expect to get real hacky real fast, and then executes them really well. Ignore the headline, it's funnier than it sounds - and it's a B or C plot in some episodes, not the focus of the show.

It helps that the jokes sound more like the real-life writers of various ages making fun of themselves, rather than just taking shots at other generations they don't 'get'.

""Well at least my bones are strong since I grew up drinking real fucking milk."""
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,The episode is way better than that headline makes it sound.
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"Not sure about this show in particular but a good generational balance was found in the Hulu TV show Only Murders in the Building.

Its been a real fun two seasons for that show and its very much built around the idea of boomers and Millennials interacting and working alongside one another. Also for fun both generations have a lot of parts trying to understand gen-z culture too."
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,Reboot is incredible so far and easily one of my favorite shows of the year even if the season isn't over yet. It makes me laugh non stop every single episode.
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,And both blame millennials who are just watching the shitshow
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,Couldn‚Äôt this also describe Hacks?
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"This show is really good. It's the Modern Family people making it, but since it's debuting for streaming they can be a lot more inappropriate. The whole cast is hilarious, too."
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,Get out of here clown whore!
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,One thing in the article stands out for me - the mention of social media. Social media is not the real world. It's an echo chamber of people seeing exactly what they want to see curated to their own sensibilities. I think there's a huge difference in what Twitter considers good and bad and what people on the street do.
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"i love the interplay between the writers

I'm glad I can understand both sides"
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,The headlines for this show keep sending me on a rollercoaster of emotions because my brain will only process Reboot as a show about Dot and Enzo.
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"I don't think age really matters in this case. This is really a show about a discussion on whether people should act offended all the time or can they understand humor is often problematic. 

I find people who get offended all the time are really just attention seekers. There is also the problem where the media will use twitter as an excuse to push an agenda. They'll find 5 rando people on twitter who are critical of something then write an article about ""outrage"" which other outlets pick up amplifying 5 people's outrage."
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,point of order: insensitivity is inherently funnier than sensitivity.  thank you for coming to my ted talk.
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"Rachel Bloom is 35, she is not a zoomer lmao"
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,This is probably my favorite new comedy atm
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"Soooo...basically slapstick comedy a la The Three Stooges, Buster Keaton, Buster Crabbe, Charlie Chaplin, and Harold Lloyd is timeless?"
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,I thought this headline was talking about boom operators lol
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"Funny, that doesn't look like ReBoot to me at all... Where's the ground-breaking mid-90s CG? The witty writing filled with 80s & 90s internet/gamer lingo? The amazing homages to popular 80s & 90s media?"
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"Every time I see an article about this show I get excited thinking they‚Äôre continuing the animated show ReBoot, then I‚Äôm disappointed it‚Äôs not that."
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,Rachel Bloom is playing a zoomer?
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"I'm starting to wonder if it's even the boomers and not just Gen X, lol"
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,Woke comedy is an oxymoron
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"Gen X enters the chat: We are the best mix, IMO. We were raised by the boomers, so we aren't pansies but we can understand both sides. Some of this woke-ness goes too far, but the boomers have been going too far for a long time now."
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,Millennials and Gen x  is just chilling with popcorn.
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"Only stupid, racist conservatives call shit woke. Everyone else knows it's simply being aware of systemic inequity that previous generations have let slide. Speaking as a millennial"
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"Boomers had their chance to be mature and find middle ground.  At this point I see no reason to compromise considering they had everything their way and are dying soon/now.

Speaking as a jaded millenial though, and I will admit some boomers buck the trend and are good people."
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"You could START by not referring to them as ""Woke Zoomers"", boomer."
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"Oh shut up, Collider. The fuck would I learn from a Conservative Boomer. Have you seen their wacked out Facebook? Some of them sound like they need to be reported to the FBI."
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,If I hear that word woke and it's not referring to white supremacy or police brutality.....
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,So is this just a Hacks knockoff or what?
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,Woke kills me when it‚Äôs literally been hijacked  by corporate America to sell more shit as they donate more to far right groups while waving pride flags once u know how culture wars r used by neoliberals to protect Davos man (nickname 4 the billionaires)
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"Hey
For once my generation isn't the go to blame pig."
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,Very true statement. The woke movement I think went too far in the wrong direction where everything is deemed insensitive and wrong while with the older generation there was plenty of insensitive things that needed corrections. I do believe there is a middle ground.
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,Johnny is real good in this
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,Has the show yet discussed the upset dilletantes that expected a refreshed adaptation of the Reboot cgi series?
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,Woke Zoomers sounds more obnoxious than Boomers even though they‚Äôre equally annoying.
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,Reiser is killing it in this role. Absolute love his resurgence lately!
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"I've only watched bits of the show over my wife's shoulder for now, but while I've definitely seen shows do exactly what you're saying, I'd be surprised if Riser accepted a role that turned out to be that one dimensional."
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,The creator Steve Levitan has been around since Wings and Frasier and is 60 years old. He is Reiser's character and isn't going to self-flagellate himself.
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,Makes me wonder if this is what they wanted to do with Chevy Chase's character in Community but since he himself was unwilling to grow as a person (according to cast and crew accounts) the writers were probably unwilling to make him appear to be a better person.  They did in some episodes but for the most part he was just the out of touch boomer that was set in his ways.
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,Which is the meta message the show is pushing for their sitcom as well! I think the show is really smartly done; I was dying that they worked in the popcorn bit the way they did.
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,Reading the description of the show makes me feel like it's a rehash of Hacks.   Liked that show but don't really want to watch boomer v zoomer show.
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,That lone got me good haha
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"I saw ads for it and thought I like johnny Knoxville, and Keegan Michael key, however I think Judy Greer is killing it in the role she has.

Oddly the one character I'm on the fence about is Zack but even calum is doing a great job with that character.

It's been an enjoyable show, which I think if people aren't watching it they should give it a chance at least."
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,The unexpected nudity in the first episode was good too
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,I do wish the zoomers in the episode were actually funny though. I think Gen z can be very funny- but they had them proposing references to bechdel test and NFTs to really highlight these are young‚Äôuns which really was a disservice to their side
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"What is the show even about? I‚Äôve never heard of it before reading this headline (inb4 ‚Äújust google it‚Äù)


Edit: ayo wtf Johnny Knoxville is in this shit?"
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,Then it must be pretty good because the headline didn't sound half bad.
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"As a millennial with ""old interests"" (I like a lot of old movies, TV, history, etc.) Only Murders in the Building is a delightful show. I honestly think it's some career-best work from all 3 leads."
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,Very funny interactions on that show. Good example.
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,It‚Äôs been really good. Definitely captures the type of humor that made Modern Family (same creator) really funny in its earlier seasons. Also nice to see Johnny Knoxville in a non-Jackass role.
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"We millennials can only play the victim card so long, as we're now the largest generation in the workforce and soon politically.   I'm not saying there's not marrit to the complaints about the boomers (they certainty used their political power to extract a lot from the economy from their 20s into retirement) but it'll soon be on us to make the difference we want."
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,Agreed. Was thinking about the comparison between Hacks and Reboot after watching the first few episodes of Reboot yesterday.
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"I mentioned above about how it's refreshing that Reiser and Bloom's characters are both flawed.  The show could easily lean into being about how out-of-touch boomers are or how overly sensitive zoomers are, but instead it gives both generations their fair share of barbs, and *Hacks* was definitely a comparison that came to mind of another show that does similarly."
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"It‚Äôs weird how selective people are with what they think is echo chamber and what they think is an opinion most people have. I frequently see it in movie, games, and music subreddits. But those same people will acknowledge political echo chambers."
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"And just the language of social media.  Something about the standards/behavioral norms of it makes people express every minor opinion they have in the strongest, most aggressive terms.  Just look at the discussion of television.  All around the world millions of people a day chat about TV shows they like or dislike, or discuss last night's episode of a show they both watch.  By and large, this is done politely with differences in opinions being tolerated.


Now look at it on social media, people calling anyone who feels differently about a TV show fucking morons."
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"I agree with you. But I also think the same thing applies to reddit. I've seen popular takes on reddit about different events/media that are the complete opposite of what people who I interact with in the ""real world"" think"
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,I'm not even sure why anyone acknowledges Twitter
Distorted,"The podcast ‚ÄúYou Must Remember This‚Äù did great episodes on Stratton and Peter Bogdanovich. Knowing the story, it was weird for them to totally truncate her time with Snider.

Distorted,"Her performance reminded me that Nicole is not a great actress. Shows the ditzy blonde was quite smart. 

Hefner also thought Paul was sleazy. Hefner. He was nothing with DS, so that was shown accurately in the show. Of course, she really did leave him for a director. Her image wasn't distorted."
Distorted,"It's about Chippendales, so it doesn't distort, it shows the important but unfortunate intersection of two volatile storms that each lead to murder. 

The only thing left to complete the death trifecta of 80s is the rise of serial killers and AIDS as it relates to this show."
Distorted,"I think they put it in the first episode, so other dark stuff doesn't feel coming out of nothing, too much."
Distorted,">  it was weird for them to totally truncate her time with Snider.

I didn't really know the story, but considering the part was played by somewhat famous Dan Stevens, I was surprised he was gone from the show so soon."

Distorted,I love the content of that podcast but her voice and pronunciation is just a no for me

Distorted,I think it was that Star Wars like movie where she played an android that put her on the map. She even appeared on the Tonight Show to plug it. Galaxina was the movie.

Distorted,"Claire Danes was, indeed, outstanding in the episode, especially in that opening conversation with Libby. 

I think it's been pretty obvious that this was where the series was going from very early on, and particularly since we saw the birth scene in the third episode. In a certain sense the story about the marriage breaking down has to be told from Toby's perspective, because told from her perspective it isn't really a story about the marriage breaking down, it's a story about her breaking down. Libby can be annoying, but as the narrator she provides a vantage point from outside the relationship, and that is necessary because it makes it more than a he said/she said. (""It takes three legs to make a tripod / or to make a table stand,"" as the old School of Rock song goes. In his initial shock, Toby leans on Libby, who provides the narration. But as viewers, we gradually see that she's not steady, and so we fully expect the story to require a fuller exploration of that third perspective for some stability.) 

That all said, I don't think Toby is really the bad guy here. (Sam, otoh. Oof.) Not that Toby is not flawed, of course. But the thing is that, ultimately, you can't make someone else get help. Rachel decided not to get help, and while that decision may be understandable and it may be possible to empathize with it, it's not usually a good decision, especially when one very definitely needs help. 

Full disclosure: my perspective on the series is shaped by my own personal experience. My marriage crumbled in the midst of what I've always thought to be a mental health crisis. I tried to get my partner to get help. My in-laws tried to get my partner to get help. Mutual friends, and even some  of my partner's friends that I did not know particularly well, tried to get my partner to get help. But you can't make someone get help. Now I've had four years of raising our son mostly on my own, with the financial, psychological, and physical health consequences that this entails. (But, yes, also rewards.) So in that sense I find a lot of sympathy with Toby, though I also feel critical of certain of his handling of the aftermath. (Coda: it's been four years and change, and my ex has never gotten treatment but has in the last year or two found a new-and-hopefully-not-too-fragile stable footing, and has been in the process of gradually rebuilding a relationship with our son.)"
Distorted,"Spoilers:

I thought it strange that they waited til e7 for this reveal. At the end of e4, after hearing about the ""nap"" in the park and seeing inside her apartment, he says something like he has to deal with this ""realization,"" and I thought for sure he had figured out she was having a mental health crisis. 

He's a doctor, and I hope they underline that when the show looks back on how he failed her and his children by not getting her help at this point. Given the trauma of what the OB did to her, there seems to be a larger metaphor developing about male doctors failing female patients.

The Ambien prescription in someone else's name, the ""it's all beef lo mein,"" the park, and that she isn't even returning her daughter's texts- these are classic signs any experienced physician should recognize."
Distorted,"Haven't watched Ep 7 yet but I'm loving the show so far. Eisenberg is doing a wonderful job of being a prick but you empathize with him just enough since we don't know what's really going on with Rachel yet. Presenting the show through Libby's narration seems annoying at first but as you slowly start to realize she's basically writing a true crime story about her friend, it starts to make more sense, especially as we learn more about her character and how selfish she is. The show is about peeling back layers for these characters and getting to the true core of who they are, and it plays the empathy card wonderfully throughout without ever forgetting to show us the true nature of any of its characters.

The dual party scene in ep 6 is a perfect example of this. On one side Toby is miserable at a party with his wife's friends, who have been painted as douchebags this entire time, but he's also being a dick to them. On the other side he's having the time of his life with his Israel friends, uninhibited by his previous life, but we're not supposed to forget he abandoned them for like a decade. Not to mention how he turns around and acts like a complete dick with Libby.

The show has reminded me a lot of Tar, actually. I won't spoil in case anyone hasn't seen it but it too is supposed to be nuanced and play with the part of our brains designed to feel empathy. Characters in that movie may not be the best people but it makes you question what you're supposed to be feel and what they deserve (to put it as vaguely as possible) all while peeling back the layers of what's actually happening. 

Two very different stories but they tackle similar (and very modern and nuanced) themes."
Distorted,That scene at Alejandra's doorstep is still playing in my head. 8 seasons of Homeland has made this role perfect for Danes. Anyone not watching this is doing themselves a disservice
Distorted,"I kinda figured that's what they were going for but the narrator being Caplan's character really irked me as it was clear she had her own arc going that seemed to me more pertinent to the central theme. Hearing her voice just kept reminding me that theirs a more interesting story going on over there.

Also, I think I'm just tired of stories dealing with self-centered professionals learning to be a little less self-centred. Though, this tends to be a rich area for top level writing as even though this show is not my subject matter of choice, the writing is stellar, I think I've watched so many of these types of shows that they've all blurred together.

That being said I'm down to see Danes wreck shop, so I'll give episode 7 a watch."
Distorted,"I have the say, I love the visual aesthetic. Whoever the director of photography is, is doing a wonderful job."
Distorted,"Her performance saved the entire series, in my opinion."
Distorted,Just got to episode 7. I‚Äôm floored. Danes did that. And Caplan‚Äôs work at the the end of episode 6 was the perfect precursor.
Distorted,"It's a great episode and Danes is great. 

But i don't agree at all that Toby is so self-centered. I think Rachel  was way moreso. He's always trying to support his wife and asks her how she's doing and trying to get her to seek help."
Distorted,Couldn't get past E1. I find Eisenberg unlikable in the lead and the amount of women interested in quickly sleeping with him feels like a contrivance ... he does not come off as charming (nor particularly handsome) to generate all that female interest. Maybe women will accept less for a doctor? Can't believe I asked that.
Distorted,"Congratulations on making it that far. We were out after two episodes.  The main character is just too annoying. I know he's supposed to be, but between him and the irritating voiceover, we just couldn't take it."

Distorted,"Thanks! We‚Äôre going to watch tonight, we‚Äôve been wondering if at some point the script was going to flip & show her side of things to where it ends up with him being the dick in all of this."
Distorted,I can't stand the commercials with Claire Danes screaming at me. Ugh.
Distorted,"Eh. This is the same character Claire Danes played in Homeland. 

Type A, slightly manic, prickly and not-like-other-girls. 

There are multiple Homeland episodes with her similarly spiralling."
Distorted,"I watched it, I still absolutely hate her character. Like she went to group therapy for rape victims and tried to act like she was just like them for having a fucking medical procedure done to her?!

She also acted like it was completely normal for her to want to move to LA and take the kids for years after barely being a parent to them in the first place and that Toby doesn‚Äôt even get a say in the matter. 

She had a mental breakdown but she‚Äôs still at her core a very selfish person who expects the world to revolve around her"
Distorted,"Everytime I see the title of this show I think it's an alternate title for ""Confess, Fletch"" in foreign countries. Yes I'm aware of how dumb that is."
Distorted,Loving this show! Has anyone read the book? How does it compare?
Distorted,I‚Äôm so hot for Fleischman. Help.
Distorted,Danes is really good at performing this way. You should see her in Homeland
Distorted,"The strange thing is that Ep 7 is not so much a 'reveal' but a 'confirm' , and the 'revelation' (or confirmation) is delayed for rhetorical or polemical purposes.

&#x200B;

The displacement doesn't really work in a weekly television series  and presumably is more effective or devastating in the self-contained novel.

&#x200B;

Viewers have to wait seven weeks to experience it and may have already stopped watching , as opposed to the novel which is already purchased in its entirety and can be read at the reader's own pace or discretion."
Distorted,"After watching the finale, it was clear that the show was not that interested in Rachel either - the show was really (or ultimately) about Libby, and she  just ended up using Rachel to tell her own story.

&#x200B;

All said and done, I'm pleased to see that this show did not figure prominently in 'year-end best of' lists (Rachel's episode was singled out for praise though).

&#x200B;

I just found it as insufferable and solipsistic as its main characters."
Distorted,"exactly!! this made TOby insufferable, imo."
Distorted,I‚Äôm curious about what you see as Libbys selfishness.
Distorted,Nicely put.
Distorted,"Awesome, please share your thoughts if you do

(and for the record, I have no idea why the approach was a trojan horse - particularly since anyone paying attention should have seen what was hiding in plain sight inside the first episode onwards anyway)."
Distorted,"Seriously, can't stand him or his character.  I want to learn more about the other characters, but it has mostly revolved around him."
Distorted,"I wholeheartedly agree with you, from what I‚Äôve seen, he is always attempting to get her some help, puts the kids first, doesn‚Äôt shame her for what she does but doesn‚Äôt allow her to make it all about herself all the time. 

She is career oriented and her family have to take a backseat and when they don‚Äôt, she goes on a rant about abandonment and cries.

She couldn‚Äôt focus on spending some quality time with her family and husband and feels abandoned when he leaves.

She couldn‚Äôt recognise and address her shortcoming (ie her insecurities towards money, how it is never enough) nor cared to listen when her husband told her about it. 

She doesn‚Äôt communicate any of her worries in a constructive way to her husband, shows no interest in taking things seriously by showing up late and defensive at their therapist, etc.

I‚Äôm sorry and it may be because I‚Äôm a man, yet I don‚Äôt see how a human being who puts their work and image above anything else when they have children can be seen as something other than self-centered."
Distorted,"The fact that he was a physician and kept thinking she just was dealing with postpartum depression when she was clearly a victim of medical rape was absolutely infuriating. He failed her, and his daughter(!) time and time again throughout the series."
Distorted,I‚Äôm curious. Are you a man? I‚Äôve found that this breaks down almost perfectly along gender lines. Women find Toby more self centered and men find Rachel. Which I also find fascinating.
Distorted,"He resented her, in everyway.  He was completely self-centered and unprotective of her; yet blamed her for not handling his isolation and abandonment better.  He was the worse! A true Narcissist, all the way down to the complete over-sexualization of all his issues (that was disgusting, btw)."
Distorted,Yes his dating experience seemed very unrealistic
Distorted,"I watched the whole series and really enjoyed it but I agree about jesse in the role of Toby. I think the writers went a little over the top nerdy with his character to the point where it wasn‚Äôt believable. I get that he needed to be unlike the typical status obsessed elite NYC crowd and overall needed to be down to earth, but they could‚Äôve cast someone with a bit more natural charisma.

That‚Äôs said, his character takes a back seat about halfway through."
Distorted,I found the sex episodes super lame and HIGHLY unbelievable.  Highly unbelievable!
Distorted,[deleted]
Distorted,I'd encourage you to watch episode 7 anyway - it is an astonishing (if belated) course correction built into the show's own premise.
Distorted,Must watch.
Distorted,I‚Äôd argue he isn‚Äôt the main character at this point but go off  i guess
Distorted,"I don't think the point is quite that Toby is a dick, although he is at times, just that neither are completely innocent or completely guilty.  They're both human."
Distorted,"thanks, please share your thoughts if you do watch it."
Distorted,"Homeland she was dealing with poorly treated bipolar. 

In this show she's a result of her surroundings and her upbringing. It's very different. Through her own choices and through the actions of people around her she reaches a point where she has a full mental breakdown. That wasn't mania. 

They're different characters and at times the expressions and outbursts were similar but no, it's not as simple as just ""same character different show""."
Distorted,You're getting downvoted but you're totally right. I'm worried she's getting typecast.
Distorted,ok?
Distorted,"ehm.. he broke her water without telling her, that is not a normal medical procedure

also you can totally get why she is the way she is if u listen to what she is saying"
Distorted,woof. you must be a man
Distorted,"She was (at her core) a mentally ill person trying to hide in plain sight - and then she disappeared from view when she couldn't maintain the charade anymore. 

&#x200B;

I can understand why you disliked her - she wasn't very likeable - but a lot of her (perceived) selfishness has its origins in abandonment issues since she felt unloved from an early age and tried to fortify herself by putting herself forward and/or first. I'm not making excuses for her - I'm just saying that moral terms fail to see her clearly"
Distorted,"That was medical rape, dude. Not a procedure. You can‚Äôt just penetrate and cause tremendous pain to a patient, without consent or without answering your patients questions."
Distorted,Bruh
Distorted,The book was excellent but Claire Danes‚Äôs performance really elevates it. Her pain is so raw and real.
Distorted,I‚Äôve never been more infuriated by an ending. They just completely ignored this women in desperate need of help.
Distorted,I watched it and didn't even realize it was a finale! So weird
Distorted,"So I watched it and you're right, Danes was excellent. She sold the mania of her character perfectly. Her eyes are so expressive that I forget that I'm seeing someone act. Also, the non-linear framing of the episode really made me empathise with her characters disorientation. I have seen someone go through similar crisis and I have to say, their depiction of it rang pretty true (sometimes to a harrowing extent). 

This episode made me feel that the show would've worked better, for me, as a three episode maxi. One from the husbands perspective the next from hers and the final being their resolution (with the two friends' side plots weaving in and out as necessary). The tightness of this episode and the emotional tension it managed to martial, works brilliantly as a standalone episode. So much so, that it compounds my apathy towards the rest of the show as I feel that Eisenberg's story was such a given that his little cameos in this episode states his side of things more succinctly than the preceding episodes (that I watched at least). 

Either way, Danes killed it and this episode is worth a watch in and of itself."
Distorted,"The first clue was when we heard that Rachel had been found sleeping in a park. That that was glossed over never sat well with me, and now it makes sense. Episode 7 was refreshing."
Distorted,I don't think you would necessarily see it coming. I've seen tons of shows where it's written from one perspective and completely ignores what might be happening from another.
Ingress: The Animation,They could make a tv show based on Pokemon: Go where a young child walks around with their phone and captures Pokemon.  The twist is that the Pokemon are actually there but they're invisible! /s
Ingress: The Animation,A couple of years after this they will just animate Pokemon characters over the characters in this.
Ingress: The Animation,"It's a long article, here's where it says the problems start:

>At some point during the third season of Rick and Morty, multiple sources say Roiland simply stopped showing up ‚Äî and when he did turn up in the Burbank offices, he‚Äôd typically avoid the writers room. In fact, Roiland‚Äôs colleagues often knew he was there only because they could hear his dogs. Or they‚Äôd hear his remote-control toy car, which had a microphone on top of it, zooming around the office. At least once, Roiland sent it into the writers room, says a source. ‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt have seen him in weeks, and then you‚Äôd see the car come in, which was insane.‚Äù Roiland would make exceptions to bring through famous fans, of which Rick and Morty has legions; at various points, his visitors included Kanye West, the comedians on Impractical Jokers and porn star Riley Reid, who gifted the room a succulent.

 
>By that time, Roiland had a girlfriend, who became a fianc√©e, and he would talk openly about their penchant for threesomes. ‚ÄúIt was something we just ignored because it was disgusting,‚Äù says an insider. Multiple sources say it was also during that period that Roiland sent a female employee a ‚Äúreally creepy‚Äù text, late at night, requesting that she come to his home (they declined to name the staffer). ‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt want to run it up the flagpole,‚Äù says one of the sources, ‚Äúand then it was just this really fucked-up, awkward thing.‚Äù

His Relationship with Dan Harmon:

>In the meantime, the relationship between Harmon and Roiland had grown so acrimonious that the show brought in a mediator to try to salvage what was once an inspired partnership. And though those efforts were unsuccessful, the pair was able to put aside their differences enough to secure a massive, 70-episode renewal from Adult Swim in May 2018. The pact, which ensured that the show would run for several more seasons, appeared to reward Rick and Morty for its precedent-smashing ratings for Adult Swim; by season five, the Emmy-winning series was reportedly generating hundreds of millions in merchandise revenue alone.

>In the years since, Roiland‚Äôs involvement on Rick and Morty has largely been relegated to voicing characters, for which he‚Äôd take no direction and record from his home. In fact, it has been years since anyone can remember him stepping foot in the show‚Äôs writers room, even when it‚Äôs been virtual. Recently, a similar situation has occurred on both Solar Opposites and Koala Man, according to multiple sources. On the former, which he co-created, he had, until mid-January, voiced one of the show‚Äôs leads. ‚ÄúHe knew the power of being the voices,‚Äù says a source, noting how Roiland had revealed early on that he believed securing key voice roles would safeguard him from being fired one day. On Koala Man, on which he‚Äôs simply an executive producer, he was given a character to voice in the show‚Äôs third episode but, per two sources, the writers almost blew their deadline waiting for him. The character was killed off at the end of the episode."
Ingress: The Animation,Who knew that Dan Harmon would turn out to be the affable one?
Ingress: The Animation,"The Roiland and Harmon part was pretty interesting, had no clue they had such issues with each other. I wonder if there was a single event or just what was discussed in the article that strained it?"
Ingress: The Animation,"Sounds like Rick and Morty losing Roiland is not really going to effect that much, get a new voice actor or two and maybe they‚Äôll actually show up and take direction. Could overall be a net positive for the series."
Ingress: The Animation,"I really, really want to know what I have to do to get a job where I‚Ä¶

- Make millions
- Surround myself with geniuses
- Win my industry‚Äôs most prestigious awards
- Gain an army of rabidly enthusiastic fans
- Get more responsibilities and opportunities

‚Ä¶while also‚Ä¶

- Rarely show up to work, FOR YEARS
- Be loud and derailing in meetings
- Sexually harass women the instant I gain professional access to them
- Blow company money at Toys-R-Us
- Make everyone around me look and feel bad

And literally not one person rats on me? Fires me? Blows my shit up? Not one?!

Like. How. Where. What do I have to do to get a life where I am coddled like a precious boy-king."
Ingress: The Animation,Why is he Sonic
Ingress: The Animation,"The only time I've heard Justin Roiland speak (as himself) was an episode of Harmontown he appeared on. The dude seemed really out there. Like on drugs AND a crazy weirdo.  When listening I was thinking ""uh oh...he's one of those show runners. The kind who will be in the news eventually"""
Ingress: The Animation,So...like [John Kricfalusi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kricfalusi) and *Ren & Stimpy*?
Ingress: The Animation,"A tale as old as time: ‚ÄúWe were always aware of the unethical/illegal actions of this person who made all of us a lot of money, but didn‚Äôt want to say anything until the actions are already made known to the public.‚Äù"
Ingress: The Animation,"It‚Äôs amazing how often this article repeats how Rolland is barely involved with Rick and Morty, as if to ensure it can continue on Adult Swim with minimal blowback.

That said, would Roiland still benefit from royalties even as he is cut off?"
Ingress: The Animation,"I don't think Roiland was ever considered a genius, unlike Dan Harmon. He was funny, with a lot of energy, and was a big part of the show's success... but that's not genius territory."
Ingress: The Animation,"I don't know about the rest of yall, but I never attributed R&M success to roiland, I always thought it was Harmon with a good writing room. I always assumed roiland was just voice work...and not good work at that. All his fucking voices sound damn near identical...except Rick IS unique compared to the rest."
Ingress: The Animation,"Is it really a surprise that fans felt his career was ""suddenly derailed"" when the reason why was kept a secret up until just recently?"
Ingress: The Animation,"Honestly I'm hopeful that the R&M writers will make the best of this. From this article and others it seems like Harmon and the other main show runners have been done with Roiland for a LONG time and he hasn't had meaningful creative input. Hopefully this is like a weight lifted for the rest of the writing staff.

The bigger unanswered question as I see it is what the next season will be like. Fairly sure it's already completely written (and maybe completely voiced too?) So do they rerecord Roiland's lines? And I feel like they'll have to add in at least a 30 second joke about the voice change. I hope the show carries on the same or better though ü§û"
Ingress: The Animation,"As a fan of the show (who‚Äôs used to liking things with awful fan bases) I was always annoyed by roiland and thought that he was only around because the seed of the idea was his from back in channel 101 days‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs so obviously Dan harmon‚Äôs show and ideas.

edit: originally autocorrected fan bases to canvases lol"
Ingress: The Animation,Never meet your heroes
Ingress: The Animation,"I'm reminded of what happened to Noel Clarke in the UK. BAFTA fellowship winner to career effectively over in under a week when 20 women came forward with claims of bullying, verbal abuse and sexual harassment. 

ITV had to pull the final episode of a ""stripped"" series from regular airing when the advertisers bailed, Sky had to cancel *Bulletproof* and BAFTA revoked his fellowship. No charges were filed due to lack of evidence, but he's done."
Ingress: The Animation,You either die a Morty or live long enough to to see yourself become the Rick ah geee
Ingress: The Animation,"He always gave off a manchild vibe, like he never actually matured to adulthood. Good riddance, I suppose."
Ingress: The Animation,Clearly this is another example of sex addiction a disease that overwhelmingly affects rich and powerful men.
Ingress: The Animation,"‚ÄúMore recently, multiple sources say that Roiland, other than voice work, has not had any meaningful creative presence on any of the series that bear his name. In fact, many of his former colleagues say they haven‚Äôt heard from him in years, and when they have, it‚Äôs been unpleasant.‚Äù

I have been theorizing this for YEARS and I‚Äôm not just saying that because this article is shitting on him. I‚Äôve always felt like he‚Äôs been a hyped up voice actor, with the limit of his creativity in R&M being the designs of the characters and Ricks ship. I‚Äôd be curious to see what else he came up with, but it‚Äôs always seemed like he did barely enough to earn that co creator title with Dan Harmon, who actually writes it. Maybe Rolland came up with the idea, which would make him a creator, but that‚Äôs the bare minimum of what people consider a creator."
Ingress: The Animation,Can these people just stop being creeps so that shows/movies/music stop getting ruined
Ingress: The Animation,"‚ÄúI turned my self into a felon, Morty! I‚Äôm WIFE BEATER RIIICCKKKK!!‚Äù"
Ingress: The Animation,"I had heard from a chick I knew, of his predilection. She said he was into 3 ways, but also mid teenage girls. Something like once he had some $ or any amount of power/fame he used it to hookup with the girls that wouldn't have given him the time of day when he was still a nobody."
Ingress: The Animation,"The moment I heard that Justin Roiland and Alex Hirsch had been hanging out together a lot, I knew exactly what was wrong. This guy doesn‚Äôt show up to work and thinks he‚Äôs the hottest shit for the work he doesn‚Äôt show up to anymore"
Ingress: The Animation,"I wish I was surprised by the fans' reaction, but I'm just not."
Ingress: The Animation,Imagine you're in a meeting and the boss drives a little R/C car in there with a microphone stuck on top and just parks it lol
Ingress: The Animation,Eerie similarities with John K. and how that sexual predator went down in flames.
Ingress: The Animation,It derailed before that. He was apparently a raging alcoholic. I hope he finds help.
Ingress: The Animation,"I love how it's always ""quirky genius"" instead of ""fucking asshole"" until the appalling behavior comes to light."
Ingress: The Animation,"Let's be real, who isn't really excited to see the next season now?

First you have two main characters getting recast and you know damn well they will find fantastic talent. Even if you can just barely hear a difference, I'm looking forward to that. And the obligatory meta scene about it. Hell make a whole episode plot about it!

Plus I always felt Harmon was the man behind the great story telling. And now this just confirms it. Without Roiland, I bet that Harmon won't be hindered by Justin's douchebagerry and we will see some of the
Best story telling the show has seen.

And there is a part of me that wants Roiland to watch R&M succeed even more so without him just so he can feel some negative emotions and knock that fucker down a few pegs."
Ingress: The Animation,Is there anyone here that remembers Bewitched?  One week they just replaced the dad and no one said a thing. I was confused but the new dad was a huge improvement from the old one.
Ingress: The Animation,"Dude was never a genius. He was a drunk idiot who did funny voices and threw out ""lolsorandom"" ideas in the writers room at best. Guy cant write a story to save his life and the best thing hes ever come up with is Lemongrabs scream. He never has or could, so I never understand why people think just cause his names in the opening titles that hes actually making these stories. Every episode is writers + Harmon with random shit sprinkled in by Justin. Writers + Harmon alone will be fine and probably better as the weirdest fans of this show always seemed to be the ones on Roilands dick."
Ingress: The Animation,He sounds like an asshole who made something cool once or twice. R&M is hilarious.
Ingress: The Animation,"I always scratch my head after reading a story like this, in which only one the interviewees is quoted as being concerned about whether this individual was inappropriate with a female colleague. Everyone else is worried about the prestige of their creative products. I‚Äôm not saying you can‚Äôt worry about that‚Äîof course, it‚Äôs natural‚ÄîI‚Äôm saying‚Ä¶Roilands are everywhere, and they proliferate in part because most people do not care about the targets of their abuse until it becomes a larger issue."
Ingress: The Animation,"I've heard from people who know him that he's a total dick. Like, obviously funny from afar, but insufferable if you have to interact with him."
Ingress: The Animation,I have a family member who works in the entertainment industry and they told me years ago that there‚Äôs been rumors of this stuff. Sucks to hear it‚Äôs true.
Ingress: The Animation,It would be great if his punishment could also somehow include McDonald's Szechuan Sauce.
Ingress: The Animation,Never go full John K
Ingress: The Animation,"Following his Instagram years ago was what led to that realization for me. Getting that extra little look into how he is when he openly expresses himself quickly tipped me off that this guy just isn‚Äôt right. He really just comes off as this emotional immature, overly volatile person who can never identify when to stop. And that last one is a big sticking point"
Ingress: The Animation,"Not a single person I know, fans included, were surprised by this"
Ingress: The Animation,"It‚Äôs always great when the people in power who had the ability to call out shitty behavior years ago, all come out after the fact to say they knew about it. See Harvey Weinstein."
Ingress: The Animation,This was not shocking to me. Rick and Marty while intelligent is clearly a cry for help and the ‚Äúmethod acting‚Äù behind the scenes video he put out of him getting drunk in the office back in like 2017 was the first indicator to me that he was unwell mentally in some capacity.
Ingress: The Animation,Quirky? I thought the mofo was just creepy
Ingress: The Animation,"It's not a long list, but I've never found people who have to drink to be creative to be good people. It's well known that Justin and many of the other writers would get drunk in the writing room and Justin would get drunk to do his voice acting work.

Roosterteeth is another company that's going through some controversy now and has always had a pretty steep drink culture.

I say this as someone who drinks, and likes to get drunk when the mood is right. If you have to get shit-faced to make entertaining stuff you've got a problem."
Ingress: The Animation,"Someday, maybe ‚Äúcolleagues‚Äù will speak up in these situations.  

Unless we want more George Santoses and Justin Rollandses?"
Ingress: The Animation,"While interesting I'm kinda skeptical of tabloids after watching Harry & Meagan. But really does make you think, curious what Harmon's take on this guy is."
Ingress: The Animation,Can‚Äôt trust someone in thin glasses
Ingress: The Animation,"""Suddenly derailed"" by charges from like two or three years ago ü§î"
Ingress: The Animation,Imagine being such a maniac that Dan Harmon is the adult in the room.
Ingress: The Animation,"Not to downplay Roiland as being a massive creep, but I have to admit; I did get a bit of a chuckle out of the article's attempt to wring maximum salaciousness out of the Riley Reid angle by framing it as him ""parading a high-profile porn star"" around the writer's room as if he had her naked and filming a hardcore scene in front of everyone to their maximum discomfort, when apparently it sounds like it was actually one of the more wholesome parts of this whole affair. She bought them all a houseplant for heaven's sake!"
Ingress: The Animation,Seems to me they put this article out in an attempt to assuage fans of their fears that this guy leaving will destroy the show.  It‚Äôs no different from an advertisement in the form of an article.
Ingress: The Animation,You read the bizarre defenses of talking about threesomes in the workplace and then you understand why the Rick and Morty fanbase is considered so toxic.
Ingress: The Animation,"All the people here saying ""I always thought Dan Harmon was the genius...not Justin Roiland"" are so full of shit. Some of us were here on Reddit when Rick and Morty originally dropped and y'all had Roilands cock so far down your throats."
Ingress: The Animation,Ah geez üò≥
Ingress: The Animation,"I am glad to hear he wasn't doing the writing. At least I know the show won't be missing that aspect and I don't care much if Morty changes a little. The only question is how much was riffing that I enjoyed in dialog, but I am sure an actual voice collaborator will make up for this."
Ingress: The Animation,100 years
Ingress: The Animation,"Honestly not to sound judgmental but I wasn't surprised when it came out he had been messaging underage girls, the kind of ""jokes"" he was making a lot of the time on podcasts were in line with that."
Ingress: The Animation,I would be willing to bet a large sum of money that Dan Harmon has lots of sexual misconduct skeletons in his closet
Ingress: The Animation,It turns out the toxic fan base is recantation of Roiland himself
Ingress: The Animation,"I guess it‚Äôs not surprising that Justin turned out to be pretty fucking weird and exploitive, given how his creative career started with insane shit like Doc and Mharti

Like, I‚Äôm pretty sure most people that weren‚Äôt totally disgusted by it were thinking ‚Äúholy shit this guy is nuts, I wonder what would happen if he was given a real budget and a staff‚Äù. Fast forward and‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs an abusive sociopath! Surprise!"
Ingress: The Animation,"So he hasn't been involved in the show's writing room since season 2.

That's weird, everyone at /r/rickandmorty kept saying how essential he is to the future of the series."
Ingress: The Animation,"I‚Äôve suspected that the writers have long detected red flags with Roiland.

While these companies are free to work with anyone he and to a degree Harmon seem to be the type of people you should probably have a ‚Äúparted ways‚Äù statement on standby."
Ingress: The Animation,How is this a surprise. He‚Äôs a POS and said some really weird stuff to minor girls through DMs. Doesn‚Äôt help how unfunny he is either; always the same stupid voice
Ingress: The Animation,"How brave of these colleagues to speak up now after the crimes have been made public and their comments don‚Äôt impact their own ability to make money. 

True heroes."
Ingress: The Animation,But no one  still listens to Chris Brown right??
Ingress: The Animation,"Justin Roiland's contributions weren't even really to writing. His idea of writing is just making up characters with silly names like ""Shploobie Bibbles"" and juvenile gross-out humor. 2 of his 5 writing credits over 6 seasons of R&M were inter dimensional cable, which we all know is largely improvised, and see my point above about Shploobie Bibbles. New voice for the titular characters will be the biggest change, and I doubt very many reasonable people will end up giving a fuck."
Ingress: The Animation,His behavior was troubling in public.  I listened to one episode of his podcast and felt like my soul needed a powerwashing afterwords.
Ingress: The Animation,Thumbnail at a glance makes him look like a bad Sonic the Hedgehog OC.
Ingress: The Animation,Lol I saw him as sonic in the thumbnail instead of Rick and was very confused
Ingress: The Animation,So all the people freaking out about Roiland's involvement blew it way out of the proportion outside or doing voices
Ingress: The Animation,But Elon Musk said he‚Äôs the heart of the show!
Ingress: The Animation,When did assholery become ok some might say. Others would say it‚Äôs always been. I‚Äôm sad for folks who he wronged. Feel stupid for finally getting to these shows and then this.
Ingress: The Animation,What a big dumb douchebaggy bag'a douche.
Ingress: The Animation,"&#x200B;

Holy shit, the [tiny RC car with a camera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii6XuM187Zo) on it is real"
Ingress: The Animation,"Amazingly well researched article. 

What a creepy fuck this Roiland turned out to be"
Ingress: The Animation,Next time they gonna say is that he started his own religion. Pigs are people.
Ingress: The Animation,"If story accurate, all he did was make himself easy to replace. Never a good idea in any job. His role was get the ball rolling and voice work. Like any exec producer really.  

This is different then why most of us thought which was he was neck deep in the day to day work of getting the shows made and so his voice (literal and figuratively) were a critical component. That clearly isn‚Äôt the case.

If you think all those Steven Spielberg producing credits was him rolling up his sleeves and getting to work, you lost your minds. His roll was to pitch it, get the money on board and then sit back, let everyone do the actual work and reap the benefits.

After that the actual creatives did the heavy lifting of the writing, directing, animating while Roiland just did voice work from comfort of home. Not saying voice actors are not important, but unlike some live action shows, they can be replaced as there are many that can mimic the voice.

As for his silence, well duh. Even a first year law student will tell you to ‚Äúshut the f‚Äî- up‚Äù when involved in criminal and civil cases. The worse thing he can do is say anything. Look at Adam Baldwin and his ill advised interview and how that is going to be used against him."
Ingress: The Animation,"For a man who created Rick Sanchez, I'll say it again, I'm not that surprised."
Ingress: The Animation,"Ahh yes, Hollywood reporter, they‚Äôre not bias or clickbaity."
Ingress: The Animation,"It really sounds like roiland just kept being himself and the success made everyone else be more cautious and that just didnt vibe with the ‚Äúwe are successful now so we must change‚Äù turn everyone took

You know, excluding the abuse stuff which is obviously terrible"
Ingress: The Animation,Whoda thought that the alcoholic who disguises hedonism as ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù nihilism is actually an annoying and crass human being.
Ingress: The Animation,Incoming netflix docuseries
Ingress: The Animation,Yoga
Ingress: The Animation,How is everyone in this comment section ignoring the fact that he's a huge pedo? That news is definitely what resulted in adult swim cutting ties.
Ingress: The Animation,"so basically, everything was fine as long as he brought them fame and power? yeh, sounds bout right."
Ingress: The Animation,Roiland trying to be Rick in real life.
Ingress: The Animation,When I first saw Rick and Morty I thought it was funny. When I saw that everything he has ever done is the same damn voice and humor I found him way less funny.
Ingress: The Animation,It‚Äôs always guys like Roiland that try to get their reports to join them for a threesome. ü§¢
Ingress: The Animation,"An episode aired last night with the toxic versions of Rick and Morty and it never occurred to me that Morty seduced two grown ass women, until just then. Never really put much thought into some of the shit that happens in the show until this stuff started coming out."
Ingress: The Animation,"I really like Solar Opposites, more than R and M. It‚Äôs a shame celebrities turn into raging douche canoes when they get a little money in the bank"
Ingress: The Animation,"He‚Äôd get shitfaced drunk to record his lines for Rick, how anyone would be surprised that he isn‚Äôt an alcoholic piece of shit outside of the recording booth is beyond me."
Ingress: The Animation,"Quirky genius? No, fuck that. 

I once pointed out awhile back, before the accusations began, that someone whose entire fame started with a BTTF parody in which Doc Brown wants Marty to suck him off, might not be the most stable guy in the room. I got downvoted to hell for it because you can't question the 'genius"" of some artists I guess. Those fans helped this guy gain his power, that he went on to abuse other creators and artists. They saw a guy who went through a lot of trouble to make the joke, ""a grown adult  wants oral sex from a teenager"" and said, ""shut up and take my money"" and he went on to become a grown adult trying to fuck teenagers. 

Who.

Fucking.

Knew."
Ingress: The Animation,"They should just write in Morty going through a late puberty, hire an actor with a crazy deep voice and never mention it again"
Ingress: The Animation,"Any true fan would have seen this coming a mile away, when I saw his method acting video like 4 years ago, I knew he had a lot of demons and trauma he wasn't able to deal with and his alcoholism was only going to get worse and get him into trouble."
Ingress: The Animation,He stopped showing up around the Third season? That‚Äôs when it all went downhill quality wise
Ingress: The Animation,This show is has been a minefield for its staff. I find it weird that few articles are mentioning the sexual harassment instances with Harmon as well.
Ingress: The Animation,"I first became a fan of Justin‚Äôs when he started his podcast way back in 2010. Generally he came off as a good person, with a crazy sense of humor, quirky ideas, and love for his friends and fans. He‚Äôd even get deep talking about his childhood, sense of paranoia for the future, and depressive episodes. Sometimes he‚Äôd come off as somewhat controlling, but it was his show after all. Just like in Rick and Morty he also did characters that went on comedic rants that were over the top, overtly sexual, scatological (lol), and just straight up funny and weird. Even if he responded to fan mail as one of these characters going on a lewd rant, he‚Äôd come back as Justin and usually say it‚Äôs just for the shock comedy and he loves his fans. Fast-forward to today and I‚Äôm not sure how to feel about Justin‚Ä¶ Worst case scenario, he was always an abuser deep down and it‚Äôs just finally come to light. Best case is he spiraled out of control under pressure becoming the personalities he always portrays in characters. Of course neither are excuses. I hope any victims get justice. I hope Justin gets therapy. And I hope the friends and family of everyone involved are doing ok."
Dr. Romantic,"I think a lot of the critics of the portrayal of Jerry West in the show should continue to watch the series, as his character becomes much more well-rounded and fleshed out in the later episodes. I even reconsidered his outbursts in the first couple of episodes and now think of them less as angry and more borne of stress and anxiety."
Dr. Romantic,"HBO:
>‚ÄúHBO has a long history of producing compelling content drawn from actual facts and events that are fictionalized in part for dramatic purposes. Winning Time is not a documentary and has not been presented as such. However, the series and its depictions are based on extensive factual research and reliable sourcing, and HBO stands resolutely behind our talented creators and cast who have brought a dramatization of this epic chapter in basketball history to the screen.‚Äù"
Dr. Romantic,If anything I love Jerry West more after watching the show.
Dr. Romantic,"I could care less about how accurate it is. It's just fun to watch, and probably the best show dropping new episodes currently. I love it!"
Dr. Romantic,There are times where I think we're going to get Jerry West doing a orgy and sniffing cocaine off a Playboy Bunny's butt. They really go wild with Jerry West
Dr. Romantic,"This is going to end up in court with a civil suit and Im not sure hollywood wants that.

Even with their disclaimer at the end of the episode I wonder how a court may rule about studios using the names/likeness of individuals who are still living in a fictional way. 



I do find it weird for HBO to respond with the ""factual research"" respone. Especially when so many invovled in the Lakers org are stating its completely false. I figured they'd fall back in their disclaimer. This wont end quickly"
Dr. Romantic,"Granted HBO didn't get the order of games correct with Indiana, and Detriot, Boston a few episodes back"
Dr. Romantic,Well I guess that means the dude really was an asshole.
Dr. Romantic,"This show doesn‚Äôt have a single cool white person, Larry bird wasn‚Äôt a chew spitting hick lol and Pat Riley wasn‚Äôt a loser"
Dr. Romantic,lot of hooplah over a mediocre post Big Short Adam McKay tv show.
Dr. Romantic,"I have few illusions that this show is not packed with massive fictionalization.  There's disclaimers galore (which they didn't even do for the highly fictionalized Chernobyl) and many of the scenes and events seem ludicrously broad.  I mean Jerry West argues with a talking statue.  

But the big surprise to me is how much we're enjoying it."
Dr. Romantic,His bit with Magic to close out last episode may be my favorite moment from the show so far.
Dr. Romantic,"I dont even have to look back at the earlier outbursts....this is a man who (if the show is telling the truth) played basketball as a kid so he could drown out the sound of his dad abusing his mom....Basketball was never something he *wanted* to do. He *had* to do it or he would've gone crazy.

I'm not a sports guy by any means and I guess the real life West is entitled to his opinion and wanting a better characterization, but where people see a rageaholic, I see a troubled guy who can't let go of the one thing that kept him sane."
Dr. Romantic,I think he's more pissed about how the show says that he was trying not to draft Magic.  He is still working for teams and some of those supposedly bad decisions that the show says he wanted to make are not exactly good for his scouting career.
Dr. Romantic,[deleted]
Dr. Romantic,"Winning Time is good, but you're doing Better Call Saul dirty"
Dr. Romantic,"I have never thought we were going to get that from West. From Buss? Yeah, I definitely expect that."
Dr. Romantic,I mean were you alive in the 80's?
Dr. Romantic,Then you're not watching the same show I'm watching because they almost never show West outside of when he's with the team and the only real odd deviation in those segments was when he showed up to a practice in his fishing gear once.
Dr. Romantic,It's very unlikely  theres a disclaimer and hes a public figure
Dr. Romantic,Yes it will end quickly. Think about everything Saturday Night Live does. They don‚Äôt even have disclaimers. West would get laughed out of court.
Dr. Romantic,"What was the correct order?  I'm assuming they took it from the book, and if there was deviation it was to build the arc with the road trip going from ""easy win"" to ""home to see Cookie"" to ""boss battle""."
Dr. Romantic,Am I wrong?
Dr. Romantic,"I agree. And in that scene West came across as calm, mature, intelligent, and collected.

He threatened today to bring a lawsuit ""all the way to the Supreme Court"" if he has to. I think that would risk setting an extremely dangerous precedent. It's also not a great way for him to prove that he's not, in fact, prone to angry outbursts."
Dr. Romantic,Dude has more genuine love and passion for the game than anyone else in the show and its killing him that he can be that close and can't go out there and do it himself because he knows how because he was the best. Its breaking his heart knowing he just can't  coach them to the next level
Dr. Romantic,[deleted]
Dr. Romantic,"It's a colloquialism that everyone knows the meaning of, whether it's technically accurate or not. So we don't need internet heroes like you pointing it out."
Dr. Romantic,"You are right. Tokyo Vice, Gaslit, and Atlanta are pretty great as well."
Dr. Romantic,"West was a pro athlete, the world is their oyster"
Dr. Romantic,"I can see some conservative judged ruling in his favor, for the exact reason you put above."
Dr. Romantic,"They were talking X-Mas, visiting Detriot and Boston which shows up as:

* Dec 23 -- Seattle

* Dec 26 -- @ Kansas City

* Dec 27 -- @ Utah

* Dec 28 -- Boston

* Dec 30 -- Phoenix 

* Jan 2 -- @ Indiana

* Jan 6 -- @ Milwaukee

* Jan 9 -- @ Washington

* Jan 11 -- @ Detroit

* Jan 13 -- @ Boston"
Dr. Romantic,Is Dr. Jerry Buss not white?
Dr. Romantic,"Olivia de Havilland brought a similar lawsuit a few years ago because of how she was depicted on the show ""Feud.""  It eventually failed, but it came alarmingly far in the appeals process.  I remember there being real concerns about how to adapt works based on real people going forward if her suit were to succeed."
Dr. Romantic,"I just like the show, but don't like sports at all. I like the show. 

I hate baseball, but love Moneyball."
Dr. Romantic,"It‚Äôs a fucking stupid colloquialism, because it means the opposite of what‚Äôs being said. People should just say the right thing"
Dr. Romantic,"People are trying to make you sound less stupid, and you keep digging in your heels defending your right, rather than just learn and grow.

Seems pretty stupid to actively put in extra work to want to be/come off as dumb/unintelligent but whatever. You do you."
Dr. Romantic,"Not a chance. The courts have essentially protected Alex Jones and Rush Limbaugh while knowingly lying. Why? Both say they are entertainers. Same thing that protects Tucker Carlson.

I‚Äôm sure West and others are upset, but they came forward for one reason and one reason alone: there was a Magic documentary that was dropping on Apple TV+ two days later. That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs the whole reason they whined about the HBO show."
Dr. Romantic,"You mean the guy who fictitiously sexually assaulted his nurse last episode? Yes he‚Äôs white, very cool of him right?"
Dr. Romantic,It‚Äôs hard not to be romantic about movies about baseball
Dr. Romantic,It‚Äôs only stupid if you‚Äôre a typical Reddit user who needs to cling to trite and pedantic memes in order to make yourself feel smart.
Dr. Romantic,"West is upset because the show portrayed him as somebody who had a problem drinking, which he didnt according to a variety of sources. 


Conservative judges will do anything to get one up on holywood elites. I am sure west's team can find 1 federal judge thatll back them from the trump era."
Dr. Romantic,"I'm only to the episode where they Beat the Celtics on xmas, I'm not sure how many episodes back that is, but are any characters on the show really all that 'cool' in general? Magic is a womanizer and an egomanic, all the players are focused on themselves, Jeanie is only there because shes Jerry's daughter. 

Anyway you sound mad fragile if your gripe with the show is it has 'no cool white people'. Go watch Marvel you herb."
Dr. Romantic,"The phrase really is quite annoying, though."
Dr. Romantic,Pointing out that something means the opposite of what‚Äôs being said isn‚Äôt pedantic dear.
Dr. Romantic,"Oh yeah and Paul westhead is a pos coward that gets thrown in a shower‚Ä¶ he actually never had a losing streak and beat the pistons on that road trip

And yea I do think the other characters in the show seem a lot cooler. And that‚Äôs because magic and Kareem were super cool irl, I just think it‚Äôs weird they make other cool people seem like losers"
Dr. Romantic,"Indeed when it adds not substance to the conversation other than making a loser feel smart, it is pedantic."
Dr. Romantic,So a deciding factor for you on the quality of a TV show is how cool the white characters are in said show?
Dr. Romantic,"Look man, you‚Äôre free to say things wrong, but it seems a bit stupid to throw a hissy fit when it‚Äôs pointed out."
Dr. Romantic,"No, I would feel the same way about it if it was the reverse. I just think it‚Äôs questionable how the show is portraying people we know about"
Dr. Romantic,"Hissy fit, eh? Believe me, calling you guys losers is shockingly easy to do. Don‚Äôt have to psyche myself up or anything."
Dr. Romantic,But I got downvoted a bunch so the majority is on your side
Dr. Romantic,Ooo you‚Äôre hard
Dr. Romantic,A Dark Quiet Death was good but Backstory was absolutely phenomenal. I'd watch a whole series of those characters in their youth. Josh Brener needs a starring vehicle ASAP.
Dr. Romantic,"I love how the next episode continued the story into the present, William Hurt was great"
Dr. Romantic,Ive heard good things about this show but i couldnt get into it after 1 season.
Dr. Romantic,[deleted]
Dr. Romantic,"Both those episodes were very good but...


Overall S2 just isn't very good IMO. I miss the comedy in this show. It's been WAY to serious throughout.  

While Backstory was the serious episode for the year,    a lot of episodes are dramadies at best. Let's have some fun again people."
Dr. Romantic,"These are known as bottle e\[episodes, character focused rather than narrative centric that contributes to the over arcing serial format."
Dr. Romantic,"I‚Äôll probably just watch this episode, I liked season one but two episodes into season 2 and I just kinda lost interest. The comedy feels less balanced."
Dr. Romantic,"I personally preferred the follow up over the first one, but ""Backstory!"" cannot be discounted because it lays the groundwork on everything that then becomes the emotional payoff in the next episode."
Dr. Romantic,Season 2 is much better as is usually the case with Reddit‚Äôs favourite shows
Dr. Romantic,"I wouldn't have either until I took a chance on a few episodes of 2. It's way, way better."
Dr. Romantic,"Well they‚Äôre usually a slowed down deep dive on a/a few character(s) in shows that are typically more plot focused. 

And Reddit loves when there‚Äôs reasoning for plot vs things just happening cause ‚Äúwhy not?‚Äù (hence loving the first 2/3 of game of thrones and not so much the last 1/3) 

The good self contained episodes tend to end up giving lots of reasoning for character actions that already occurred and then also sensibly can set up future ones."
Dr. Romantic,Yeah that last episode after the 2 parter with CB was really unimaginative. The storyline with Ian and poppy is just really boring this season.
Dr. Romantic,"It happens sometimes that the best part of some show is the chemistry between the main couple, specially if the plot isn't strong. In that case it makes sense for the producers to make the story revolve around the two of them because it's what viewers want. But i think producers tend to do go overboard with it. If it isn't clear that 90% of the audience watch that show only because of the couple then plot of the series shound't be neglected. Because as we see from your examples few things i think happen: part of the audience doesen't ship that couple or want to see more of some other couple, part of the audience that does like the couple gets dissapointed with how their story involves and the other part that watched for the plot stops watching. For a 80min's movie if a story only follows one couple then that isn't a problem but for a tv show it happens that the audience doesn't end up liking all that relationship of the main couple ""suffers"" for the sake of a interesting plot. That happens often. I guess my point is the plot is very important,an excelent series can't exsist only besed on a chemistry between two actors. Changing the story while considering viewers wishes yes but not to the extend where the whole original plot of the series disappears."
Dr. Romantic,"From Community:

Jeff: ""It's called chemistry. I have it with everybody"""
Dr. Romantic,"I'd say it depends on how they are making the story. If the writers behind it know that they want to go from A to B on a certain path and that's the story they want to tell then they should stick to the plan.

If the story is being writt5 as they go and they don't have a specific hard end then I think they should take what they are given from a chemistry perspective and try to work that in since it feel more natural that way."
Dr. Romantic,"Really wish someone would upload a clip of him in acting class where they're talking about how killing people is fucked up, while Barry starts freaking out because that's his life, and he isn't fucked up, right?"
Dr. Romantic,"Give it up for NoHo Hank! That dude's accent, his dumb text messages, and his demeanor should not go unrecognized. Hank is awesome. Hope he and Barry have more scenes this year. "
Dr. Romantic,Reddit and exaggerations... name a better duo.
Dr. Romantic,"‚ÄúWhy did you say that?!‚Äù

That‚Äôs two actors that I didn‚Äôt expect to be in one of the most intense scenes in recent memory.  

The ‚Äúfantasy‚Äù scenes of his wife hearing the news cut between Hader breaking down was the cherry on top for me.  Such a brilliant show"
Dr. Romantic,Agreed and I too loved Taylor. He was like Doakes from Dexter.
Dr. Romantic,"An amazing episode! But no, it is not even close to being one of the best single episodes. Just stahp it!!"
Dr. Romantic,"I have, no joke, seen at least a dozen threads on this subreddit over the year singing the praises of this show, and never once have I seen a single comment actually talk about *why* Barry is so good.

I know I can look up a synopsis on my own, but it is an odd pattern I've noticed. The subreddit says Barry is beautiful, what about it is beautiful? Barry has great characters, but what is great about them? Amidst all the praise I couldn't even tell you what genre this show is in."
Dr. Romantic,It's a great episode but this post took longer to read 
Dr. Romantic,It's pretty decent yeah. 
Dr. Romantic,"I didn‚Äôt really like that they made Barry do such terrible things, at least this early in the show. My interest in watching Barry was significantly diminished watching this episode and especially the finale. Barry‚Äôs a straight up piece of shit; I no longer care if his relationships or acting career succeeds; this guy sucks and deserves to get caught.

I know a lot of people like it, and it was certainly an unexpected development. However, I just feel it weakens the rest of the show. If these were the final episodes, cool. But as the beginning of a show that presumably plans to go for several more seasons, it made me much less interested in Barry as a character. He‚Äôs basically the villain of his own show."
Dr. Romantic,"damn. i watched it, thought it was good, but not *write a 2000 word essay about it* good. dude this is some next-level nerdy shit. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø"
Dr. Romantic,"I really wish people would just say, ""This is one of my favorite"" instead of, ""This is one of the best EVER"""
Dr. Romantic,4chan and Nazis
Dr. Romantic,"When this show was airing season 1 last year, there was a post like this every single Monday."
Dr. Romantic,"Just an honest opinion I hold. It's all good if you disagree. I realize it's a bold/grandiose statement in scope that many people won't agree with, but it is my honest-to-god personal opinion."
Dr. Romantic,Reddit is the BEST exaggeration site EVER!
Dr. Romantic,"[Some fries, mother fucker.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leeP6LgM8H0)"
Dr. Romantic,">never once have I seen a single comment actually talk about why Barry is so good.

From my post:

>I can't think of any other show or movie that so nimbly shifts between straight-up comedy, dark comedy, action, drama, tragedy and back again as expertly as Barry does

And a specific example:

>Only a few minutes into this episode, it has already demonstrated what this show does better than anything else on TV or in movies. We started with a comfortable and somewhat serene opening with a John Denver song, instantly shifted to action with the Bolivians shooting up the car, instantly shifted to comedy with Cristobal and Goran and then closed out the opening with a serious and traumatic moment for Chris that absolutely devastates and shatters him. Somehow -- somehow -- this wild rollercoaster makes perfect sense tonally within the confines of the show.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding what you're getting at, but if you're looking for a generalized explanation as to why this show is good (or why I like it, at least), then there's your answer.

As for characters, well, the last few paragraphs of my post get into why Barry is an enticing character, though it obviously contains significant spoilers. I don't really delve into the other characters since this post is really about Barry's character only (and how Chris's character affects his), but I do off-handedly mention how every character in the show, from the police to the amateur actors to the gangsters, are all somehow affable and likable since every character gets to take their turn at the show's more comedic moments.

Plus, maybe you should give the show a shot rather than scouring Barry threads for opinions! I didn't know anything about Barry when I first watched it other than Bill Hader was the lead and was blown away at how excellent it was since I knew nothing going in. It's only eight episodes at thirty minutes per episode, so it's not a heavy investment, either! Definitely worth a try. :)"
Dr. Romantic,Just watch it dude.
Dr. Romantic,"You could say this about pretty much any show this subreddit likes, it occasionally happens but on a whole you could say the same thing about people that like Breaking Bad or The Handmaid's Tale. This isn't a subreddit full of professional critics, it's a subreddit full of people that like television. Therefore most people aren't going to be able to give in depth explanations of why a show is so good. If you want something like that you need to look up professional reviews of the show. "
Dr. Romantic,"It's Dexter if it was a dark comedy with really delightful side characters, like quirky mobsters, self-obsessed actors, and Henry Winkler just kills it as the acting teacher. "
Dr. Romantic,">If these were the final episodes, cool. But as the beginning of a show that presumably plans to go for several more seasons, it made me much less interested in Barry as a character. He‚Äôs basically the villain of his own show.

I actually agree with this. After the first season finished airing, I was under the impression it was a standalone mini-series and I thought it was the perfect way to wrap up the story it told. I'm still excited for season two, but I am admittedly concerned that it'll be a lot more difficult to capture the same magic given the events of the last two episodes of the first season."
Dr. Romantic,"I think you have a point. Barry's ambiguous morality was a strength and now that's mostly gone. You could excuse Chris's death because it was true that him going to the cops would be a death sentence for both them and Chris's family, but the ending to season 1 was driven by pure self-interest."
Dr. Romantic,I tend to read them as interchangeable when I see a post that says that. Because really that‚Äôs what they mean. 
Dr. Romantic,"Which is of course totally fine and I love the show, I think its just because your title atleast presents it as a definitive rather than opinion. "
Dr. Romantic,So say ‚ÄúIn my opinion...‚Äù in the title 
Dr. Romantic,"In my defense, your entire opening post is marked for spoilers and I am not wont to open those willy-nilly. But you are correct, that is exactly the sort of synopsis I was looking for, I'm actually interested in watching Barry now!"
Dr. Romantic,"> This isn't a subreddit full of professional critics, it's a subreddit full of people that like television.

I mean, you should still be able to spare a few words as to why you love it. Like if someone asked about Legends of Tomorrow, I would say that it's a fun and funny time-traveling sci-fi show that never takes itself seriously and yet manages to be full of heart. Something short and sweet like that, y'know?"
Dr. Romantic,Thank you!
Dr. Romantic,"Fair, but I do think that when discussing the quality of any piece of media or art, it's sort of a given that a person's statement regarding it is going to be his or her opinion rather than fact. :P

Although in that context, your original comment about exaggeration still holds true. It's just something I honestly believe!"
Dr. Romantic,"Hope you enjoy it! You might not think it‚Äôs as good as I do (because I mean look at this post, I LOVE the show!) but given it‚Äôs rather short length I don‚Äôt think anyone would say it‚Äôs a waste of your time to give it a shot!"
Dr. Romantic,"damn, this list is more useful than I thought lol. Definitely missing a 'High school or Teen comedy' category though.

also, change 'Crashing' to 'Crashing (US)'. Can't be forgetting about Pheobe Waller-Bridge's underrated masterpiece **Crashing** just yet. "
Dr. Romantic,"Ash vs Evil Dead, not an outright comedy but very funny and continues on the Evil Dead franchise

Son of Zorn, only had one season but very original idea about an animated 80s He-Man style dad and his human family

The Grinder, cancelled after one season but incredibly underrated. Rob Lowe plays an actor from a family of lawyers who moves back home to work with them

Mike Tyson Mysteries. An animated show starring Mike Tyson (Tyson also provides the actual voice) and his gang as they go around solving mysteries Scooby-Doo style. High concept meets lowbrow humour

New Girl, ensemble sitcom about a girl moving in with three guys. A bit in the vein of Brooklyn Nine-Nine

Trailer Park Boys. Canadian sitcom that on the surface is about three guys committing petty crimes and doing drugs but deep down a show with a lot of heart

Brockmire. Hank Azaria playing a washed up baseball announcer who moves to a small town to rejuvenate his career"
Radiant,"If I'm not mistaken the entire series was available on the CW app (it was the Seed, but I think they shut that down and it's just the regular CW app now, but of course you could just buy it on DVD for cheap now too).

But yeah it was an excellent show with an excellent cast. I love Jeremy Sisto and wish he was in more stuff. It was made by the same woman who made As Told By Ginger, which was a Nicktoon I watched as a little girl - and recently as a grown woman - and boy howdy is that show dark at times for a ""kids"" show. She also made ""Selfie"", which was criminally underrated as well. Last I heard she was cooking up something new, so I can't wait to see what that could be.

But yeah it really should've lasted longer than just 3 seasons!"
Radiant,"The first season of Suburgatory is brilliant. The first half(ish) of season 2 is pretty much just as excellent as S1, but somewhere in the back half of S2 it starts to get a little uneven. 

Season 3, though... not great, especially not compared to what it was in S1/first part of S2. I mean, it definitely still had good moments but IIRC, the storyline got so weird and convoluted that I understand why it ultimately ended up canceled."
Radiant,"I watched it as it aired.  It's how I discovered Jane Levy and was also my first show where I noticed Cheryl Hines (as I hadn't seen Curb yet at that point).  It was a fun show.  I think I tuned in for the premise and Alan Tudyk as I was a big fan of Firefly.   If you need more Jane Levy then I highly suggest the roku channel as it has Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist.  For more Alan Tudyk, Resident Alien.  And Chery, of course those first like 9 or so seasons of Curb Your Enthusiasm.   Oh and Ana Gasteyer & Chris Parnell were amazing as well.   Parker Young also is in about half the episodes. He went on to be in Imposters (a hidden gem, IMO) and is currently in United States of Al (which is decent).   The overall cast is great."
Radiant,"Love Suburgatory!! And Jane Levy! 

I was very disappointed when I was unable to find the rest of it on DVD. I was desperate to find out what happens in Season 2 since Season 1 ends on a bit of a cliffhanger...so I took a chance and bought it off a (sorta shady) website I think called HardtofindTV. The discs play fine though, and it was the complete series set. However. I don't usually support shady/unofficial sites so I was stressed about the whole thing. But all my usual paths to find it on DVD led nowhere. 

I heard ABC pulled seasons 2 and 3 from retail shelves after their cancellation, but I still would love to know why.  Seems massively stupid to me."
Radiant,"This show definitely didn‚Äôt get the credit it deserved, ABC isn‚Äôt always great at promoting their comedy shows especially around the early 2010s. Suburgatory, Happy Endings, Don‚Äôt trust the B, Selfie, just to name a couple.

I just restarted the show this afternoon actually, still so funny."
Radiant,All of the episodes are available on [CW's site](https://www.cwtv.com/shows/suburgatory/pilot/?play=e7c9ab58-7bc9-4687-9d07-e5319cd37135).
Radiant,The other two seasons aren't there to prevent your eventual disappointment.
Radiant,Liked what I saw of this one. Might have to track it down.
Radiant,Was really looking forward to some backstory or completed version of Perfect Nightmare sang by all 3 of them.
Radiant,"Emily Kapnek is working with Karen Gillan again on a musical animation for Disney+.
 So we'll get to hear more of Karen's singing!"
Radiant,"Ana Gasteyer is currently on NBC's new comedy ""American Auto"" too! I thought I recognized her from this show as the neighbor girl's mom."
Radiant,Carly Chaiken (Dalia) was also really good in mr Robot!
Radiant,Thats crazy they never released the entire series on dvd and its not on any normal streaming apps now.
Radiant,Oh this just sounds *wonderful*! Thanks for letting me know!
Radiant,I should probably give that show a chance.  I think the only new broadcast show I picked up on this tv season was Ghosts (which was great).  She was great on the TBS show People of Earth.
Radiant,No prob! I also post related stuff over at /r/SelfieTV if you are interested. I like most of Kapnek's shows so I hope this can last a while longer!
Radiant,"It's a little wonky in the beginning because they just throw you in with no explanation of anything...which I don't usually like. 

But it's created by the same guy who thought up ""Superstore"" which I LOVED. Absolutely the most realistic depiction of big-box retail I've ever seen. :) 
They've aired the first five episodes of ""AA"" as of now."
Radiant,"Oh, that's a small red flag for me... I didn't enjoy Superstore and dropped it after the first season despite liking the two leads from other shows.  I'll still give AA a chance.  I have peacock thanks to xfinity internet, so I can try it out there."
Radiant,Nobody is watching this show for the writing.
Radiant,"I don't know what it is, but I really enjoy messy teen dramas with (potential) murder mysteries. 

Pretty Little Liars, Tiny Pretty Things, Elite. 

Are they completely ludicrous? Yup. 

Am I gonna continue to watch them? Yup."
Radiant,"Agreed, it was sooo bad but so goooooood. I‚Äôll legit be disappointed if it doesn‚Äôt get picked up."
Radiant,"I agree, it was really awful...but I also watched the whole thing. The dance scenes were the thing that kept me around. It was absolutely ridiculous."
Radiant,"I started it because Dance Academy is one of my favorite shows, and I couldn't even make it through the pilot...I do plan on trying again with lower expectations though."
Radiant,"You said it in your headline, it's very entertaining, no matter what you think of the quality.  For me the dancing and the gratuitous nudity more than made up for any plot holes.  Most shows have the plot holes without the bennies. ;-)

And I agree that ""Bette"" was by far the best actor in the show and has a ""made for the camera"" face.  If anyone breaks out from this, it will be her."
Radiant,This show really was pretty little liars but make it ballet üòÇ
Radiant,I‚Äôm still scratching my head about that ending tbh.
Radiant,Do that many teenage boys really care about ballet? About half the school is made up of male dancers.
Radiant,"Man, I don‚Äôt know how you can possibly criticize this show... without mentioning that totally clusterfuck ending episodes where the storylines didn‚Äôt make any damn sense at all, suddenly one person loves another one out of nowhere, a nearly falsely committed murdered is just walking around without a worry in the world, we can‚Äôt even tell whose side anyone is ok because they kept switching allegiance out of nowhere, most of those relationship storylines are nearly dropped and tossed out the drain and everyone‚Äôs just dancing around performing on stage while people are getting pushed off buildings and getting stabbed lol. The characters are terribly written (safe Bette and the teacher whom I thought was a quite compelling character) and one of them is suddenly killed off for whatever reason. I thought ‚Äúeh, this show is actually pretty meh and the murder shit got me hooked‚Äù but those last two episodes just caught me off guard, like wtf happened? All in all, I‚Äôm definitely up for a season 2."
Radiant,I literally just googled this because I was thinking the same thing. I‚Äôve never found it so difficult to get through a series. And I love ballet stuff.
Radiant,"*Let's talk about the elephant in the room here too, the fact the everyone's naked goddamn near half the time*

A friend of mine worked on the show as part of the production crew. He enjoyed the experience."
Radiant,It was so terrible! I especially noticed how terrible all the actors were. And how completely far fetched the plot was. Absolutely horrendous. But I watched it until the end.
Radiant,"I just wanna say that Pretty Little Liars writing was better than the writing in this show.  Of course, it's been years since I've watch PLL so maybe I'd change my mind if I saw it now but this show's writing was just terrible.  Lol.  Some of it didn't even make sense or things would just happen out of no where, like people getting together that didn't even have a lead up to them getting together. 
Also that moment where it's so randomly noted that the choreographer is what's her faces father was so wtf?? ü§£

So many moments throughout the show.  I did finish it though, couldn't stop watching but I'm also a dancer so I loved the dance aspect, had it not been about dancers I would not have watched.

I did like Shane though, he was fun and that other kid.  I can't remember everyone's names tbh.  Lol


The MOST annoying part of the show is that bitch Bette that everyone defends for no reason.  She is so horrible the entire show and they make it out like she's actually a good person... um... no.  I wanted to see someone knock her lights out lol"
Radiant,"I thought that the series would be bad BUT that I would enjoy watching it. I really wanted to. But honestly, it isn't good, not even for guilty pleasure. 

The story is bad and almost all the actors too. The book is better, I don't really get why they didn't just copy it. It could have been a good-easy to watch TV show with the book story."
Radiant,I really liked Dance Academy. Thanks for mentioning other decent ballet shows.
Radiant,"You can just say you enjoyed it, you don't have to act above it. 

It knows what it is and you know what it is (since you ended up watching it all and even say it entertained you). 

Don't put a front, just enjoy what you enjoy."
Radiant,"I have only seen the trailer for it on Netflix but from that, I could tell it was just a pretty little liars lookalike in a ballet setting. IDK why anyone would  expect:

>the step by steps of chorography, the development of dancers or the other intricacies of dance

Based on the previews, all the teens and the aforementioned PLL similarities, I did in fact expect a terrible plot, a lack of logical thinking and an overabundance of nudity and sex scenes.

Thanks for watching and writing this up so I know my suspicions have been confirmed and I can comfortably skip this. I will say though, as someone else commented, there are people who enjoy this type of teenage mystery/PLL clone so I guess the networks will keep churning them out until they go out of fashion. At any rate, the audience for this is most likely not the audience of Dance Academy."
Radiant,Whatever
Radiant,https://discord.gg/Q9kg8CFp
Radiant,"I agree with everything you say including the bad acting, in the first episode there's a scene of Oren eating a burrito and I swear he bites into it the most awkward way possible."
Radiant,The fact that Nabil was crying more than the parents....lol
Radiant,"I really think the cop was inaccurate as well. I mean, for the most part they were doing interrogations outside the station and releasing information to literally everyone. Usually cops, at least on tv, conduct conversations with possible suspects or witnesses inside the station in an investigation room. Another thing, the cop only talked to the minors??? I haven‚Äôt seen a scene yet where the detective talked to the principal, if anything, the principal should be the main suspect bc the dancers were her responsibility and it was her business Cassie got hurt in. Another thing, why wouldn‚Äôt the dancers bring up the fact to their parents that a detective is sussing them of a murder attempt? Also, I understand detectives are assigned cases, but literally what‚Äôs this cops deal? She had no other case to do? Why do she fact check each student by revealing what the last person said? That‚Äôs not how interrogations work and if so, that‚Äôs dumb bc now all of the potential suspects can change up the story bc they know what the detective is thinking. It‚Äôs also her lack of seeing the pedophilia for me? I know it‚Äôs a dance school but literally everyone is naked majority of the time. The detective didn‚Äôt think the fact that these minors were out pass curfew MOST nights doing who knows what and that they were half naked majority of the time that she shouldn‚Äôt have raised questions abt the authority in that place??? Like come on. That‚Äôs the first thing you check in to for a crime like that. Another thing, I‚Äôm not sure if the investigation was open, if not then she shouldn‚Äôt have been pursuing those kids so openly bc it wasn‚Äôt in her right. But, why wouldn‚Äôt she close the roof off for further investigation on the crime scene? She could‚Äôve found evidence that she missed like that hoodie NAVAEH found right below the roof. Why didn‚Äôt she look deeper into the kids lives to find a motive? She‚Äôs steady going off of ‚Äúshe said, he said‚Äù. Like these are teenagers you‚Äôre investigating, you gotta be smarter. 

And cassies parents literally didn‚Äôt exist like what, someone just tried to kill your daughter and you still let those ppl near her while she‚Äôs unconscious. If anything nabil filled that role. 

And why didn‚Äôt navaeh show the detective the picture of Cassie and the dance teacherüò©???? That was such an obvious lead."
Radiant,Can still leave hate‚Ä¶.
Radiant,Elite is pretty well written and acted though. It's way better than most teen dramas.
Radiant,"Might I dare say, √âlite (before that terrible 3rd season) and Pretty Little Liars (up to a point) are way better put together shows than Tiny Pretty Things. In fact, √âlite is pretty great (before season 3 of course). 

The key is consistency and cohesion. The show can be over-the-top or just straight up absurd, that's not a flaw (well unless that's not what they were going for), many shows are, but if it lacks consistency and simple logic to the point where the viewer is questioning everything the show is putting in front of them, then that's when it's *bad*."
Radiant,Idk. I think pretty little liars was definitely better written and provided a more riveting storyline (specifically in the first few seasons. The latter seasons were definitely way worse).
Radiant,"The show is meant to take place at an elite dance school, so approximately half the students would be boys, yes."
Radiant,There's plenty of male dancers.
Radiant,"The three last episodes were a train wreck! A car crash, more police investigation, suddenly June's mom is back, Oren and Neveah fall in love, Nabil is heartbroken and quiet again so his character progress was for nothing, and Cassie wakes up saying some random stuff. Just way too much"
Radiant,wait u found this through google? im amazed. lol.
Radiant,üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Radiant,"Same here! I just wanted a good ‚Äúbad‚Äù show to watch, and this was just plain bad."
Radiant,"If you're considering Flesh and Bone now, don't. It's not good. Worse, nothing in it resolves. Truly a waste of time."
Radiant,it's soooooooo bad though. üòÇüòÇ i might've enjoyed it ironically but i can't write a post telling people i found it to be good.
Radiant,"maybe i should start watching the trailers/previews for shows, ü§î i usually just read the synopsis and look at the poster then jump right in."
Radiant,If you want a good teen drama with a murder mystery to watch you should check out Elite.
Radiant,And what are the pretty little things? I'm still trying to figure out the relevance of the name to the show....
Radiant,"Tbh the only teen dramas that doesn‚Äôt feel like a guilty pleasure is euphoria,skam, and skins that‚Äôs it. Those are the essential trinity of teen dramas imo"
Radiant,"2 years late comment but I watched the show recently and you are definitely right. 

I don't mind messy shows especially since they can still be entertaining. 

However, those other ""teen drama"" have all been better put together overall. 

It's a shame because it would have been nice to see those dancer-actors improving more to the point of appearing in future contents but it's been 2 years and I don't think I saw them appearing anywhere in general (except for the couple of named actors)."
Radiant,Yep! I put in ‚Äúthe writing is so bad on tiny pretty things‚Äù and here i am!
Radiant,"I literally just googled why is this so bad, and your post is top of the list. My wife is watching it, I try and play on my phone in the background, but I have nearly put my phone thru the TV. Genuinely deathmetal at the TV after the tenth sex scene this episode. I think its truly irresponsible to have this much casual teenage sex and not mention protection at all. But the thing that killed me the most? Sniffing coke in a sauna! A god damn sauna! Clearly have never done drugs ffs I wish they had the writing might be more on point. Yeah I'm soo efing mad at this for no reason üòí"
Radiant,Do you think it is still worth watching even if I don‚Äôt personally mind it not having a resolution?
Radiant,That would do it. I myself will not watch anything without a trailer and/or reading a critic or 2. There are so many shows and movies out there that I just wouldn't be able to decide otherwise. And it has the bonus of taking out the absolute trash. Or at least it lets me know it's trash I'll enjoy.
Radiant,"Oh I know about Elite and I've watched every episode of that hot mess. Some of the plotlines were a bit over the top but I think over all, it held up pretty well."
Radiant,SPOILER: Ramon tells Cassie he‚Äôll destroy the tiny pretty things she loves.
Radiant,"I disagree, well kinda. I'll agree that most teen dramas aren't necessarily great, but i'd throw a few more worthy ones on top of those, like √âlite, L'amica genaile (My Brilliant Friend), Freaks and Geeks and My Mad Fat Diary. 

But either way, gald to see you mentioned Skam. Not many people here know about that one."
Radiant,üòÇüòÇ
Radiant,"If you have a particular interest in ballet and go into it with lowered expectations, then maybe. But only maybe."
Radiant,Harry Potter but the magic is chess and Hagrid is tranquilizers.
Radiant,"I was honestly surprised by how much I liked it. I thought it would just be some ok drama about a ""genius"" chess player, but it was actually a hard look into brilliant vs mad. Her self-destructive behavior as a sort of coping mechanism. The possibility of a genetic component and the internal struggle with her dead mother's mental state and what that means for her own.

And lastly, the set design is dope. Those wallpapers were awesome."
Radiant,I am three episodes in and The Queen's Gambit is awesome!
Radiant,"When I saw on my Netflix front page I was actually really annoyed about the whole thing... Because the story of the real best woman chess player ever, Judit Polgar, is so fascinating. Like, why are you making up chess heroines with wild back stories? Judit's parents raised her and her sisters as basically a fully-documented experiment with the explicit plan from birth of making them grandmasters. I want an 8-part Netflix series about them dammit! But a Hungarian social experiment proving her crackpot father (partly) right to become a top-10 player in the world clearly will never have the same drawing power as an American orphan fighting against all odds. Really the player she resembles the most is Bobby Fischer, at least the whole ""no-one can beat the Russians"" plot.

Anyway I quickly overcame my gripes about the premise and fell completely in love with the show. I agree with OP's review that it doesn't quite dig deep enough into Beth's character - nor anyone else's. No-one is one-dimensional but everyone stops short of feeling quite fully fleshed out. And I would've loved to see more of that kid she met in Mexico! I kept hoping he would pop back up and he never did :(

Edit: I can't get the spoiler tag to work. Anyway good show very happy"
Radiant,Just finished it today. Great show. Couldn't care less about chess but this show was fantastic.
Radiant,Let's look at the previous excitement offered around Chess ..  [https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/chess-the-musical-611220](https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/chess-the-musical-611220)
Radiant,"Walter Tevis also wrote {{The Color of Money}} and {{The Man who fell to Earth}}

Should be good."
Radiant,"I finished watching it yesterday,and thought it was great."
Radiant,I think you'd really love March comes in like a lion.
Radiant,Totally out getting the press it deserves! Terrific show
Radiant,OP if you responded to this you should check out the movie that made Paul Newman famous - The Hustler (1960). It's about a pool but hits very similar themes and was based on a Tevis novel as well. One of my absolute favorite films.
Radiant,I still can't grasp why the ending left me so confused and melancholy despite it being a happy end which im normally completely fine with. I guess it has something to do with her character.
Radiant,I thought the custodian was hagrid
Radiant,Yeah I assumed because woman+chess that it was a biopic of Judit Polgar initially. Whatever gets more people interested in chess though.
Radiant,"I loved the show as well, but thanks for telling me about Judit Polgar, reading the Wiki article right now and totally agree that it would make for a great show/documentary as well, crazy story."
Radiant,"[I get my kicks above the waistline, Sunshine](https://youtu.be/rgc_LRjlbTU)"
Radiant,March comes in like a Lion is a god-tier anime and I think is in my top 5 (which is a list that features Attack on Titan and Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood)
Radiant,Just what type of moves are you contemplating?
The Bride of Habaek,The jokes about Annie were brutal lol.
The Bride of Habaek,[Mirror.](https://streamable.com/01seqr)
The Bride of Habaek,> Let's just all agree it's uh... still okay
The Bride of Habaek,BD Wong could have reprised/parodied his role. Dude has killer comedic chops and co-starred with Bowen in Nora From Queens.
The Bride of Habaek,"One of the many things I love about the show is how McBride has said he makes a point of not ending any season on a cliffhanger. Both for just in case they aren't renewed, and that he sees each season having its own self contained story and antagonist that wraps up in the end."
The Bride of Habaek,Didn‚Äôt he do this for ‚Äúeast bound and down‚Äù as well? I love his writing.
The Bride of Habaek,This show is gold.
The Bride of Habaek,"People are saying season 2 was more boring than season 1‚Ä¶ What show did you guys watch? I thought season 2 had more jokes, more action, and more of a plot than season 1 did."
The Bride of Habaek,I‚Äôm a little sad Eric Andre won‚Äôt be back in season three. He‚Äôs always awesome.
The Bride of Habaek,"One of my favorite shows since it began airing, I‚Äôve never been a huge Danny McBride fan but after watching the righteous gemstones on basically a lark I appreciate his comedy more, the show is the perfect fit for him which makes sense since he‚Äôs one of the forces behind it. This show also has one of the best casts around, from Edi Patterson, Goodman, Walt Goggins, Adam Devine, Skylar Gisondo and Cassidy Freeman

What he says in the interview about ‚Äúthe idea of struggling to be the best version of yourself‚Äù really is the backbone of the show and the season one finale really did a great job highlighting that, from Baby Billy changing his ways to Goodman‚Äôs sermon and Jessie going to Haiti to help his son, a show I recommend my friends and get happy when they like it"
The Bride of Habaek,Not a bad idea in this age of quick cancelling.
The Bride of Habaek,The ending was hilarious and amazing!
The Bride of Habaek,The Baptism episode in Season 2 is comedy lightning in a bottle
The Bride of Habaek,Mamma told me not to I did it anyway misbehavin‚Äô!
The Bride of Habaek,Daddy said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt write season 3‚Äù but I did it anyways. Misbehavin‚Äô.
The Bride of Habaek,When did variety because such a spam filled site. Thank goodness for reader mode
The Bride of Habaek,"I know this is a pipe dream, but I would love to see them perform a mass on a live tour."
The Bride of Habaek,Season 2 didn't hit like season 1. Hope season 3 is better.
The Bride of Habaek,"Everything Danny writes/directs has been awesome so far, Absolutely love his shows."
The Bride of Habaek,Is this show worth watching?
The Bride of Habaek,Will this finally be the season of Keefe? My man deserves success
The Bride of Habaek,"This is the perfect character for McBride. I mean, he basically plays the same character in everything he‚Äôs ever been in, but Jessie Gemstone is an absolutely perfect fit for that character."
The Bride of Habaek,Season 3 news makes my bird twitch.
The Bride of Habaek,"The charm of this show is the Gemstone family members. Anytime they add in an outside character, I don‚Äôt care as much. The Eric Andre  and Jason Schwartzman characters were just in the way of the Gemstones story. I guess there needs to be conflict in order to keep the plot moving, but I think there is more than enough conflict within the Gemstones and their Megachurch"
The Bride of Habaek,It's Kenny Powers goes to church but it's been entertaining.
The Bride of Habaek,"Season 2 was great, not sure what life changing experience people were hoping for."
The Bride of Habaek,"That said, season 2 was pretty disappointing. It moved so slowly and boringly and then they tried to reveal so much at the very end. Live season 1, couldn‚Äôt wait for season 2. Was really disappointed. It was..ok."
The Bride of Habaek,"Season 2 was ok, love McBride and everything he does."
The Bride of Habaek,Great first season
The Bride of Habaek,"Season 2 was a bit of a let down until the Young Guns ending, which was perfection."
The Bride of Habaek,It‚Äôs a toilet baby?
The Bride of Habaek,Season 2 was kind of shit. The resolution with Andre was rushed.
The Bride of Habaek,Adam Levines scenes in the show were all so stupid. Season one was so much better.
The Bride of Habaek,I love the redneck gay character w a mullet. God! It‚Äôs such a hilarious quiet joke. I just always wait for him to appear. Also the sibling rivalry is the best.
The Bride of Habaek,Season 2 sucked honestly. Funny moments here and there but overall the story was dumb.
The Bride of Habaek,The biggest disappointment was them killing off Scott MacArthur.
The Bride of Habaek,"Doesn't deserve it. They had a great idea, which we saw come to life in season one. For season two, they completely lost the thread. All of the wit and heart from the first season evaporated for the second. Bike ninjas sound great in a writers room, maybe..."
The Bride of Habaek,I‚Äôm convinced that Danny McBride is just an asshole and every character he plays is just him being himself.
The Bride of Habaek,I love that he does that. There's nothing worse than when season 2 ends on a cliffhanger and then the show gets cancelled. The Mick is the worst for this. Poor Sabrina T\_T
The Bride of Habaek,This is one of the things that made ‚ÄúThe Wire‚Äù so great for me. Each season was a slightly different show but with most of the same players.
The Bride of Habaek,That's cool of him
The Bride of Habaek,Screw cliffhangers.  If people like a show they'll be back the next season no matter what.  Just give each season a satisfying conclusion.  I derive no enjoyment as a viewer from cliffhangers.
The Bride of Habaek,Santa Clarita diet ending the way it did still kills me. I much prefer the wrapped up nicely seasons.
The Bride of Habaek,"Danny is such a smart guy and great at what he does.

As far as cancellation goes, I feel like his relationship with HBO has made his shows pretty much bulletproof though."
The Bride of Habaek,I wish Raised By Wolves did that‚Ä¶ now I‚Äôm left with so many questions
The Bride of Habaek,Didn't he end season 2 on a cliff hanger??
The Bride of Habaek,Yes and Vice Principals which is also on HBO
The Bride of Habaek,UNCLE BABY BILLAY!
The Bride of Habaek,"I‚Äôd compare it more to a ruby, emerald, or diamond. Any sort of special rock. There‚Äôs a word for them but I just can‚Äôt put my finger on it"
The Bride of Habaek,So classless & I love it
The Bride of Habaek,"My only beef with S2 was that I felt like the storyline with the Lissons was rushed. They basically disappeared for the middle part of the season, and then it felt like they came back out of nowhere. I really think they needed more episodes to fully flesh out that story arc."
The Bride of Habaek,"I felt that there was a large shift between season 1 and 2 but I can‚Äôt quite put my finger on it. S2 just didn‚Äôt do it for me, it felt like the characters were all acting weird. I can‚Äôt explain it."
The Bride of Habaek,I dont think it was boring but Season 2 was somewhat subpar compared to season 1. The muscle man arc was somewhat meaningless and we needed more of the lissons. I think Goodman was wasted in season 2 . But watched it in 2 days and can‚Äôt wait for season 3!
The Bride of Habaek,"Idk what everybody else watched, but im genuinely surprised you're not getting more pusback.

 It had funny parts, but the story was slow, disjointed, and downright bad. 

Kelvin's storyline sucked ass and he was the funniest part of season 1. They wasted John Goodman for most of the season minus like 2 episodes. They wasted Eric Andre. Bj saved the season."
The Bride of Habaek,My wife and I think season two is like the peak of comedy. I‚Äôve literally never seen my wife laugh so hard.
The Bride of Habaek,Dude the muscle men sub plot.... so funny. Keefe is comedy gold
The Bride of Habaek,S2 is superior to S1. I haven‚Äôt seen much people saying S1 was better.
The Bride of Habaek,Same
The Bride of Habaek,The vomit scene in season 2 is probably the hardest I've ever laughed at anything on TV.
The Bride of Habaek,I felt like Season 2 was a (good) Godfather Part II running joke.
The Bride of Habaek,"Unpopular opinion, I know, but I‚Äôm okay that Eric Andre doesn‚Äôt wont be back.  

He‚Äôs funny, but there‚Äôs so many good characters.  Eric is best in measured doses."
The Bride of Habaek,"I'm not and I was really looking forward to him, but he was kinda boring for most of the season and only got good at the end."
The Bride of Habaek,Idk I thought that ending left it open so that he could come back.  Imagine how funny that would be also.
The Bride of Habaek,"I'm glad the show wasn't just a dunk on ""haha Christians are dumb."" The Gemstones are true believers, just extremely misguided. Eli really has the most heart of the family because he remembers not being rich and famous. And it's made very clear that losing their mother was what put them all on this unrepentant decadent path."
The Bride of Habaek,"All of his shows have a similar vibe, I recommend them all but pace yourself.  The similarities are also a bit repetitive.  Do one, watch something else, do another."
The Bride of Habaek,"All of the actual sermons are actually on point; it feels like they went out of their way to ensure that the characters were always the focus of ridicule/comedy and not the religion. 

Not that those types who would most benefit from the lessons of the show are actually watching it..."
The Bride of Habaek,I was dying at the cake throwing scene in that episode
The Bride of Habaek,"Waiting for the internet to implode on itself these days, in a massive wet ad fart."
The Bride of Habaek,"I love this idea, though to be a stickler it would be a service (or a revival, perhaps?) not a mass."
The Bride of Habaek,"I could see them doing something ‚Äòon brand‚Äô creatively to scale this, though ‚Äî like a real, traveling state of the art hologram show ‚Äî a la the Tupac technology  ‚Äî with all of them in virtual form featuring real live music and probably some animals. All in some smaller venues that wouldn‚Äôt command such a high ticket price for such a meta joke‚Ä¶The joke being the Gemstones couldn‚Äôt be bothered to really go on a small city tour so made a virtual one and still expect people to attend and fawn over them! Would be a cool marketing experience for season three, to be honest‚Ä¶"
The Bride of Habaek,"My Crazy Ex Girlfriend did a tour. I never saw it, but I really wanted to! I‚Äôd definitely go for a RG tour."
The Bride of Habaek,Not gonna lie. I‚Äôd go to a concert of baby billy and Aimee Leigh. That misbehaving song  be stuck in my head
The Bride of Habaek,I agree but it was still good to watch.
The Bride of Habaek,Really? I thought the jokes were a lot punchier this season.
The Bride of Habaek,They need to make it a hour long.
The Bride of Habaek,except Halloween Kills..
The Bride of Habaek,Totally
The Bride of Habaek,"I watched the first 3 or 4 episodes when season 1 first came out, then forgot to keep watching. I got bored a couple of weeks ago and binged the rest. It's very good, and pretty much everyone in it acts their asses off"
The Bride of Habaek,What?? I had no idea this show existed and now Im going to find it asap.
The Bride of Habaek,You think there's zero self awareness to the characters he plays?
The Bride of Habaek,Stop reminding me of The Mick's ending
The Bride of Habaek,My Name is Earl is another one that ends on a horrible cliffhanger.
The Bride of Habaek,The Last Man on Earth üò´
The Bride of Habaek,"On the other hand, if only Westworld *had* been cancelled after the first season finale (a cliffhanger) then it would have been one of the best shows of the past decade. 

Instead it greatly outstayed its welcome, and devolved into a mess."
The Bride of Habaek,"Raised by Wolves, RIP"
The Bride of Habaek,"For closure....
https://www.thewrap.com/the-mick-cliffhanger-sabrina-season-3/"
The Bride of Habaek,"Sick Note had it worse man, some big secret gets exposed at the end of season 2 and we never get to see the fallout from it. The central plot is never resolved."
The Bride of Habaek,This just happened to Raised By Wolves on HBO.
The Bride of Habaek,In my list of top five for that very reason
The Bride of Habaek,"Eh idk, I think there‚Äôs narrative merit to a well executed cliffhanger. Severance‚Äôs finale is a great example imo."
The Bride of Habaek,I love British shows because they keep them short and sweet.
The Bride of Habaek,Fuck Netflix
The Bride of Habaek,Not that I remember. The Lissons were taken care of and the family had reconciled their insecurities and problems with each other in regards to how much power they had in the organization.
The Bride of Habaek,"No, but Season 1 sure felt like it had some dangling threads that didn't get picked up in Season 2."
The Bride of Habaek,Vice Principles had a pretty serious cliffhanger at the end of season one.
The Bride of Habaek,Vice Principals was written from beginning to end in one go and filmed the same. It was always gonna be just two seasons. Danny wrote it to be a movie originally before getting to make it as a limited series.
The Bride of Habaek,Now who wants to suck an old man‚Äôs dick?
The Bride of Habaek,Sweet Ambrosia!
The Bride of Habaek,...misbehavin'?
The Bride of Habaek,"‚ÄúNo, he‚Äôs not a baby. He‚Äôs a slender, silver-haired man in his late 60s.‚Äù"
Ordinary Heroes,"I have seen qhite a lot of popular anime, but i have to tell you, attack on titan is by far superior. That show is just 10/10"
Ordinary Heroes,"While we're on the topic of anime, I started rewatching Fullmetal Alchemist (the 2003 series) and I just got to the Nina episode and I'm not mentally prepared for it... This is one of the few times I actually have a hard time getting myself to watch an episode of a fantastic series because of how tragic the episode is."
Ordinary Heroes,"Thanks for the recommendation! I‚Äôm surprised you gave My Hero Academia such a low score. What I liked about it is that side characters had a chance to shine, unlike some other popular animes  where the side characters disappear. But I see where the main storyline can be repetitive !"
Ordinary Heroes,"great recommendations. 
You should probably check out the great pretender on netflix, its really good!"
Ordinary Heroes,If you love sports anime also check out Run in the Wind. Its more of a drama show with Sports as a backdrop than a sports show. But it is surely worth a watch.
Ordinary Heroes,"If you have time to check it out, try these three sports anime. HAIKYU, Kurokos basketball, and Chihayafuru. That last one, is probably my fave anime at the moment."
Ordinary Heroes,"You'd love Assassination Classroom on Hulu. The English dub is actually really good.

My only issue with NHK is the whole Manic Pixy Dream Girl shit."
Ordinary Heroes,will definitely check out 1 or 2 of those when i get the time. admittedly i've never seen a sports anine before.
Ordinary Heroes,"Very feel good, but unrealistic at the same time. It's generally for a teenage demographic, I feel, but I still love them; this is coming from someone who doesn't even play sports in real life."
Ordinary Heroes,"TL;DR: The show blames the operators, while actual data seems to blame the equipment and regulations. The show draws heavily from a fictitious book written by someone with a personal grudge and less authority and knowledge than they claim to have had."
Ordinary Heroes,"Funny, I watched the show and I got the impression that yes, the operators were somewhat to blame for pushing the equipment. BUT the equipment was faulty to begin with because the USSR didn't want to pay for correct equipment. They wanted to do everything the cheapest way possible. I didn't know anything about what went wrong in Chernobyl before this miniseries so all of these conclusions came from the show."
Ordinary Heroes,No offense to OP but that's a mammoth post to read. Can someone give me the tl;dr version please?
Ordinary Heroes,"It‚Äôs a fucking tv show, fcs."
Ordinary Heroes,Did we watch the same show?
Ordinary Heroes,"Jesus, komrad, we are never gonna read all that. I guess that's why you/Russia are producing another TV show that blames US black ops forces for Chernobyl, huh?"
Ordinary Heroes,You here to promote the new russian version with CIA bad guys?
Ordinary Heroes,[deleted]
Ordinary Heroes,"The likely hood is that this show distorted the facts for a worse reason than the Soviets. They were protecting their countries reputation.  Not defending this at all just pointing out that the people distorting the facts for this show probably just did it to make a better story. After all you need a good villian.

I see the Russian moles have turned their attention to my comment."
Ordinary Heroes,Ra ra Rasputin lover of the Russian queen.
Ordinary Heroes,"That wasn't really my takeaway from OP. The show doesn't wholly blame the operators, but it does make Dyatlov seem like a power tripping ignorant tantrum throwing teenager, when many actual reports do not support this. I think that's the issue they have with the show. They make it seem like the path leading toward the event was mainly the result of one idiot's incompetence, when that may not really be the case."
Ordinary Heroes,Guy says that the show was not showing the true image of the operators and  they were making Dyatlov to be too evil and the problem was solely because of the Soviet totilarian system. Most of the other commenters  thought he was a Soviet sympathizer and he's how look like shit without even reading his badly written paragraph. Just a classic case of people jumping to conclusions without knowing the case. OP's at fault himself here for not explaining well though.
Ordinary Heroes,TV shows are disturbingly influential in making a narrative seem concrete. Historical works of fiction have to be held to an impeccable standard of factual sourcing.
Ordinary Heroes,"Jesus Christ, did you read any of what he said?

Or did any of the morons who upvoted you.

He wasn't absolving the USSR of any blame, just pointing it at the right people in the USSR"
Ordinary Heroes,I love how you just didn't want to read and called him a Soviet sympathizer when he wrote things that were blaming the USSR.
Ordinary Heroes,"It's so obvious that is hilarious. Why would Joe Redditor take the time to put all this together?  

Those Russians really don't like that show very much do they.

Edit:. It's been pointed out that I jumped to the wrong conclusion.  I was wrong."
Ordinary Heroes,"Read the post, it's not about US vs USSR. It's about blame being properly given and not stacked upon dead men who can't defend themselves."
Ordinary Heroes,"TV Shows based on historical events are incredibly influential. When they aren't factually based, they are literal propaganda."
Ordinary Heroes,"Oh look, another person that didn't *even* skim the OP and yet still has an opinion anyway.  Isn't that neat."
Ordinary Heroes,"Not really. Art/entertainment is disturbing influential in bringing the topic up for discussion. Apparently that‚Äôs working pretty good in this case. However, creative liberty‚Äôs are quite often used to make the material entertaining. I don‚Äôt have any problem with knowing the facts, but I don‚Äôt expect HBO to teach me. Since watching this limited series, I‚Äôve learned more about Chernobyl reading about it. Up until then, I totally forgot it even happened."
Ordinary Heroes,"He's basing his argument on the guy being ""railroaded"", and the sketchy results of the ""official"" investigation.  

The only way to get to the bottom of it would be an official forensic investigation done by a team of qualified historians and inspectors/investigators, coupled with an experienced nuclear engineer spotting contradictions between the physical evidence and the witness testimony.

The reality is that no one on reddit will (ever) know what the ""correct"" story is.  Chernobyl is merely entertainment, cloaked as a cautionary tale."
Ordinary Heroes,[removed]
Ordinary Heroes,"Because people don't like propaganda being fed to them.

The Russian government would take more issue with this post than the actual miniseries.

Use your brain and read the post."
Ordinary Heroes,I don't have an opinion. I presented lyrics.
Ordinary Heroes,"> I don‚Äôt have any problem with knowing the facts, but I don‚Äôt expect HBO to teach me

The same can't be said for others who take it as facts."
Ordinary Heroes,I'm sorry *morons* don't read a post and then get offended when called out for it.
Ordinary Heroes,So yeah. I did skip most of it and I did completely misinterpret it. Thank you for pointing it out. I admit when I'm wrong.
Ordinary Heroes,"Yeah, I know. They also take everything on Facebook as fact, and you know how that worked out for the US."
Ordinary Heroes,">I admit when I'm wrong.

One of the best character traits to have. I'm guilty of not always doing that myself."

Ordinary Heroes,"Totally, I haven't started GoT either and I have successfully avoided spoilers so far which seems kind of impossible with me being on the internet."
Ordinary Heroes,"It's a pity amon ended up being the villain who gets a giant flashback - imo amon is a villain that has a good enough motivation to stay strong without backstory, meanwhile Unalaq is a villain that desperately needed backstory to become interesting. They lost a lot of potential here..."
Ordinary Heroes,"Pretty close to my feelings, I think I just liked season 4 a little more than you and season 1 a little less. 

Main reason for 3 > 1 is the ending. The truth behind Amon was kind of underwhelming for me and turned him into just another rogue bender; he could have been one of the single-episode nuisance villains of the original series. He almost would have been better being left as a mystery, or as a multi-season villain if they had known the show was going to go on. His philosophy and methods were genuinely frightening for Avatar; his ideals were the least cartoonish of any Avatar villain. You almost agreed with him, making for an interesting viewing experience. 

3 was simply the most consistent season. Zaheer and his squad were really fun/scary to watch, having bending abilities not seen before. The showdown with Tenzin is one of the best moments in the series, and the collapse of the Earth Kingdom was one of the darkest moments in either ATLA or Korra.

I liked 4 until the last few episodes; ""giant battle to save the city/kingdom/whatever from the death machine"" felt kind of... done. It was really just a scaled up version of the drill thing from the original. Until then season 4 was awesome. Korra's PTSD/recovery was surprisingly introspective and realistic for a kid's show. Kuvira herself I really liked because I felt like she was a reasonable portrayal of a proto-fascist leader for what was still, ultimately, a kid's show. Having her sucker in some of the good characters was a shrewd move in demonstrating her allure. It's a shame her resolution was so lame, along with her push to attack Republic City. I think if we had known her advisors and inner circle a bit better, giving a sense of Earth Kingdom/Empire nationalism among her supporters, that decision would feel more earned. 

Season 2's problems are well documented. Unalaq was really underdeveloped and the ""ultimate light spirit vs. ultimate dark spirit"" finale was way lamer than it thought it was. The two parter of Beginnings is great, as was the episode with Iroh, but otherwise season 2 was kind of all over the place, and didn't really have one consistent arc throughout. It was also almost totally filler for the non-Korra characters. 

Overall, I think Korra's biggest failing was the amount of filler material and weaker characterization for the main cast. Team Avatar 2.0 just wasn't as dynamic or interesting as the original version. In the original, an episode focused just on any one of them could be great, whereas I almost came to dread Mako, Asami, or Bolin-focused episodes. The filler issue is probably because there wasn't an overall ""defeat the Fire Lord"" arc to hold everything together and moving in the same direction, but it's there nonetheless."
Ordinary Heroes,"Seasons 1 and 2 were somewhat boring to me, but Seasons 3 and 4 made it all worth it. Perfect finish to a great series. "
Ordinary Heroes,"This might be a bit nitpicky, but
> the main plot of Season 4 becomes like Season 2, another ""somebody is taking over the world"" type of situation.

She only wants to unite the Earth Kingdom (which used to include Republic City), so no world domination here.

The only thing I disagree a lot with you on is season 4, which is one of my favorites."
Ordinary Heroes,"> The character Kuvira is not too well developed, and everything is so rushed. It's basically like two episodes and she has taken over the entire earth kingdom and has a Sauron-level army.

I think they did a good job explaining why she did what she did firstly by her logical reasoning and in the finale the emotional reasoning. As far as her army remember after the Earth Queen died there was no one to run the Earth Kingdom. Kuvira was the one who stood up and took action. I'd imagine that would be an admirable person to follow as a soldier. It is three years after S3 at the start of the first episode she already has most of the Kingdom in her control and mostly willingly. "
Ordinary Heroes,"I've always said Legend of Korra is like The Pacific to Airbender's Band of Brothers. Not as good or as coherent, but still enjoyable and very much worth your time if you're a fan of the latter."
Ordinary Heroes,"I can't fault Bryke for how the show turned out given how much Nickelodeon basically fucked with it from the get-go, but it was certainly disappointing how it ended.  The ending just seemed like a forced statement that was also pretty much just fan service to shippers.  I contrast that to [spoiler](#s ""LGBT relationships"") that are more natural and appear better accepted, like on The 100.

Besides that, I think Book 1 and 3 were the strongest, and Book 2  and 4 the weakest.  Book 3 and Book 1 both had complex villains with motives that a lot of people could honestly sympathize with.  If you're born without bending in the TLA world, it really *does suck* for you, and you can see why Amon's powers were particularly attractive.  Given how much Korra and her predecessors have screwed things up in the past, you can see why anarchists would want to end the cycle too.  It was just great storytelling from that perspective, and the villains had a good deal of character development.  Contrast that with 2 and 4, which tended to have cartoonishly evil villains with cartoonishly evil plots.

That being said, I think the show was certainly a bit overanalyzed because of the hype from the original series.  Honestly, this is a show produced on Nick, and it's pretty good given the circumstances.  The people who were TLOK's earliest fans probably watched the original TLA series, but that show ended 4 years before TLOK, and I think the time difference matured the audience a good deal.  A rewatch of TLA really doesn't show it to be that much better than TLOK; a lot of it really came down to nostalgia.  "
Ordinary Heroes,"Season 1 might be my favorite season too

I think it would be season 1,3/4, then 2 in order

Amon was simply an amazing villain a seemingly unstoppable extremist , like a force of nature, with a good critique of the crumbling corrupt system.

Each season actually has an extremist with a point that takes it too far, in season 1 it's a commie like extremist pointing out the unfair advantages of benders, in season 2 it's a theocrat, in season 3 anarchists blowing up a decaying kingdom, in 4 a facist strong woman uniting the country. The compromise is a Democracy (which they note in the epilogue) possibly one of the reason that people dislike season 2 is that not many fans, even religious fans think we need a bit of theocracy in our government."
Ordinary Heroes,"Korra was a bit disappointing to me as a whole. Despite have about half the episodes each season and thus far less filled compared to TLA, it still managed to be boring at times

That being said, season 3 was just so good it makes up for everything else imo. Zaheer is my favourite villain from any show, him and his crew were simply amazing. I legitimately wanted Zaheer to take over just so we could see them more "
Ordinary Heroes,"I thought seasons 1-3 were terrible, didn't bother with the last one. The animation is beautiful though."
Ordinary Heroes,"I think each season had strengths and weaknesses. I liked season 1 the most too, but the sports bending was pretty boring."
Ordinary Heroes,[deleted]
Ordinary Heroes,Let's not forget the worst character ever: Wu. They literally took Sokka Season 1 goofiness X10.
Ordinary Heroes,"See, I think had they been given a set ""you have four seasons"" they could have made Unalaaq/the dark spirit the ultimate villain. Give him more time to be built up, give him some motivation. Essentially being the Anti-Avatar FEELS like something a show would do in its final season. Have ""The Convergence"" be the big event of the series, like the meteor was in the first one.  

Of course, then we wouldn't have gotten Zaheer, who was simply a phenomenal villain. "
Ordinary Heroes,"She desired power so much. I truly believe her goal shortly after would have been uniting the entire world, to share her greatness. Sounds familiar."
Ordinary Heroes,">  fan service to shippers

I'm weird but I don't like when characters are shipped just because they're good friends (gay or straight).  Korra really needed to go off to the spirit world alone, as her character as an avatar needed to develop away from those she cared about.  They could have still alluded to her feelings, but that she had a quest to complete on her own."
Ordinary Heroes,"I don't think Kuvira is a cartoonish villain, I just think it ended in a cartoonish way. Giant robot. "
Ordinary Heroes,"When I rewatch ATLA I think it's better still. Mainly, each season had a lot more episodes, so they managed to fit in a lot of Eastern philosophy (Iroh) and way better character development."
Ordinary Heroes,"Actually, Korra was only about 8 or 9 episodes shorter.  It had smaller seasons, but it also had one extra season."
Ordinary Heroes,"The fact that Amon basically would beat any bender without using bending is pretty insane. Literally, that makes him like the best at martial arts out of anybody/"
Ordinary Heroes,Have you heard about Guru Laghima? 
Ordinary Heroes,"I actually quite enjoyed Wu. I liked the portrayal of someone who legitimately has a good heart but has grown up in such a way that he is deluded to reality. I also thought his character arc was well done. He pissed you off in the beginning, but near the end it was clear he was really a good guy."
Ordinary Heroes,"I was thinking more in terms of individual seasons though, not the series as a whole

That's the one thing that really struck me after season 1; just how fast the story went by"
Ordinary Heroes,Neh he still made me angry at the end lol.
Ordinary Heroes,Would you rather have an entire episode where ~~Piccolo and Goku~~ Korra gets her driver's license?
Ordinary Heroes,"I'm thinking more of Avatar episodes like The Storm, or the Beach. Great episodes that go deep into characters without really advancing the plot at all."
Ordinary Heroes,"Two upcoming new ones that I'm looking forward to are 

HBO's series *Westworld* check out the cast: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westworld_(TV_series)

and a Netflix original series called [Narcos](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2707408/) about Pablo Escobar."
Ordinary Heroes,You should watch the show The Shield (not to be confused with Marvel Agents of SHIELD). It's a show about dirty cops.
Ordinary Heroes,"Transparent, Olive Kitteridge, The Good Wife, The Affair, Homeland's rebirth, Getting On, The Comeback, The Missing. I'm glad most of them are not cop shows. It shows how diverse TV can be. "
Ordinary Heroes,"It's incredibly important to maintain the distinction of the network schedule vs cable and online. The Leftovers is a bold, promising artwork. As is Olive Kitteridge. Transparent. The incredible end of Boardwalk Empire--the best season this far of Newsroom and Louie. Orange in the New Black, and House of Cards stand as towering achievements. 

You're argument seems to indict the landscape as a whole. Network television is dead so stop using it as a ruler in which to measure the rest of the already full, burgeoning art form that is television. For this is far from a vast wasteland we are experiencing--it is an embarrassment of riches. And one should not focus upon what new series will single highhandedly revolutionize television. We already live in a revolutionary time.  "
Ordinary Heroes,"While I agree that network tv is as bad as it has ever been, I think there are plenty of interesting new programs elsewhere. Two new shows that I recommend: The Affair (Showtime) and Transparent (Amazon)"
Ordinary Heroes,"Just to stick the final nail in this coffin: Olive Kittridge, Transparent, Silicon Valley, Manhattan, Salem, Fargo, The Leftovers, The Strain, AND THE FUCKING KNICK! Penny Dreadful. The more titles I think of the more angry I get at the OP premise. It's been a damn fine year!"
Ordinary Heroes,"A show about the bad side of the police? What are you, some sort of hippie, liberal, baby-killing Muslim commie?"
Ordinary Heroes,"Maybe for new stuff, but Arrow and Person of Interest are still really good in my opinion, and Suits is as well (though it's on hiatus now).  The good wife as well.

There's always going to be cop shows."
Ordinary Heroes,"I have to disagree. How To Get Away With Murder is the best show I've seen in a long time. I'm loving Bad Judge, Forever and Resurrection too. 

But for me HTGAWM is just so damn good and takes the cake this year. "
Ordinary Heroes,Aren't highschool dropouts the people who would hate cops most?  People who aren't very educated tend to despise authority more often.  
Ordinary Heroes,[deleted]
Ordinary Heroes,"I love the good cop shows because that reflects reality.  This TV season has been very good. Not as good as the last one, but still brilliant."
Ordinary Heroes,"I have seen it and didnt like it. They tried to justify the means the bald guy took showing that it was effective. While he may got criminals by his illeagl methods, they didnt mention or show that also harm innocent people. Because it isnt always so clear and easy to know, thats why we have a justice system. "
Ordinary Heroes,"I am talking about new shows, no question Boardwalk Empire is great. I am not demanding a new revolutionary shows but just quality like Sopranos, The Wire, Deadwood. 
"
Paprika,Love Cathy Yan but that's bizarre when there's already a great movie based on the same book. Is there enough for a series?
Paprika,"Didn't the late, great, Satoshi Kon direct an animated movie based on the same novel? Funny that Deadline couldn't be bothered to mention that."
Paprika,"Hope it‚Äôs good. Satoshi Kona‚Äôs film was great, so expectations are probably not good. Excited to see so many ‚Äúit copied inception!‚Äù comments in the future /s."
Paprika,I was right I knew Amazon would differ from other streaming services by giving up on streaming anime and instead focusing on creating live-action adaptations of anime. The Promised Neverland live-action adaptation has the chance of being huge.
Paprika,"Great, she wanted to be James Gunn with Birds of Prey, now she wants to be Christopher Nolan with this."
Paprika,Will this work as a live action show? (I dont know nothing about the novel)
Paprika,"I will see it, but there is no chance this has the same magic as the Satoshi Kon adaptation.

His style is so unique that I fear this is not gonna come close.

I'll still give it a chance though. I had fun with Cowboy Bebop even when everyone hated it."
Paprika,Such a great anime too!
Paprika,It's Deadline
Paprika,Is this sarcasm? Netflix has been doing live-action anime adaptations for years.
Paprika,"With that logic, Christopher Nolan wanted to be Satoshi Kon"
Paprika,">  she wanted to be James Gunn with Birds of Prey

Whoa, filmmakers influence other filmmakers, that's crazy dude."
Paprika,Yeh and they have been also making deals to stream anime exclusively. I am talking about Amazon giving up on anime and only focusing on live-action anime adaptations.
Paprika,Your comment doesn‚Äôt make any sense.
Paprika,"‚ÄúLook into the eyes of a chicken and you will see real stupidity. It is a kind of bottomless stupidity, a fiendish stupidity. They are the most horrifying, cannibalistic and nightmarish creatures in the world.‚Äù
-Werner Herzog"
Paprika,I would watch these commercials.  In fact I would aggressively seek them out on Youtube.
Paprika,"""I would like to see the chicken."""
Paprika,And an unproduced 12th episode on MSG.
Paprika,"In this commercial the Colonel, wearing a simple white jumpsuit, throws uncooked chicken carcasses violently at the camera while asking, in a harsh voice, ""Does this enrich your inner child?!"""
Paprika,"[Herzog, on chickens.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhMo4WlBmGM&ab_channel=SavilleProductions)"
Paprika,Someone give this man gold. I would but I‚Äôm broke g üò¢
Paprika,"‚ÄúAnd what haunts me, is that in all the faces of all the chickens that the Colonel ever butchered, I discover no kinship, no understanding, no mercy. I see only the overwhelming indifference of nature. To me, there is no such thing as a secret world of Chicken. And this blank stare speaks only of a half-bored interest in food. But for Colonel Sanders, the chicken was a friend, a savior‚Ä¶

Purchase a spinning bucket family feast today. With the illusion of choice of sides. ‚Äú -WH"
Paprika,"""The  enormity of their stupidity is overwhelming."""
Paprika,"Thank you for your optimism. It is shinier than any digital gold trinkets. I‚Äôve been trying to make this happen ever since Betty White got on SNL. Sadly, all my posts were downvoted to Hell. This one has been the most positive so far. I will keep trying."
Undercover Law,Well alright then.Cant say I saw that one coming.But hey this is that good shit that 2020 often doesnt let us have I suppose.
Undercover Law,"Alright, I remember reading a piece they did about this a while back. It was simultaneously fascinating, disgusting and inspiring.

I wonder if their let her play the lead."
Undercover Law,That awkward moment during a sting when someone recognizes you from Vegas Vacation.
Undercover Law,still not the craziest storyline Riverdale tried
Undercover Law,"This sounds cool and hey, it's not a spinoff, reboot, remake, etc. so that's already a huge plus."
Undercover Law,Coming from a scientologist member this is rich. Maybe she should begin with the scientology church first
Undercover Law,I would rather the tactics they use to fight sex trafficking NOT be turned into a popular tv show for all to see. Seems like something that should be kept tight lipped.
Undercover Law,She‚Äôs a Scientologist
Undercover Law,"Well this is perfect for TV, there's a reason why SVU is the longest running Law & Order."
Undercover Law,"There are videos for these sting operations on youtube. I've never seen one with Marisol Nichols but I have seen them with Laurie Holden, the actress who played Andrea on *The Walking Dead*, and her job was to keep all the kids safe when the traffickers started getting arrested. There is a movie coming out based on Operation Underground Railroad."
Undercover Law,Bad luck she is a scientologist but i still like her.
Undercover Law,Snitches get stitches
Undercover Law,Some dude dipped from a sting and isn't going to get charged because he really liked season 6 of 24.
Undercover Law,She's got the legs of a thoroughbred.
Undercover Law,What an absurd comment
Undercover Law,So less people can be aware of them? Sounds like something a sex trafficker would say
Undercover Law,"Could be a big green alien for all it matters, anyone who hunts and stops sex traffickers and paedophiles is good in my book."
Undercover Law,Means she is under cover as an actor.
Undercover Law,"And she can be, but I'm surprised a federal organization would work with her.  If I ran one like the FBI or the CIA, I'd assume, lawsuits or blackmail would follow, and not get involved in the first place.  CoS should be on the government's shitlist."
Undercover Law,"Fuck off, child"
Undercover Law,Eh... I doubt that defense will hold up in court. No one liked season 6 of 24.
Undercover Law,What an dumbass comment
Undercover Law,how is it in any way absurd? you won't answer but it'd be nice to get one.
Undercover Law,I'm slightly worried about the methods used to catch sex traffickers becoming public knowledge. I can't imagine you want traffickers too aware.
Undercover Law,That's a pretty dangerous precedent.  All a villain has to do is convince you whoever they are hunting is a sex trafficker.  I'm sure that'll never come up though.  Nobody ever falsely accuses their enemies of egregious crimes.
Undercover Law,Ok Karen
Undercover Law,Really not sure what to respond to that. We are talking about the FBI and different projects setting up stings to catch sex traffickers and paedophiles with the intent to harm and your point is that there have been false accusation cases in the past? Well no shit Sherlock. Not entirely sure what relevance it has to this in particular though.
Undercover Law,"""And if my grandmother had wheels she'd be a bike."" Gotta say, this is such a strange comment, it's true, but in a way that's obvious more than revolutionary. All  *anybody* has to do for you to believe they're doing the right thing is to convince you, that's literally what the concept of convincing someone means. Yes, people can always lie, but I'm not really sure what you think you're pointing out?"
Undercover Law,What a dangerous precedent is automatically assuming a group of people associated by the same religion to be guilty.
Undercover Law,scientologist vs rapist is like Biden vs Trump except they're both rapists
Undercover Law,"Scientology isn't a religion, it's a dangerous cult."
Undercover Law,"I'm an atheist. To me, there's no difference between Scientology and Christianism or Islam."
Undercover Law,"Then you have a poor understanding of all three. I'm agnostic, that doesn't mean I can't intellectually grasp that scientology is not an actual religion. That has nothing to do with *being* religious, it's about facts."
Undercover Law,"2000 years from now on, Scientology will be established as a regular religion just as Christian/Islam/Judism. 

For any religion to be ""established"", all you need is time.

Ron Hubbard will be treated as their ""Christ"" with Tom Cruise being Saint Paul."
Undercover Law,"No, it will be remembered as a cult like Jonestown or FLDS. Its operation and practices are nothing like Judaism, Christianity, or Islam at their inceptions and if you think that L. Ron Hubbard is figuratively identical to Jesus, that further underlines your misapprehensions about both religion and Scientology. Even Scientologists do not see him as a deity or Messiah."
Undercover Law,">McGoldrick was coy about what that show might be, but we hear two possibilities that are on the table are *Law & Order: Hate Crimes* and *New York Undercover,* along with original concepts.  
>  
>*Hate Crimes* was originally given a 13-episode order in September 2018 but NBC paused on the spin-off in early 2019. At the time, the network said that it wanted to get the spin-off right. *Law & Order: SVU* showrunner Warren Leight recently said that the show would be a ‚Äúbetter fit‚Äù for the streaming service as the language that people use when they commit hate crimes is not acceptable for network television. ‚ÄúIt is something we‚Äôve talked about,‚Äù admitted McGoldrick.  
>  
>The other project that could resurface in the streaming world is a reboot of *New York Undercover.* Last May, ABC passed on a pilot, which was based on Wolf‚Äôs 1990s cop drama. Universal TV at the time shopped the pilot, hailing from Wolf (left), *Hand of God*¬†creator Ben Watkins and director Anthony Hemingway, which was headlined by original New York Undercover star Malik Yoba, reprising his tole as J.C. Williams, joined by fellow original cast member Luna Lauren Velez, who reprised her role as Nina Moreno. While it did not find a home, reviving the title has remained a priority for Wolf."
Undercover Law,Do you really need him to make a simple police procedural. Just make it good instead of paying to put law and order on it.
Undercover Law,America needs to step away from the police idolatry.
Undercover Law,"So, I guess their goal today was to take everyone who said D+ had no original content besides The Mandalorian, and pretty much punch them in the face repeatedly."
Undercover Law,Hooch is crazy

Undercover Law,I thought this was wallstreebets DD for a second lol
Undercover Law,"Nothing on any of the ""old"" Netflix series has me sad...  Nice write up, though."
Undercover Law,/u/arashtp you missed Percy Jackson.
Undercover Law,Super stoked on most of this. I‚Äôm especially looking forward to the Nat geo content. Can you imagine if Disney+ dropped with half of these titles? Game changer
Undercover Law,"Based on the release timelines of those shows, it looks like their strategy is: 

Zeitgeist show for 6 weeks -> 1 week of cool down ‚Äî> couple weeks of hype up -> next Zeitgeist show -> Repeat"
Undercover Law,They're really going all out with the High Republic.
Undercover Law,did She Hulk get a trailer or anything?
Undercover Law,that's a lot of content
Undercover Law,"So strange to realize Ice Age is owned by Disney now. 

Also I‚Äôm sort of unexpectedly excited about the continuation of Mighty Ducks!"
Undercover Law,A Turner and Hooch reboot yyyeeeeessss!!! I've been a fan (we call ourselves Hoochers) for years and am flipping out right now!!!!
Undercover Law,Missing rogue squadron on Star Wars
Undercover Law,Hocus Pocus 2. What.
Undercover Law,"A lot of this is awesome, but can I just take a moment to appreciate *Sister Act 3*?"
Undercover Law,">Tiana is the first princess to have her own Walt Disney Animation Studios series

Just going to ignore the Little Mermaid and Tangled series apparently."
Undercover Law,[deleted]
Undercover Law,I have only read a hand full of moon knight comics but from what I have heard and read making a PG moon knight show is not going to go over well with fans.
Undercover Law,Any specific dates to go with this?
Undercover Law,You forgot the multiple tongue in cheek references to Matt Murdock.  Charlie Cox's Daredevil is officially part of the MCU now.  Hes apparently in She Hulk and Spider-Man 3.
Undercover Law,"Damn, the Ducks end up becoming what they rebelled against..."
Undercover Law,"As a bi dude I'm still waiting for literally anything big that features a non-straight dude. In film they ignored it almost completely out of fear of gay-hating countries banning it and them losing money (like China). 

Really hoping for something to come through, maybe with x-men back in the fold Iceman could get something"
Undercover Law,So is Ahsoka taking the place of the Rebels spinoff? Because thats what I was most excited for
Undercover Law,Disney is milking Star Wars and Marvel for everything dollar they can squeeze. There are way too many reboots and remakes. They need originally sourced content that has no reliance on existing IP. How about some original NON-Marvel/Star Wars scripted content? I think the Mandalorian is a cute show but I want to see ORIGINAL content for once. This slate of shows are not enough to keep all of their subscribers satisfied.
Undercover Law,I just want to have the spin off Thrawn and Ezra travels in space show.
Undercover Law,"Hey, bozo, why didn't you mention It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia?

Great list, otherwise."
Undercover Law,so much content that post alone made me vomit .
Undercover Law,Seems like Star Wars's future is on TV.
Undercover Law,Is it weird that I'm most excited for the Josh Peck version of Turner and Hooch?
Undercover Law,"Looks like they're updating Microcosmos with A Real Bug's Life, that should be cool as fuck."
Undercover Law,">The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers

>Lauren Graham (Gilmore Girls, Parenthood) and Emilio Estevez (reprising his role from the original feature films) star in the next chapter of the hit Mighty Ducks franchise, premiering in early 2021. In present day Minnesota, the Mighty Ducks have evolved from scrappy underdogs to an ultra-competitive, powerhouse youth hockey team. After 12-year-old Evan is unceremoniously cut from the Ducks, he and his mom Alex set out to build their own ragtag team of misfits to challenge the cutthroat, win-at-all-costs culture of competitive youth sports.

I hope Disney has been paying attn to Cobra Kai and takes all the good from it and applies it to the Ducks!!!"
Undercover Law,"Man, Tony Stark cannot keep control of his tech, can he? Well, I guess he's dead, so that makes sense."
Undercover Law,The one thing I want from Marvel is an OG Nick Fury and the Howling Commandos show.
Undercover Law,They forgot Shadow Hunters.
Undercover Law,Disney+ launch was more like beta test to ensure their decision of allocating such resources to the platform
Undercover Law,"The criticism was regarding lack of original screenplays, too. It's still true in that aspect."
Undercover Law,"It's still lacks diversity, it's still marvel, star wars and Pixar animated pg-13 movies, still no new new IPs."
Undercover Law,[deleted]
Undercover Law,"If they don't have Phill Lewis playing the dog using mocap, they dun goofed."

Undercover Law,Thanks man you're awesome
Undercover Law,[Rogue squadron](https://youtu.be/5bLkTjn6Y_s)
Undercover Law,Not enough üöÄüöÄüöÄ
Undercover Law,"Just hints at Daredevil, from Sony in Spider-Man 3 and at the reveal here today for She-Hulk."
Undercover Law,"Yeah sounds like the Multiverse in SM3 will pull in Daredevil and Kingpin. Which could be great.

Daredevil was hinted at strongly for SheHulk, and there have been rumors that DNofrio has campaigned hard and they‚Äôve taken him seriously as maybe using his character to put together the Sinister Six."
Undercover Law,"There's a big hint in Hawkeye. Maya Lopez is a definitively Daredevil character (Echo, a deaf woman who can see something once and imitate it originally hired by Kingpin to take out Daredevil and eventually befriending him). She also wore the Ronin outfit for awhile that Hawkeye wore in Endgame after his family vanished (New Avengers comics).

Edit: why am I being downvoted for this?"
Undercover Law,And Swiss Family Robinson.
Undercover Law,It‚Äôs pretty genius
Undercover Law,Super into the Acolyte as I‚Äôd really like to see what the Sith/dark side users were up to during this time period
Undercover Law,"No, but they confirmed Tatiana Maslany."
Undercover Law,Tim Roth will be back as Abomination and Mark Ruffalo.
Undercover Law,Its a rather deceptive line if your not in the know.  WDAS is the movie studio. Disney Television Animation is the studio that typically handles the TV side (they were the ones that made the Tangled series).
Undercover Law,That's not necessarily a bad thing tbh. It's how they execute it that matters. GOTG was kinda considered a bottom of the barrel IP for marvel before they made it and it turned out well.
Undercover Law,"There‚Äôs like 70 announced shows here and less than 10 are actual original ideas. Really disappointing *in my opinion*.

I get people like Star Wars and stuff, but it seems extreme to me."
Undercover Law,"I think it could be done. For me at least the fun part is the mind-bendy unreliable narrator stuff and not the graphic violence. Although there is something to be said for when other characters meet Moon Knight and are like, ""oh this guy is *crazy* crazy and not just *Batman* crazy."""
Undercover Law,"This didn‚Äôt mention any of the Marvel movies since it‚Äôs still not certain whether they‚Äôll be released in theaters first or on Disney+ at the same time, but The Eternals is set to have their first openly gay main character whenever that‚Äôs released.

If you haven‚Äôt watched the Disney+ short film Out, you absolutely should."
Undercover Law,"Young Avengers is just over the horizon, and that comes with the most prominent gay couple in marvel. Still a few years out though."
Undercover Law,Not sure if it is 100% confirmed but I remember seeing somewhere that Valkyrie is looking for a wife in the next Thor movie.
Undercover Law,"As a fellow homo, I'm sorry you're getting downvoted, but that's r/television for you. I've learned not to bring up representation issues on this sub anymore."
Undercover Law,"I would bet it will be in a team, or they will reveal the character is gay in a sequel...that way people in China will already be invested.  Because you‚Äôre right....they want that China money badly. 


Wouldn‚Äôt it be a kick in the nuts to China if the wait until like Shang Chi 3 and reveal he was gay the whole time! Lmao. That could literally start a war!!"
Undercover Law,"I feel like this'll be a big part of the Ashoka show, considering that she was still searching when we see her in The Mandolorian."
Cathedral of the Sea,i don't care for how netflix simply stamps original on anything it licenses. i was watching better call saul recently and even it said 'a netflix original'
Cathedral of the Sea,What was hidden in the wall at the end? A document for something 
Cathedral of the Sea,"NooOooooOoo just eight episodes? I have 10 minutes left then. Have been watching an episode or two a day, it really is a great, intriguing, sad story. A few things that bug me but overall one of the best things I've seen lately (I don't watch that much, I'm interested in medieval&fantady series and movies exclusively). 

Got the feels both bad and good quite a few times. I had to stop ten minutes before the end of the episode because SO wanted to watch TV, and it did feel quite final but I hoped there were at least 10 episodes.

Come to think of it I began reading the book once but I never finished it."
Cathedral of the Sea,It's not a true cathedral unless the youngest fishes are being innappropriately touched by an evil shark.
Cathedral of the Sea,[deleted]
Cathedral of the Sea,Unoroginal
Cathedral of the Sea,"I find it hysterical how people are clutching their pearls about the quality of this adaptation. I haven‚Äôt seen it yet but I did read the book and the source material is the definition of mediocre wine mom schlock. Chill the fuck out you fucking weirdos, there‚Äôs no sacred ground to trample here."
Cathedral of the Sea,"5 f*cking days. That's how long it's been out. Chill. Wtf. Literally just heard about it 3 days ago. People have lives, we can't binge everything the moment it comes out. Entire series' can not be consumed and discussed ad naseum in one news cycle or you end up Kaleidoscope. Yeah remember that one? The one everybody watched but no one has mentioned in over a month?"
Cathedral of the Sea,"I see this show has been getting lukewarm reviews, but I absolutely love it."
Cathedral of the Sea,"The critic ends with this: ""Sure people will watch, but we‚Äôre not getting the adaptation we deserve.""  

Who deserves what? It's like reddit wanting things to be the way they expect. Overcome.  Don't watch. Nobody cares. As has been said, people will watch. End. The rest is nonsense from people who value their own opinion too much. That's why everyone is seeing Yellowstone around."
Cathedral of the Sea,"I *really* like this show. I loved the book.

Here's what I like about the show: adjusted for the 1970s era, it feels like a really accurate portrayal of a group of musicians and an good snapshot of that time. I doesn't feel like a fictional story. Daisy Jones reminds me a great deal of a current musician I know. Billy Dunne reminds me of a few people: now hitting middle age and reflecting on their musical careers. The casting and acting is good. It feels like a genuine human story to me, especially as I know the twist that is coming. I love Last Of Us, but I don't need every series I watch to be an epic."
Cathedral of the Sea,"We've seen pretty much this same story play out the same way in so many movies, TV shows, etc. I didn't read the book, but none of the plot turns in the three episodes I've seen so far were in any way surprising or unexpected."
Cathedral of the Sea,"It's not brilliant, but I find it pretty entertaining so far."
Cathedral of the Sea,did reddit write the review?
Cathedral of the Sea,It‚Äôs like apologists on Reddit wanting to hear nothing but praise for things they like. Overcome. Don‚Äôt read the comments. Nobody cares.
Cathedral of the Sea,A pretty substantial part of this subreddit whines whenever people critique shows.
Cathedral of the Sea,"Genius politicking from everyone involved.  Viserys starting to look more kingly than previous episodes, Rhaenyra pulled off her first major power play by getting Otto fired.  YEEEEEEEAH"
Cathedral of the Sea,"Emily Carey is also doing a great job of playing the dutiful daughter (now queen) Alicent. 

I can't fault any of the performances, such great casting."
Cathedral of the Sea,"Viserys might not be considered a good King by some, but honestly his family does not make it easy for him."
Cathedral of the Sea,"That kid was not putting up with one more second of that guy's bullshit.

Way to assert yourself, medieval nerd prince."
Cathedral of the Sea,The fucking scenes with Alicent laying cold and Uncle/Niece incest being both together made for an‚Ä¶ interesting watch.
Cathedral of the Sea,The Blackwood/Bracken rivalry has been brought to screen. I can't believe my eyes it actually happened. It was extremely funny as well. God this show is good
Cathedral of the Sea,"Oh Criston Cole, you can‚Äôt be getting caught up with these bored, powerful women"
Cathedral of the Sea,"I have really enjoyed all 4 episodes. We have learned so much about these brand new characters in a short amount of time. The actor playing Viserys is killing it.  He is so believable as a mediocre king‚Äîhe isn‚Äôt totally weak and a coward, but he isn‚Äôt totally strong and confident either, just as most people are not one or the other. He is just doing such a great job being‚Ä¶an average guy in extremely non-average circumstances."
Cathedral of the Sea,"Paddy Considine is such a revelation for me. I was initially let down that we did not a get a fat Viserys (thats how i thought he would look, based on the books description of him), but fuck me if Paddy isnt killing this. id argue hes elevating the character above what he was in f&B"
Cathedral of the Sea,Holy tiny subtitles Dr Dragon.
Cathedral of the Sea,[deleted]
Cathedral of the Sea,"My god its keeps getting good.

I was on the edge the whole episode, so much tension.

Ahhhh and the cast is amazing. Every single one of them. Emiley Carey shone in this episode 

The previews for the next one looks great"
Cathedral of the Sea,Milly Alcock is such a delight. I hope she gets more roles after this.
Cathedral of the Sea,"Loved the performance by Emily Carey on this
episode. She was really good. Allicent without her
father's influence could become a good queen."
Cathedral of the Sea,"I‚Äôm continually amazed by how well they‚Äôve managed to adapt a history book into a full fledged narrative so far.

Another strong episode, hoping they can keep carrying the quality forward."
Cathedral of the Sea,"I gotta say, I did not see Otto screwing himself in that way.  Truly a beautiful thing."
Cathedral of the Sea,I'm also glad that they aren't whitewashing Rhaenyra. I felt pretty uncomfortable for Criston this episode. It bodes well for the future of the series
Cathedral of the Sea,"ooh abortion tea

solid episode."
Cathedral of the Sea,"It was my favorite episode so far. It's just so Thrones, I love it.

The parallelism between Rhaenyra and Alicent was so well done. They are truly making me care about Alicent and feel for her when I couldn't even care for her in the book.

Preview for next week's episode looks insane."
Cathedral of the Sea,Best episode yet imo. The writing was on point. It was refreshing to see how the king was fully aware of how Otto was playing him. Also Daemon stopping himself at the last moment was great. And you could feel pain inside Ser Criston when he just couldn‚Äôt resist. Very very well done
Cathedral of the Sea,"No action, very little fancy CGI, all story. It was great!"
Cathedral of the Sea,"That was an exciting episode, it went by so fast ! Matt Smith kills it in every scene, and I love his chemistry with Milly Alcock, who was also fantastic. It keeps getting better, really enjoying this series so far."
Cathedral of the Sea,"Insane as he seems, Daemon is so correct about the politics/statecraft.  Targaryens are fucking dragons.  They don't have to act like everyone else or worry about their common morality.  

By trying to blend in with the common houses, they diminish the majesty and *existential terror* that their name should invoke, and more than anything, >!it's this attitude that's going to lead to the fall of their house!<."
Cathedral of the Sea,Really liking the show.  Characters that defy easy categorization but the writing has really made their various facets believable and compelling.
Cathedral of the Sea,"Holy shit that was basically the same scene from Caligula when he sneaks out of the palace.

‚ô™ The la-dy Dru-sill-a ‚ô™"
Cathedral of the Sea,"Great episode! Heavily character focused.
I honestly enjoy every single character so far."
Cathedral of the Sea,Another banger of an episode. Love this show.
Cathedral of the Sea,"This was probably the best episode so far. The cast is incredible, especially Paddy Considine and Milly Alcock in this episode. It'll be sad to see Milly go (though maybe they will do flashbacks?) but I'm sure Emma D'Arcy will be great too."
Cathedral of the Sea,My favorite part of GoT was always family members being bitches to each other and I love that they just turned that into a whole show.
Cathedral of the Sea,I enjoyed this episode a lot. All I really need is some good political intrigue and court drama.
Cathedral of the Sea,Why are all the suitors talking about Rhaneyra living with them? Has it not been publicly announced that she's still the heir?
Cathedral of the Sea,"The sex scenes felt way different from GOT‚Äôs, more intimate and romantic. Goes to show the touch of a female director and a good intimacy coordinator I think."
Cathedral of the Sea,"No on going to talk about the uneven power dynamic between Criston and Rhaenyra? Does he feel like he can say no to person who gave him his position? He‚Äôs clearly uncomfortable before, during, and after they have sex. He doesn‚Äôt even smile back at her when he comes to tell her the queen‚Äôs message. The next episode‚Äôs preview showed him absolutely wigging out about something."
Cathedral of the Sea,"Best episode so far! Everyone is at their best but Paddy Considine is absolutely killing! He brings so much gravitas to a character that I would never guess when I first saw him. Also writing, and dialogue is consistently superb. I am not much of a hater of latter seasons of GoT as the rest of Reddit, but one thing that really irked me was that once they run out of GGRM's material it was very evident they don't know how to write a formal dialogue between two noblemen, this show brings it back in an amazing fashion."
Cathedral of the Sea,"Probably my favourite episode to date. The characters all really shine here. Rhaenyra is obviously really fun to follow and has some interesting character stuff this episode, but Alicent really had my attention during this episode in particular. Wonderful acting all around and I love the tone of this show. My husband and I spent a couple hours after the episode discussing it at length, which brings me back to GoT days."
Cathedral of the Sea,"I'm glad they got a female director for the extremely horny episode. Really great episode again, though Mysaria's accent is still annoying to listen to."
Cathedral of the Sea,Terrence and Philip show up this episode
Cathedral of the Sea,"That was was the first episode which totally won me over, just superb acting and storytelling, now I'm hooked."
Cathedral of the Sea,"This really is what George R.R. Martin is a master of.  Letting you see the shit stew forming and just wondering where the hell things are going to land.

&#x200B;

Enjoying both LOTR and this so far, but I agree the most recent episode has put this series ahead."
Cathedral of the Sea,This episode was my favorite so far.  I was a little worried after episode 3 but this brought me right back.
Cathedral of the Sea,"Man, Daemon is such a kid, trolling and throwing tantrums just to get big bro's attention.

And we all love him for it.

The relationship between him and Viserys is one of the high points of the show... among so many others. Both actors truly manage to sell it perfectly.

Oh and I'm now definitely making it my head-canon : Rhaenyra had a massive crush on Alicent. It gives so much more depth to their relationship."
Cathedral of the Sea,"There's so many people around the internet who watch this magnficent shows and they complain that its not good enough bringing the fact that ""the crabfeeder didn't get enough screen time"" as their main gripe. I really don't understand it. Seriously, who gives a shit about the crabfeeder?"
Cathedral of the Sea,SWEET HOME ALABAMA
Cathedral of the Sea,[deleted]
Cathedral of the Sea,"After Paddy last week, it was Milly's turn back to shine oh so brightly this episode.

She is gonna rule all over Hollywood in no time.

A special mention to Rhys Ifans too. Much more low-key but his performance is absolutely on point as well.

The episode also started to give Alicent more agency and depth but so far, if I were to have one major criticism of the show, it would be her treatment. They could have fleshed her up a bit more in previous episodes. I'm still waiting for a defining scene for her."
Cathedral of the Sea,"The acting is superb. All around. Bloody hell HBO does cast well. Also helps that writing and dialogue has been on par too. It‚Äôs like day and night between this and RoP. While I enjoy that too and it‚Äôs lighthearted nature, the acting and dialogue has not yet engrossed me, as HOTD has done so in every episode thus far."
Cathedral of the Sea,Were there always so many paintings on the wall of the castle depicting people f*cking or am I just now primed to notice them?
Cathedral of the Sea,"I can‚Äôt believe people are still whining about the crab king. The same people will be saying ‚Äúthe pacing is off, we need more sub-plots‚Äù. Bruh‚Ä¶ the crab king WAS a sub-plot."
Cathedral of the Sea,"Otto's firing seemed a bit rash, I mean we can see from our perspective that he was right about Otto's judgement being clouded, but I feel like not enough stuff happened in the show to reflect him losing faith in Otto.

Still a great episode though, the scene of Viserys having sex while Alisent just stared at the ceiling had me dying. Poor girl looks abs miserable."
Cathedral of the Sea,This was my favorite episode. King V finally stood up for himself politically.
Cathedral of the Sea,"i mean, i fully expected rhaenyra and dameon to fuck, same with her and criston. it was obvious from the get go there was sexual chemistry. i just didn't expect dameon to end up rejecting her and then she ends up fucking criston afterwards. i thought it'd be rhae and dameon get married and then she keeps cheating on him with criston"
Cathedral of the Sea,"My favorite episode so far. Just full of tension the whole way through 

The acting is so strong by every single one of them. In particular, The actors for Alicent and the King really shone in this one.

Was that medieval Plan B? üòÖ"
Cathedral of the Sea,HotD was especially hot this week.
Cathedral of the Sea,The increasingly poorer decisions of Rhaenyra Targaryen
Cathedral of the Sea,I know people say its pointless to compare this to rings of power but it is just simply so much better. idk if it is because of age rating or established world but im way more interested in the world of house of dragon than lotr
Cathedral of the Sea,"‚ÄòThe princess has a dragon you dumb cunt‚Äô fuck I love this show.

As a Tolkien fanboy, I cannot help but be annoyed by the fact that HBO did not buy the rights to LOTR and make ROP. 

This show is 100x better and its not even close. Pains me to say it."
Cathedral of the Sea,"Something else I liked about this episode was the contrast between the commoners and the members of the court.  While the former were drinking and partying at night without any concerns, the latter were riddled with disease, or emotionally tormented, or scheming away.   You can understand why Daemon tries to get away."
Cathedral of the Sea,"Idk why a lot of people is saying this was the best episode so far. For me it was the worst one, boring and predictable. To be a 1h episode seemed like nothing happened.

Yes the acting was amazing. I like the characters too and since I liked rhaenyra from ep 1, now it kinda made me think is shes going to be as good as I thought.
The king firing the hand seemed rush, we dont even so the character yet to support that decision.

rhaenyra seemed smart, so how does she goes full retard to do that im a place full of people? 

Anyway, average episode. Some nice things happened, but overall it was kinda boring and predictable."
Cathedral of the Sea,Best episode of the series so far imo
Cathedral of the Sea,I wonder if Daemon is based on Richard III or England. Both were the brother of the king and both banged (allegedly)the kings daughter in order to secure power and inch closer to the throne. All Daemon has to do is lock his brothers other kids in a tower.
Cathedral of the Sea,There was like a 20 minute intermission that was nothing but sex scenes. Personally I don‚Äôt mind sex scenes but when those scenes start to take up so much of the episode‚Äôs run time it honestly starts to feel like they couldn‚Äôt be bothered to write a full episode of dialogue. But otherwise I liked it.
Cathedral of the Sea,I feel like a prude but the actress that plays the princess looks so young.  I know she‚Äôs 22 but earlier they were passing her for 14 .  Just the sex scenes with her seemed so wrong.  I guess the queen is actually younger but it doesn‚Äôt seem as bad for some reason
Cathedral of the Sea,"It's not a bad show, but damn the tone is so different from GOT. It feels more like a Shakespearan drama or prestige soap opera than the GOT tone we've grown accustomed to."
Cathedral of the Sea,"Loved the writing in this episode. Not to be the guy who compares HoD to RoP all the time, but it's such a big difference between the two shows in terms of how much I care about these characters and what happens next"
Cathedral of the Sea,"Probably the only episode I haven't really enjoyed so far. I get what they were trying to go for, but the whole sneaking out sequence paired with Alicent's personal hell felt like it dragged on longer than it needed. On the plus side I do like every moment we spend watching Viserys just buckling under the weight of his responsibilities as king. And it was refreshing to see him finally call Otto out on his scheming, even if it seems innevitable that Otto will now begin plotting more brazenly to undermine Rhaenyra."
Cathedral of the Sea,So much Lust! I loved it.
Cathedral of the Sea,"Westworld ruined me because I kept expecting the music at the end of the episode to segue into a rendition of Nirvana's ""Pennyroyal Tea""."
Cathedral of the Sea,This is the first episode that really dragged for me
Cathedral of the Sea,"Is it just me, or ‚Äúnarrow sea‚Äù that Damien is supposedly king of is def euphemism for vagina lol"
Cathedral of the Sea,There are a lot of people in this thread who are mad at anyone who doesn‚Äôt agree with them about everything. GOT is such a toxic fanbase.
Cathedral of the Sea,"I'm really starting to miss the OG GOT. the lack of humor / ""real"" feeling people and the multiple story lines. 
These characters are just...thin."
Cathedral of the Sea,[deleted]
Cathedral of the Sea,It has exceeded GOT.
Cathedral of the Sea,"How would you rate episode 4?

fappable/10"
Cathedral of the Sea,"I legit dont understand how you guys watched episode 4, I had to skip through alot of the end cause it was making me legit upset in the stomach. Anyone who enjoyed that was a sicko. I enjoyed GoT, but man that actress looks too young. Just some horny ass directors.."
Cathedral of the Sea,"Good episode but probably the weakest of the series so far. Viserys is an interesting king, but we are teased each week that he is doomed to die soon. This makes me sad because he would be a fun character to see throughout multiple seasons.


The show is giving the strong handed message about how woman are treating unfairly in this world. While its something I agree with its in almost every episode and as Rhaenera slowly becomes a villian with daemon I wonder how the public will handle all that"
Cathedral of the Sea,Bored.
Cathedral of the Sea,What‚Äôs up with the random fights to the death by nobleman over stupid shit.  I thought the tourney was egregious and that 12 year old gutting some heckler just seemed weird.  Did game of thrones have this much casual killings?
Cathedral of the Sea,"Best episode so far character up to mark in 
 house of the Dragon 
( I have to mention something here 
this hbo max not give my native subtitles i think so they hate our country embarassed to give a subtitles Cancelled my subscription )"
Cathedral of the Sea,[deleted]
Cathedral of the Sea,"First half of the episode belongs in my softcore porn folder. Enjoyed it though, kept my attention (mostly) for the full hour. Second half of the episode was solid."
Cathedral of the Sea,Needs more sex scenes.
Cathedral of the Sea,"Good episode but as a whole not outstanding. The show is still not as good as the first seasons of GoT. Those sex scene were terribly shot and went on for way to long especially since they didnt show anything, might as well skip the screentime and move forward. 

Characters are also questionable in their reaction and behavior sometimes. People give this show way more slack then they do with RoP. Probably because ""amazon evil"" and RoP too ""woke""."
Cathedral of the Sea,"I wrote earlier that I felt GoT was turned from a mature fantasy to YA with tits and blood. This episode further confirms my theory. So much of the plot so far has revolved around a daughter in the ""you can't control me / I will find true love"" trope. I didn't expect it to be as good as early GoT but they're clearly going for low hanging fruit rather than having complex interplay between characters/houses.

Edit: lol got reported haha will you edgy kids calm down"
