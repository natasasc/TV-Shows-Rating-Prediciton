Pinky Malinky,Wait this is actually still a thing? Last I heard it was ordered to series by Nickelodeon in 2015 for a late 2016 premiere. Also why does one of his friends look like a copy and paste of the dad from Gumball? 
Pinky Malinky,"I've gotta get something together to pitch to Netflix, they wont stop until they achieve an endless scroll for your watch list "
Pinky Malinky,"You're looking at this from an adult perspective. The channel is not for you, its not HBO, its for kids.

Kids don't care if content is new or old, revamp, revivial, or whatever. They can and do watch the same show over and over and over and love it every time. They just care that they like it and its fun. It could be spongebob or whatever revival #45 and the new 8 or 10 year old watching is gonna love it just as much as the 10 year old did 20 years before"
Pinky Malinky,They’re gonna be gone in 10-20 years regardless if they don’t pivot to digital content.
Pinky Malinky,"Nickelodeon also shot themselves in the foot with their treatments of Harvey Beaks and Korra. 


Why would anybody take the risk of pitching their show to nickelodeon if it's never gonna air and get cancelled after two seasons due to not achieving the same ratings as Spongebob?"
Pinky Malinky,"You're probably correct, but I also don't know why you're *worried*.  So a giant corporation dies because it couldn't keep up with the times.  Someone else will make the shows we DO want to watch.  There are 97 streaming services now, the fact that I REALLY liked this one cable channel when I was a child doesn't mean I care if it dies today."
Pinky Malinky,"i still am bummed that they cancelled VICTORIOUS.  it was such a fun, funny show with a great cast (Victoria Justice, Elizabeth Gillies, Ariana Grande, etc.) and some great musical numbers.  

there is currently nothing on Nickelodeon that looks even remotely good to watch."
Pinky Malinky,"i'm glad they're going back to cartoons 

this past era of teen shows were terrible, its time they went back to being a cartoon only network"
Pinky Malinky,They protected Dan Schneider for so long that whole company deserves to fail.
Pinky Malinky,"the problems for nick, along with everything else, is disney."
Pinky Malinky,"You know that a good opinion,If nickelodeon doesn't pitch  high production original shows and focus more on spongebob then they should focus on spongebob only and just rename the channel the 'Spongebob Channel'.

Sorry for my rant but in realistic point of view ,if nickelodeon keeps on doing this process then this will be the downfall for this channel unless the newly merged  CBS-viacom will improve it perhaps not only have the channel  air  the kid targeted star trek cartoon but also let nick air high budget original programming,

I wonder if the its a wonderful sponge movie will bomb at the box office."
Pinky Malinky,"I understand,Even though msot older people didn't like those type of sitcoms"
Pinky Malinky,">  it was such a fun, funny show 

really? it was painfully bad"
Pinky Malinky,Actually nickelodeon aired only live action shows back then and packaged cartoons
Pinky Malinky,Dan Schneider is literally a meme. Hes not a rapist
COMEDIANS of the world,"SVU's most recent episode had Ice T referencing ""his old partner"" a few times. Said he went back to Baltimore after he retired. Great character."
COMEDIANS of the world,"Doesn't he hold the record for the same character being in the most shows? NYPD blue, law and order x 3, and wasn't there a Simpsons with him too?"
COMEDIANS of the world,RIP tremendous actor. Always made whatever he was in better.
COMEDIANS of the world,"Is there any actor as famous for portraying the same character in so much *unrelated* media?

Richard Belzer played a Detective John Munch in *Homicide: Life on the Street, 30 Rock, The Wire, The X-Files, Law & Order, Arrested Development, Unbreakable Kimmdy Schmidt* and [so much more.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Munch)

Fun fact he's one of two characters based on Jay Landsman in *The Wire*, the real cop who showrunner David Simon worked closely with. There's John Munch based on Jay Landsman, the character Jay Landsman based on Jay Landsman, but also the real Jay Landsman is in The Wire as a cop named Dennis Mello lol."
COMEDIANS of the world,I've been watching old SVU a lot recently. Always loved it when Belzer would pop up on screen. Bring Homicide to streaming!!!!!
COMEDIANS of the world,To think Munch was referenced heavily in this past weeks episode of SVU. And with high esteem.  Seems very fitting.
COMEDIANS of the world,"Another reminder that Homicide: Life on the Street is the best show not available on streaming or digital format. Before SVU Munch partnered with Ned Beatty’s character Stanley Bolander. 

Loved Munch’s encounter with the Lone Gunmen in X-Files."
COMEDIANS of the world,"I'm an old timer and I remember when he was choked out by Hulk Hogan, hit the floor and split his head open on his own talk show. He sued Hogan and won."
COMEDIANS of the world,"Godfather of the original MCU - the Munch Cinematic Universe, albeit contained almost exclusively to television."
COMEDIANS of the world,"Aw man, I loved the Belz. Underappreciated as a comic due to his success in dramatic roles. Really funny."
COMEDIANS of the world,The comedian in Scarface!
COMEDIANS of the world,Rest in Peace Belzer. The last episode of SVU had Ice T mentioning his character quite a bit.
COMEDIANS of the world,Homicide: Life On The Street still gets no respect.
COMEDIANS of the world,The glue that held the St Elsewhere connected universe together. RIP to a legend
COMEDIANS of the world,Finn and Munch are the GOAT TV cop duo. Better chemistry than Benson/Stabler. RIP to the legend.
COMEDIANS of the world,"Aw, man. Munch was my favorite, not least because of his ability to magically exist in every televisual universe simultaneously. May his memory be a blessing, in every single one of them."
COMEDIANS of the world,"“I've known Chevy Chase for so long, I actually knew him when he was funny!”

Richard Belzer"
COMEDIANS of the world,"Jagger Off!!

https://youtu.be/dKBo-glyYSw"
COMEDIANS of the world,"rest in peace to an absolute legend, munch was my favorite character in law and order"
COMEDIANS of the world,"RIP Munch, absolute legend

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_5NtaqONbU&list=PLAc63Rzp8QKThusgjqJGzguXK0D6vwFpC&index=8"
COMEDIANS of the world,RIP Munch.
COMEDIANS of the world,"Once in awhile, a celebrity death hits hard, and you’re not sure why. 

This is one of those.  

RIP"
COMEDIANS of the world,"In his honor I’m going down to the docks tomorrow to ask every dockworker if they know what happened to Richard Belzer. Anything at all that could help me. 

I’ll leave them a card in case they think of anything."
COMEDIANS of the world,"Oh man, Belzer was one of my favorites.  I read his comedy conspiracy theory book multiple times in high school and legit loved his on screen chemistry working on SVU, not to mention Homicide and his various extra appearances as Detective Munch.  RIP sir."
COMEDIANS of the world,"RIP

I remember seeing him years ago in a bizarre 1970s comedy called “The Groove Tube”. I checked and it was his first movie role. He was also in Ron Howard’s “Night Shift” with Henry Winkler and Michael Keaton."
COMEDIANS of the world,He was the coolest guy in NY in his stand up hayday in the late 70s early 80s
COMEDIANS of the world,Damn. With all the talk about Munch in the last svu episode I was kind of hopeful that he’d have a guest spot. Dude played the hell out of that character.
COMEDIANS of the world,Nice tribute from Baltimore…. https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/opinion/column/richard-belzer-homicide-life-on-the-street-law-order-special-victims-unit-death-VYJG57FHVNF4ZOW7OWMSF56E7I/
COMEDIANS of the world,"He was the crossover personified. As Detective Munch, he tread between continuities on television like it was nothing at all, first showing up on Homicide: Life on the Streets, then Law and Order, then Sesame Street. He was the glue that bound continuities together, and without him to provide that stability, I dread to think of what might happens to the Multiverse."
COMEDIANS of the world,"Never forget when Richard Belzner was choked out by Hulk Hogan on air, passed out and split his head from falling on the ground. Ended up suing Hulk Hogan for $5mil and settled out of court. Used the money to buy an estate in France which he named “Chez Hogan”. Legend."
COMEDIANS of the world,"He never struck me as old because he also had that middle age ""been there, seen that, too cool for everything"" energy. Never thought about him getting up there age. I didn't realize he was in his late seventies. 

Him as Munch was the best. No matter where he showed up, he was always a highlight."
COMEDIANS of the world,I really thought he’d be around for another decade. RIP.
COMEDIANS of the world,Now Munch and Lenny can sit around and crack jokes about each other and their exes uninterrupted. RIP
COMEDIANS of the world,"Fun fact: Because of Richard Belzer’s character John Munch making appearances or mentioned in other shows that would mean that Homicide: Life on the Street, the Law & Order series, the Chicago series, The X Files, Arrested Development, The Wire, Luther, and… Sesame Street would all exist in the same universe."
COMEDIANS of the world,"Munch , no! 
RIP 
Good night Sweet Prince."
COMEDIANS of the world,"Hogan did it, he finally killed him."
COMEDIANS of the world,"Man, that sucks. The Belz will be missed."
COMEDIANS of the world,MUNCH!
COMEDIANS of the world,Richard was always a welcome presence. Thanks for all the entertainment over the years
COMEDIANS of the world,"It was reported that his last words are, and I quote: “Fuck you, motherfucker.” Beautiful."
COMEDIANS of the world,Did Hulk Hogan do it?
COMEDIANS of the world,It's crazy Munch got name checked for the first time in years in this week's episode of SVU. Rest in peace to a legend.
COMEDIANS of the world,Damn not my man’s Munch. Rest in peace
COMEDIANS of the world,"He was always the best scrapbook professor, RIP"
COMEDIANS of the world,"Some of yhe most raw, hysterical standup ever. RIP"
COMEDIANS of the world,PSA: apparently his last words were “fuck you motherfuckers”
COMEDIANS of the world,Rip. Great actor.
COMEDIANS of the world,"I knew him from Homicide. I didn't know he was a comedian. Saw him on 'the green room' and really liked his appearance. 

https://youtu.be/UXqmTgQy1YU"
COMEDIANS of the world,"He shouldn’t have made all those God jokes on Evening at the Improv in the 80s !

EDIT: why the downvotes? That was his signature bit in the 80s; telling a joke about God and then clenching his chest as if God just have him a heart attack in response."
COMEDIANS of the world,"I was recently thinking about him, wondering how his retirement was going and hoping he was enjoying it. R.I.P munch. May your conspiracies live forever"
COMEDIANS of the world,RIP.  I loved watching him over the years.
COMEDIANS of the world,"So this is how the Munchivsrse ends.  Rest well, detective."
COMEDIANS of the world,Fuck!  The Belz?  NO!
COMEDIANS of the world,Noooo. He was so great as Munch.
COMEDIANS of the world,RIP to a legend
COMEDIANS of the world,"Last weeks episode had so many mentions of him after nothing for how long. Seemed like a build up to a guest appearance, so sad."
COMEDIANS of the world,That’s too bad. Loved Munch and Tutuola. SVU wasn’t the same after he left and that duo got broken up.
COMEDIANS of the world,Nooooo! I love Munch!!! I am always talking about how funny he is. RIP
COMEDIANS of the world,Obscure trivia… Belzer was morning radio host in the early 70’s.  He co-hosted on WNBC in NYC with Scottie Brink until Imus came back from Cleveland in ‘77.   https://books.google.com/books?id=aNECAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA33&lpg=PA33&dq=brink+and+belzer&source=bl&ots=ldWkLGmhgt&sig=ACfU3U0hW-CqLKZnJYoRGmGJcThshFjSCw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiko4__h6P9AhXslmoFHZFECDAQ6AF6BAg9EAI#v=onepage&q=brink%20and%20belzer&f=false
COMEDIANS of the world,"Fuck, :/. When I still lived at home my mom and I would watch SVU almost everyday. 78 is definitely getting up there but you never really think they’re gonna pass until they do.

I fear Ian McKellan could go any time now and it wouldn’t be all that early given his age as well.

Condolences to his family, dude is a legend."
COMEDIANS of the world,rest in peace man❤️❤️❤️ youre well loved
COMEDIANS of the world,"That’s all we get usually, 78 is a good life. It’s hard to believe we only get that many years here.

I took me 35 to feel like I’m prepared and in a good place. I can’t believe I only have 41 left."
COMEDIANS of the world,I used to see him on the upper west side walking his dogs back in the day. True and true new yorker.
COMEDIANS of the world,RIP. My favorite character on SVU
COMEDIANS of the world,"RIP Richard Belzer.

I wrote a book a few years ago, a neo-noir story set in a close future NYC. In the last chapter, you have these two detectives piecing the puzzle together about the main character misdeeds, and I actually had Munch/Richard Belzer in mind.

The other one? Clark Johnson, of course. I loved the funny but clever vibe in Homicide. Belzer was great, one of the best deadpan comedians I might say."
COMEDIANS of the world,You’ll be missed. Made everything a little more intriguing
COMEDIANS of the world,"He will be deeply missed, the world has lost another great soul"
COMEDIANS of the world,"Hulk Hogan finally finished the job, eh?"
COMEDIANS of the world,RIP another one of favs gone. Thanks for the laughs.
COMEDIANS of the world,Isn’t he the guy Hulk Hogan choked out and dropped on the floor?
COMEDIANS of the world,"One time, in the mid-90's I was on MDMA and buying clove cigarettes in a bodega in NYC and I said to the man in front of me, ""nice jacket!"" because it had gold epilates and it was Richard Belzer.  So, yeah..."
COMEDIANS of the world,I grew up watching Homicide life on the street.
COMEDIANS of the world,So great on Stern
COMEDIANS of the world,rip he was amazing :’)
COMEDIANS of the world,"The cornerstone of the multiverse, RIP legend."
COMEDIANS of the world,"Sarcasm and quips, great actor. Sad, rest easy."
COMEDIANS of the world,Didn't know he was a comedian.
COMEDIANS of the world,"Feels bad man. Loved this guy on SVU, and seems like he was a pretty cool guy off-set as well. Absolute Chad last words too"
COMEDIANS of the world,Never knew he was a comedian.
COMEDIANS of the world,"Rest in Peace, Richard. Only knew him from the wrestling issue, but seems to be that he wad a great actor on SVU, so have to check that out. 

R.I.P."
COMEDIANS of the world,"Goodbye, Munch! Rest in peace."
COMEDIANS of the world,And Munch was just mentioned on SVU Thursday night as having gone back to Baltimore and reporting The Waterfront bar.
COMEDIANS of the world,RIP. Loved the Belz!
COMEDIANS of the world,I first saw him on late night HBO stand-up.  Soooo funny.  I stopped watching SVU when he left.
COMEDIANS of the world,Man was absolute legend rip
COMEDIANS of the world,"I will always remember him first for *""The Wrong Guys""*. Fun little movie. Belzer was one of a pack of grown up Cub Scouts; which also included Louie Anderson and Richard Lewis. They all head back to a failed pack site to try and finish it as adults. They get mistaken gor the FBI by escaped convicts; which incide John Goodman (Duke Earl) and Ernie Hudson. Their childhood bullies show up to. Silly, but fun. And gave one of the most memorable lines that i actually got to bust out in the appropriate moment a few weeks back. I feel the only other person who has seen this other than me is one of my sisters."
COMEDIANS of the world,For some reason I thought he was already gone
COMEDIANS of the world,Loved his work.
COMEDIANS of the world,:( I initially thought it was Keith Richards... whew...
COMEDIANS of the world,"He was a B, for suing the Hulkster."
COMEDIANS of the world,[deleted]
COMEDIANS of the world,And Scarface.
COMEDIANS of the world,"I met him walking down 72nd street and Broadway some years ago. He was chatting with someone walking their dog, and I waved and nodded as I walked past. He stopped for a sec and turned to me and and lit up with a big smile “Heyy, how are ya!” 

A chill and talented guy."
COMEDIANS of the world,"Good riddance, he was a pathetic weakling and the gene pool is stronger without him"
COMEDIANS of the world,Well Mandela effect in full force because I clearly remember how sad it was when he died over a year ago.
COMEDIANS of the world,"I could've sworn that I remember Belzer dying years ago. 

I loved seeing him pop up everywhere."
COMEDIANS of the world,"oh wow, I thought he passed away years ago.. my bad.."
COMEDIANS of the world,Always hated this guy.
COMEDIANS of the world,I’ve never seen this guy before. He looks like a Bored Ape NFT
COMEDIANS of the world,Definitely wasn’t an actor.
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"I found the entire series could have been condensed to a 2 hour documentary explaining all of her techniques.

The canned chatter between her clients I could have done without."
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,I finished it all in a few days a week or so ago. She’s a great tv personality though the show can be a rad lacking at times. She gives really good tips for packing clothes and towels!
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"I liked it because I'm a fairly obsessive organizer, but they lost me with the thanking the house and items that they were getting rid of part.

Just show me tips on how to clean and organize, not get all awkwardly spiritual with it. ಠ_ಠ"
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"Like... there's no way I'm the only one who thought this show was blown way out of proportion, right?

I saw everyone online raving about it and like the idea of better organization so watched the first 2 episodes.

If you get rid of the emotional throughline bullshit and spiritual nonsense, it was literally just:

* get rid of shit you don't use anymore
* use boxes to organize better
* fold your jeans like you already do

Basically what everyone already fucking does. 

Like, when she shows them how to fold the jeans in ep.1 I was like, this is a joke, right? This is what 99% of the world already does.

I think the only ""technique"" I learned at all was to lay out all of my clothes first to better visualize before discarding what I don't wear. And even that's like some shitpost you'd see on r/lifehacks with a score of -10."
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"""Phenomenon""?

Lol, never even heard of it."
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"That sounds very, very boring. Go watch a YouTube video if you're into that; this is trying to be somewhat entertaining. "
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"That is the whole point of her technique, it makes no sense to critique a show and a style that is 100% based on that by saying “don’t do that”. It’s like watching a show like the office and saying “I liked it because I work in an office but they lost me at all the humor. Just get rid of that and show me the day-to-day of a paper company.” "
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"as a person that has started the process, i thought thanking was stupid too...then slowly as i went through my clothes it made ton of sense, it let me figure out what sparked joy, and what did not. Clothes a lot of people don't get joy, guys in general, but going through each thing individually by the time you are done it makes a ton of sense."
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,2edgy4me
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,So you don't get joy out of seeing it then?
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,Your parents did a shitty job of teaching you how to view the world from others perspectives.
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"I don't see how it's the whole point of her technique. 

I saw the show advertised and it looked like a how to clean up and organize your cluttered house/apt show, which it is. I was just thrown off by the pseudo-spirtual angle of it. 

All that being said, The show is fine, I'll still watch it and enjoy it, I just find that aspect weird and slightly off-putting."
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"Going through each item and seeing if it ""sparks joy"" is one thing, and I can get onboard with that, but the moment of silence and thanking the house and each item they were getting rid of is weird to me. 

Apparently, I'm in the minority. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯"
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"I'm just wondering why they're calling it a ""phenomenon. ""

Odd choice of words."
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,It’s about how to “spark joy” through organizing and decluttering. It’s literally the name of her decluttering book. 
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"I mean you are not praising a t-shirt you bought in 2010 and thinking of all the fun times, you just hold it, and it is yes or no, if yes throw it in the to fold pile if not look at it one last time say thank you and gone it goes!  
  
It is more to hone your sense of joy so when you get to step 5 it is much easier to sort your items, it gets harder each step and the first 3 are for you to figure out what your joy feels like"
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,How dare they call something you haven't heard of a phenomenon.
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,It is also about how a disorganized house can have greater consequences on your mental health and relationships than just being messy.
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,That sounds suspiciously like building good mental health.
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"If something is a phenomenon, you'd think it be known by *everyone*."
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,And this is something that Americans are missing in their lives.  Taking a moment to slow down and thank something as mundane as the house.  We're so caught up in ourselves/our life that we just want the answer to feeling better (more meds!) instead of slowing down and looking at things first.  
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,after i finished clothes i felt SOOO destressed even though my house was still very cluttered lol i knew i finished step 1 and i could finish the rest. 
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,Luckily that is not what it means to be a phenomenon.
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,How embarrassing for you.
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,If you say so...
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,If you say so...
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,The dictionary says so. 
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,I’m on episode 1 and this first family might be about to snap on each other...
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,I reorganized my closet after marthoning the season. It is so good! It brought me joy. 
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"read her book, it's great"
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,There's a later episode that gets kinda heated too. 
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,I've already ordered it!
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"Yeah, I’ve been a fan of Marie for a long time. I’m a mid 30s dude and I think I first did it in July 2017. Felt so good to pile all my clothes on my bed and actually see which brought me joy. Maybe I’ll do it again though I own far, far less now. Just seeing their drawer of all Tupperware I’m like.... why? You can’t possibly use all that.........

I want to show this to some friends but I don’t think they could handle considering their own super cluttered house."
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"i found it very helpful, hopefully you do as well!"
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"I've been telling everyone about this, it's been great. I just graduated with my bachelor's so it's a nice final transition into my next stage in life. Start the new adventure with a clean slate."
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"Good for you, friend. It’s very easy to accumulate stuff you don’t need. If you’d like some unsolicited advice, consider what you use every day and splurge on that. Your bed should have an awesome comforter (and be awesome), big into movies or games? Your tv should be top notch. This doesn’t mean the most expensive item, but one that sparks joy in you. Everything you don’t use daily, you can rank accordingly and be more thrifty on. In this way, you’ll have a code on whether or not to accumulate.

I have a feeling many people on this show will have weird ass kitchen gadgets they never use, for instance! Haha."
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"For the most part the people on the show seem to hoard clothes which is understandable, people's styles chance. Not to mention if you live in an area where the weather varies. 

That's a great way of looking at life. I kind of already go with that mentality, I try to invest in the things I like. I'm an English teacher, so most of my space is taken up by the books I collect. "
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"I actually tripped on clutter while watching it, just like the lady in the first episode did. I think the universe is trying to tell me something. "
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"No foolin', my wife binged this show and cleaned out all our closets, reorganized all our clothes, and took truckloads of stuff to Goodwill 24 hours after finishing it.  Something spooky going on with this little Japanese lady.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;"
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,This is the kind of show I really should watch but under absolutely no circumstances actually will.
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,We just started watching it and it’s better than I thought it would be. 
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,I really need to watch this
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,Not as good as I was hoping for.
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,Missing out there
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"It is an extremely charming show, and it's nice that it's helping people to pick up some positive habits."
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,I am so exited about this!!
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,Just read her damn book. Does it spark joy? no? throw it out. Now you don't even need the book!
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"You’d be surprised how many people don’t understand the simple idea that easily finding things and not having too much crap can make you happy?  Then again, in the US, and it must be so in Japan as well, consumerism is all around us driving us to buy new things and that only buying something new makes us happy, rather that thinking about designing our lives without buying stuff can be rewarding.

I want to easily find things, I like to use things up and not keep a ton of things lying around even in storage.  My wife is different. She is worried constantly that she will need stuff, and refuses to easily give up things. We watched the first episode of Marie Kondo’s new series and it at least inspired her a bit to organize her dresser and the kitchen.  I of course helped, but the point is I always wanted this, she just resisted because she never wanted to give things up.  It was the agreement that we could do some work organizing and that we could enjoy it together is the small epiphany she came to.   

My wife spent most of her twenties scraping by trying to keep her kids alive and fed.  I’ve been able to give her a comfortable life but those habits drive her even now even though she doesn’t need to behave that way.  She needs something like Marie to realize hoarding does not make most people happy."
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"She’s going to conquer the planet, isn’t she? That army isn’t for tidying the planet, it’s for ruling it."
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,I really don't get it. Haven't we always known that clutter makes you unhappy? This just seems like pseudo-Buddhist pop-psych nonsense around a very simple idea taken to extremes.
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"People have too much money, I guess"
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"I'm sick of this woman already. You have too much junk, so throw some out or give it to a charity shop - it's not a new concept. Then stop buying crap you don't need. "
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"I am amazed that anyone would practice her ""techniques"" at all after watching 5 minutes of that show. Why aren't people rioting in the streets crying over all the belongings they gave up?"
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"Cult.  The word they're looking for is 'cult'.  I like the show, I like a lot of the techniques... but there's also some weird hokum mixed in that's a bit laughable.  

"
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"She wants you to buy her $80 tiny boxes, really check her website. She went to a religious college in Japan, seems mandatory to learn English. She wants attention and money."
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"*""Does this bring you joy?""*

*- I read Marie Kondo's book.*

*I threw it away.*"
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"I haven't read it yet, but doesn't she also provide an effective method  and advice on how to successfully do this? 

Advice like going through your stuff by category, not by location. Sounds logical, but not many people would do it by instinct. And if for example, you keep stuff like pictures, memorabilia, or books in different places in your house, you might end up with stuff that don't really spark joy."
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"I've had stuff stored for a very long time and suddenly one day I needed it and it was there, it was useful and I didn't have to spend a dime, some are still in use.

Even stupid stuff like the side cover of a 90's computer can [.have it's uses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPtZHoRsqK0)."
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,When was the last time you used those nuclear weapons? Don't worry I'll take them off your hands.
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"It's literally just a woman helping people tidy and organize.  Like 99% of self help programs are expressing fairly simple concepts, but in a way that inspires people to take action.  "
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"It is a lot, I agree.

I've always been a tidy person who doesn't like a lot of stuff so this isn't aimed at me. But while I'm also not particularly attracted to drugs or alcohol, I'm still glad that programs exist that try to help people recover from all types of addictions. Even if all the hype about it can get on my nerves."
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"*Lots of people inspired to improve their lifestyles*


You:  ""ENOUGH ALREADY!"""
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,I do volunteering at a charity and they have to reject a lot of junk people are trying to offload since this show! It's nice that people want to help out but people can get really offended when told the stuff is not suitable or that there is no room currently to accept more donations. 
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,They made the show too over the top
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,The shit you own ends up owning you.
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"Yeah, why aren't people more upset about the trash they throw away!?"
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"Wait, you're telling me a woman who wrote a book and starred on a TV show has *commercial motives?*


Seriously, what the fuck is your criticism even?"
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,Yeah but it's popular so it's the internet's solemn responsibility to be a dick about it.
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"Yeah. There is a method involved but it’s all about the spark joy line too. If I remember right, she advocates collections everything of a certain type and hen doing the culling. "
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"All this ""does it bring you joy"" noise reminds strongly of the second Noble Truth of Buddhism, but rearranged with an emphasis on the objects of attachment rather than the practice of detachment."
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,Better than being owned by the shit you don't own.
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"But it's not.  It's literally just a barometer for ""should I keep this thing?""  Like a lot of minimalism things will go hardcore with ""if you haven't worn this shirt in 3 weeks and it's the appropriate season for it, throw it out"" as some hard and fast rule.  Kondo is a lot less rigid.  The point is to get you to put hands on everything you own because lots of people don't even *remember* half the stuff they own.  And if you like it, you don't have to justify that based on some rule, but if you feel nothing about it, why do you have it?"
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"Yeah, I don't have anything like that because I'm not an idiot."
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"Oh yeah, you seem like a real fucking treat, spazzing about Buddhism in a fucking cleaning show.  Not an idiot at all."
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"I mean, she was a shrine maiden for years. She's Japanese, and their religious culture is a hybridization of Buddhism and pre-Buddhist native traditions called Shinto. There's nothing surprising about the origins of her philosophy."
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,I really wish people would stop trying to politically weaponized this show. It's not what the far right or left claim to be about. It's just a show about cleaning up.
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"Oh great, the race card....again."
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,Do the Black Western Audience understand it?
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"Wow, way to make it about you, lady.  Sorry you had issues with your parents and found being biracial hard.

Also, the position you take in this article is exactly what you are accusing the critics or Kondo of."
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,That she’s an acoustic japan. 
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,You expect anything else from huffpo?
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"I dunno, better not ask them. Could be racist."
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"This article isn't the most coherent of analyses. It feels like the writer just wanted to tie popular shows recently released on streaming to some generic buzzworthy topic - i.e. Millennials - to give it in air of intelligent reasoning.  But in some episodes, the Marie Kondo show isn't even about Millennials. One might just as well tie in *The Punisher* for no other reason than it just came out."
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"Don't watch Marie Kondo scam artist, she is selling $80 for cheap ass small boxes. Reality TV shows are just filler junk for Netflix."
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"i thought it made pretty good sense. the overarching theme is the perfectionism & burn-out culture of millennials. This is exemplified by the 2 most hot viral netflix shows ATM, which both in their own ways show how fascinated and obsessed millennials are with being perfect"
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"i agree - it was a coherent analysis to me, and i found it interesting.  (btw the buzzfeed article referenced in this one, on the general topic of millennial burnout, is hella good, in my opinion.)  "
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"Uhhhh yeah sure, thats it. rofl wtf nibba."
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,Is this the only question he is asked by reporters?
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"Robert Pattinson gave the best summary of this situation…

>	I always say about people who do method acting, you only ever see people do the method when they’re playing a a–holes. You never see someone being lovely to everyone while they’re really deep in character."
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"At this point, this ‘method beef’ story is starting to feel like marketing."
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"Cox:

>“He’s (Jessie Armstrong) very disciplined in that way, and also he’s very British in that way. The American inclination is to milk it for all it’s worth.”

>“I’ll miss the cast, I’ll miss the atmosphere, I’ll miss the bonhomie. Logan, probably, I’ll miss a bit. But upward and onwards.”


On Jeremy Strong:

>“I’m glad he is not in pain personally, he's a wonderful actor. It’s really a cultural clash. I don’t put up with all that American shit. I’m sorry. All that sort of ‘I think, therefore I feel.’”

>“Just do the job. Don’t identify.”"
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"I like to think he does this as his own way of method acting to keep Jeremy/Kendall in character as hating Logan. But he's probably just an old grump, and that's fine too. He's earned it."
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"He is aware that the king of method acting, Daniel Day-Lewis, is from London right?"
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"Gary Oldman, Christian Bale, Daniel Day Lewis….."
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"The majority of big-name actors who I’ve heard of doing this aren’t American, though…"
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,He sounds cranky like his character anyway so method acting is sort of a moot point.
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,DDL isnt American
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"Brian Cox is a crusty old Scot and I FUCKING ADORE HIM.

""If you were my son, Mac, I wouldve *smothered* you by now!""  Fucking love him in Super Troopers 🤣🤣🤣"
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"Maybe my favorite anecdote from the New Yorker piece on Jeremy Strong is that Brian Cox once asked him why he behaved so oddly and insisted on avoiding the other members of the cast and doing all this method acting stuff etc. and Jeremy Strong basically said ""I don't know another way to embody and perform as this character"" and Brian Cox said ""....have you tried...acting?"""
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,"They could all take a page out of Jason Alexander's book ""Acting Without Acting'."
Pingu in the City,Noot noot
Pingu in the City,oh snap!! So many pleasant memories from my childhood summers.. I am watching.
Pingu in the City,Has there been any news on when is City Primeval airing? I think it is unlikely that it will air in Spring now since it will miss the Emmy deadline.
Pingu in the City,"I'm in the middle of my re-watch right now! Just as good as the first time around.

*We dug coal together.*"
Pingu in the City,"Pro tip: if your seven year old starts saying to your mom ""Grandma June, as I live and breathe,""  your D+ parental controls aren't set up right"
Pingu in the City,Already on CTV app for free
Pingu in the City,"Uh it’s on Amazon Prime now in Canada. 

Source: am rewatching it now."
Pingu in the City,"*""Just* ahead of?"" Where does this come from? No release date has been announced, and while I don't think ""Decades ahead of"" is likely to be true, ""Just ahead of"" is ridiculously misleading. So ... clickbait, right?"
Pingu in the City,"I wish we could get more seasons of both Justified and Santa Clarita Diet, I need more Olyphant in my life."
Pingu in the City,"Good news for Canada, awesome show."
Pingu in the City,Next ones coming faster
Pingu in the City,"Justified season 1 to season 6 are there in amazon prime guys 

Check it out!!"
Pingu in the City,"Primeval?
     
Transmat firing!"
Pingu in the City,Why would they only put it on Disney+ in Canada?
Pingu in the City,Shut up and take my **streaming** money!
Pingu in the City,The first few seasons are great but the show gets very repetitive
Pingu in the City,[deleted]
Pingu in the City,Great show but the last season is pretty bad.
Pingu in the City,I look at the original Justified TV show on wiki and it says the ratings are only about 2 million but it seems to be very popular. Why the low ratings ? And does such ratings justify a revival?
Pingu in the City,I hope they add Justified even in Europe to Disney+ alongside The Americans and Sons of Anarchy. (or Man Seeking Woman). But I am really looking forward to this one.
Pingu in the City,Probably end of the year/end of summer.
Pingu in the City,"“There is still a sizable amount of money missing.”

“How sizable, Raylan?”

“Well over ten dollars.”"
Pingu in the City,That is my favorite line
Pingu in the City,Don't meet many 7 year olds who are Aunt Helen fans.
Pingu in the City,And on FX on demand but not for long I fear with exclusivity contracts and all it would be so nice if they could share between providers and not not just lock it behind one single source.
Pingu in the City,I've been watching it for the first time. I'm on season 6 now and I'm going to miss this show once it's over. It's also on the CTV app.
Pingu in the City,"Won't lie, I read that like Raylan was saying it"
Pingu in the City,"I'm not one for reading the article, but the title implies we're very close to getting new justified episodes?"
Pingu in the City,I heard he’s in the new Daisy Jones show?
Pingu in the City,We've had it on prime video for some time already. We weren't lacking.
Pingu in the City,Also on the CTV app for people who don't have prime.
Pingu in the City,"It's on Hulu in the US, like most of the Disney-owned ""adult"" properties.

Edit: Also it's an FX show, and that's where they keep the FX stuff."
Pingu in the City,Wish it was Disney+ in the U.S. would love a rewatch but not spending more on another streaming service
Pingu in the City,Everyone's entitled to their opinion but I'm not quite sure how you managed to arrive at yours.
Pingu in the City,"I feel like the opposite is true, and it starts a little repetitive but finds its footing?"
Pingu in the City,Do you mean first few episodes? Because it becomes anything but repetitive
Pingu in the City,Disney+ in Canada also has Hulu content since we don’t get Hulu up here. Plenty of FX shows end up on there. It’s pretty great.
Pingu in the City,"seems to be what they're doing in most places, putting everything on Disney+. whereas in the US, aside from the Marvel TV shows (Daredevil, Jessica Jones and such), they put the 'adult' stuff on Hulu instead"
Pingu in the City,"eh, that's nothing really out of the ordinary for a show on cable tv these days. everyone here (rightly) loves Better Call Saul and that averaged barely above 1 million viewers in its final season. those numbers don't factor in people watching shows on streaming services or whatever"
Pingu in the City,"""Well if I had that kind of money I would be in Mexico.""

""Boyd, I've been to Mexico and I don't think you'd like it...""

""And how's that?""

""Because there are a lot of Mexicans."""
Pingu in the City,"My friend. 

You’re in for an amazing finish. 

And rejoice cuz some of us have felt it’s absence for so so many years. 

Now it comes back and he’s finally gonna deal with Detroit and the villain they cast is Boyd Holbrook and Tarantino producing it from an amazing source book. 

I have missed Raylan for so so long. 

He’s Dixie Batman, his rogue gallery is almost as good as Bruce’s."
Pingu in the City,"Yes, but it is one off miniseries, I would love more seasons."
Pingu in the City,"> Daisy Jones 

never heard of it, thanks for the tip

looking it up seems like a smaller role though"
Pingu in the City,Its crazy for the longest time you couldn’t find it in any major streaming site same as The Americans. That why I think both shows became a bit forgotten about.
Pingu in the City,"oh we dont have hulu in nz so hopefully it comes on d+ here (although tbh it could be on there already and i just haven't checked yet, but if not hope it does)"
Pingu in the City,"It's not Disney owned show. It's made by Sony, for FX."
Pingu in the City,You can get Disney+ for $2.99 if you have Hulu.
Pingu in the City,I havent seen the show in quite some time. I just mean that every season is a new baddie that raylan has to get
Pingu in the City,"It starts off as a case of the week, procedural before slowly switching to a more serialized arc.   I always figured it was always intended to be more serialized but they had to ease into it to get everyone on board."
Pingu in the City,I believe Tim said in an interview never say never about them doing more in the future. I think he's always open to it anyway.
Pingu in the City,"Haven’t watched yet, too bad :( I’ll just continue along through season 4 of my justified rewatch."
Pingu in the City,"i know The Americans was on Amazon Prime for a pretty long time until recently moving to Hulu. i *think* that might've been the case for Justified, too"
Pingu in the City,You’re right. I meant that Disney had the license for streaming and didn't clarify my original comment after the edit.
Pingu in the City,Disney owns FX
Pingu in the City,That's more than zero dollars.
Pingu in the City,"Well, considering the main character is a LEO then what else could the show be about?"
Pingu in the City,It was. Both were on Prime for a few years before switching to Hulu.
Pingu in the City,"Yeah I know. But Sony is the official distributor of that show. They make it for FX but at the end of the day, they hold international rights for the show. Looks like a licensing deal between Disney and Sony is allowing this show to be streamed on Disney+ in Canada. Justified has been licensed to Prime Video where I live."
Pingu in the City,"- Starts as a film directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Leonardo DiCaprio.

- Almost a decade passes and no progress on the film.

- It goes to Hulu as a limited series.

- 3 years pass, nothing happens.

- Keanu Reeves is announced to star while Todd Field directs.

- Less than a year later, Reeves leaves and so does Field.

- Limited series is now scrapped.

Hmmm, I'm starting to think this adaptation is cursed."
Pingu in the City,"This is legitimately never gonna get made at this point lmao

Please just get some history nut veteran showrunner an HBO budget and cast Nick Offerman as Daniel Burnham.

Edit:

> In recent weeks, Jeremy Allen White and Jude Law were in talks to star but in the end, the entire project fell through. Was it the deals or was it a top-down message that an expensive period piece wasn't the way Hulu should go? ([source](https://twitter.com/borys_kit/status/1632911131986784256?s=46&t=nfDSG6o3y6zWZ-Y4pfC3bA))

We were so close"
Pingu in the City,"Jesus Christ, why has no one in 20 years been able to crack it? Whether as a movie or a show? Huge names have been attached to this yet it keep falling apart."
Pingu in the City,This is disappointing news
Pingu in the City,Maybe it’s for the best. Look how long it Y The Last Man to be made and that adaptation was pretty mediocre.
Pingu in the City,"Man this project certainly fell apart. Went from having a lead actor, director and a network last year to none this year."
Pingu in the City,"With all the crap that streaming turns out, this one can't make the cut?"
Pingu in the City,"Feels like every year or two I hear new names attached to this project and then it disappears. Same goes with Blood Meridian. TBF, both seem like they'd be very difficult adaptations."
Pingu in the City,This project is cursed.
Pingu in the City,Cursed but American God's got made so I'm hopeful still
Pingu in the City,I really wanted to see this
Pingu in the City,"I literally just finished this book. If they do the Worlds Fair parts, it would make for a boring movie.

Edit: I actually really enjoyed the fair sections, I just can’t imagine that be very exciting because a lot if it was about choosing architects, floral designs and such. They’ll probably play up the fires and such, though."
Pingu in the City,"Had a feeling this was a dead series when Keanu dropped out. 

It seems like a weird project to adapt. A story about the creation of a giant expo and a story about a serial killer, neither of which have anything to do with another.

I'm surprised nobody has decided to ditch the part about the World's Fair and do a film about HH Holmes. It's probably all the parts about the World's Fair and recreating it is what would cause the project to have a giant budget."
Pingu in the City,Hard -- in the visual media -- trying to figure out how to fit in 3 episodes on architectural history in the middle of a story about a serial murderer.
Pingu in the City,This and “Confederacy of Dunces” have pissed off the adaptation gods and just can’t get out of development purgatory.
Pingu in the City,"Depending on your definition of progress, there was a lot of it on Scorsese’s film version. There’s a couple different drafts of the script floating around online, and probably several other versions that never emerged anywhere. Lot of writers worked on that movie over the years."
Pingu in the City,"A real shame, this would be a pretty epic 3hr movie more than a series IMO. DiCaprio would have been perfect too."
Pingu in the City,A Scorcese and DiCaprio vehicle sounds like a non-brainer to begin with. Really weird why it didn't go to completion at that first step tbh
Pingu in the City,"I remember first reading Devil In the White City because it was an inspiration for the then-upcoming Bioshock Infinite. 

That was ten years ago this month."
Pingu in the City,Pretty sure that before Leo and Scorcese Tom Cruise was attached to it as well.
Pingu in the City,It has been an emotional journey to follow along the whole time
Pingu in the City,Has Robert Eggers ever expressed interest in show running?
Pingu in the City,"Nick Offerman as Daniel Burnham?

Speaking of being so close..."
Pingu in the City,"Attaching huge names might be the problem. Star power is expensive and difficult to schedule unless it’s their passion project. Cast some unknowns. Grab an up and coming director. Save a bundle and give someone new a chance. If the production is good and the people behind it are talented, you don’t need star power."
Pingu in the City,"> Jesus Christ, why has no one in 20 years been able to crack it? 

Because the best parts of the book would make for one really dull drama. The best parts of the book was about the architecture of Chicago and the work done to put on the world's fair.

All the shit about HH Holmes is really a pretty forgettable story about a serial killer. 

The only thing interesting that Holmes did is he built an elaborate torture chamber. 

So at the end of the day they only options for story telling is about someone building things."
Pingu in the City,The show runner wanted to turn the show into something else. The main cast were pretty good but they didn't have a lot to work with. Alienated anyone who liked the source and didn't attract any of whatever demographic they were aiming for.
Pingu in the City,"Setting aside the question of whether you could make a direct adaptation of Y: The Last Man today, not having the Israelis and Amazons essentially got rid of the antagonists from the comics. That adaptation was a bit like making a Harry Potter movie without Voldemort and the Death Eaters, where Lily and James Potter really did die in a car crash.

Whether or not a slow burn quasi political post-apocalyptic story is something anyone has ever been interested in watching is something I think is fairly clearly answered by the fact no other show like that exists. Maybe such a programme (of film) *should* exist, but it's pretty clear they were just using the framework of the IP to trick people into watching/greenlighting what was a fundamentally different story. Sort of like Foundation except people didn't really like the new plotline. I suggest the major difference is, and I haven't read Foundation, that the Lee Pace stuff is kinda necessary for anything in Foundation to make sense, whereas in Y: The Last Man the politics stuff exists in an inherent tension with what the main characters are trying to do. Having a storyline about ""what comes next"" after a world shattering event, is a bit nuts when your ostensible main characters are trying to shatter the foundations of this new world.

They also made specific changes to Yorick and Mann that made both of them much harder to sympathise with. Alas, the specific change to Yorick was destructive to his entire character concept from the comics. Show Yorick knows Beth wanted to end things, whereas comics Yorick is sort of this hopeless romantic, which is endearing... even as the audience knows his mission *should* be doomed to failure (due to dramatic irony).

There are worse ways to make an adaptation, but Y: The Last Man's failure is clearly on how they tried to adapt it, not that they tried to adapt it in the first place."
Pingu in the City,"God if there was one comic that seemed to be an easy homerun it was Y last man. I really liked the first episode or two but then they decided to completely stall the story and change shit around. Same thing happened with preacher, yeah let's just spend an entire season focusing on shit that has nothing to do with the comic. TWD started great and faithful to the source material then got bogged down. The Witcher, eugh. 

If the last of us has a lasting impact I hope it's that the people with the money find someone who loves and understands the source material and let's them stay faithful."
Pingu in the City,"I finished the book the other month and after a certain point found the Holmes stuff to be an absolute drag on what I really wanted to get back to, which was Frederick Olmsted getting really annoyed over the specifics of park designs."
Pingu in the City,"Everyone can have their favorite parts, but if prior to reading the book you had told me I would dismiss much of the serial killer stuff and be profoundly captivated by the 1893 Colombian Exposition I would have laughed at you. But that’s what happened. The World’s Fair stuff is magical. And if I was ever offered an opportunity to go back to a time and place, it would be Chicago the year it opened."
Pingu in the City,"> If they do the Worlds Fair parts, it would make for a boring movie.

That also seems like it would be prohibitively expensive. They'd need a huge budget for sets and CGI extensions to show off the large scale of structures and workers and show all the progress over time in building the fair. Not to mention of course its a period piece which makes everything more pricey."
Pingu in the City,That's literally the only part I care about!
Pingu in the City,Disagree greatly.
Pingu in the City,"The race to put together the World’s Fair is the actual story though, it’s not in the middle of a story about a serial killer. And there’s a lot of dramatic thrust there, wouldn’t be hard to structure it in an episodic format. It’s not like it’s just dudes staring at blueprints, there’s fires and storms and huge egos and crazy people coming from around the world and people dying under construction failures.

If anything in the book the HH Holmes stuff gets kinda repetitive and feels tacked on. It’s pretty clear to me that Larson wanted to write a book about the World’s Fair and the publisher made him include a serial killer hook."
Pingu in the City,"And a 20 minute aside on the layout of the fair and the risk of flooding that they had to avoid.


It why I never read Thunderstruck also by Erik Larson it's the same schtick of a bunch of interwoven events occuring and some just aren't interesting."
Pingu in the City,"Blood Meridian, too. 

I had no idea Confederacy of Dunces had been through adaptation hell. I feel like that one would require exceptionally gifted writers. The line between hilariously off-kilter and just weird seems like it'd be very fine for this one."
Pingu in the City,Throw *Neuromancer* in there too.
Pingu in the City,The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay is another great book that has had an adaptation in development hell for many years.
Pingu in the City,"At first you had my curiosity, but now, you have my attention."
Pingu in the City,But star power also brings in financing and this will be a very expensive period piece.
Pingu in the City,"Exactly lol the thing that would be the easiest to make into a television show would be HH Holmes and his murder house, but that's quite literally a backdrop to the story of the world's fair and the enormous feats to pull off its creation  

Might just be one of those things that simply works better as literature  

However, as someone who loves time period pieces I would absolutely watch a mini series about its creation"
Pingu in the City,"Yeah, the Holmes stuff is interesting early on in the sense that it's fascinating to watch this guy just sort of glide his way into building this little fiefdom/murder machine but once he has all the pieces of the machine set in place and the initial horror wears off it's mostly just a guy devoid of a soul repeating a pattern over and over again, and so checking in with him almost feels like a chore.

Meanwhile the Burnham side of the book is such an incredible look at what it takes to get something like that done, all the little ways in which it helped shape the century to come in terms of innovations, the labor movement, etc., and really this snapshot of life at that specific point in time. I think a really good show could be made out of it but it would cost a lot and would be pitched at a pretty niche audience, like if a David Simon show about urban development was given a huge amount of money by someone who just wanted to see it and didn't care that they lost a ton of money on it."
For the Win,"Agree completely. Her performance was wonderful. 

Mossbacher got a second shot with Andor."
For the Win,Literally every actor in that show should be getting some award. Show was incredibly well done all around.
For the Win,"Heard, chef."
For the Win,"Naija in the building!!! So happy for her, I haven't finished the Bear yet, but she's been great in everything I've seen."
For the Win,"I am really happy for her. I love her character in the Bear since its one of the few ones that actually feel like how human beings actually behave. 

She got recently cast in Marvel's Thunderbolts and knowing Marvel, I hope they don't ruin her character. I am really rooting for Ayo and Jeremy Allen White to grow successful as actors."
For the Win,Yes!!! She is the best.
For the Win,"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tVq8L7Skxpg

She just also starred in a stage reading of triangle of sadness."
For the Win,She is very good in this series. Well deserved
For the Win,Ok now I've gotta watch this. She's been really funny in all of the podcasts I've heard her in.
For the Win,She was great in season one.
For the Win,"Good, she deserved it!"
For the Win,She was great. I only think Carmy pulled a better performance and nearly everyone did a fantastic job.
For the Win,"She deserves it, she’s amazing. Can’t wait for season 2!!"
For the Win,She did a great job in the show. Can't wait for season two man.
For the Win,i would like to start a cult and ayo is the leader. my queen
For the Win,She have a license for those guns? Dam
For the Win,I love her character. That’s great!

For the Win,The thumbnail looks like she is naked holding a bunch of kittens
For the Win,Daaaaa bear
For the Win,Awesome! I wonder if she gets to go celebrate by doing cocaine with cocaine bear
For the Win,Most relatable character. And shes pretty
For the Win,"The Spirit Awards are pointless now. How on Earth  is streaming show  considered ""independent?"" 

Of course this pales in comparison to a movie produced by the fucking Russo Brothers being also considered ""independent."""
For the Win,Why is she kinda ripped
For the Win,[removed]
For the Win,Icon
For the Win,She can take that award to Brunch with now!
For the Win,Great show.
For the Win,"She was great, happy for her"
For the Win,Favorite second behind Carmy. She was amazing! Can’t wait to see where her career goes after this
For the Win,Absolutely agree. Part of the reason the show was so awesome was that every single person NAILED their character. Very impressive when you look at it from all angles.
For the Win,"Yes, Jeff."
For the Win,this should be the top comment lol
For the Win,"We love the show, patiently awaiting new season."
For the Win,We no Dey carry last!
For the Win,She also got casted to voice April in Seth Rogen’s TMNT: Mutant Mayhem movie next year :)
For the Win,"Ooh, do you know which Thunderbolt she’s playing? I read those as a teen bc my bf was obsessed with them lol"
For the Win,"I’m jealous that you get to watch “The Bear” for the first time. It’s awesome, enjoy!"
For the Win,she looks jacked af
For the Win,"If it is made by an independent studio, it is considered independent."
For the Win,Does it matter?
For the Win,Why do people hate this remark as much
For the Win,"Sorry, I’m unclear: who do you think is being discriminated against?"
For the Win,wOkE
For the Win,I believe that anyone that uses woke in a negative fashion doesn't have anything useful to contribute to society.
For the Win,"But acting is not something that benefits from a gendered awards system. Men and women act together and neither has a biological advantage. It honestly makes no sense to separate the categories except "" this is how we always have done it"""
For the Win,Are you some sort of a multinational broadcasting conglomerate? What’s your big plan with boycotting oscars for life? Standing in crowd with a poster? What if your life expectancy is around year and a half?
For the Win,"Awards delivery order: 

Best Supporting Actress

Best Supporting Actor

Best Actress

Best Actor

Best Film

It was always clear that ‘best actor and film’ were the pinnacle of the show, the most important awards. The word ‘Actor’ covers both men and women who perform, but awards shows separated women from that word and gave them their own, lesser category, ensuring they can never compete against men for the top spot. 

As a young girl who was taught to ‘save the best for last’, the Oscar’s seemed to be intentionally telling me, and everyone else, that a girl could never be *The Best*, she could only be the best *girl*, the runner up. I asked every year why men and women couldn’t compete to be the best against each other. AT LEAST in acting. We were prohibited from being a part of so much else, for so long, this always just seemed like a reasonable request for fairness and equal opportunity to me. 

So yes, you are crazy for thinking those ugly, unfair things, and I think you may also lack empathy and thoughtfulness."

For the Win,"So you are okay with one person winning instead of two?  Got it! 🙄🙄 Separating the sexes ensures that BOTH genders get rewarded for their efforts, talent, and hard work.  Or does equality only matter when we are talking about women and racial minorities?! 😳😳 

Yes, I’m crazy this way because to me- who is a gay woman by the way- equality means FOR ALL PEOPLE, MEN AND WOMEN! 😬😬 If we just change these categories to actor, either a woman or a man will win, so one gender will always be left out.  See my logic, or are you so obsessed with manufacturing a gender neutral world to the point that you can’t see how this would hurt and punish BOTH genders equally?!But, yeah, saying I want equality for both genders is being a misogynist and somehow backwards and bigoted in today’s cultural climate… 😔😔 

As for sports, men will always be physically stronger and faster than us, so yes, as women we would always be on the losing end of that battle if professional sports were to become gender neutral or men and women competed against each other for sports titles.  There might be exceptions, of course, but due to the biological and physiological differences between us, women would most often end up on the losing end of this equation.  This is all just my opinion, I think most reasonable and rational people would agree with it, but you have the right to disagree and keep fighting for a genderless society as is becoming the trendy thing nowadays… 🙄🙄"
For the Win,"The writing in that show is great. Especially since the creator and head writer stars in it. That combo can spell disaster with the writer/actor dominating the show and having no flaws and getting no criticism.

All characters feels like they have good sides and bad sides, which makes them feel relatable.

Also I need Tyler James Williams to star in an Eddie Murphy biopic. It’s like his character is Eddie dialed down to 1. I think it could work."
For the Win,And let’s not forget she’s also playing Janine’s sister on Abbott Elementsry
For the Win,"Oooh even better!  I love TMNT stuff and thought it was 2024 for some reason ><

edit:  Thanks for that!"
For the Win,Why?
For the Win,"Sure bud lol, not reading all that, the first line was dumb enough."
For the Win,Yea its rare to see a piece of art work so perfectly in this medium but abbott nails it on every level
For the Win,"I’ve heard tell in the television program, “Abbott Elementary”, she plays the sister of lead character “Janine”"
For the Win,Because I like ripped girls?? Am I gonna get hate for this too?
For the Win,"Your initial comment provided no context. Honestly, I thought you were mocking her for being ripped."
For the Win,"I was not, it was a compliment"
For the Win,Your comment could have been written a bit better then.
For the Win,No it couldn't
For the Win,Most stressful comedy ever
For the Win,They could have submitted for Drama and he would still deserve it.  His monologue in the last episode was killer.
For the Win,I’m honestly surprised he never won one for shameless
For the Win,"I didn’t even know who Jeremy Allen White was before I watched The Bear and now I’m convinced he’ll be one of the very best actors of this generation! I’m so happy he won this, I’ll watch anything he’s in now."
For the Win,Heard Chef! I just binged this show over the last two nights.  So freaking good. The entire cast was superb.
For the Win,I don't understand why this was nominated as a comedy. It's so clearly a drama.
For the Win,"Damn good show. Well deserved. Even on Shameless, he was the one I rooted for most, until they ran his college arc to the ground."
For the Win,How is The Bear a comedy?
For the Win,He should have won one for Shameless years ago.  He’s so talented.
For the Win,Yes chef!
For the Win,"If “Curb Your Enthusiasm” created cringe comedy, “The Bear” gave us anxiety comedy."
For the Win,God I cant wait for S2.  First new show in a long time that I’ve really gotten into.
For the Win,Congratulations Lip!
For the Win,Thatta boy Lip!!!
For the Win,AM I THE ONLY ONE THAT THINKS HE LOOKS LIKE GENE WILDER?
For the Win,What made The Bear a musical or comedy?
For the Win,Good for him.
For the Win,This show is amazing. Glad he won’
For the Win,"Just an amazing show, the dudes got some serious acting chops. That monolauge is so fucking well done!"
For the Win,Hell yeah. Most of the cast deserved an award. Great show.
For the Win,I think the bear could classify as a dark comedy but he should not have won for comedy. He could have won for drama though.
For the Win,Well deserved
For the Win,"Not very funny, and I can't dance to it for shit."
For the Win,I’m happy for the dude. He deserved it. The Bear is my favorite new show in 2022.
For the Win,He deserved! Love this show! Haven’t been that stressed watching something since Adam Sandler’s chaotic *Uncut Gems*…
For the Win,Why was the prior post deleted?
For the Win,The part when the orders come in too quick… that was  when he won it
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,"Bow Wow is on a show called ""Droppin Cash"" and spends $1100 on some sports memorabilia......times are tough 😭😭😭"
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,"Yep, definitely. Lol. Trippie Redd spent (more like got seriously fucking hustled and/or extremely overpaid by about $4,800) spent 5k to smash up a ≤$50 scrap yard vehicle and some old curb-side grade appliances and spray $30 worth of some paint around. Fetty dropped 20k on a 12k bike, and Soulja gave 80k on a 75k car. And then here’s *Bow Wow* dishing out a whole $1,175.00 counting out exact change down to the dollar bills, while the store owner looks on. Dejected and annoyed he wasted his time getting excited for a big sale after pulling out the crème de la crème 100k-350k pieces for nothing. Bow Wow also making sure to name drop his “*Uncle Snoop*” about 5 times and state how he’s buying an extra jersey as a gift for him. Furthermore, during the driving vignette he laments that he was just *trolling* and *knew what he was doing* when he was caught, re: the *Bow Wow Challenge*, fraudulently flaunting owning and boarding a private jet. However in actuality he was seen and photographed flying commercial, in Economy class at that, the very same day mere hours after posting the private jet boast. Also he ends the episode commenting about how others in the industry don’t take care of their money properly and are broke, and then immediately follows with for next episode he’ll **definitely** be buying a Bugatti for the show and its viewers."
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,"fetty gave him an extra 8 grand for being ""fam"""
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,Damn you dug deep.
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,:) not as deep as you w your Gd essay
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,Tbh I don’t even remember writing it haha. Where are you from brother? Toronto?
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,"Odds on them cobbling together another NCIS spin-off to replace it, the way Hawaii replaced New Orleans?"
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,All these NCIS' make it sound like joining the Navy is a death sentence. If you don't commit murder someone will murder you.
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,I imagine a lot of the cast was ready to leave. The main 4 have been doing it since season 1(with one joining late in the season). In a hypothetical season 16 I could see all of them gone due the actor wanting out. The original NCIS was able to space out departures much better. It kinda funny but if the show had been less successful at retaining cast members it might have been able to continue.
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,"Not surprising given how checked out the cast is. There has only been 1 I think episode this season where every cast member was in it. They rotate an episode off, but it def seems like LL Cool J and Chris O’Donnell are out the most. It’s annoying how obvious it’s been for like 3-4+ seasons that it’s just a cash grab-they are probably making a ridiculous amount of money. 

I’m enjoying the new Hawaii leg of the franchise. It’s much fresher and I like the cast."
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,INB4: NCIS Hawaii CSI Mcguyver 5-0
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,"Awh damn, I love this show. Time for a rewatch from season 1."
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,"Kind of a big shock, even bigger than them canceling Magnum PI last year."
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,Who's going to break the news to grandma?
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,For some reason this is the only NCIS I haven't watched but after the crossover episodes last week I finally started watching it and it's not too bad.
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,"as a nobody actor it is my dream to just get a recurring role on one of these shows that nobody really watches but lasts like 15 years

I still regret not going ti work on the walking dead. turned into a 20 yr gig for some of my friends (here in Ga)"
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,14 seasons is a great run- I honestly thought that it was going to end sooner.
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,Just in time for Chris O’Donnell to star as Robert Pattinson’s Robin in The Batman 2!
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,"This show is still on! The LL Cool J and Chris O'Donnell one? Wow, I thought it was one of the CSI spin-offs that fizzled out."
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,It'll be replaced with more police/military procedurals or a new fire fighting show.
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,My mom is going to be so disappointed.
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,My favourite NCIS
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,I'd like a show that follows actual NCIS crimes instead of terrorism and murder durder.
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,Should have ended like 12 seasons ago.
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,"Damn- my great, great, great grandmother is going to take this really hard…"
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,Why is nathan drake standing on the left?
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,Look at those empty plate carriers
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,Why do all of these people look like posers?
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,"Thank goodness because the episode I just watched was so abysmally atrocious it was beyond comprehension. I mean, it was NCIS in name-only because they always did more spy / espionage / terrorist stuff than any actual Naval Criminal Investigative stuff. But “Best Seller” — totally horrendous."
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,Who watches these low bro shows?
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,I went 14 years not watching this. Was hoping to make it an even 15.
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,Who?
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,Is there a place where one can stream NCIS Los Angeles (older seasons and not just current or last season) and not have to pay by the episode or for the season (e.g. like a Netflix or a Paramount Plus)?   I’m on Season 14 of the original NCIS on Netflix and cannot find NCIS Los Angeles (whole) anywhere.  Plan was to start that next.
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,Why do they all look like discount Delta Force?
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,I need someone with a lot of time on their hands to do a total body count for this show.  How many kills did the team make in the 14 years?  I’d guess it’s in the thousands.
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,Does this mean no more navy-related crime in LA?
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,Not bad for a show set in a city with little to no NCIS personnel.
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,Not surprised since they never even bothered to pair it up with the other NCIS shows to create a NCIS Monday block.
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,NCIS: Gary Indiana
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,there's  Sydney Australia  one that's supposed to come out sometime this year
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,"unclear. honestly, a big impetus for hawaii was because CBS has a standing production setup in hawaii dating back to the original hawaii five 0 that has resulted in them near constantly looking for cost savings by reusing it with new shows. they axed the reboot 5-0 and almost immediately there was an ""NCIS: pearl harbor"" pilot script making the rounds.

that being said i hope they keep going cause eventually theyll run out of major port cities."
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,"I didn't know that New Orleans was over, does that mean that Captain Archer has a clear schedule?"
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,"Navy petty officer vs starfleet ensign, neither for the faint of heart."
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,"I had a roommate who hatewatched NCIS, he lost his shit with how often the victim was a petty officer.

One time the victim was an Admiral, and he perked up thinking it was going to be a good one.

Nope, Petty officer wearing an Admiral uniform.

Roommate lost it, the outburst was hilarious."
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,"people talk about how cabot cove from murder she wrote is some death trap and that angela fletcher must be the one doing all these murders, but holy crap the murder rate amongst state-side sailors and marines is off the charts."
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,"Also the amount of times that an investigative branch of one of the US's military services are involved in things (not even ""cases"") that'd seem so far outside their juridisction, it's sort of laughable. 

Like the time they planted two of their detectives into Afghanistan into the hands of a mass-murderer.

Then this INVESTIGATIVE BRANCH kicks off and are balls deep into a live-combat rescue mission in AFGHANISTAN against an armed camp of taliban."
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,"Wow. Actually thinking about it, I think that’s why I still watching the OG NCIS. I’ve actually enjoyed the cast changes. Every time I think “Damn it’s gonna suck” I end up being surprised especially with Mark Harmon leaving but nope still watching."
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,Jesus. The actor for Gibbs was on that show from from 2003 to 2021
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,[deleted]
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,It's probably not their decision but a result of budget cuts. Everyone gets paid for like 16 episodes a season instead of 22 (for example) and the show saves a million an episode without firing anyone.
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,I was watching the most recent episode and it seems like Daniela Ruah isn’t even trying. She was terrible.
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,Wait they have a Hawaii spin-off? Why not continue with the Hawaii Five-0 reboot instead
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,"NCIS Hawaii had pretty bad ratings to start but it's slowly going up. I've enjoyed it from the start and agree it's definitely fresh, I stopped watching the original NCIS once Hawaii came out."

Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,"Me too. I started watching it on TV during the pandemic and it was a nice show. The main four and Hetty were great in the earlier seasons. One of my favorite episodes is the one with the twin suicide bombers. The ending with Callan never ceases to make me shed a tear or two.

I just hope they wrap up Hetty and Callan's past and let them have a good ending."

Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,"unless another NCIS takes its place, gonna put good money that CBS puts another firefighter show on the roster, cause A: it seems thats the new job amongst the 4 tv jobs (dr/lawyer/cop/firefighter) and B: fire country's premise is so far away from the normal routine and if you ignore that, CBS is the only major network without a firefighter show"

Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,"If it were a good old fashioned weekly episodic show, I'd watch Star Trek: NCIS."
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,What about faith of the heart
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,I actually enjoy both shows but it was always weird to me that normal NCIS feels like they actually solve navy crimes while LA is basically a counter terrorist strike team.
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,"It was Syria and they were technically recovering an NCIS agent. And investigating a terrorist.

They tracked the camp down because the terrorist was obsessed with a slurpee knock-off."
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,It’s like CSI having the forensics team do raids and get into shootouts.
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,"That happens in JAG too. 

I believe both Rabb and Bud are put into combat situations over the course of the show. I don't remember the specifics though...it's been a long time."
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,Wait Mark Harmon left? No Gibbs on NCIS?
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,Deeks.
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,"That’s certainly possible, but given how visibly checked out they all are, it’s a toss up IMO whether it was done by choice or by force. 

Also, no doubt that the core 4 make an absolute fortune after putting in 14 seasons on a top network procedural (13 for Olsen) they definitely don’t make a million an episode!!! And it’s only one actor sitting out per ep so it’s not multiple salaries. 

I can’t find the cost per episode for any of the NCIS shows, but back in the day, ER seasons 4-6 cost $6 million per episode so I have to fathom it costs more than that (that was the most comparable show I could find, everything else I found was either sitcom or premium TV). Those 4 actors are rumored to make $350k/episode so someone smarter than me would have to figure out the cost/benefit to benching them on rotation. Also, they cut the episode count from 22-24 ep down to I think 18 per season already.

 I can say that personally between them sitting out episodes and the lack of effort they put into their performances, the show def sits in my queue much longer than most other shows (and longer than they want for it to reflect well in their numbers if others are like me)"
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,"Yea, except for the newer cast members they have all totally checked out. I know Ruah and Olsen have directed/written episodes, but they have all been totally over it in front of the camera for years now. Idk how much they make, but it’s certainly well into 7 figures annually so it was prob hard to give that up. Tho on the other hand, how much money could they possibly need?! LL Cool J must be SF rich and O’Donnell, Olsen, and Ruah prob don’t need to work another day in their lives. 

I just hope that Linda Hunt comes back so they can finally conclude the like half a decade mystery behind her and Callen before the season is over. And, I hope they put in more effort in the remainder of the episodes."
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,"Idk, prob bc it’s different creators so it’s different old white men padding their pockets lol. 

I think that the NCIS Hawaii is much better than H5O which I never cared much for despite enjoying most of the leads. It’s on Mon nights right after the original NCIS at I think 10pm. Vanessa Lachey is the lead/the Gibbs of the show. I enjoy her MUCH more than I thought I would. 

The show also shows a tad more of their personal lives away from “work” which is something I always enjoy in procedurals. I find it hard to get invested in a show when the characters are shown to be one dimensional workaholics and the only thing we know about their non work lives comes from like 1 episode a season and often bc the character is in trouble. The L&O franchise I find to be the worst culprits of this. 99.9999% of the show is the case (which clearly the majority of viewers like given how successful that formula has been for that franchise). I enjoy learning about the characters and it helps me get invested in them and therefore the show."
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,we dont need another reboot
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,"Yea, I think the 4 OGs all are. I get that it must be hard to walk away from SO much money, but they either should have put in the effort they were paid to or stepped down and let someone else get the opportunity (a newbie obv wouldn’t make $350k, but a consistent acting job like that must be very highly coveted in such an unsteady industry)."
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,"Yes, which is precisely what's popular with a lot of people and especially overseas. NCIS is regularly one of Netflix's most-watched series per Nielsen. Not everything has to be HBO to be valuable."
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,JAG was way better than any NCIS could ever be.
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,"Honestly, I don’t know what NCIS is. Not throwing shade. I’ve just never seen it."
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,Crane division likes blowing shit up
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,Only if Bert Macklin in-retires from the FBI and joins NCIS to catch Judy Hitler.
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,yup https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/16/ncis-is-coming-to-sydney-as-the-police-dramas-first-international-spin-off

Seems for this bathing beauty, her Bikini really took

*yeeeeeeeeaaaaahhhhhh*"
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,They really should do that: recycle the scripts and give it a Trek coat of paint.
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,"Fanfic exists, but it is weird."
Droppin Cash: Los Angeles,That would imply starfleet routinely has murder trials. Theres a few episodes where characters go crazy and try to kill from alien mind fuckery or a virus but I dont think they ever present an officer as being naturally homicidal.
Long Riders!,Only if we get to see gimple return to the character by having him team with Rick grimes as a 45 year old safety patrolman
Long Riders!,The amount of effort you put into that cast list....
Long Riders!,the fuck is fillmore?
Long Riders!,"Amazon, right?  I just looked for it and it's not pulling up at all. Wonder if they took it down for some reason."

Long Riders!,Sure. I only watched a handful but I'll give it a shot. Msg me. 
Long Riders!,I love to join in with this project!
Long Riders!,Next do Scarecrow and Mrs. King
Long Riders!,I'm curious where can you watch episodes of Simon & Simon on demand
Long Riders!,I loved it at the time.  I've tried to watch it since and found it not as interesting.   I have always been curious why there's only ever 3 seasons available.
Long Riders!,Sweet. 😎 👍
Long Riders!,"Thank you! I'm glad to hear that. I'll try to advertise it here on Reddit. Of course, I could come back to this post and send you message. :3"
Long Riders!,"Plus more! If this is successful, there will be more podcasts on other 80's shows. 😉"
Long Riders!,Hulu
Long Riders!,"Ooh, that be nice to dive in to see why the show isn't as interesting as it was. Wait, there's only 3 seasons available? What?"
Long Riders!,"I also enjoyed *Manhunt: Unabomber*, but this caught my attention:

>*Manhunt* hinges on his ability to play a beta male, the intelligent alpha intelligence that can't put his social demons behind him long enough to hold a real conversation.

I'm not sure I quite agree. The issue isn't that Worthington's character Fitz is a ""beta male"", but rather that he's a former blue-collar beat cop who feels like his white-collar superiors in the FBI are unfairly dismissing his ideas *because* he's a former blue-collar beat cop. This isn't entirely justified ""objectively""; after all, Fitz *did* get anointed by being recruited to the prestigious [BAU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_Analysis_Unit). That doesn't change that he's still sensitive to how—or whether—a person like him can truly be embraced by the Bureau. That means that mostly-benign joking, like where his colleagues [spoiler](#s ""poke fun at his Philadelphia-specific way of pronouncing 'water'""), is something to which Fitz is more sensitive than another agent would be. On top of all that, he's also a junior agent in a highly hierarchical institution like The FBI, meaning that he'll be at the mercy of the upper levels of the bureacracy.

Once Kaczynski is arrested, Fitz's concern is that a judge [spoiler](#s ""*will* agree with Kaczynski's argument that forensic linguistics is an insufficient basis for a search warrant""). This isn't just the worry of a law enforcement officer that a defendant will [spoiler](#s ""be released on a technicality""). For Fitz, it's more personal: the fear is that a supremely intelligent person will justify all of Fitz's second-guessing and insecurities by [spoiler](#s ""proving the invalidity of forensic linguistics in open court"").

Later, as the noose tightens around Kaczynski, I think Fitz is torn because he's genuinely [spoiler](#s ""sympathetic to the ideas in Kaczynski's manifesto""). This isn't about being a beta male; it's about the mindfuck of trying to apprehend someone who did something horrific, but [spoiler](#s ""whose ideas you respect—especially when all your actions with your superiors seem to vindicate Kaczynski's diagnoses of how institutional conformity undermines personal autonomy""). Figuring out how to reconcile those seemingly opposing views is something with which Fitz clearly struggles. That struggle hardly ends with Kaczynski's capture or even his conviction, as underlined by the [spoiler](#s ""final scene at the stop light"")."
Long Riders!,I lost my Saturday to that series!
Long Riders!,"No, he is not. I could not disagree with you more. Sam Worthington was such a pile of hot garbage, and he should thank his lucky stars that throughout his career his performances (or lack thereof) have been redeemed by actors actually worth their salt. Paul Bettany single-handedly salvaged this series. Jesus Christ how does this guy keep getting work?"
Long Riders!,Just finished this series the other day and thought it was great.   I thought Bettany was great in it.  
Long Riders!,"I'm almost done with that show, loving it, but Worthington is the worst aspect by far to me. He just seems so flat. I don't feel any of the obsession or passion of his character. Like the scene with him and Mark Duplass in the car, he just seems sort of removed from what he is saying."
Long Riders!,"Worthington is great in 

-  Man on a Ledge 
-  Texas Killing Fields 
-  Last Night 
-  The Debt 

I grew bored with Unabomber. I made it to about halfway through the ""Ted"" episode and dumped it. They were stretching the story out with all the filler stuff in the ""present"". If the show had just focused on his capture I may have enjoyed it more also I found the resistance from Worthington's management to be contrived. "
Long Riders!,"Oh man, that's nuts! I feel like it's so perfect. He is completely removed from the human emotion in that scene. This guy is breaking down about his brother being the Unabomber, and Worthington's character is saying what he knows he should say, but internally *thrilled* that his brother is the guy. One guy is seeing his world crash down around him, and the other is seeing everything he cares about come to fruition. That scene where he gets the letters from the family he is so oblivious to the way the family is perceiving him... as he drops down to dig into the box without even giving a shit about decorum. It communicated so many things about his character to me.

With the dialog in that episode I feel a lesser actor would have played up the buddy buddy aspect, but Worthington just doesn't give a shit because Fitzgerald *can't* give a shit. He gave up his wife. Who cares about this random dude sitting next to him? And the cold delivery of the attempt to sell this guy he did the right thing? It hues back perfectly to how he failed in the jail cell with the Unabomber. The guy has no charisma, just intelligence and quiet desire."
Long Riders!,Finally someone else gets it.
Long Riders!,I thought Ted was actually the strongest episode.
Long Riders!,"Yeah, I never really got the anti-Worthington backlash. People are to quick to complain about someone being overexposed. "
Long Riders!,"I really liked in him in this; hopefully he can aspire to more serious roles based on this. You know, I think the shy, beta male aspect you discussed in the OP is a good fit for him, as was the case in The Debt as well.  "
Long Riders!,I did too. They almost made me sympathize with the freaking Unamomber.
In Family We Trust,The girl wanted her dad buried but they were all eating him already lmao
In Family We Trust,The visual of Joel’s wristwatch prominently in the shot while he and Ellie reunited was cool.

In Family We Trust,"Was David sexually abusing the girls/women of his group? And was that why he had a ""violent heart"" even before the apocalypse?"
In Family We Trust,"Bella Ramsey is so good. And Pedro can be so menacing, the interrogation scene he was just oozing bloodlust."
In Family We Trust,“I made you eat your parents”
In Family We Trust,the actor for david did a great job
In Family We Trust,Reverend Rapey McCannibal is certainly a character I don't mind being killed off.
In Family We Trust,"Fucking amazing episode, even knowing what was going to happen my entire body was full tense the entire runtime"
In Family We Trust,She killed two dudes in the steak house and then set it a blaze. Nice of Ellie to leave the town a cooked meal on her way out.
In Family We Trust,I feel like a dumb bitch for taking until the reveal to understand that was who the dead guy was. I want to go back and watch 6 because on first watch the university gang looked like thugs and not the starving congregation we meet in 8.
In Family We Trust,"You think Troy Bakers character wanting to kill Elie was actually his way of saving her from all the torture he knew David wanted to do to her, and prevent her from being eaten/ abused?

Edit: something one of the comments by u/swordfiend said  really added to the dynamic: 

I just finished listening to the post epi podcast by niel druckmann, craig mazin, and troy baker for ep 8 and they said that James (troys character) has been completely indoctrinated and brainwashed by david and feels threatened by ellie and wants her dead. David pretty much is thrilled by Ellie because of her capacity for violence and wants to ‘own’ her as his pet at his side. I’d recommend giving that video a listen. They go deep in the psychology of these characters, which gave me a whole new appreciation for the episode."
In Family We Trust,"I’m seeing double here!

Four Joels!"
In Family We Trust,"""It's okay, baby girl. I got you.""

Oh my heart!!!"
In Family We Trust,"James' actor has such a cool voice. I think with a little bit of practice, he would make a decent voice actor."
In Family We Trust,"""Baby girl"" 🥺 

Gonna go weep brb"
In Family We Trust,"Woman: ""What is it?""

Man: ""It's venison.""

Me: ""That is 100% people."""
In Family We Trust,"That was hell of an episode, and it also improved my opinion on episode 6 with how they tied them together. Been a while since I played the game, but they managed to make David just a monster of a human in an hour. I continue to be impressed, and I'm both sad and excited for the season finale."
In Family We Trust,"Saved Joel, wiped out some cannibals, killed a pedophile, set the place on fire on the way out... Seems like a pretty good day, all things considered.

Shame about the horse, though."
In Family We Trust,"Just a random comment. I can't speak to the specific stab injury but I once had a very bad and untreated infection where I felt like I was dying - high fever, sweats/chills, etc. One stick in my butt cheek and I felt like a new man 24-hours later."
In Family We Trust,"For some reason I didn't remember who David was... until I saw the dinner.


Super creepy in the game, and they really captured that in this episode!"
In Family We Trust,"Indicative of David’s character - his plate was 4 times larger than everyone else’s

Edit - 4x’s the cannibalism"
In Family We Trust,"excellent episode, great writing and editing. the reveal that david knows what joel and ellie are up to is the same as the game, but here it felt much more insidious; david aaaallllmost comes across as authentic at that point, and the needle drop hits a little harder.

my only criticism is that the human stew looked a little too obviously fucked up lol"
In Family We Trust,Well that was exactly as harrowing as I remembered.
In Family We Trust,"""What's this?"" - ""Venison""

Me: ""Ight David and James came back already""

*David and James proceed to enter with actual venison when dinner is already served*"
In Family We Trust,"With one episode left, I just hope Joel gets to throw a bottle or brick to distract somebody at least once. It's practically one of his favorite hobbies."
In Family We Trust,[removed]
In Family We Trust,That moment you find out she's eating her dad.
In Family We Trust,"I teared up when Joel called Ellie, “baby girl.”"
In Family We Trust,I’d nit pick Joel’s recovery time if him going John Rambo wasn’t so fucking awesome
In Family We Trust,"Yo, when he stabbed that dude in the chest and he choked on his blood, dying eyes wide open, that shit was raw as fuck. They shot that death sequence horrifyingly, and exactly how I’d expect from a series that makes so much of how repulsive violence is; another good example of nailing the spirit of the games."
In Family We Trust,"""I believe  him"""
In Family We Trust,100% that kid’s dad was the ear
In Family We Trust,Oh yeah. That’s that shit I like right there
In Family We Trust,Lol in the behind the episode thing they showed that they actually yeeted some stunt double to the ground off a fake horse.
In Family We Trust,"They definitely made David creepy as fuck here and I've never been as uncomfortable as I was during that whole segment at the end.. he hints at how he really is, and for some reason it made it much scarier. The series is awesome for really creating a vibe and not being afraid to show the worst"
In Family We Trust,That was unbelievably intense. Bella Ramsey was incredible.
In Family We Trust,It's an interesting choice to not >!have Joel pull Ellie off in the middle of hacking David to death and move their reunion to outside after the deed is done!<
In Family We Trust,Little penicillin and that creepy preacher dude will be good as new
In Family We Trust,"On the one hand, I wish the season had a few more episodes.   
On the other, if this was `The Walking Dead` this one episode would've lasted a whole season 😬"
In Family We Trust,"How about Troy Baker getting to do some legit live action acting once again?! I hope he gets to do more stuff. He's still got it. 


Which is crazy but every time I was watching Dark on Netflix, I kept thinking one of the characters looked VERY reminiscent of him. Like maybe an English version of the show could be possible. I mean it doesn't have to happen as the show was perfectly fine the way it was...but just in case, I say use Baker for that certain role."
In Family We Trust,"Loved the ep, but a question: where were all the other people in the resort at the end there? One of their buildings was raging on fire. Wouldn’t others have come out to see what was going on? Or was that steakhouse in a separate area of their community? I was expecting more of the residents to come and cause more trouble, but they walked off at the end as if those few guys they killed were all there was when we saw at least 20 more people at the beginning."
In Family We Trust,"The vengeful passion of Joel trekking across the land with a stab wound to save Ellie after his enhanced interrogations culminating in “it’s okay baby girl” was absolutely perfect. 

One of my favorite quotes from another apocalyptic story is, “In an age of rust, she comes up stainless steel.” And damn if Joel and Ellie aren’t stainless steel survivors."
In Family We Trust,"I've really liked Bella Ramsey ever since episode 1, and only grown to appreciate her portrayal of Ellie more as the series goes on. I've still been skeptical of if she'd have the chops to take Ellie where her story goes in Part 2 when that gets adapted. 

Well, she just showed me what a fool I was to doubt. What an incredible, hard-edged performance."
In Family We Trust,"The guy brings chunks of bloody flesh in a bin to the cooks in the kitchen and they look at him and he says ""it's venison"".

(But in the next shot the deer is brought in whole through the front door). 

Ughhhhh."
In Family We Trust,Excuse me creepy preacher sir but I’d just like to confirm whether the mystery meat passes all the relevant food and safety regulations
In Family We Trust,I miss the two openings of the first two episodes.
In Family We Trust,"""you have a violent heart"" man they are really setting up for the 2nd game."
In Family We Trust,I counted 22 stabs…damn Ellie
In Family We Trust,Great episode overall. I wish they could’ve filmed one more episode just to spread out some of the story here at the end and let it breathe a little.
In Family We Trust,The conclusion to this episode felt strange. Where did the rest of the community go? Their town hall was burning down and nobody came to investigate? Why did they all just cease to exist? Anybody else think that was specifically kinda weird?
In Family We Trust,Absolutely perfect episode. David was an amazing monster in human form.
In Family We Trust,DAMN but is it ever a good thing Ellie wasn’t still holding that knife when Joel surprised her from behind 😳
In Family We Trust,Holy crap Bella was amazing in this ep. Wowza
In Family We Trust,If you’re gonna cook human meat at least sear it first instead of throwing it straight into the tomato sauce.
In Family We Trust,Nearly perfect adaptation of the Winter chapter of the game. That final scene gave me goosebumps even when I knew what was happening. Also how awesome was it to see Troy Baker in this? In happy for him.
In Family We Trust,"If anyone who didn't play the games is wondering what was different in the show, in the game, ellie and david have to fight off a large horde of infected and a bloater while waiting for that dude to come back with the drugs. Then both joel and ellie kill *a lot* more people in their respective parts. Ellie's escape is a lot more complex as the place she was held isn't the same place she fights david, but the gist of it was the same"
In Family We Trust,WHAT A FUCKIN EPISODE! A round of applause for Bella Ramsey and her acting abilities please? She absolutely nailed it tonight! Glad Joel is better and they got to reunite. Can't wait to see the finale next week!
In Family We Trust,Ahhhh stealth Joel with no gun kills really copying my playthrough
In Family We Trust,Great episode. Love how they explore how the apocalypse has changed some people with Joel torturing and killing those guys contrasted against how the apocalypse has allowed some people to be who they truly are like David.
In Family We Trust,"I’m curious what other people think: Do you suppose James and his crew wanted to go against orders and kill Ellie out of a thirst for revenge, or was it because at least a part of them knew that a bullet would be more merciful than what David had planned for her?"
In Family We Trust,"Anyone else notice James got the biggest plate of food, but also was just picking at it because he knew what it was?"
In Family We Trust,"With David, James and a number of other men in the village dead now, good chance the rest of the village is going to starve to death.

Chilling to think that even the death of bad guys means the death of innocents"
In Family We Trust,Where was everyone during the final confrontation? I mean the other members of the cult.
In Family We Trust,That is right behind episode 3 as the best of the series. Bella knocked it out of the park and David was a great one episode tyle villian.
In Family We Trust,[removed]
In Family We Trust,"I wonder how it would be to binge the show, for instance, being able to immediately watch this episode after the last episode which was entirely a flashback."
In Family We Trust,Fantastic episode. I love that Ellie killed video game Joel.
In Family We Trust,Ellie’s screams while hacking David are soooo chilling and real
In Family We Trust,"As a red head who teaches math named David I found this episode frustrating. The villian was too relatable in most regards /s 

Really enjoyed it overall and the above line is legit, but still well done."
In Family We Trust,"As someone who’s never played the game I feel like all the people who have played the game are being wildly harsh on things I am blissfully unaware of. I feel zero pacing issues, zero issues with the relationship that joel and Ellie have formed and the pacing thereof, zero qualms with the impact of the characters, etc. 

It’s hard to describe to folks that already know this whole story how much everything is absolutely working. Those folks have, in my eyes, the unfortunate perspective of having a video game to constantly compare this show to. To me, this show is the freshest take on a zombie apocalypse I’ve seen in ages, and am loving it."
In Family We Trust,"Part of me wishes Troy Baker would get the drop on Pedro Pascal screaming, ""there can be only one!"" but It was a good episode, and it was nice to see Troy Baker in a cameo."
In Family We Trust,"""you remind me of me"" wow fuck you David

What an awesome episode. Totally lived up to what my expectations were. Bella and Pascal are so good."
In Family We Trust,God fucking dammit. That episode was perfect...
In Family We Trust,That went by so fast
In Family We Trust,I wonder if David looks like a clicker now
In Family We Trust,Wow she fucked David UP! Little tiny pieces...
In Family We Trust,Pretty faithful to the game. Wish that David would have said the line of how is he supposed to explain his broken finger to everyone else. Then Ellie introduces herself.
In Family We Trust,"Another fire episode! Bella just knocking it out of the park as Ellie. 

We got a little glimpse of how Joel got things done back in the day.

The actor that played David did a good job, he was very creepy just as he was in the game.

It was cool to see Troy Baker in the show (he voiced Joel in the game).


I hope everyone ready for the season finale, because it's going to be crazy especially if it sticks to the game."
In Family We Trust,I wasn't sure how Bella as Ellie would turn out but she has killed it every episode so far.
In Family We Trust,The clinking silverware at the beginning of the episode.... *shudder*
In Family We Trust,"Fun seeing Troy's cameo on the show (more than a cameo, he had a decent sized roll here)  Im curious his thoughts on it"
In Family We Trust,"“It’s okay baby girl, I got you” I AM NOT OK"
In Family We Trust,"Holy fuck that episode was intense. There were so many incredible lines of dialogue in this episode too.

The final scene with Ellie in the dining hall literally had my jaw dropped. The emotion Bella showed as she killed the cannibal rapist preacher was next level. What an incredible actress.

I love how this show doesn't linger on side characters. They introduce them, somehow make us invested in just a few minutes and then move on. They don't spend half a season stuck in one QZ. They don't draw out things like Joel coming back from the stabbing. I absolutely love that about this show."
In Family We Trust,"the biggest twist from david for me its not that he is cannibal or creep r-----. But that he actually worship cordyceps all along, its his God, find god after apocalypse, etc."
In Family We Trust,"The final scene with Bella was fucking terrifying. I know she is a very capable actress, but I didn't think she was capable of channeling *that*. Damn impressive."
In Family We Trust,Fuck.
In Family We Trust,"Jesus, that was intense"
In Family We Trust,They somehow managed to make David creepier here than in the game.
In Family We Trust,"I thought it was weird that the fire did absolutely nothing the entire last scene.  Neither of the characters acted like there was a fire and they had a lot of fire cutaways like it was building to something.  After she got out I expected the fire to attract colonists, but they just walked away.  If everything was on fire just for the vibes I think it was done badly."
In Family We Trust,"I love that they focus on the more human element of these situations, it’s really a character driven program and you can’t have as much action as the game since it wouldn’t be realistic.

But damn after Joel dropped that “Don’t worry I believe him” line and just murdered the other dude, I’m not going to deny that I’d love to see more of Joel just being a badass out here."
Hashoter Hatov,Goddam Isaraelis thought they were all serious and shit
Hashoter Hatov,"Heh, apparently the Netflix show of the same name was based on this. "
Hashoter Hatov,"Yes!!! We sat and watched the opening sequence over and over, it was that funny!  Not to mention that the rest of the show is hilarious.  Anyone who refuses to watch it for political reasons is an idiot.  You're missing out!  Try it, you just might learn something in between catching your breath from laughing so hard."
Hashoter Hatov,"Hey Netflix!  We want the second season, with English subtitles, please!"
Hashoter Hatov,"Not just cops, but Israeli cops. Thanks I hate it."

Selection Day,"""...Maybe, just maybe, our accent can be a perspective, not a punchline..."" - Vir Das"
Selection Day,"Sweet. As an Indian American, I've loved the few Indian Originals they put out in the past. Brahman Naman was weird as hell but still pretty funny. And there was a female comic with the first name of Aditi, I think, and she was really good too. 

Never knew the word ""chadi"" existed....but I know now. "
Selection Day,Glad that Netflix is doing these. If only their subscription prices weren't twice the cable prices..
Selection Day,In which language will those be shot?
Selection Day,Netflix has been killing It this week 
Selection Day,"""3%"" is awesome"
Selection Day,"I think it's cool, but I wish there was a way to selectively hide them. I usually don't like live action shows from foreign countries, but I enjoy anime and kung fu/samurai movies. I'd just like to be able to hide some stuff like Korean dramas from cluttering up my personal list."
Selection Day,Aditi Mittal
Selection Day,Where the heck do you live that prices for cable are $5 usd?
Selection Day,Hinglish. Code-switching between Hindi and English.
Selection Day,"Yeah their interface is a mess, there are movies that are in every category, and some others that are hidden. I wish they were more organized with the library."

I loved her humor because it was so different in style from what we hear from Asian comedians in the West which ultimately boil down to jokes about being immigrants or children of immigrants. "
Selection Day,India Probably
Selection Day,"Netflix is quite expensive in India. The two closest competitors, Hotstar and Amazon Prime, cost Rs. 200 per month and Rs 500 *per year* (seriously). Netflix is 650/pm for the HD, 2 screen plan. I have no idea how much cable costs because I don't pay for it but it's dirt cheap, really. "

Selection Day,hey atleast it not one those cricketer biopic 
Selection Day,haha but it still looks good though 
Selection Day,Yet another?
Selection Day,The OA cancelation made me not too happy.

- 7th The Woman in the House Across the Street from the Girl in the Window

- 9th Unorthodox

- 10th Black Mirror (S1-S2 are from Channel 4, S3-S5 are Netflix Original)

My watchlist (what I'm going to watch next): Ozark, Inside Job, Godless."
Selection Day,No love for the Mike Flanagan shows?
Selection Day,"I think Netflix has really become disappointing in recent years. When they first got into original programming, they would develop these really amazing shows that were unlike anything else on television. But ever since they cancelled Sense8, they have started premiering more average programming. 

My favorite Netflix originals:

1. Bojack Horseman: Became one of my all-time favorite shows rather quickly and really revolutionised for me what adult animation can do. 6 almost flawless seasons and I think it should have gone one for 1-2 more seasons.
2. Orange Is The New Black: I am generally a huge fan of shows with female leads, and this was really one groundbreaking and entertaining show. I feel like its impact and popularity is almost forgotten by now, but I think it was one of the shows that really defined what streaming could do. I also think it found a great ending. 
3. Sense8: This was not a perfect show, but a beautiful concept, connecting people from different backgrounds and promoting international friendships, which few shows do. Additionally, it was pretty amazing to actually see a show shoot in all these different locations all over the world.
4. Glow: Again, I really love female-centred shows and this was no exception. Great performances by a great cast all around.
5. Russian Doll: Same as Orange Is The New Black or Bojack Horseman, I think Russian doll really drives home the fact that streaming services like Netflix can tell different stories from traditional outlets.
6. Tuca and Bertie: It died too sun on Netflix, but thank god it was revived on Adult Swim. Different enough from Bojack Horseman to stand on its own, but sharing a lot of the same sensibilities that made Bojack fun.
7. The OA: Again, this is not a perfect show for me, but what I really loved about this show was how different it was from your usual fare and how different the story was told. It felt more like a good book than a TV series, which many streaming series aspire to, but really actually achieve in doing.
8. Dead to Me: This show is not as great as many of the others, but the chemistry of the two leads is iressistible.
9. Stranger Things: A little bit overhyped, but creative.
10. Jessica Jones: My favorite of the Marvel shows. (Actually the only one I watched more than one season of.)"

Selection Day,Iweather you have or have not watched bojack I urge you to reconsider
Selection Day,">When They See Us

One of the hardest shows to watch. Damn I felt bad for them."
Selection Day,Dark should be top this list
Selection Day,"There are a lot more Netflix originals that I really like that unfortunately didn't make the list: Unorthodox, Mindhunter, The Queen's Gambit, Quicksand (Störst av allt), Unbelievable, Altered Carbon, Sintonia, Bridgerton, Easy etc.  
  
Also, as for other acquired/co-produced content that I chose to not put on the list: Alias Grcae, Kalifat, Parfum, La Casa de Papel, La cocinera de Castamar, Crash Landing on You etc. are all great television.  
  
*But anyways, since this is a pm\_me\_reason\_to\_livx list, ya kno what I gotta do....*

Here are my specific praises for shows on this list:  
  
**Best concept** — Sense8 \[runner-up: - Squid Game\]  
  
**Best storytelling** — D.P. \[runner-up: - Desenfrenadas\]

Selection Day,OITNB is great. I watched the first 4 seasons.
Selection Day,[deleted]
Selection Day,I see you haven’t watched bojack horseman in my opinion that is the best Netflix original
Selection Day,What's going on with that Master of None write up?
Selection Day,[deleted]
Selection Day,"Thanks, cool list! Some shows I havent heard before"
Selection Day,I would say that Babylon Berlin and BoJack Horseman are the best.
Selection Day,"Way late to this post but definitely recommend “the last kingdom” one of their best shows, just finished its last season and then will end with a movie. Also the show “russian doll” had a fantastic s1 and returns for s2 in 1 day, highly recommend that one as well, very quick watch too because it’s 30m episodes and only 8 per season."
Selection Day,"Maid, Unbelievable and Mindhunter."
Selection Day,I loved Hemlock Grove.
Selection Day,"Lilyhammer was so good. But unfortunately it was cancelled too soon, the show does not have an ending :("
Selection Day,I like The Haunting of Hill House a lot.
Selection Day,"I've seen everyone of those besides Between, Helix and Cobra Kai. And I'm almost sure they're not Netflix originals."
Selection Day,Bloodline season 1 was one of the best seasons of television I’ve ever seen. Unfortunately season 2 killed it and 3 buried it in an unmarked grave. Should have been a limited series.
Selection Day,It's the reason why I haven't given it a rewatch yet. I just can't bare all that pain again.
Selection Day,Ah feel ya. *But Desenfrenadas tho*.
Selection Day,[deleted]
Selection Day,"You know, 100+ Netflix series yet I've never actually seen House of Cards. lol. I must acknowledge it though because it's one of the most popular Netflix OGs. But personally, politics? Big *naaaaaaah* for me."
Selection Day,Because it's bad
Selection Day,I've watched Bojack Horseman.
Selection Day,"*I don't know what they want from me, it's like... the more money we come across, the more problems we seeeeee!*"
Selection Day,"lol, this comment. check some out tho."
Selection Day,"One of the first chopping block regrets, but not the last"
Selection Day,Between and Cobra Kai are Netflix originals. Helix is a cancelled Syfy series.
Selection Day,I never plan to rewatch it. Ain't going through that again.
Selection Day,"Yea I've seen Marco Polo. The closest thing to it I guess is Kingdom. Vikings Vanhalla is close to that time period as well, but I think it's *where* Marco Polo is set that makes it unique and not *when*."
Selection Day,Man the first season is peak television
Selection Day,"Great list----there are only six of the shows you listed, including Desafrenadas, that I've never heard of, but they definitely sound worth checking out because of your descriptions of them. Here's a couple of faves of mine on Netflix, some of which I didn't finish before they got taken off, and some I haven't finished yet, along with one I'd like to see, and haven't seen yet:

1.The Protector----a Turkish fantasy-thriller that lasted four seasons, with 10 half-hour episodes for each season. It's about a young guy who runs a shop with his father, who discovers after a tragedy that he's been chosen as the Protector, and that he's part of an ancient people with superpowers who fight the demons, called the Immortals, that are trying to take over the world. I've seen only one season so far, but it was pretty good, and fun to see a fantasy action series with a Turkish take on it.

2. Paranormal--- Netflix's second Middle Eastern series (after their first one, a Jordanian series called Jinn, which lasted one season). It's set in 1960s Egypt (where it was actually shot, because it's based on a popular series of horror books by an Egyptian author, Ahmed Tawfik.) It's about a hemotologist and college professor named Refaat Ismail who finds himself literally haunted by ghosts from his past, even tough he dosen't believe in the supernatural. He also finds himself caught up in a whirlwind of curses and supernatural terror anyway soon after he comes in contact with a mummy that he winds up stealing to de-curse it, along with another man who's trying to stop the mummy from cursing everything else around it. He, the dude trying to do the un-curses, and his crush, another professor named Maggie, wind up going to the desert, being chased by demon creatures and haunted by other things. Really fun and lively old-school show, only six episodes. It's supposed to get a second season later this year---I enjoyed the first season, so looking forward to the second.

Liked three of the Marvel shows----Luke Cage, Jessica Jones, and Daredevil---but my laptop conked out the same week all three shows were leaving Netflix for Disney Plus and I didn't get a chance to finish watching them, lol.

La Reina del Sur---a Mexican drama about a woman who winds up on the run after her drug dealer boyfriend is murdered to another country, where she winds up being too close to some more major drug and trying to keep her head above water. This long-running popular telenovela inspired a reboot of the series back around 2017, I believe, and an American version of the show called Queen of the South. It's very exciting and action-packed all way."
Selection Day,"Cobra Kai wouldnt count for this list because the first season aired on youtube, i think"
Selection Day,"For real-----even though I'm old enough to recall when the real case jumped off back in the day, and even after seeing the Ken Burns documentary that finally told the Central Five's side of their stories---When They See Us, which was very well made, was still difficult as hell for me to watch, knowing that these young boys--which is exactly all they were, no matter how demonized and hatefully stigmatized they were at the time, mainly because they were black---were going to jail and put through literal hell for a crime none of them committed. Yeah, they survived, but some of them still bear the scars of what they went through, and what it took to survive that, even today.

The second youngest of the Exonerated Five, as they now are able to call themselves, Yuself Salaam, wrote a book last year about his experiences called Bitter, Not Better: Living In The Pursuit Of Racial Justice, that's worth reading. Here's a review of it: [One Of The Falsely Accused Five Tells His Story](https://www.npr.org/2021/05/18/997792060/in-better-not-bitter-one-of-the-central-park-five-tells-his-own-story)"
Selection Day,Actually a better comparison is Medici as a historical drama about real life characters and one I notice often gets left out of these discussions
Selection Day,"I'm just saying that Cobra Kai is a Netflix original, I did  not say that Cobra Kai counts for OP list. It doesn't count because OP is excluding Netflix originals that did not start on Netflix, like Black Mirror."
Selection Day,"Sure, just wanted to clarify that you guys seem to be operating under different definitions"
Selection Day,"Not really, he said that those three shows are not Netflix originals, which is incorrect."
Selection Day,"Post more threads like this for sure. Always fun to read about some of the lesser known and hyped shows that are due in 2023. I was aware of some of these shows but I had no idea stuff like Mrs Davis and The Consultant were in the works. 

You do a decent job of selling all the shows on that list and that is often more than can be said for the distributors themselves!"
Selection Day,"This is really cool, I've seen some of these where the ""why you should be excited"" section didn't do much but you made me genuinely excited to watch a lot of these, thank you!"
Selection Day,The Curse is going to be fucking bonkers but it's going to be on Showtime so I won't ever see it
Selection Day,Warrior season 3 HBO Max
Selection Day,"There's a non-zero chance that Brit Marling's show is actually season 3 of The OA in disguise, knowing how creative she is."
Selection Day,"Fantastic write up, love the format. Already knew about many of these, but the 'Why should I be excited?' would for sure sell me on these shows otherwise. Specially the mention of showrunners, writers, and directors and previous shows, since is really common for people to look for new shows based on previous ones they've liked.

I personally I'm most excited for **The Fall of the House of Usher**, as a Flanagan superfan that recently watched **Midnight Mass** and loved every second of it and **Retreat**, ever since **The OA** cancellation my heart longs for more Brit and Zal storytelling.

I'll add **The Consultant**, **Mrs. Davis** and **The Curse** to my list, all seem like great projects."
Selection Day,Interesting that there's no mention on IMDB or the show's poster that Shogun is an adaptation of an incredibly popular book by James Clavell. You would think they'd want to let people know to draw in that audience
Selection Day,Woah the guy who made counterpart is making a shogun adaption?? Holy fuck I am extremely excited for that. Counterpart is one of the coolest shows I’ve ever seen and definitely the most unique spy thriller show.
Selection Day,Well now im interested in Time bandits
Selection Day,Nice to see a list that isn't just posting all the blockbuster shows
Selection Day,The ending to the time bandits movie was so messed up it still bothers me to this day ever time I think about it.
Selection Day,Most interesting is mrs davis
Selection Day,Really looking forward to the Apple + shows.  Mrs American Pie and Time Bandits.
Selection Day,"I started watching Willow and was thinking how cool it would be to have a Time Bandits TV series, so happy to see it on the list. The rest of the shows don't really interest me much at this stage, going by the descriptions. Could be some gems in there but nothing I can see right now.

Thanks for posting though."
Selection Day,"Not excited by any of those, but thanks for the post.

Hopefully something piques my interest in the next one.

I have almost nothing to watch at the moment and struggling to find new stuff."
Selection Day,"Or I can not access the streaming service or I dont have that service or Is not interesting enough. Or all reasons to once in the mayority of times.

But your work is interesting."
Selection Day,Looking forward to Shogun. Anything with Samurai Warriors & Japanese Culture intrigue me.
Selection Day,"Echo (Disney+) 

Agatha: Coven of Chaos (Disney+)"
Selection Day,"> Shōgun, set in feudal Japan, charts the collision of two ambitious men from different worlds and a mysterious female samurai.

That... Is not the plot of ""Shogun"""
Selection Day,None of these sound interesting.
Selection Day,How about some foreign shows?
Selection Day,"Great, more of the same shitty shows for white, middle-aged, alcoholic moms."
Selection Day,Only the curse sounds great on paper
Selection Day,"They pretty much all sound good, but really excited for retreat, shogun and the curse because of whose attached"
Selection Day,I try to keep on top of new stuff but there's a couple of things I'd not heard of that I'll likely read more about/check out
Selection Day,Only one I knew about was House of Usher. I'll definitely check out the shows from ''Servant'' and ''The OA''s creators as well as the one from Lindelof.
Selection Day,Honestly I had never heard about any of these shows before reading this. Definitely looking forward to a few of them.
Selection Day,"If Damon Lindelof hadn't already sold me on Mrs Davis, ""Betty Gilpin as a nun battling artificial intelligence"" definitely did"
Selection Day,Agreed. Excellent thread and now I have shows to be excited for. I’m pumped.
Selection Day,"To be fair, most of those shows just haven't started their marketing campaign. The important thing for the distributors is that people know about it when it releases."
Selection Day,"Same. As someone who loves House Hunters International *and* Emma Stone, I feel like this show was basically made for me but I have no clue if Showtime is even a thing here? And if not, where can I watch it?"
Selection Day,It's really not that hard to watch a show on a channel you don't have c'mon.
Selection Day,Paramount+ and Amazon Prime have deals on Showtime frequently. If you have Prime go sign up for their 1.99 a month Black Friday deal and watch Yellowjackets. At least if you're in the USA.
Selection Day,"Please God, I'd do anything for this"
Selection Day,we can only hope.
Selection Day,It was evil.

Instant Hotel,"I'm frankly shocked that Breaking Bad hasn't been listed yet. It was one of the greatest pilots ever, it just hooks you, is well paced, and frankly a fully watchable standalone piece of work itself. Usually I hate pilots, because they get bogged down in exposition, but, Breaking Bad's was so well paced. 

Definitely agree with Fargo on there. I watched it the first week, with some skepticism if they could do justice to the movie, and it absolutely blew me away. "
Instant Hotel,The Last Man on Earth's pilot is in the pantheon of comedy television episodes.
Instant Hotel,"The Walking Dead's pilot was *fantastic*. Rick's descent down the stairs in the dark using matches to light his path still stresses me out. Also, rewatching the pilot after becoming accustomed to zombie apocalypse survivor Rick is pretty mind blowing. ""I'm sorry that this happened to you"" and ""we don't kill the living!"" are just so out of his character now."
Instant Hotel,"Downton Abbey's Premiere is probably the best pilot I've ever seen.

I also really liked the color scheme and how dark and gritty it is, and how gritty the show was with fights etc, while still being serious and not totally over the top.

Instant Hotel,Oh man I rewatched it  like 2/3 years ago (amazing to see it on TV in Spain) and it felt even better than when I used to watch it with my parents.
Instant Hotel,"I wouldn't say it went downhill quickly.

Season 1 was fantastic. Season 2 was one of the best seasons of any show ever. The first few episodes of Season 3 were the peak of the show, with 'Exodus Pt 2"" being the show's best episode. Also, the Season 3 finale was insane. 

Season 4 was easily the weakest season but even that had some great moments. See episodes ""Revelations"", ""The Hub"", The ""Oath""/""Blood on the Scales"".

BSG did season finales and mid-season finales better than just about any show, if you give them a break for the long stretches people had to wait between seasons.

I do agree that the last 30 minutes of the series finale was dogshit though. I don't care what anyone says, I hated it and it let me down.

I still love the show though, and despite the finale it was one of the best TV experiences I've ever had.

Murder Mountain,I wouldn't hold Murder Mountain in the same regard as the four titles in this list that I have seen. Actually thats a lie it btfo of Amanda Knox.  That does not belong in a list alongside Ken Burn's Vietnam and the Fog of War. Will have to check out the rest of those titles thanks for the submission!
Murder Mountain,Ok
Murder Mountain,"Thanks for posting this. I know there are discussion threads for the episodes/ show, but this take was so special and unique that it really did deserve its own thread."
Murder Mountain,"> But until then, I'll skip it.

Yeah we will see you next weekend."
Murder Mountain,">Which is odd...I am after all a fantasy nerd. Dragons, magic, sword and sorcery...these are all my jam.

Ah I am not really that big into fantasy (with some exceptions) I think it's the drama that got me into GOT and HOTD.

>The answer is simple. The plot. There isn't one. 

It's about who will be Viserys' heir.

>What motivates Daemon Targaryen?

Daemon wants to be King and marry Rhaenyra. He wants to be as influential as Aegon the conqueror and bring the Kingdom back to the glory of its past.

>What does Alicent Hightower want?

Freedom to choose. Her character hasn't developed up to other goals yet but that's important as her father has given her little agency. Now Otto is gone we should see her develop her views in what she wants.

>What kind of a ruler does Rhanyra want to be?

Right now she is focusing on the idea of actually managing to become a ruler first.

Did you ask this of Joffrey? Cersei? Jon? Daenerys? Tommen? It wasn't always clear until they became King/Queen.

>There is no reason to follow or root for any of the characters, because they're all dull and one dimensional. There is a two year time jump between episodes 2 and 3, which is only apparent if one observes a particular baby within the show, because none of the other characters go through any change in behaviour or attitude like a normal person would. 

Okay this is a fair point. Little seems to change between such large jumps in time.

>Let me now demonstrate a few instances of poor writing. The Crabfeeder is set up to be this formidable opponent, that our heroes are unable to vanquish despite having dragons. Dragons! And the reasoning? The Crabfeeder and his troupe hide in the caves and crevices in the mountains when the dragons are around. One would think that this is a great chance to make some TFC (Tandoori Fried Crabfeeder) given that dragonfire is hot enough to melt iron. But no, we need to give Daemon Targaryen a moment of heroism, as he takes down an entire army of opponents under the deceit of surrender, armed with just a sword and plot armour. 

Episode 3 was the weak point of the series. I was not a fan of how the Crabfeeder storyline was handled at all. It felt very cartoony. Episode 4 felt like a major jump in quality."
Murder Mountain,imagine writing game of thrones off in the first 4 episodes
Murder Mountain,Your boring take isn't changing minds.
Murder Mountain,no one care about you
Murder Mountain,"Honestly? I agree with you, but you're exaggerating.

Crabfeeder especially was done extremely poorly. But most of the characters are pretty damn interesting and layered. Are you really going to claim Viserys and Daemon are one dimensional? Seriously? 

I do agree that the writing doesn't feel as strong as GoT, but it's still better than 90% of the shows made today. Couple that with amazing production value and that's a combination you simply don't see.

If you put your standards that high you might as well as not watch any show at this point. Not every single show can be Breaking Bad, or Succession, or the early GoT.

HotD is ATLEAST an 8/10 at worst and that alone makes it an absolute worthy experience to check out. If you somehow are watching shows so much better than HotD then please, I would love some recommendations lol.

You watch to see actually bad writing? Check out Netflix's stuff. People raved about Strange Things S4 and it had absolutely atrocities writing. That's the normal standard of quality we have these days."
Murder Mountain,"> Strange Things S4 

> absolutely atrocities writing.

You couldn't back that up in a debate."
Murder Mountain,"Well maybe atrocious was a little hard, but it's just the most 5/10 writing and dialogues I've ever seen. Just generic Netflix quality, not more. I recently watched the Better Call Saul season as well so the difference in quality especially jumped out to me. Stuff lile BSC, Succession etc are on such another tier of quality that most Netflix stuff, including Stranger Things, just feel ridiculously average."
Murder Mountain,"The number of people ITT who are upset *their* favorite show wasn’t on someone else’s entirely subjective list is a perfect microcosm of why /r/television and /r/movies kinda suck. You don’t need to be offended this guy liked other shows more. *Your* favorite is still *your* favorite.

OP took the time to write some pretty decent reviews for the shows, and even brought a few to my attention I hadn’t heard of that sound great. The Newsreader in particular.  There is no need to downvote this post"
Murder Mountain,"I thought I watched a lot of tv this year but I didn't see even one of these shows. Most I have not even heard of.

Best show of the year? Dopesick, Succession, Mare of Easttown."
Murder Mountain,"I'm always impressed by how varied your TV watching seems to be. I don't know how you have the time or the ability (access wise) to watch so many shows, especially international ones, but that's cool. Some of these sound really cool."
Murder Mountain,"surprised heike monogatari is only 13. feels like it should be much higher with the amazing work they did on humanizing the various characters. Especially the struggles and decisions made by tokuko and the motivations behind them.

the production also did a fantastic job accurately depicting the historical setting. the beautiful and ugly. the luxury of the elite and the devastation endured by regular people. The social obligations and expectations everyone has to navigate and deal with. especially women.

the show is also not just aesthetically japanese or historically japanese but extremely culturally japanese. Especially the ending.

---

i really liked wonder egg priority and it was the perfect show for me up until episode 7. the beautiful art and amazing animation and fun characters along with tackling the difficult topic of suicide was really nice and meaningful.

But then I felt like it dropped the ball and focused on things that were antithetical to the topic of suicide. a focus on sci-fi for the sake of sci-fi instead of the raw reality that modern life is fucked for a lot of people.

the intentionality changed and with it, i felt like it ruined the show. >!(people killing themselves from their own volition as opposed to due to the machinations of a spooky AI daughter ghost out for revenge)!<

will check out blindspotting tho! nice list"

I’ve got Reservation Dogs, Maid, The Serpent, Anna, and Wonder Egg Priority on my watchlist already and have heard good things about all of them. 

I’m intrigued enough by the descriptions to add The Newsreader, Eden, Delete Me, and Sonny Boy to my watchlist. Hopefully they pop up,in my region at some point as I think of the bunch only Sonny Boy is available to me right now."
Murder Mountain,"Not only did you put *Wonder Egg Priority* above *Odd Taxi*, you also put it at number 4 and the highest ranked anime. Furthermore, *Ousama-ranking* is missing as well (and presumably below *Wonder Egg Priority* according to this list). I can't comment on most of the other shows, because I haven't seen them, but the anime ranked on this is extremely sus. Of course everyone can have their own opinions, but with *Wonder Egg Priority* having such an awful ending even ignoring ep 13 (imo), I cannot see how it deserves to be above literally every other anime this year, let alone 4th among *all* shows this year. Among anime, also strange is *Horimiya* that high. It's actually one of my favorite manga because it's a nice wholesome read, but it quickly devolves into being quite generic after the strong start. I cannot see how it belongs at 19, let alone above *Odd Taxi*.

Also I admit I'm a fanboy of the show, but *Arcane* missing from the list is extremely suspect. It is the most nominated show at the Annies for a reason, getting a nomination count equal to Disney productions even though it was almost completely unknown (outside the LoL fanbase) before its release. Even if the story and characters are deemed just par, the technical component of the show alone should push it to a spot in a top 25 show of the year list. Also suspect is *Succession* missing, but you did mention elsewhere that you have yet to see it.

I appreciate the well written out thoughts on your top 25, I just think it's a really bizarre ranking. I will try to check out some of the shows you listed, some of them sound really interesting, so thanks for that."

What did you think of the list? Are there any shows you think that should be there that isn't (or vice-versa)? Any shows you think are ranked too high/too low?

**My overall thoughts on 2021 television**: Somehow I found more great shows this year than any other year... but none quite on the level of the top shows from 2020 or 2019 (*...does that make sense?*). There were a lot of bad endings, and quite a few shows on my list had inescapable downsides. But still I haven't seen everything I wanted to see this year as yet (Dopesick, My Name, Yellowjackets etc.), and maybe I'll update this list at the end of January if anything else stands out.

p.s. I'd like to give a shout out to @jramjee on twitter. Because of him I got access to a lot of inaccessible foreign TV shows. And also @L21sMa who took time out of his limited free time to do ~~some~~... in fact *a lot of* writing and editing for me. ❤️"
Murder Mountain,Yellowjackets?
Murder Mountain,I need to see Dopesick. Mare of Easttown was never going to be on this list. lol.
Murder Mountain,"Okay firstly, sorry for the late reply to this. 

I had my issues with Heike. I don't think Heike laid out it's story (the genpai war) in a way that people not already familiar with it can fully understand. It's an anime for people already familiar with it (*which makes sense since the Japanese literally learn about the genpai wars in high school*). 

But don't misunderstand me now, even though I had my issues with it skipping pass (not animating) key moments the way it does, I still think it's a fantastic series and fully appreciate it. I mean... I watch over 60-70 new shows this year... so #13 is no small feat. 

> i really liked wonder egg priority and it was the perfect show for me up until episode 7. the beautiful art and amazing animation and fun characters along with tackling the difficult topic of suicide was really nice and meaningful.

> But then I felt like it dropped the ball and focused on things that were antithetical to the topic of suicide. a focus on sci-fi for the sake of sci-fi instead of the raw reality that modern life is fucked for a lot of people.

I agree... and disagree. I mean I don't want to go deep into Wonder Egg Priority post-episode 7 (which in true anime fashion introduced new ideas for the prospect of a big '*good vs evil*' final battle scene, that ultimately we didn't because of production issues), but as I said in another reply WEP accomplished what it needed to by said 7th episode... and it was incredibly impactful (*at least for me*), and nothing that came after (*as bad as it may or may not have been*) diminished that for me.

WEP was easily my #1 of 2021. And for all the reasons you meantion, ended up at #4 instead. But I'd also like to point out that I didn't just consider plot when making this list, so whatever shortcomings it may have developed in that department, to me it still had some of the best animation design, visuals, soundtrack and concept I've seen all of this year."
Murder Mountain,Why?
Murder Mountain,Stick to Vampire Diaries
Murder Mountain,"😐 .... but... why? 

I'm actually curious since for some reason you got unvoted. 😅"
Murder Mountain,Damn... I can't believe I found someone else besides me and Luis who watched Thunder in My Heart and Threesome. lol.
Murder Mountain,-*raises glass and nods in approval*-
Murder Mountain,"Okay, great reply! Answering this will be challenging but let's see if I can explain my decision making here. lol. 

First off, nothing is *suspect*, it's just my opinion, honestly. 

> Not only did you put Wonder Egg Priority above Odd Taxi, you also put it at number 4 and the highest ranked anime.

Wonder Egg Priority was actually my #1 show of 2021 before I watch that underproduced ending (*I actually saw it very late too, and read a few comments about the production issues they had*). But despite the unfortunate ending I didn't discard what came before. For me, it's still one of the most impactful and beautiful anime I've ever seen. And honestly, I feel like everything the anime needed to accomplished, it already did by the 7th episode. So it wasn't something that needed a great ending to be significant... it already was. The ending was really just to wrap-up the story. Some viewers put a lot of weight on ending, almost to the point where a great show is now a bad one if it doesn't have a satisfying one, but I don't.

> Among anime, also strange is Horimiya that high. It's actually one of my favorite manga because it's a nice wholesome read, but it quickly devolves into being quite generic after the strong start. I cannot see how it belongs at 19, let alone above Odd Taxi.

ODDTAXI is ranked below Horimiya because of visuals tbh. Plot-wise, Odd Taxi is far superior, but remember, I'm not just considering plot, I'm also considering production design, soundtrack, cinematography etc. (also why Wonder Egg Priority is ranked so high). 

> I will try to check out some of the shows you listed, some of them sound really interesting, so thanks for that.

Yea, you're welcome. Recommending shows is always my main reason for posting these listicles."
Murder Mountain,"I loved Invincible so much that even though it wasn't the more unique or creative thing... and even though I was very underwhelmed by the art-style, it still made the list. 

As for Arcane, [well............](https://c.tenor.com/9pxLR-8u5z4AAAAC/homer-simpson-hiding.gif)

I haven't seen Ranking of Kings. 

And I'm the biggest Attack on Titan fan but as you can see I'm not very open to adding returning shows to my end of year lists."
Murder Mountain,"Invincible was my nr 1 show this year. I had no expectations going in, I had not read the comics. And I was absolutely blown away."
Murder Mountain,I haven't seen the new season yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet! 😩
Murder Mountain,Ted Lasso anybody?
Murder Mountain,I have no interest in checking out the U.S. remake of Scenes from a Marriage tbh. But Yellowjackets is already on my list of course. I'll see with The Shrink Next Door too.

That's suppose to be a good thing. Check them out. 

> Also, where's Succession?

Murder Mountain,No wonder I haven't seen any of the shows you consider top of 2021. Obviously we have vastly different tv preference.
Murder Mountain,"can not believe you got downvoted for not liking mare of red herrings. kate winslet must have had a sore back after carrying that piece of shit tv show. your list is very interesting btw, definitely gonna check some of these out"
Murder Mountain,"ended up watching blindspotting and it was everything you described and more. really really great show and solid recommendation.

Murder Mountain,Nordic shows are great
Murder Mountain,Uhhhhh... it doesn't have to be *that* vast. lol. I just found Mare of Easttown to be very unoriginal tbh. Great performances though.
Murder Mountain,"I did [a review of Mare](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/npc6zj/great_performances_and_characters_saves_mare_of/) basically saying the same thing. Kate carried that show, there was just... noting else to it besides the character work and acting."
Murder Mountain,"Awww.. THANK YOU! 😄💕 

It makes me happy that you watch it and even happier than you enjoyed it. 

It seems like you actually *got it*. And that's nice to see because not everyone does. I remember me and this other TV critic friend of mine agreeing that it was easily one of the best shows we'd seen for the year (and we rarely agree on anything), but the reaction from imdb and a lot of the comments here didn't think so. It's creativity, and I guess the point of it all, really just flew over their heads. 

You're the 2nd person who've watched it from my recommendation and loved it, so thank you. hehe. 

But anyways, you seem to be an anime fan, so if you could recommend me a few anime similar to Heike or Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day I'd appreciate it."
Murder Mountain,"Uhh, no, not yet but plan to."
Murder Mountain,"Hmm, animes similar to Heike are probably 

- Angolmois: Record of Mongol Invasion

- Vinland Saga

for the historical perspective. But they're much more ""anime"". Other stuff by Science Saru is also usually just ""good"" though. Like 

- Eizouken ni wa Te wo Dasu na!

---

honorable mention goes to 

- Mars Red

for being different and interesting. The CGI is pretty rough though but it's also based on a Japanese historical period. (Taisho era). And focuses around the corruption of the japanese military, and vampires. lol. It's based on a stage play that's sort of an adaptation on Salomé by Oscar Wilde."
Murder Mountain,"Plot can be mundane, but realistic world building is top, you know, like Scandi series often do, like ""Akta Manniskor""."
Murder Mountain,Thanks a lot. It's been so long since I asked I thought you forgot. 😅💕
Murder Mountain,I havent seen Akta either but I know what you're talking about. lol.

Murder Mountain,"This show has my favorite fights on TV.  They are so fun and over the top.  They remind me a lot of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""."
Murder Mountain,"Season 1, they built a world with a very scant budget. They really focused on the characters and the emotional conflicts but still had great fight scenes. S2 they expanded the world and the mythology and got very personal with the conflicts and had better fight scenes with a bit bigger budget. S3 looks to out do GoT on a comparatively much smaller budget. Hats off to the prop and set designers. And the fight scenes are the best Iv'e ever seen on TV. Great show. Just go with it."
Murder Mountain,That sounds amazing! Is it based on any prior properties?
Murder Mountain,"I watched the first two seasons on netflix and I agree...

Its fucking weird, but entertaining. There are so many issues with the show it kinda just blurs together into a weird melange of genres. They don't stop enough to do any worldbuilding which is probably for the best so there isn't room to poke holes in the setting and they keep trucking forward.

I think Quinn was the most amusing character on the show, his descent into batshit insanity was played great by Martin Csokoas. "
Murder Mountain,"I have never seen this show, but I saw ""Spoiler"" all over the post and decided to take the dive and read your post, and goddamn.  Now I REALLY want to watch this!  Thanks!"
Murder Mountain,"> The main **villain** is a woman named the Widow

How *dare* you.

Team Widow forever."
Murder Mountain,"If you want to see an example of style AS somethings substance, this show is a good example. That being said, the dialogue is painfully bad sometimes. Most of the times. Always. But I can get over it because the action and style is too damn fun, honestly!"
Murder Mountain,"I walked in on my dad watching this show and was like, ""uhh, what are you watching?""

""Oh, its a post apocalyptic, steam punk, kung fu show""

""Oh, ok Dad, have fun"""
Murder Mountain,It's awesome.
Murder Mountain,I've watched it and I'm up to date. The budget feels bigger this season. But I'm on and off about some of the FX quality. 
Murder Mountain,This and Ash Vs. Evil Dead were my two favorite shows on television. I just hope Into the Badlands doesn't get cancelled.
Murder Mountain,Season 1 & 2 are on Netflix.  I didn't realize season 3 started so I have been watching from the beginning on and off lately.
Murder Mountain,Dinosaurs. 
Murder Mountain,This sounds like a trash fire and yet I desperately want to see it... I admit Nick Frost helped.
Murder Mountain,"I read online when it first released that its loosely based on journey to the west. Which is a 16 century chinese novel about demons and how to expel them iirc. I like into the badlands. Haven't missed a show which is strange for me because I rarely watch tv and hardly ever get involved with series. The mix of kungfu, steampunk, religious iconography and opium makes for quite an interesting and bizarre show"
Murder Mountain,"Every person I have shown this show to has fell in love. I have watched the first season about 4-5 times now, just to show people how awesome it is."
Murder Mountain,"I fucking love this show, and I don't get how the super-powered monks are way better at being Iron Fist than Danny Rand in the actual Iron Fist show.

I was 100%on board from the start and its only gotten both more ridiculous and more entertaining "
Murder Mountain,American Gods? 
Murder Mountain,I love this show.  It's completely insane and ridiculous but so entertaining.  Great fight scenes.  The Widow is one of the most badass characters I can think of.
Murder Mountain,You just convinced me to watch this show.   I love off the rails shows.
Murder Mountain,Been on it since episode #1 ... This show is amazing!
Murder Mountain,"Its now the best show on TV since AshVsEvilDead got cancelled.

I wish their was more over the top absurdist stuff - the gritty realism nonsense is utterly boring.
"
Murder Mountain,"Watching it, it's awesome and unique but trying to communicate about it and I keep slipping between AMC's Into The Badlands and MTV's The Sword of Shannara.

Very much gorn, though for some that's not an issue. I enjoy it but my gf would never make it through a few episodes."
Murder Mountain,I love it for some weird reason
Murder Mountain,Haha the show is a bit crazy and has ups and downs. But it is super unique and if your a kung fu fan it is worth a watch. Even just for the first season. 
Murder Mountain,"All I know is that if you have Nick Frost, you have me as a viewer. "
Murder Mountain,"I love it. It is so out there, its refreshing. Plus I just love badass kung fu action."
Murder Mountain,"Fine. It's been on my watch list forever, guess it's time to get around to it."
Murder Mountain,Is it the only Xianxia show on America TV? I can't really think of anything else.
Murder Mountain,"I was semi-enjoying the show in season 1.  Season 2 I was quite into it and Season 3 seems like its going to be even better.  

May or may not have 'helped' an already good Season 2 but IMO how bad the fight choreography was in 'Iron Fist' also gave a solid comparison of how good fight choreography can be from other actors with no previous martial arts background.  This may have injected a dose of nitro so to speak again not that I didn't already enjoy the hell out of season 2."
Murder Mountain,For some silly reason I have not seen this show. It's exactly the show for me and yet I haven't watched on episode. 
Murder Mountain,I'm slowly working my way through season 2.  The acting from the lead characters is so hard to get past.  At least they can make the fights look great.
Murder Mountain,I wish HDTGM podcast did TV shows!
Murder Mountain,"I thought the magazine cover was just [spoiler](#s ""Bioshock"")"
Murder Mountain,"I 100&#37; watch this show because the action is amazing. So unbelievable but it looks soooo good.

Yeah, some of the characters suck. Like M.K.. I hate that kid. Everything else is good though."
You,I’m just annoyed it doesn’t come with YouTube premium with this increase in price
You,I’ve received 4 emails this month about services I use going up and in return offering nothing new to justify the increase. The only thing not going up is my paycheck.
You,So they took away my MLBTV and are charging me more for it….
You,So they're losing more and more channels and are charging us for it? Yeah I'm gonna go cancel.
You,They could at least include YouTube premium with their price gouging.
You,Aaaaaaand it’s Cable.
You,I just need a streaming option for local channels. I can’t get them over the air. Now all the services with locals are all $70 plus. It’s just too much to pay to watch Jeopardy.
You,That's literally more than my current cable package.  lmfao
You,"Cable cutting was great at first, but all these price hikes are just gonna send people back out to the high seas."
You,"73 bucks and you still have to watch commercials, basic price gets you no movie channels and there's tons of channels you'll never watch. Gee, sounds like cable!"
You,"Well think I'll switch to Sling, their 60/mth plan has all the channels I like and still does 3 streams which means I can still share with my MIL."
You,Glad Sunday Ticket will be available a la carte!
You,Just 4 years ago this and Hulu live were $45/mo
You,"I don't care that you have 100s of channels. Let me pick the three or four I actually watch and pay for that. PLEASE!!!!

You lose content and want me to pay more? COME. THE. FUCK. ON.

At least they are lowering the 4K offering by $10, so this price increase is practically a wash for me. But it is the PRINCIPLE!"
You,How is this cheaper than my cable package?
You,"As a person who subscribes essentially 100% for sports, as long as they keep the following features, I'll probably stick around:

* Unlimited DVR
* Point in time stats during DVR'd sports
* Key Plays for live and DVR'd sports
* No restrictions on skipping while watching DVR content
* Seamless access from a variety of devices

I had Comcast until I switched back in 2019, and unless they've done major improvements, the quality of life of their service wasn't anything close to YTTV. Aggressive compression made picture quality noticeably bad, mobile device access was semi-functional at the best of times, I couldn't skip some commercials while watching some DVR content, billing issues/mystery charges, on and on.

If there's another service that allows me to record every broadcast game of major US leagues (NBA, NFL, NHL), every March Madness game, and every US-aired European soccer match so I can peruse/watch any of it whenever I want (along with the features I listed above), please let me know."
You,"still absolutely better than spectrum cable. don't have to deal with cable box fees, contracts, local channels fees, and so much more"
You,I’m out of the loop- what does $73/mo get you?
You,I just want live sports. Is it really so impossible for a service to be cheaper and offer sports packages? I’m not paying close to $90/month for the few channels I want for a game or two a week.
You,I pay $85 for internet. $73 for YouTube is something my 2009 self just can’t comprehend.
You,I bailed on YouTube tv forever ago because it hit $50
You,"I am a 4k subscriber as well, so my net change is $4 / month cheaper!"
You,YouTube doesn't need to raise the rate.  They are doing it because they can.
You,"I just want Xfinity to be less expensive. A good cable/internet bundle. That's all. And to watch NFL without having to be a confused boomer meme. Everyone is like, thank you for being a loyal customer. Also fuck you."
You,Literally every subscription or service ever.
You,I always thought it was ridiculous to have to pay for YouTube premium as well. It should’ve been bundled from the start.
You,Canceled!!
You,Is there still a point in “cutting the cord” ? All these streamers and costs seem to add up to the same if not more
You,They need to add Youtube Premium to it.
You,"Professional marketer here. Aside from the rate hike, the email announcing it pissed me off. It was in plain text and small font. It required a read not a scan. This is intentional! They have every tool to make this communication bite-sized, easy to  look at and easy to understand. Their purpose in forgoing graphics, dynamic text or even bullet points was to MISS your attention. It’s not just YouTube. All the rate hike emails for every service are like this. They have to let us know, but they’re hoping that the majority of us won’t read the email and won’t notice the extra $5 or $10 coming out of our accounts. Yet, the minute they have something new to sell, they’ll make damn sure to catch your attention with a slick and easy to digest message that you can make sense of in an instant. It’s a small rant, but realizing the psychological game here adds insult to financial injury."
You,"I was already on the fence about hanging on to YouTube TV. I’ll miss that unlimited DVR, but I can’t justify it anymore."
You,Man I wish we could organize a Reddit strike for 90+ days on all these kinda companies just to see the impact
You,I also read on Twitter that NFL Sunday Ticket will be offered on its own as a premium channel (no price yet). This means I wont have to sub to YouTube TV unlike DirecTV that had me by the gonads for years.
You,I think I’m going to cancel YouTube tv and start looking for other options then
You,"Of course. One month after I switch to it from cable. Still cheaper than what I was paying, but grrr"
You,"I am way more surprised at the number of people who have YouTube TV, were paying the old amount, and are still going to pay the new amount, and still pay for premium separately! 

There are people in this thread paying $100 a month to YouTube! Wtf"
You,"Oh good, and no MLB network... Maybe it's time to switch to Hulu Live"
You,"$875.88 per year, why waste the money?"
You,Networks charge a fee to broadcast their stations. There's no company that's going to come along and be able to offer comparable TV packages at a significantly lower price than everyone else.
You,"I’m getting rid of it. Just got that email today. The only thing we use it for is to occasionally watch the evening news. We’re too unaccustomed to commercials to watch anything else. 

We’ll just have to figure out how to watch NFL games in the fall."
You,"Stream, they said.  Its cheaper than cable, they said."
You,"Google Fiber is nonexistent.

YouTube TV is more expensive than a comparable cable package.

Google Voice is essentially dead.

Google Fi has been in beta for years and still doesn't have basic feature parity with mainstream providers (like 5G).

So much for Google's ""disruption"" of big telecom players."
You,"To be fair this is why I stick to On Demand content now. Live TV as a whole is no longer worth paying unless you're a sports enthusiast. Even me being an NBA fan I sign up for League Pass. Do I miss games that are broadcasted nationally? Yes, but it's not a big deal to me personally."
You,Byeeeeeeeeeee.
You,Yo Ho
You,Of course. Cuz I just signed up last month. FFS.
You,Cancelled as soon as the Superbowl finished. I used to pay $40. It's doubled in 5 years.
You,too rich for my blood
You,"What are they smoking?

For that price you can get:

Apple TV 4.99

Discovery 6.99

Disney+ 7.99

HBO Max 14.99

Netflix 15.49

Hulu 12.99

Paramount + 9.99

All together its $73.49 it's literally the price of all other major streaming services combined."
You,I literally signed up yesterday…. Guess I will be canceling after the free trial after all :/
You,"I never would have gone for it anyway, but at $73?!  Are they insane?  There's no way they have content worth even half that."
You,"LMAO, I was about to sign up so I can watch some of the March Madness games tonight and tomorrow. 

Fuck that now lol hell no. I'm going to a bar. This is legit more than it would cost me to pay Spectrum for access to those channels via their app. Pretty sure that's around $40 a month. The DVR function is useless if you are already used to watching things via streaming 24 hours after it premiers on cable."
You,I just canceled
You,"The only way these companies will ever understand is if you vote with your feet and cancel but if you continue to pay then they will continue to raise the prices, it’s really that simple!"
You,I can’t wait to not sign up for it!!!
You,I’m out after the tourney!
You,"Are there still commercials? Because if so, it should be free."
You,"Damn. At this point, all of these streaming platforms need tofucking go."
You,"Well scratch keeping it for the NBA and NHL playoffs out of laziness. I could almost ALMOST justify it if they had YouTube Premium included and Sunday Ticket was going to be included.

Once again, why couldn’t Sony be better at Marketing? PSVue was the best of any of these services."
You,I would cancel but my wife would get mad.  I do have rabbit ears hooked up but no DVR.
You,"YouTube TV has a very tiny slice compared to people that go to YouTube as a whole. I question anyone using the service that has alternatives.

Also, no, Cable is far worse than this.. this you can cancel, no boxes to use.. you can use it on anything, its far more flexible."
You,Still cheaper by at least $30 @ month than cable.
You,And iptv is $120 year. Lol. Way cheaper.
You,"You were supposed to destroy the sith, not join them!"
You,My pirating has increased 12%.
You,So now more expensive than direct TV...
You,Who pays for this? No thank you
You,They lowered the 4K service by $10 which helps balance this out for me. They’re still on par with cable now.
You,That's going to be terrible for all 37 of their customers
You,Whay does anyone pay for this? It still has ads and doesn't come with premium.
You,Price gouge people who haven’t cancelled since watching the Super Bowl on a free trial??
You,Move to Sling and save
You,Why would someone pay for this shit?
You,“…for no good reason besides corporate greed.”
You,All their services are too expensive. YouTube premium is $16 a month just for no ads.
You,"Look at that, same price that cable used to be. What a surprise."
You,"Pirate life for me

VPN crew"
You,Ridiculous
You,"Although I’m not happy about it, YouTube TV is still worth it if you split it with other people. You can add people to your plan and watch 3 screens simultaneously. This is still a great deal for those who like the classic flipping through channels to find a show to watch feeling."
You,"Honestly not all bad. As a YTTV user I’m a little annoyed by it. Says they are lowering the 4k streaming cost from 20 to 10 per month. 

So basically if you were already paying for 4k your monthly bill actually goes down a few dollars. Shout out to those lucky few"
You,I look forward to watching them fail
You,"The price made my jaw drop. Here in Brazil, I have most of the main streaming services, HBO for $2.50/mo, Disneyplus, $1.80/mo, Netflix $4.50/mo, Paramount $1.80/mo, all maximum plans btw, and that pretty much covers my viewing needs."
You,"Watching AEW last night had absolute terrible video quality(was only an issue with YTTV based on other comments from wrestling fans), the fact they think their 4k package is worth a damn is insane."
You,You tube was great until they kept adding channels nobody wanted and became a cable company.   The point was keep the price at $40 or so to steal away the cable people.   Now I can bundle my comcast for a better price.     Morons
You,Might as well get cable
You,"🎵Yo ho, yo ho! A pirate's life for me!🎵"
You,Who's paying this. That's very expensive for a service. What do you get for that
You,What??!? I didn't know services like this and sling were so expensive. What is the point of cable cutting then?
You,And they took away my precious mlb network too. Ugh.
You,I’ve tried out both Hulu and YouTubeTV.  YouTube has a Far better UX. Channel selection and recording was much better with YouTube. I have Hulu TV and can get around easily
You,I wouldn't mind youtubetv but my main gripe is they show like 3 commercials on repeat.  Changing my ad settings does nothing.
You,I dropped it as soon as it went up. I was watching for Warriors games and that was the only channel I watched. Not worth it anymore. I'll read a book.
You,Wth
You,Wtf does YouTube tv coke with? Like holy shit 73 a month is crazy. It better coke with all the premium channels or some shit. I’m not paying over 800 a year for basic cable.
You,"Well this fucking sucks. I loved Playstation Vue, then they killed that. YTTV was a decent alternative and now I'm going to have to bail on that. 

Anyone know a service that has SNY, USA, FOX, ESPN, ABC, NBC, CBS, TBS, TNT, Comedy Central and MTV? Basically the only reason why I still have a live service is for sports. I really don't watch anything outside of sports and the occasional CC/MTV show."
You,"Lmao they emailed me saying this is the first increase in years...ummm, no.  I remember getting this over 5 years ago and 49.99. Then it was 59.99, then 64.99 and now a whopping $73



72.99 + wifi...........back to cable I guess"
You,I just started thinking about getting them for nfl sunday ticket too. Fuck them
You,So cable is now cheaper???
You,For that price you might well just get cable or satellite…
You,I'm out.
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,Is this the only question he is asked by reporters?
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,"Robert Pattinson gave the best summary of this situation…

>	I always say about people who do method acting, you only ever see people do the method when they’re playing a a–holes. You never see someone being lovely to everyone while they’re really deep in character."
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,"At this point, this ‘method beef’ story is starting to feel like marketing."
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,"Cox:

>“He’s (Jessie Armstrong) very disciplined in that way, and also he’s very British in that way. The American inclination is to milk it for all it’s worth.”

>“I’ll miss the cast, I’ll miss the atmosphere, I’ll miss the bonhomie. Logan, probably, I’ll miss a bit. But upward and onwards.”


On Jeremy Strong:

>“I’m glad he is not in pain personally, he's a wonderful actor. It’s really a cultural clash. I don’t put up with all that American shit. I’m sorry. All that sort of ‘I think, therefore I feel.’”

>“Just do the job. Don’t identify.”"
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,"I like to think he does this as his own way of method acting to keep Jeremy/Kendall in character as hating Logan. But he's probably just an old grump, and that's fine too. He's earned it."
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,"He is aware that the king of method acting, Daniel Day-Lewis, is from London right?"
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,"Gary Oldman, Christian Bale, Daniel Day Lewis….."
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,"The majority of big-name actors who I’ve heard of doing this aren’t American, though…"
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,He sounds cranky like his character anyway so method acting is sort of a moot point.
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,DDL isnt American
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,"Brian Cox is a crusty old Scot and I FUCKING ADORE HIM.

""If you were my son, Mac, I wouldve *smothered* you by now!""  Fucking love him in Super Troopers 🤣🤣🤣"
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,"Maybe my favorite anecdote from the New Yorker piece on Jeremy Strong is that Brian Cox once asked him why he behaved so oddly and insisted on avoiding the other members of the cast and doing all this method acting stuff etc. and Jeremy Strong basically said ""I don't know another way to embody and perform as this character"" and Brian Cox said ""....have you tried...acting?"""
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,"They could all take a page out of Jason Alexander's book ""Acting Without Acting'."
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,"Ironically, Brian Cox is currently engaging in method acting by being so vocal about how he hates what Jeremy Strong is doing."
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,"There’s more than one way to skin a cat. If getting your best performance is method - great! If it’s not - great? 

Do method actors annoy some people on set? Yep. At my job there’s plenty of people who annoy me - as long as they don’t keep me from doing my part though that’s not my problem"
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,I think Brian Cox is a great actor but I wouldn’t ever want to spend any time with him. Absolutely annoying AF
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,"I think that most American actors pursuing method acting **today** were probably inspired by the quite English Daniel Day-Lewis.

**Edit:** Added a word."
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,"“American shit?”, every method actor I know is British"
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,How does he feel about actors talking shit in the press about their coworkers on a constant basis?
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,His tendency to try to be shocking is just as tiresome as the media that keeps reporting it.
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,"This is the guy from super troopers, right ?"
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,Didn’t a Russian come up with method acting? How’s it American?
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,"Heh. My brother is an asshole. He got cast as an asshole in the high school musical and tried to call it ""method acting"". heh."
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,Hmmm. Method acting? Didn't he play a rich guy in the show? Did he have to go on vacation for months to play a rich guy? Or is he already a rich guy? I could get used to that method acting.
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,Does he think Method Acting is exclusive to American actors?
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,"How is The Method which was invented by Stanislavsky in Russia an ""American shit""?"
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,"Lol he put up with it for years to make money, so quite clearly he will put up with it. 

Sadly, the irony of he himself being a method actor asshole is lost on him."
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,My dumbass thought Brian Cox (physicist) and was very confused
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,Couldn’t he be considered a method actor himself? He always plays the same asshole.
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,Sounds like he's method acting a grumpy old man
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,Isn't the most famous method actor in the world British?
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,Maybe he was in character when he answered? lol
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,Isn't Daniel Day Lewis a big method actor?
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,"Christian Bale is one of the most notorious method actor. And famously, not American"
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,"He used Daniel Day Lewis as an example of how shit method acting is, despite the fact that the man is English lol."
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,The method acting stuff gets all the attention but I'm really here for his weed takes
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,Daniel Day Lewis. English.
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,"Method acting is Russian in origin.

And it's most famously used by Daniel Day-Lewis, an Englishman.

Dude sounds like an asshole. Seems like he just wants an excuse to bash Americans."
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,Does Mr. Cox know that Stanislavski was Russian lol
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,OMG! This notion that acting is hard.
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,"Great pitchers are different. Some throw 100 mph fastballs, some throw 85 mph curveballs. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzLSNgZNE-Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzLSNgZNE-Q)

Daniel Day-Lewis method acts and is the only actor I know that was heralded for his 1800's accent that is no longer spoken.

Brian Cox is an actor who can close his eyes and be in character. 

Doesn't mean one process makes a better actor."
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,I’m sorry but I’m calling bullshit on Cox. He tolerated American Jeremy Strong method acting for 4 seasons of succession. So he apparently does put up with that “American shit”.
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,"This one time I directed a simple short film about a scientist who traveled back in time to save his wife, we all knew that the shirt film was cheesy but that’s why we made it. We found this one random actor through Facebook who was an interesting guy… he was also a “method actor”, so this whole time he wanted to keep the props (our take time machine) during shooting (even when the cameras were turned off) so he could remain in character. He also wanted to ask the cast to refer to him to the characters name all time and he almost hurt the other actress bc he was too much in his character. The funniest part was that during a crying scene he asked someone from production to go to the grocery store to buy onions cause he couldn’t feel the emotions. Crazy experience"
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,Honestly sounds like something Logan would say - maybe Cox is next-level method acting so deep he doesn’t even know it?
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,He sounds like he’s method acting as Rupert Murdoch
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,What if he's the *ultimate* method actor and this is all so he can continue to hate Jeremy Strong's character?
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,you mean to tell me Captain John O'Hagen was not method acting? my world has been shattered.
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,"Ok but the most famous method actor was British, Brian (DDL)"
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,And yet I'm still seeing him in dumb ass commercials...what's wrong Brian do you somehow not have ENOUGH money???
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,All I'll say is him and Jeremy strong have dynamite chemistry together so whatever drama they are trying to drum up is clearly working. Keep it up!
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,"> ""Acting is about the exploration of character rather than simply a projection of self. I was in New York with Maggie Smith recently, promoting a film, and we were asked about the Sanford Meisner Method school of acting which is based on ruthless self-exploration. Maggie, in her unique way, said, 'Oh, we have that in England, too. We call it wanking.'""

Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,I’ll believe that when me shit turns purple and smells like rainbow sherbet!
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,My take is that Jeremy Strong accomplished exactly what he wanted with his method acting.
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,Winning friends on both sides of the pond is old Brian Cox.
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,I feel like one of the most famous method actors of all time is Daniel day Lewis and he is from the uk
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,What a cranky old wanker!
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,Isn’t method acting French?
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,"Like Robert Pattinson once said: actors who go method always do it when they’re playing crazy assholes. No one ever says, I’m being super nice because I’m method acting a kind person lmao."
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,but acting like you are your character is the whole point
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,"I never gotethod acting, the whole point in being an actor is being able to pretend, method acting is literally anti acting"
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,"As usual have to post this clip from Sharpe:)

https://youtu.be/wUeTOLEwyZ8"
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,I wonder if he’s ever been to the method one acting clinic with Tobias.
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,This dude sounds like an asshole
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,TIL Daniel Day-Lewis is American.
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,"First off, it's *Russian.*

Strasberg, Adler and Meisner might have made it popular in the States, but it was Stanislavski who created it.

But second, ***yeah, Mr. Cox, we can tell don't use it because you play the same character in every fucking thing you do.*** 

Meanwhile, Gary Oldman along with DDL are considered the best actors of your generation, so I guess that ""American shit"" has worked very well for them."
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,"Basically the guy who plays a jerk, is a jerk.  How is this not surprising?"
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,I wonder if Jeremy Strong is an asshole to others on set or if he just does something weird that Brian Cox doesn’t like? I’m sure there’s details in an interview somewhere but the rest of the cast all seem to get along fine with Jeremy so I think Brian just lets it bother him way too much.
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,"Isn't the most famous method actor English? I'm talking about Mr. Learned to butcher meat, Czech speaking, touches his eye with a knife, dress maker, Daniel Day Lewis?"
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,American shit? Bro one of the best method actors of all time is a Brit. Daniel Day Lewis.
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,Ironic he hates method acting but did the interview as Logan Roy.
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,Says the guy taking money from McDonald's to sell Chicken sandwiches.
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,Isn't the most famous method actor in the world British (Daniel Day Lewis)?
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,"Man who has literally only ever acted like himself thinks actors who actually try to act like someone else are fools!

/eyeroll"
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,"Cox: get over yourself. ""Wah, someone does their job different than me. WAH! I don't WAH put up with this Waaaaaaaahhh!"
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,"One of his co-stars (I think it was Kelvin Harrison Jr.) said about Peter Dinklage, that he can be joking around but the instant they call action he is immediately in character.  *That* to me is real acting."
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,"""That American Shit""?

Remind me where Daniel Day-Lewis was born?

Myopic old coot."
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,"Except, the most famous user of method acting ... isn't American."
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,"Always felt Cox was the same character in everything I’ve seen him in, so his word doesn’t mean that much."
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,Brian Cox is your average European Redditor
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,Old wind bag talks too much.
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,"Honestly, it sounds like Jeremy Strong had been getting on Brian Cox's (and others) nerves while filming.  I'd read the plan was originally 5 seasons (and is what HBO hoped for), but I'm guessing season 4 was a tough shoot and the creator just thought it was best to end it.  My worry is that this being the final season was announced months after season 4 filming ended, so I hope we get a proper ending."
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,Badabababa he's not loving it.
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,Does he know Daniel Day Lewis is English? DDLis the king of method actors.
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,I love him
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,Don't have to method when you are the character.
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,"Jeremy Strong: ""Shenanigans""

Brian Cox: *whips pistol*"
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,Isn’t DDL a method actor? He’s a lrettt strong actor so it works for him
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,"I’m haven’t watched the show, so I only know him from other roles, but does Brian Cox have any range other than being Brian Cox? I feel like he’s great in all the roles I’ve seen him in, but he only plays like one type of character, and it seems to match his personality in these interviews."
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,Brian Cox is awesome. Just no shits given. Look forward to whatever he is in next.
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,Buda bah bah bah - Brian Cox on my McDonald's Ad
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,Oh fuck offf!
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,Err...the veritable king of method acting is from the UK. Why the dog on Americans? Fuck off!
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,"Isn't Daniel Day Lewis, a very famous non-American, one of the most notorious method actors out there?

Edit: made comment before I read, he referred to DDL in the article, LOL"
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,"He just comes off as an asshole, wants to bag on the American shit but you can rest assured he never turned down that American paycheck."
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,I don't know what Succession is but this headline has made me not want to watch it.
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,"Honestly these comments from him make me think he’s actually method acting, it just seems too close to a real Logan/Kendall interaction."
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,He seems pleasant
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,"> “The American inclination is to milk it for all it’s worth.”

It's literally illegal for corporations to *not* maximize the shareholder benefit in the US..."
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,I don't understand actors who choose method acting. It's called acting. You are pretending. It's play. Stop taking it so seriously.
Stand Up and Away! with Brian Regan,"Method acting the way people think of it today is not really a thing. All actors have their own process. If that includes some Stanislavski, Mizner, Adler, Chekov, etc.. great, but anyone that has studied any of the classic American acting philosophies will tell you that the “method actor” of today is not practicing a true school of thought."
Way Back into Love,S1 was very cute and i can't wait for more.
Way Back into Love,I absolutely adored this show in season 1 and can't wait for season 2. I didn't know how they would address the passing of Mike Hagerty and I think the decision to not address it is a good one. He was such a big and warm presence in season 1 that acknowledging his real life death would put a huge cloud over this entire new season. I'm sure this show will make it all work and continue to be one of the best on TV.
Way Back into Love,Yes! I loved Season 1!
Way Back into Love,I saw this randomly and binged it in one sitting. So heartwarming! Can't wait for the second season.
Way Back into Love,"I was just wondering this show last night as a browsed for some TV comedies.

That’s good news!"
Way Back into Love,   Yes! I think the first time I saw Bridget Everett was in Patty Cake$ and she was fantastic in that. Recently I just saw her  cabaret stand-up. So funny! She's a gem and this show rocks!
Way Back into Love,Terrific show!  I hope its audience continues to grow.
Way Back into Love,Is this an Everything Everything spin-off?
Way Back into Love,Loved this show!
Way Back into Love,">It's mad. It's a mad experience. As you say, I have spoken about the fact that, emotionally, I had moved on. We'd had a really great experience making the shows that we made, and I'd loved playing the character. I felt like it had been a success. Did I feel like there were scratches left to itch? Yes. Sometimes, it's just the way it goes. I think it had been almost two years since I'd heard from anyone, so I really expected everything to move on.

>Then, to suddenly now be, weirdly, at the start of the journey again—we feel like we're just beginning again—I feel incredibly blessed, incredibly fortunate, and really excited to crack on and play this character some more.

it was great to see him again,"
Way Back into Love,"After watching Daredevil on Netflix, I realized his greatest ability isn't his heightened senses or fighting ability, its how well he can take an ass whooping over and over again."
Way Back into Love,"The gold suit is so fucking ugly. Still, really glad to have him back in the role."
Way Back into Love,"Lots of comments here about Daredevil, about the MCU, about the costume. Those are all fun conversations to have, I get it.

But the best part of this interview is at the end, about how he and D'Onofrio approached a basically mirrored scene from completely different places and both got really strong performances. I know this is going to sound a little strange because casting has really been one of the MCU's strengths, but it's kind of nice to see these characters approached by an actor's actor, y'know? In a lot of interviews the MCU actors make reference to being a part of a legacy, or loving the character or how fun the experience was. But either because the marketing machine it too finely tuned or because they had less input overall than they might have in another role, they almost never get to talk in a serious manner about the choices they made and why. Moon Knight had problems, but I liked how much Oscar Isaac could to do the same thing. 

I'm just assuming here, since most fans were not going to accept a Daredevil that wasn't Cox and since he started outside the MCU machine, you're not going to find many people in a position to make as many authorial choices in how their character is presented."
Way Back into Love,"I was hoping for a scene, that would harken back to Daredevil and Punisher.  Jenn takes exception to the brutality of Daredevil and he only says ""Not all of us have the luxury of pulling our punches""."
Way Back into Love,I hope they don't keep it. It's pretty ugly tbh.
Way Back into Love,I like the OG suit. Pretty nostalgic
Way Back into Love,What’s up with the green helmet?
Way Back into Love,"Completely off topic, but related to daredevil


Y’all i had this TV for years that was really shitty and my boyfriend was recommending watching daredevil at the time. I watched the first 15 minutes and kept thinking wow this is a really creative intro. They’re showing the first bit with the video cut and relying completely on orchestrating the sound to depict whats happening, as it would be if the audience were blind. 

Then about 15 minutes in and a blurred/scratched image began to appear and i was like WOW i like this. I told my boyfriend about it later and was like “what a cool intro” and he could not be more confused. Turns out my TV decided to take some liberty with the show while also showing me who the broke dumb bitch was."
Way Back into Love,I just want Jon bernthals punisher back is that too much to ask.
Way Back into Love,"I only last night watched the final 2 episodes of SHE-HULK's first season and i had no idea >!Charlie Cox/Daredevil was going to!< be in them!  needless to say those 2 episodes imo were SO GOOD (especially episode 8 where there's a good amount of >!SHE-HULK/Daredevil interactions/teaming up/scenes together. Daredevils fight/action stunt moves!<!) were amazing!.   

i especially loved (in that 8th SHE-HULK ep.)  the scene where he >!jumps over the side of the parking garage's 4th or 5th floor and does these really cool moves grabbing the wall all the way down as he goes after the frog villain!< guy!  his scenes in these 2 episodes officially have me very excited for his new upcoming Daredevil series!"
Way Back into Love,I read that they are ignoring the Netflix shows. If that's true I have no hope for this.
Way Back into Love,Great guest appearance and glad to have him back. The original daredevil series were unnecessarily long but the character and acting is excellent
Way Back into Love,He needs a better outfit
Way Back into Love,"Glad he's back but the tone/vibe of his character was so weird in She-Hulk, like he's a dark brooding character in a shitty unforgiving city. It's like if Christian Bale Batman showed up to a kids birthday party, just odd and looks like the character is out of their element.

That being said, I don't have high hopes for where the Disney will take his character with how much they like to cater to children (presumably to sell merchandise), especially in this phase 4 of the MCU but I hope I'm wrong..."
Way Back into Love,Daredevil was my favorite comic as a kid and I don’t remember red/gold suit. It was always black with a red outline
Way Back into Love,"Hopefully they don’t absolutely ruin his character with bad writing forced comedy and pointless reboots of already established characters.
Kevin feige has a knack for pissing all over the good in order to please his pg13 mouse overlords"
Way Back into Love,"easily the best part about She Hulk, which exemplifies how the show and the main hero herself are total uninteresting dreck. Although Cox' hair was a bit weird"
Way Back into Love,Disney will ruin him eventually and the series sadly
Way Back into Love,Does daredevil mode mean getting the piss beaten out of him?
Way Back into Love,I find it hard to believe his statements are genuine when they've taken a somewhat serious character and shoved him into basically a comedy show for member-berry points with the audience. Probably would have made much more sense for Daredevil to appear in a series like Blade or something as opposed to She-hulk tbh.
Way Back into Love,Nice
Way Back into Love,I fought back tears. My boy is back 🥲
Way Back into Love,His fight sequences in the 8th episode were legit the only time I actually felt entertained throughout the whole series. Also the only good fight choreography that has been in a Marvel D+ show since Hawkeye.
Way Back into Love,Kinda like Lucas Hood
Way Back into Love,He has to have a metal-plate on his head or something.
Way Back into Love,"Can't blame him too much for his fashion choices, he is blind after all."
Way Back into Love,"yea I guess it's an iconic look in the comics, but I don't think it translates"
Way Back into Love,"I actually love the decision to use it while I’m not super big on the suit itself. He only wore that suit for the first 6 issues in the comics, if I’m remembering correctly. Might have been 7. So for him to make his grand re-entry into the MCU wearing the suit he debuted into Marvel Comics with…it’s a nice acknowledgment of the characters origins. We’d already seen the black and the red suits, so I’m glad we’ve gotten to see this one now too. 

That being said…put my man back in all red and put the fucking DD on his chest."
Way Back into Love,"Came here to not like the suit, thanks for holding the fort"
Way Back into Love,"Yeah overall I didn’t love everything about how he was handled in She-Hulk, but I’m so happy to see him back. He’s so terrific as the character"
Way Back into Love,The 2 tone suit blows for sure. It was worse than the dialogue he had.
Way Back into Love,If the Punisher gets dragged into this pussy ass PG-13 Disney+ formula I’m done. Daredevil already looked like a buffoon with his “my ass remains unwhooped” line. We don’t need that for Castle.
Way Back into Love,I figured it was just his silly suit for when he goes to LA.  Hopefully when he goes back to NY and in his own show we get to see the red and black again.
Way Back into Love,"Yellow suit has always looked bad imo. I guess if they're using a cameo to get it out of the way for an updated look, that's cool. I would like to see something sleek and shiny and less practical. Like Spider-Man's new look at the end of No Way Home."
Way Back into Love,"yea, that looks awful"
Way Back into Love,I hope you don’t be needing a super suit because you just got yourself blacklisted. But really though even Jen’s suit looks like you could buy it online.
Way Back into Love,It's gold. It's based on a [different suit design ](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Daredevil%27s_Suit)
Way Back into Love,https://i.annihil.us/u/prod/marvel/i/mg/7/10/51894efb25f92/clean.jpg
Way Back into Love,Rumor is he's replacing Jesica Jones as the person Matt is looking for during Echo. That would reintroduce him just in time for Iron Wars...
Way Back into Love,"I actually had the opposite reaction to that scene in ep 8. Watching the original series, he always felt like not having super strength, there was very little if any CGI that stood out and all his moves were somewhat believable and realistic. When I saw that scene I pretty much laughed because he is supposed to be closer to an average person than to captain america and that move down the building seemed very much like 'now I can do anything'. 

I'm thrilled to have him back in the role either way, so hopefully it will be a worthy comeback."
Way Back into Love,"I agree with you! While I think Netflix DD was more gritty, human, and down to earth, I think this version with all the crazy levels of acrobatic gravity defying maneuverability brings his skillset up higher into the wild MCU levels. At least, he'd make a good partner for Captain America now! Haha"
Way Back into Love,I loved the callback to/subversion of the hallway scene from the Netflix series.
Way Back into Love,"His first appearance suit back in 1964 was yellow and red. 

https://i.annihil.us/u/prod/marvel/i/mg/7/10/51894efb25f92/clean.jpg"
Way Back into Love,I'm sorry that the showrunners didn't discuss this with you and go with what you remember.
Way Back into Love,"Other than the Punisher, what would make Netflix Daredevil an R rating?"
Way Back into Love,Disney made his Netflix show. They just sold it to Netflix but they made it.
Way Back into Love,Better than getting the piss beaten into him.
Way Back into Love,…. “member-berry points”?
Way Back into Love,Both of you have just been blacklisted by Luke Jacobson.
Way Back into Love,"It was ugly in the comics, they just put it here for the reference value and because he won't have to wear it in the next show.

All things considered, they made it look a little better in live action than it does on paper, but that's probably because it was yellow and brown, not red and gold."
Way Back into Love,"""in the comics"" is the new excuse for everything going on in the current Marvel phase and it's a shit excuse. Comics can be bad. Comics can translate to the screen poorly. Just because it happened in the comics doesn't make it good television."
Way Back into Love,Give me Daredevil in the black and red suit with the horns.
Way Back into Love,It's also made by a fashion designer in the show. It's obviously just a call back to the comics. People need to chill a bit.
Way Back into Love,"Yep, [Daredevil #7](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Daredevil_Vol_1_7)"
Way Back into Love,"They should keep the suit for the first episode, have Foggy tell Matt how ugly it is, and then change it in episode 2."
Way Back into Love,What was wrong with his dialogue?
Way Back into Love,"Agree on the suit, hard disagree on the dialogue. Absolutely loved the show."
Way Back into Love,"Punisher is one of the lamest and most boring comic book characters ever, and he’s idolized by cops and school shooters so I hope they leave him out of the mcu too"
Way Back into Love,"I think they will. The yellow and red was a nice homage to his original suit in the comics, to welcome him back to the MCU. But for his own show I'm pretty sure they'll go back to the red."
Way Back into Love,Also hopefully go back to his character being the same instead of the MCU quippy version.
Way Back into Love,Wait... you're telling me peanutbutter is not green?
Way Back into Love,Oh no not this again
Way Back into Love,Ooooooh I’m excited.
Way Back into Love,"> When I saw that scene I pretty much laughed because he is supposed to be closer to an average person than to captain america and that move down the building seemed very much like 'now I can do anything'

those acrobatics are how he is in the comics. comics fans seem to be on board with it, but those that only watched the show found it jarring it seems."
Way Back into Love,"The only reason he didn't do that in the original series is budget. Daredevil has superhuman senses, including touch/balance. He has actual superpowers. In the comics Capt. America isn't superhuman, he's just a human at peak physical fitness."
Way Back into Love,Exactly. I hated that scene lmao
Way Back into Love,This reads like a shit ad-bot.
Way Back into Love,Thanks! That was way before my comic reading. Really awful
Way Back into Love,"I’ll survive, thanks"
Way Back into Love,Did they? I thought it was a Netflix produced show licensed by Marvel
Way Back into Love,Maybe in the new series
Way Back into Love,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHJhu15f-hg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHJhu15f-hg)  
Basically this but with Daredevil lol."
Way Back into Love,"He's overrated. Yeah, you heard me, Luke. You put a streetfighter in a pleather suit. He is going to make shuffling noises every time he moves. Not only that, he is going to sweat like a mofo. Cotton, Luke. Matt's from Hell's Kitchen. That place gets humid during the summer. It's not Los Angeles. Again, Cotton, Luke."
Way Back into Love,">and because he won't have to wear it in the next show.

Seeing as the woman he's sleeping with made a negative comment about the color palette, I bet he goes all-red again in his own show."
Way Back into Love,"> they just put it here for the reference value and because he won't have to wear it in the next show.

To be fair, there was a passing reference to how Matt ""lost all my old gear."" $50 says it's Blip-related. I'm betting that for Matt at least, it was always supposed to be a temporary fix until he could get a proper new red/black suit."
Way Back into Love,it's just a suit lol. get over it.
Way Back into Love,"I mean, for more than a decade people complained about the MCU ignoring what happened in the comics.

Now they are relying on the comics and that's bad too apparently."
Way Back into Love,I would be totally down for the Shadowlands suit…as long as they stay very fucking far away from that storyline.
Way Back into Love,The entire show had some of the worst dialogue in marvel history
Way Back into Love,That seems unfair to the character. He's idolized by shitty people but they just like the edgy skull icon and reputation of brutality. None of those people actually read his comics or know anything about Frank Castle.
Way Back into Love,More lame than captain America or superman?
Way Back into Love,"Not sure about that. Netflix had a bit of a color coordination going on with their shows, with Daredevil being red, Jessica Jones blue (fighting the Purple Man), Luke Cage yellow and Iron Fist green. Daredevil was also in black for all of the first season (except the final scene), and it contrasted nicely with Punisher showing up in season 2 in all black - Punisher taking the spot that Daredevil had left, thematically. If they aren’t doing any of the other shows, there isn’t a reason to put him in all red.

Although I hope you’re right. I want him back in the dark red tones of the Netflix show, and I would love some guest appearances from the other shows. Well, not Iron Fist, but the others."
Way Back into Love,You mean an exceptionally comic book version of Matt Murdock?
Way Back into Love,"He was quippy in his show, especially during courtroom scenes?"
Way Back into Love,He needs Sonic teeth.
Way Back into Love,God I'm so tired of people telling me that bad TV is good because of the comics.
Way Back into Love,"I would be fine with acrobatics, but the obvious CGI looked really bad. And in the warehouse he didn't even really use any crazy moves."
Way Back into Love,">  In the comics Capt. America isn't superhuman 

What the fuck are you talking about, this is insanely wrong.

https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Talk:Steven_Rogers_(Earth-616)#:~:text=According%20to%20official%20Marvel%20Database,and%20also%20lift%20merge%20hulk."
Way Back into Love,"Fair enough. I enjoy the creativity of your description for my digital tone.

Heh. Maybe I am a bit. That’d be nice and simple. 🤷"
Way Back into Love,It definitely looks better in the comics but i'm really happy they decided to homage it in the show!
Watership Down,"I was six years old when I first saw it. I don't remember what it's about, all I can think about when I try to remember it is dying rabits writhing in pain  underground."
Watership Down,"I saw this movie with my best friend when I was 5. Her mother dropped us off thinking it was a ""bunny cartoon"". When she picked us up, we told her wide-eyed stories of bunny murders and screams. It was a bit much for a 5 year old brain to absorb and she was horrified that she dropped us off for the bunny slaughter. 

Read the book when I was 12, and multiple times since, and love it!!!!"
Watership Down,[deleted]
Watership Down,El-ahrairah and the black rabbit of Inle is so metal.
Watership Down,[removed]
Watership Down,"Man, I haven't seen the movie. Is it worse than the book? When I read the book I loved it, not traumatizing at all. Bigwig was a fucking badass. "
Watership Down,"I was really into the sort of ""mature anthropomorphism"" genre as an older child. So Watership Down was my favorite, but there was also the Redwall series by Brian Jacques, all books by the author ""Avi"" especially the novels ""Poppy"" and ""Perloo the Bold"" and I'm sure there are some others but I'm forgetting their names at the moment.

Oh, and later on, the ""Warriors"" series by Erin Hunter which was about anthropomorphic wild cats who lived in tribes and had cool names like ""Fireheart"" and ""Brambleclaw"""
Watership Down,"Well, okay, but to be honest I'm not sure you can out-do the original film. It was a damn near perfect adaptation. 

I grew up on that. Never scared me. To me it was just epic and amazing. 

Dot and the Kangaroo on the other hand... "
Watership Down,"I don't know what happened, I saw the thumbnail and I just kind of froze and looked like the dog who has seen some shit "
Watership Down,"Hearing ""Bright Eyes"" while watching the disembodied head of the Black Rabbit of Inle floating over the down still terrifies me"
Watership Down,I actually enjoyed watership down as a young child I can't be the only one can I? But then again I grew up in the country side and we shot and ate rabbits quite regularly.
Watership Down,My sister still has an irrational fear of rabbits after seeing this movie when she was like 4 or 5
Watership Down,Why would they do this?? Next it'll be the Animals of Farthing Wood!
Watership Down,Is it a kind of dream?
Watership Down,Watched the VHS version as a kid. Watched them all the time. Game of thrones is a total knock-off.
Watership Down,Hopefully it will be watered down. 
Watership Down,I feel like I'm the only person here who hasn't heard of this book or seen this film. And I'm almost as old as MTV.
Watership Down,"Do not think I have seen this one, but if it is anything like [The animals of Farthing woods] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Animals_of_Farthing_Wood_(TV_series) or [Samson & Sally] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_%26_Sally) I see where you guys are coming from! :D [This song] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEbv6nWQjO4) is still stuck in my head, **just look at that crazy shit!**"
Watership Down,"Not as gut wrenching as Watership down, but there were a few dark cartoons I remember as kid. Animals of Farthing Wood was about an exodus of woodland animals to reach a reserve and it seemed like every episode killed off one of the characters.

 And there's Alfred J Kwak about a duck being raised by a mole after his entire family was killed off in the first episode. Also, his enemy was a [crow called Dolf](http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/Mj6e4z9iLqw/hqdefault.jpg)

Then there's the [mundane adventures of a bohemian tescicle that lives under a kitchen cupboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJHGg9c86fs)"
Watership Down,I feel like I am the only one that watched 1999 version. I liked it as a kid.
Watership Down,At least it's not *Threads*.
Watership Down,Why do some of the faces in this remind me of characters in Hotline Miami after a brutal beating/stabbing/shooting?

Watership Down,A Watership Down miniseries?! Yes please! :0 I read (and still own) the book! So gooood~
Watership Down,"The cover art does not help at all, it looks like a standard animals act like humans story by disney or some shit. My mom rented this for us when I was like 6 or 7, what an experience that was."
Watership Down,"They did pick British voice actors, but Netflix have already said they are pushing to Americanize it to make it easier to digest for their home market. Expect the common snappy phrases and replies:

*Ok, you can do this, you can do this! Focus, focus! Uh-huh yeah UH-HUH I'm really doing this! WHOOOOOO-YEAAAHH!!*

*Did that just happen? Really?*

*Are we really doing this?!*

*You gotta be KIDDING me!!*

Watership Down,My dad read me the book when I was 5-7ish. I thought it was amazing! When I was 12 I remember realizing how weird it was to anthropomorphize rabbits like that.
Watership Down,"Once when I was working as a door-to-door salesman (ugh... don't ask) I noticed a stack of DVDs in someone's window. 

All child friendly movies. Toy Story, Shrek, Lion King, Finding Nemo, Watership Down, Tangled... I had to do a double take, I was like, ""holy shit what the fuck is that doing in the rotation"". "
Watership Down,"Oh my god, this movie was terrifying. All I really remember is violence, blood, and being very afraid. And telling my mom that the ""seemingly innocent rabbit movie"" was scary, and I didn't like it. I am 27 now, and I'm still afraid to read the book or rewatch the movie. I did brave the trailer just now. I feel validated after seeing how scary the trailer still is haha."
Watership Down,This film. I cannot be around rabits without thinking of it... Remember getting such a shock watching it
Watership Down,Oh god. My Grandmother had the audacity to show me this when I was 7.  That messed me up for years...
Watership Down,"Was Happy Tree Friends ""inspired"" by watership down? Deceptive covers fooling even adults that this is a kid's movie. Do they even have ratings at that time when it was released? Surely there should be a red label that says ""WARNING: GRAPHIC VIOLENCE"""
Watership Down,"good movie shows what life is really about, lots of hope lots of pain

traumatize?

welcome to the real world bitches"
Watership Down,I remember having discussions with people when I was like middle school with people about 'Who the F considered this a children's book?!' when I worked as a library assistant as one of my electives in school. Its freaking dark.
Watership Down,"Ah, the Watership Right of Passage. You've not received your exit pass from childhood until you lose your shit watching rabbits kill each other."
Watership Down,"CGI? Meh, I say. I bet they won't even have the rabbits rip each other to bloody pieces"
Watership Down,This is the most accurate title I have ever seen on Reddit
Watership Down,The animated version of The Plague Dogs is even worse. Richard Adams had some seriously dark streaks in his books. 
Watership Down,"I've never read this book or seen the movie, so I had no idea what made this movie such nightmare fuel. I just looked up some ""noteworthy"" scenes on youtube.

Jesus Christ. This was marketed to kids? lol"
Watership Down,"OK maybe it is because I had raised rabbits by the time I watched the film but I suffered no trauma.  I knew what rabbits were capable of and just thought it was a wonderful story about rabbits.  It could also be that I knew what food was before it was food also.  So the idea that an animal would fight to the death not to be killed, well that just went with the territory to me.  You city folk need to spend some time on a farm.  And not some factory disguised as a farm.  Hell you would all become vegans after that kind of animal Auschwitz.  No a farm, farm.  It will change how you look at your food.  It will change how your kids view their food.  Hiding these realities will not make your kids lives better in any way.  99.9% of the worlds population eat animals.  Telling your kids that the cows on a farm aren't the same animals that end up as steaks is fostering a fantasy that will not help them grow into an adult."
Watership Down,As a child my parents rented this movie for me to watch some night they went out. My pet rabbit had died a week prior...
Watership Down,"Nooooo!!! Worst movie ever! As a kid you think you're going to watch a cartoon, then you realize very quickly it's just a cartoon about evil rabbits killing nice rabbits. Look at  parents ""why mom and dad, why?"" Tears streaming down my face."
Watership Down,"Yeah, don't put it in the kids catagory."
Watership Down,I am so glad I was not the only child traumatized by this abomination of a movie.  It still gives me nightmares. 
Watership Down,"Netflix, please no. "
Watership Down,Honestly the world isn't all rainbows and bj's so to me this kind of film portrays a gritty reality contrasted with strong morals
Watership Down,Someone tell me what the appeal is of 3D/CGI versus 2D animation in terms of production 
Watership Down,We just had Mr. Yuk. Haha
Watership Down,My grandma got me this movie for my 9th birthday. It's the scariest shit I have ever seen. WHY WOULD THEY DO THIS?!! Netflix & Kill.
Watership Down,To risk so much for one damn meal.
Watership Down,I'll say this about *Watership Down*... it's no *Duncton Wood*.

Watership Down,"Try the movie from the 70's, ""The Lottery"" for children."
Watership Down,The book was great.
Watership Down,This is the best movie ever. Couldn't get any of my college friends to watch it though lol
Watership Down,"I loved this movie when I was an older child (my parents wouldn't let me watch it when I was younger), and I read the book in college and loved it even more.  
The thing that disappointed me the most was the film's short length (not uncommon for an animated movie). I preferred the pacing and length of the book, and rewatching the movie made it feel rushed and short, not like the sweeping epic I thought it to be as a child.  
I hope the series format will fit it better than a movie, but I'm afraid that a miniseries won't actually end up being significantly longer than a feature length movie anyway."
Watership Down,This needs to happen. 
Watership Down,"Looks like I'll have an opportunity to use my newest descriptor: ""a fluffle of rabbits"". Nice."

Watership Down,Oh hell no. Never watched. Going to pretend I didn't see that cover picture.
Watership Down,"I loved that movie so much, but then again I saw it when I was 17. Its in my top 10 for sure. "
Watership Down,"So this got to the top of my front page asking with another one from r/books. I've never heard if this and none of the top contents gives a tldr of what the book is about. Come in Reddit, you're slacking today. I'll even settle for a snarky link to the tldr I missed.  Cba to check Wikipedia."

Watership Down,I saw this film accidentally when I was 9. Mom had taken my sister and Me to Pinocchio and this turned out to be a double feature.  I asked if we could stay 5 min into the the next film.  Sure she said.  I was mesmerized.  We stayed for the whole film I'm glad to say.  Bought it when it came out on DVD and read the book finally as an adult.  
Watership Down,Gonna make kids watch this.  
Watership Down,"cus, cus, cus, cus"
Watership Down,"Black rabbit of death FTW. When that creepy mother fucker starts bouncing across the serene countryside, with that weird as hell sad music playing! *shudders* *Shudders* *SHUDDERS*"
Watership Down,Good! A little bit of trauma never hurt anyone!
Watership Down,Judging by the trailer it looks like a story of rabbit hunting told from the prey perspective. How correct am i?
Watership Down,"ITT reddit trying to one up another about how traumatized they were by this movie, only to go back playing GTA and burning prostitutes alive while giggling to themselves."
Watership Down,"HOLY SHIT I was just asking my housemate if she saw this when she was little and I tried to describe how traumatic is was when I saw it. I was really young and it might've been the first film to actually horrify me. Anyways, she laughed it off a couple days ago so I am so excited to watch this! We've been on a childhood movie kick so this will fit in so well! Ha, I'm actually stoked, a gift from the universe"
Watership Down,When does this arrive to Netflix I can't find it in the article 
Watership Down,"I love Watership Down, but I can't say I've been very enthusiastic about Netflix adaptations. The Crouching Tiger 2 movie was especially bad."
Watership Down,"We had a movie day at my Elementary School when I was a kid and this was played, oh how times have changed."
Watership Down,"Wow, that thumbnail..."
Watership Down,This is legitimately the funniest title I've come across in a minute..
Watership Down,"hopefully the new adaption of 'Watership Down' isn't watered down... I want a dark and satirical juxtaposition of human life and rabbits, that will stick with children until they're 30... like it did me."
Watership Down,"Even the book was pretty dark as a kid. 

I still loved it though. "
Watership Down,Thanks netflix..... I had just about gotten over THAT scene... Then this is posted..... 😰😨😭
Watership Down,"Please don't be CGI.  Please don't be CGI.

Fuck."
Watership Down,"A quote that always stuck with me was, ""My heart has joined the thousand, for my friend stopped running today."" For some reason I love that line."
Watership Down,"Eh, it's going to suck. Noam Murro as a director."
Watership Down,"Definitely not an appropriate children's novel or movie. Don't let the cute bunnies fool you. 
When my daughters were young, we read every night before bed. We read through the first couple chapters of Watership Down, and not only was it way over their heads, the book has a seriously downward arc. 
We moved on to Roald Dahl or something like that.
I finished the book myself. Perhaps Watership Down is important literature, I'm not in a position to say. But it's a rich, complex, and very human tragedy.
Not for kids though."
Watership Down,"I remember feeling a lot more messed up at the end of [The Plague Dogs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0UmOH6Qf1g) than I was at the end of Watership Down. Then again, I didn't see either until I was an adult."
Watership Down,"I've already watched it, i cried when i thought hazel died."
Watership Down,"Never realized there was a movie of that awesome book.

Also, I never was traumatized by the book, on the other hand found it quite moving, is the movie somehow gone wrong?"
Watership Down,Lennie from Of Mice and Mens worst nightmare.
Watership Down,"Awful movie about an amazing book.  Kinda excited to see another shot at a film, but to be honest I'll probably end up cursing and turning it off just like I did with my other favorite book Ender's Game."
Watership Down,"I loved this movie as a kid. I remember thinking is was terrifying, but I also
felt like I was seeing something realistic. The life of a wild animal 
can be brutal and short and I felt grateful that somebody was being honest about that,
rather than feeding me the same old pap that I got from
picture books.

I thought a lot about the movie and its message and eventually went on to read the book, which
I loved and still consider one of my favorites.

It's funny because even though I loved this movie as a kid, I'm really hesitant to let
my own kids watch it.  Not all kids are the same and some might be ready to see something like
this sooner than others. You just have to use your best judgement, I guess."
Watership Down,"probably one of the coolest animated movies out there, since I first watched it I have been showing as many people I can, Fiver is my favorite character, then Hazel, then Bigwig and Keehar the bird was pretty good for comic relief ""wing no good, wing no good, KKEEEEHAAARRR"""
Watership Down,"I loved this movie when I was a kid, I didn't yet know English and we only had an English VHS of it, and still I watched it several times a month.

Inuyashiki Last Hero,"So in the game I totally understood Joel’s POV. 

I was immediately onboard with the decision lol.

Not the killing part but the moral quandary was not one for me.

The lying though was a mistake.

In the show it was more disturbing because they really portrayed him as a mass shooter."
Inuyashiki Last Hero,"I like this statement:

>Good stories are not built on themes like “brotherhood” or “anger”; those are just words. Good stories are built on arguments: It’s worth killing everyone to save the person you love. We can debate that."
Inuyashiki Last Hero,Well Neil Druckmann did first when he wrote the game. Craig is just echoing that here.
Inuyashiki Last Hero,This guy was such a moron in the after the episode specials. Can’t listen to him at all.

Inuyashiki Last Hero,[removed]
Inuyashiki Last Hero,This is why I love the characters so much...they are layered. No one is the good guy or bad guy; everyone has reasons for doing what they're doing. Nuance makes for a great show!

Inuyashiki Last Hero,"Empathy is a double edged sword too. 

You can just as much empathize with a hobo as you can with a Nazi. 

We need to understand we are not infallible.  That our emotions are not truths. That our instincts are tools, not laws. That dogs trusting these same feelings can see children as threats and attack them. We are no different. 

But what we do after acknowledging...how we ACT on these principles is something neither Neil nor Mazen has yet to interrogate 

I'd like to see less critique and more attempts at solutions that promote dialogue."
Inuyashiki Last Hero,"That's a cool concept and all, but I'm not sure this is the right scenario to explore it because I don't think it feels nearly as grey as that would require. Nobody watching is going to be unsympathetic to the calls made by the characters here, or consider them ""negative"" expressions of love in any meaningful way."

Inuyashiki Last Hero,"Or you know, don’t frequent threads that might spoil things for you in the first place?

The games vs the show have very different fan bases. The show moves faster than the game. You don’t want spoilers?

Don’t watch the show until you’ve played the game. It’s that simple. 

Spoiler avoidance from game to show? Two completely different ball games. Do not make demands that can not be met."

Ellie now has the corpses of the potential saviors of humanity on her name. All while believing her immunity can't be for nothing. That's rough."
Inuyashiki Last Hero,"Ironic given that you kill A LOT more people in the game (because it's a fame, I understand thebseparation of media, just funny that it felt that way)"
Inuyashiki Last Hero,"> So I’m the game I totally understood Joel’s POV.

> I was immediately onboard with the decision lol.

Yeah, first time I played the game... there wasn't a thought of sneak through the hospital. Like Joel, I killed everyone that was in the way."
Inuyashiki Last Hero,"You don't feel that way in the game because you've been mowing enemies for the past 16 hours of playtime by then. You're desensitized to the violence by that point. 

Joel has less action in the show, which makes the last scene more impactful. That's great writing to be honest."
Inuyashiki Last Hero,"He definitely was a mass shooter in the game, but when you’re controlling him you empathize. When he’s autonomous and you have to sit and watch him do it, you see it more objectively. It was fascinating for me how differently I felt about events as a player and a viewer."
Inuyashiki Last Hero,My friend said that it gave off school shooter vibes
Inuyashiki Last Hero,"I mean, I don't know – I'm not sure Tolkien would agree.

I wish more people actually debated this right here instead of all the excuses about how what Joel did ""isn't actually that bad"""
Inuyashiki Last Hero,"This is what bothers me about tlou2 talk. It's fucking shallow as shit. People talk about it like it's exploring some deep theme. It's not. It's the basic premise of anylove story really. What would you do for love? What's interesting is not that ""from a different perspective, things are different!"" That's fucking basic. What makes love stories interesting is the individuals involved and their growth within the story. 

Murder is bad? Yes. This is a shit story. Violence begets violence? Yes, this is a base level concept that many stories use but builder deeper themes and characters on top to become great. TLOU2 is basic shit."

Inuyashiki Last Hero,"The podcast is genuinely unbearable, he sounds incredibly pretentious."
Inuyashiki Last Hero,[removed]
Inuyashiki Last Hero,Joel is absolutely the bad guy in this situation. We understand and feel for him cause we are watching his perspective but if we watched an entirely different character up until they are brutally murdered by this stranger Joel at the hospital we’d absolutely look at him as the villain. He made a selfish (understandably) choice.
Inuyashiki Last Hero,"I'm not sure I understand the distinction you're making. I'd say The Last of Us 1&2 absolutely acknowledge and question the impact of how someone responds to their emotions/instincts, and the alternatives to acting off instinct or emotion. The games (and this first season of the show) are constantly questioning the morality of characters actions, especially when their reasons for acting may be sympathetic or instinctive.

What exactly is it you think this IP has critiqued that even has a solution? What has it not encouraged a dialogue for?"
Inuyashiki Last Hero,"I was taught this quite effectively in GCSE English in the 90s. We read a piece of prose about a military officer getting chocolate for his daughter on his way home from work during a terrible war in winter.

It was a wholesome, but boring, story.

After we'd finished reading it the teacher asked us what the ""snow"" could be. It was worded in such a way it wasn't obvious. Then they explained - he's on his way home from the Concentration Camps. The ""snow"" was the ash of corpses he'd ordered be burnt.

The story and it's allusions suddenly made MUCH more sense. It was a 'wholesome' story but with one hell of a fucking kick.

We were all stunned. This guy who we'd all decided was a wholesome dad going about his day and getting his sweet daugther a chocolate bar during this terrible war. Turned out to be a fucking Nazi Deathcamp leader.

It was a real eye opener and has stayed with me for 25 years."

Inuyashiki Last Hero,The game's fanbase has been arguing about it for 10 years now.  Is there a particular reason you think the show will be any different?
Inuyashiki Last Hero,"I thought Joel was straight-up evil in the finale, but you don’t think his actions were “negative?!”"
Inuyashiki Last Hero,">Nobody watching is going to be unsympathetic to the calls made by the characters here

Yes, that's called protagonist bias and some of the most interesting media being made lately is about confronting that and recognizing that other perspectives outside the one presented to you as the most sympathetic are just as valid. 

It's always interesting to me how many struggle with that while being simultaneously angry that the media confronting that... is about that. ""Why are they trying to tell me violence and revenge are bad?"" They shout as they miss the point entirely and defend Joel as if those he's murdered don't have equally valid lives and families.

That's not to say that those who want a shallow reading or story of good guys v. bad guys are wrong for wanting that but it does feel weird to be angry at the story for digging deeper.

EDIT: You deleted your reply so I'll leave my response here: 

>to possibly save a bunch of people who are essentially abstract concepts

But this again misses the point of protagonist bias.

You are asking the narrative to spoonfeed why someone should care about faceless people when the point is that you should care regardless.

The value of the cure is in its possibility, not its certainty. Life doesn't have value because you are told how and why those lives are sympathetic."
Inuyashiki Last Hero,"Highly disagree, >!there was an actual plan for the cure this time!< so fuck him and what he did"
Inuyashiki Last Hero,I’m sorry I don’t understand what you’re saying. Can you explain this to me again while not sounding like a psychopath?
Inuyashiki Last Hero,"It’s honestly so similar that it’s hard not to. 

Same thing happens with book adaptions except most people on reddit play games more than they read books. 

The last of us hbo subreddit has a show or game spoilers thread though if you want to be able to discuss in peace.

/r/thelastofusHBOseries"
Inuyashiki Last Hero,"For those who have played the second game, it’s next to impossible to even discuss the finale and what might be next with those who don’t know the story.

Given their context and details, the spoilers are nearly unavoidable. Easier to simply say nothing than even try to be vague or play dumb—which is it’s own kind of frustrating for fans wanting to talk about it.

Not sure how people will go in Season 2 without knowing some of the bigger plot points.

Though, if you do, props to you. It will be quite the feat."
Inuyashiki Last Hero,"They follow the game story dot for dot when making this story which isv extremely rare. It means you can actually join in the conversation with the players too. After all, the show is made for people who didn't play the game and that's pretty neat because now we're both enjoying the content. That being said .. I love 2 way more than 1 so buckle up!"
Inuyashiki Last Hero,"You know, having ADHD isn’t always great, but I forget things so easily I basically can’t be spoiled. 

That being said, so far as I’m aware, studies have shown spoilers don’t diminish the enjoyment of a piece of media."
Inuyashiki Last Hero,What?
Inuyashiki Last Hero,They do though? There’s not many show only threads but they are there.
Inuyashiki Last Hero,...they do have show only threads
Inuyashiki Last Hero,Rekt
Inuyashiki Last Hero,"I think it can easily be the morally right thing to do.

Murdering people who are already incapacitated is not morally right to me. killing the doctor is not a morally right thing either.

But I wouldn’t sacrifice a child to save humanity who has adapted to the new world order.

I would allow her to sacrifice herself though. That’s the other thing Joel is guilty of, but so are the fireflies."
Inuyashiki Last Hero,There are plenty of ethical arguments that what the Fireflies tried to do is horrible. Not saying its some settled debate but wouldn’t be surprised if other people with medical training wouldn’t be appalled by the operation itself and the way it was handled.
Inuyashiki Last Hero,"It's the cost of love. As a parent, I would do **anything** to protect my children. The love a parent has for their kids is so primal. I didn't understand until my first child was born. Something just switches in people."
Inuyashiki Last Hero,"No, what’s selfish is asking someone to sacrifice their “family” member just so your bloodline can continue"
Inuyashiki Last Hero,The game made it more of a “it’s you or me” situation. The show presented it as him mowing down crowd’s without resistance.
Inuyashiki Last Hero,"Right but you are killing them in your mindset and my mindset was completing the game. As you said, a function of the game is plowing down henchmen albeit with limited resources.

In the show, we get a stronger notion of how unhinged/determined Joel is when it comes to protecting Ellie. We also get a distinction on who it is he’s killing.

I don’t recall a point in the game where someone is sincerely begging for mercy and incapacitated. When they begged then it was either a cutscene or a ruse iirc. 

The weight of it just feels heavier watching it for me."
Inuyashiki Last Hero,"I would say, to amend Mazin’s statement, good stories are built around tension, and that can come in the form of inter-character tension, like tlou, or intra-character tension, like lotr."
Inuyashiki Last Hero,"Yea that seems like a nothing statement to me. It basically amounts to ""can you turn the themes of your stories and internal struggles of your characters into marketable taglines catered to people who engage with media on a surface level"".

Cause ""It's worth killing everyone to save the person you love"" is the absolute shallow end. It's what conservative preppers dream about when they buy guns."
Inuyashiki Last Hero,"Well, there was also the “destroy evil on middle-earth” part too haha but yes I agree."
Inuyashiki Last Hero,">I wish more people actually debated this right here instead of all the excuses about how what Joel did ""isn't actually that bad""

Lol, that is the debate. You feel differently than those people. You sound like you're just wishing everyone agrees with you tbh

This type of story is going to fracture opinions and split ideals. Some people will justify each action Joel made, not realizing it, seeing the lines he is crossing. Others will be horrified and want him to stop. Some will be cheering him on like he is dad of the year, and others will never look at him the same way.

It's a complicated story that has a ton of varied responses from viewers. That's it's strength imo"
Inuyashiki Last Hero,Isn't Druckmann listed as the only writer for the first game?
Inuyashiki Last Hero,neil is the sole credited writer for the first game
Inuyashiki Last Hero,"I loved it. It's refreshing to see the thought process of the creators. Not everyone's cup of tea I guess, but I don't see how he's more pretentious than anyone else deeply connected to a story would be."
Inuyashiki Last Hero,"Everyone in that hospital was actively conspiring to murder Ellie.  They weren't exactly innocent themselves.

Joel wasn't necessarily ""right"" but it's meant to be ambiguous and I do not understand why people act like it's black and white."
Inuyashiki Last Hero,">The game's fanbase has been arguing about it for 10 years now.

Eh. Ish. Like, people talk about it being morally complicated, but... it's not, really, it's more a bit of spice in the characters. Would anyone ever believe Joel might choose differently? People see it as something that humanises him far, far more likely than they see him as a monster for it. Would people have actually preferred he let shit play out otherwise? I doubt it.

And even if we go with the now clearer idea the cure would work, for example, how much of a difference that would make to this world isn't exactly clear cut. In making such a big deal of the human factional conflict and inevitable grimdarkness of everything in this world, and minimising the gameplay sections (ie the bits where we actually see how dangerous the infected are), the show has made the fungus a secondary problem, so the supposed stakes don't quite stand up. If everybody got immunised tomorrow, it would change very little for a long time."
Inuyashiki Last Hero,"I mean idk.. taking so many lives like he did definitely is bad but am I crazy for feeling like he was justified in doing so? I'm not saying it was right what he did or moral but I wouldn't go as far as to say that it was pure evil. They attack him and Ellie(loves her like a daughter) with stun grenades, knock him out with a rifle, say they are killing his daughter without her consent for a chance at a cure that might not even work and if he tries to go to her they will kill him. Everyone he kills minus the 1 doctor has ARs and are actively trying to kill him to stop him from getting to Ellie. Killing the lead surgeon who was defenseless was the only real issue I had with what he did. That and obviously lying about what happened to Ellie. Marlene would have eventually come after Ellie and was pointing a gun at Joel threatening his life.

If he had left and nothing positive came out of Ellie's murder(yes that's what it would have been) it would have haunted him to his deathbed and completely destroyed him that he didn't save her when he could have just like he didn't save his own daughter. I really believe the situation would have gone completely differently had the doctors given Ellie the choice and let her help Joel understand that this is what she wanted. He would have had closure and Ellie would have had agency over her decision. That and trying other alternatives before moving to something so drastic"
Inuyashiki Last Hero,There’s nothing evil about saving a little girl from being murdered. Joel did nothing wrong.
Inuyashiki Last Hero,"TIL defending your children is considered evil.

There’s a saying that eludes me right now, but it’s something like any parent would rather let the world burn than lose their child."
Inuyashiki Last Hero,"While I don’t think killing people is a thing I could do, I would never allow the use of a kid in the way they did either.

In the game the killing is far easier then actually seeing it in the drama though. 

Still there is no question in my mind that fireflies were wrong unless they specifically asked Ellie which they did not."
Inuyashiki Last Hero,Need a cure for the 2 groups of infected he ran into throughout a cross country expedition?
Inuyashiki Last Hero,It's more that people just outright post spoilers
Inuyashiki Last Hero,Are you sure it followed the game dot for dot??
Inuyashiki Last Hero,I hate spoilers. It takes the excitement and surprise out of watching a show.
Inuyashiki Last Hero,Then why is everyone bitching about spoilers?
Inuyashiki Last Hero,"I think it's fascinating because Ellie makes it pretty abundantly clear that given the choice, she would absolutely sacrifice herself and Joel knew that. To me, it's even doubly selfish that he *knows* what path she would choose and he took that choice away from her. And he *knows* what he did was wrong, otherwise he wouldnt have lied to her. Joel is a broken selfish man and it's engaging as fuck."
Inuyashiki Last Hero,"I feel like they knew they were going about this the wrong way too. By sedating her and immediately going for the surgery, they purposely robbed her of the choice so she couldn't say no, so they wouldn't have to put down a screaming child. That's absolutely monstrous, even if the outcome was a positive for humanity."
Inuyashiki Last Hero,"> But I wouldn’t sacrifice a child to save humanity who has adapted to the new world order.

I think that's an incredibly naive thing to say since you haven't lived through an apocalypse. Would people who think it's normal to see their loved ones killed by infected feel the same way as people who post on reddit from the safety of their own homes?"
Inuyashiki Last Hero,It's one thing if they were 100% sure they could make a cure out of killing her. But they seemed more desperate and clinging to the last illusion of hope they have. There is also the fact that the fireflies won't give the cure for free and will use it to gain power and replace the government.
Inuyashiki Last Hero,It’s more than just the bloodline of the ff it’s all bloodlines potentially
Inuyashiki Last Hero,You mean like mankind has been doing for millions of years with war? Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians are offering their children up right now to try and preserve the tribe.
Inuyashiki Last Hero,"Most of the people he killed had assault rifles and were actively trying to kill him.  The only really ""unjustifable"" kill, at least onscreen, was the guy who tried to put down his gun."
Inuyashiki Last Hero,Retcon
Inuyashiki Last Hero,100% agree. They did great with that. Humanizing the enemy. It was impactful with the kid that Ellie paralyzed and Joel killed. Having him beg for his life and call out for his mom was brutal.
Inuyashiki Last Hero,"Yeah, and I don't mean to be overly-critical. I'm not a writer and I didn't study it, and sometimes these quotes are taken out of context."
Inuyashiki Last Hero,"> Lol, that is the debate.

No, it's a different debate. Instead of asking if it's morally right for Joel to doom the world to protect his family, instead the debate is switched to ""Joel was actually saving the world"" or ""Joel knew the cure wouldn't work!""

Stuff like ""the Fireflies mishandled the whole situation"" falls under the original debate. Things like ""Well the cure wasn't likely anyway"" is moving away from the original debate to just flat out saying murder is okay because the cure would fail"
Inuyashiki Last Hero,"Yes.

Game Director: Bruce Straley

Creative Director: Neil Druckmann

Written By: Neil Druckmann

https://www.mobygames.com/game/60922/the-last-of-us/credits/ps3/"
Inuyashiki Last Hero,"If you go by the game credits, Neil was in charge of the story and is credited as creative director and Written By, and Bruce Straley handled the gameplay side. If you go by what people online say, Bruce reigned in some of Neil's narrative choices to improve it to the story we wound up with in the final product. 

Where the truth lays? I don't know. But yes, Neil is credited as the sole creative contributor.

Edit - Not sure what I said to upset people; the credits are what they are."
Inuyashiki Last Hero,Glad you enjoyed it. Guess I just have a different perspective working in the film industry with these types. Wish we had heard more from the other co-creator who actually made the game.
Inuyashiki Last Hero,"No one’s acting like it’s black and white and being a bad or good guy is completely subjective. In the story that’s being told here Joel essentially took away the chance to have “literally” saved humanity because he couldn’t handle losing Ellie. His actions are absolutely understandable but he still fucked over others to have his way. The hospital/fireflies weren’t conspiring to murder Ellie, what a dumb and absolutely ridiculous way to phrase them trying to make a cure that could save mankind. Putting aside whether it would work or the logistics of it the point is they had noble means and Joel is the opposite. His actions were selfish and could have ultimately doomed the world. It’s not black and white but he’s absolutely “narrative term here” the bad guy in this situation and even by saying that I understand his motivations and actions. You can still root for and respect the bad guys actions. It’s not at all ambiguous, it’s a moral debate. I don’t think you understand the term ambiguous."
Inuyashiki Last Hero,Why the downvotes?
Inuyashiki Last Hero,"> Would anyone ever believe Joel might choose differently?  

That's not the question posed, it's whether Joel was justified in his actions or was he completely and unwaveringly selfish or even both. You're not supposed to question whether he should've made a different decision (I don't think he ever would and that's why in the game you aren't given the choice) but question whether he is justified in his actions (which I do not)."
Inuyashiki Last Hero,"I don't have much sympathy for the Fireflies at all for the reasons you give, but also because I have zero confidence in them to actual accomplish anything. They are NOT a competent resistance group, the Fireflies and I have no faith in their ability to generate a cure. Even if they managed to, how would they distribute it?

Killing the surgeon was easily the most questionable thing Joel did (and certainly will come back to haunt him depending how close they follow the second game in the future), but frankly, the surgeon was something of a dumbass. I was laughing at the guy when he was put down.

""How did you get in here?""

He just did a John Wick and slaughtered all your mooks. Did you not hear the gunfire?

""I won't let you take her!""

Again, he just took down a dozen guys and is here with a gun. You're giving his daughter to him or...oh, never mind, he just shot you."
Inuyashiki Last Hero,"I gotta agree, have you ever seen anything about a game called Lisa: The Painful? Similar premise, but I feel it does a better job with the toxic love question. While also giving the daughter character agency to maker her own choices"
Inuyashiki Last Hero,"he only slaughtered countless men, including several that were trying to surrender and pleading for their live. He shot the doctor in the head without flinching, when he didnt have to. He shot and killed Marlene, who was also actively trying to reason with him. 

""nothing wrong"" lol"
Inuyashiki Last Hero,"You're insane if you really think that 

Like I get rationalizing Joel's act because you love Joel but saying he did NOTHING wrong at all is just outright evil shit."
Inuyashiki Last Hero,And he robbed countless of lives from being saved and cured with a vaccine.
Inuyashiki Last Hero,"Evil is a strong word, but everyone is the hero of their own story and the villain in someone else's. Loads of people aren't going to give a shit how much Joel loves Ellie (who they would happily point out is not actually 'his'), while their own children and millions of others are dying. To them he is the bad guy. Maybe even evil."
Inuyashiki Last Hero,"People think crossing an arbitrary border to save your child's life is evil, why the surprise here?"
Inuyashiki Last Hero,That's not his child!
My Sassy Girl,"Wait, season 3 of Kingdom?  I didn't know season 3 was confirmed!  My body is ready for more fancy hats."
My Sassy Girl,[deleted]
My Sassy Girl,Shit MSG was released 18 years ago.
My Sassy Girl,I am in the minority but I hated My Sassy Girl. All the comedy came from the girl abusing the boy. I guess we were supposed to find it endearing but I didn't like it at all.
My Sassy Girl,[deleted]
My Sassy Girl,Me too !  What a great fucking show.
My Sassy Girl,"Because it isn't confirmed yet.   
From the article:

>Regarding the reports about Jun Ji Hyun taking part in a third season of the drama the agency said, “The production has not been confirmed, but if it is confirmed and we are given an offer, we will positively review it.”  
>  
>A source from Netflix also shared, “The production of ‘Kingdom’ season three has not been confirmed yet.”"
My Sassy Girl,"i heard that it was one season that went long so the split it in half, this is great news."
My Sassy Girl,Is she really one of the more expensive TV actresses still? Hasn't been too relevant lately right?
My Sassy Girl,"It's very Korean and very 2000s. It doesn't really fly anymore these days probably, but I found it one of the best romcoms I've ever seen."
My Sassy Girl,Yes. I didn't like that movie as much as I thought. Feels dated. But I'll watch anything from JJH. She is capable of turning a mediocre material into a highly entertaining stuff just by being there.
My Sassy Girl,"The boy was a consensual adult though. Isn't that fine?

If you thought there was abuse in My Sassy Girl I wonder how you'd respond after watching Love me if you dare, another great rom com.

PS It's a dream of mine to meet someone with the audacity to say that the sky is blue because they willed it."
My Sassy Girl,"I'm 100% with you.  I watched it because it was on my ""great movies"" list, but gave it a 2/10.  I hated it but it was at least competently made."
My Sassy Girl,Indeed. I don't get the praise it has gained. It's like Superbad for me. It's not bad but it's nothing to write home about. Well you get out of movie what you bring into it and there was a complete disconnect for me.
My Sassy Girl,Season 2 is out?!?!?!
My Sassy Girl,This is what I get for not reading the article.
My Sassy Girl,She's still very relevant after starring in 2 top rated and very popular dramas and winning several awards. Still one of the top actresses in SK.
My Sassy Girl,[deleted]
My Sassy Girl,"Oh I love tha movie. It's gonna get roast like crazy if it's out nowadays, I found it so funny and romantic."
My Sassy Girl,The subway scene is just so funny.
My Sassy Girl,Sorry I misread I thought this said The Last Kingdom.
My Sassy Girl,Woo-Hee Chun was great in the one movie I saw her in. My personal favorite being Kim Tae-Ri though.
My Sassy Girl,Destiny is all.

My Sassy Girl,The trust fund bit was by far my favorite.
My Sassy Girl,"The whole bit with James where everyone just assumes he's gay, no matter how many times he insists otherwise."
My Sassy Girl,I love the show. So many hilarious moments. Sister Michael is fucking brilliant.
My Sassy Girl,"Watch Orla. Orla in the background, reacting, is brilliant."
My Sassy Girl,Remember that police scene with Liam Neeson. Oh for suffering Jesus
My Sassy Girl,"I think one of my favorite moments is in season one when Colm is over for dinner. 

He’s going on about something and they think he’s done talking, he starts up again, and Ma Mary just goes “Jesus wept” under her breath. 

Their dry, Irish humor is just so fantastic! I know the show is focused on the kids, but the comedy from all the adults involved just cracks me UP."
My Sassy Girl,"There’s a holiday special Bake Off episode with them, it’s a must watch."
My Sassy Girl,"I need to catch up on Seasons 2 and 3. Season 1 has some great lines. I like the end of episode 1 when they all get called into Sister Michael's office:

Michelle: ""Nobody actually gets expelled. Rhonda Gallagher hasn't even been expelled and she's in the IRA.""

Erin: ""I'd say that's probably why.""

Then Clare dobs them all in:

Clare: So it had nothing to do with me! Yes, okay, I was there. I admit that, but I didn't do anything. It was Michelle. It was all Michelle. I'm not going down for something I didn't do. If anyone deserves to get punished, it should be Michelle.

Sister Michael: Well I think it's safe to say, we all just lost a bit of respect for you there, Clare."
My Sassy Girl,"James gets hate online?! He’s so nice to everyone though, I don’t see a reason to hate him. I think I teared up when he was about to leave but ended up staying"
My Sassy Girl,As someone who is Irish and grew up in the 80s/90s (80s baby) it definitely was nostalgic and brought out some big feelings and big laughs. I can related too well to some bits and cringed. Lol. But I think they also captured the troubles well and how it affected their lives.
My Sassy Girl,"The Uncle Colm with Liam Neeson scene was the best. I had never laughed this hard before. 

And the show in itself is incredibly well written. 10/10 will recommend"
My Sassy Girl,What business have you with Seamus!?
My Sassy Girl,"""everyone keeps using the word wee for things that aren't even very small!"" 

-James"
My Sassy Girl,I think I like Gerry (the dad) and Joe (the grandad) the best. I think they have some of the best lines or encounters. With each other and with other characters.
My Sassy Girl,"My favorite ep is when Mary ""killed"" her Aunt 😂 Almost died laughing lol

*""How's the wicked witch of the northwest?""*

Other fave quotes:

""Killing nuns now, is it?"" 

""WINKING? At your age?! Christ, I feel SICK!""

*When Erin thought Claire was into her when she came out as a lesbian* ""I'm not interested in you like that, look at the state of you"""
My Sassy Girl,"The bit with James in the chippy is hilarious. The way he says ITS MUCH, MUCH TOO GREASY! and the faces on the other girls crack me up. I think Orla even covers her ears.

And of course Dennis' GET OUT! 

Sister Micheal is a blessing. The way she hates Father Peter. Dose!"
My Sassy Girl,Orla is hilarious. Her dance act where she just stepped up onto a single step was beautiful
My Sassy Girl,"Uncle Colm is my favourite, just phenomenal dead pan. 

It reminds me so much of A Moody Christmas an Australian mini series with a similar Uncle Terry character who cannot stop giving people street directions or enquiring about which route they took to get there. Another show that captures a particular cultural ‘normal’ view of life."
My Sassy Girl,"“Am I dead? Is this my wake?” 
Love that show"
My Sassy Girl,"This is a fact.

It’s 3 perfect seasons - with a 12/10 finale bit

It’s wholesome and sad and funny and perfect"
My Sassy Girl,"i’ve re watched the first two seasons probably at least 20 times in the past year and a half. it’s easy to just have on repeat and play in the background. it’s short and sweet, but i’m still catching things i missed. truly an amazing show!!!"
My Sassy Girl,"Yes, the show has so much to offer. Satisfying character development, laughs abound and of course some sweet tender looks at the humanity of the family during “The Troubles”. Very unique."
My Sassy Girl,"It’s one of the best pilots of any show. 

James not being able to use the teachers bathroom. The old nun that steals from the girls and then Michelle’s mom saying “sorry I’m late they shut down the bridge. I told them to let me risk it but didn’t”"
My Sassy Girl,"Having grown up in that part of the world at that time  (I'm a couple of years older than the characters portrayed in the show) there are many wee details that are absolutely spot on.

For example, in one episode there is a mention of a kebab shop in Coleraine - Abrakebabra. Well that was a real place that a mate of mine ran...."
My Sassy Girl,Love Sister Michael!!
My Sassy Girl,"I was recently thinking uncle Colm's monologue about Tommy Duddy eating paper is one of the funniest things I've seen in a long time, I was genuinely howling at that"
My Sassy Girl,truly one of the funniest and best shows in recent memory.  husband and i had to watch with subtitles on since we're american.  it managed to take a difficult and dark situation and make it absolutely hilarious -- charming and beautiful and bittersweet.  all the characters and the actors who played them were phenomenal.  i wish more of my friends would watch this so i could talk about it with them.
My Sassy Girl,I’ve been to Ireland twice to see family and explore and during my last trip while in Derry we caught them filming the episode the president visited lol. It was an awesome experience and now whenever I show people the episode I tell them “I was right there off screen!” Lol
My Sassy Girl,"I ugly-cried at the series finale- I was totally incapacitated. The perfect blend of hope, trepidation, and just extreme sadness to realize the toll that the troubles have taken on their adolescence - a transformative bit of TV."
My Sassy Girl,"It took me like 2 years, but when I finally gave it a chance, it had some really solid moments, and reminds me a lot of Father Ted in the comedic delivery and hijinx"
My Sassy Girl,Probably the best comedic written show since Arrested Development. It bums me out that I only know like 2 other people that have watched it
My Sassy Girl,"I’m American, but was in High School (catholic all girls high school, even) during the early 90’s, so this show is absolutely gold to me. 

The writing is brilliant, the actors are phenomenal, and it’s just so, so fucking funny. I’ve watched the whole thing through countless times, and I always find something new to laugh at."
My Sassy Girl,I agree I love Derry girls one of the funniest shows. I binged the first two season when I was sick with Covid and it cheered me up like no other show could. Also I think Sister michael is one best characters on any sitcom ever.
My Sassy Girl,Now that it's over I need Derry Girls to become like The Sopranos where every discussion thread just devolves in to exchanging quotes because they make me so happy.
My Sassy Girl,i want more Sister Michael.
My Sassy Girl,"Just started this last, loved the first episode"
My Sassy Girl,Uncle Colm telling the story of having his car stolen…. Brilliant!
My Sassy Girl,Sister George Michael stole the show.
My Sassy Girl,Show is absolutely cracker
My Sassy Girl,"It really is amazing.  A sitcom about ordinary people in extraordinary times, funny in an intensely feminine way, just very very special.  I did feel like the last season lost a little bit of the perfection of the first two, as the stories got a little zanier (>!accidentally helping rob a school, getting sent across the border to clean up a house that felt haunted, planning an elaborately fancy 18th birthday party, going on TV to get backstage passes and then a parent dying, and honestly even the letter getting to Chelsea Clinton, which was a scene that's not likely to age as well as the rest of the show!<) and it felt less like ordinary life.  Regardless, BRILLIANT show and the >!voting!< storyline in the finale coupled with music choices that echoed the first episode's were absolutely brilliant, beautiful, ending on a real high."
My Sassy Girl,"I'm Australian and get tired very quickly of most US and UK comedy shows. Will always jump onto anything from a different English-speaking country that's offering something different. The Young Offenders (another Irish comedy) scratched that itch a few years ago and I still miss it. Derry Girls was a lockdown discovery that really got to me. Grew up during the 90's, so the soundtrack was 'chefs kiss'. 

It's a very different vibe, but I strongly recommend you check out Rosehaven. If you enjoy watching the hijinx of good friends living in a land that is foreign to you, Rosehaven is a delight. NZ is kicking Australia's ass when it comes to comedy lately, but Rosehaven is a timeless classic that will warm your heart. Two best friends writing, directing and acting as two best friends in a rural Australian town. Kinda like a far less crazy Schitt's Creek."
My Sassy Girl,100% agree. It's just a perfect encapsulation of time.
My Sassy Girl,Orla’s belief that lesbians were mythical creatures was one of the funniest through lines in any comedy episode I’ve watched.
My Sassy Girl,"The last season was so, so good! I'm so sad to see it go, but I think they ended it flawlessly."
My Sassy Girl,"One of the best series of the year, they are amazing, very smart way to connect the history to young audience, insanely funny and great cast."
My Sassy Girl,I love their accent
My Sassy Girl,"I agree with this whole heartedly. I saw a review for Derry Girls one that said it can make you nostalgic for a time and place you never lived, and that is so true. I've told myself ""it's illegal to be sad while watching Derry Girls,"" so it's something I've often put on when I'm feeling down as a pick me up. Reading these comments has me on the verge of tears with the desire to watch the show over for the first time, but instead, I'll have to survive with a rewatch. Uncle Colm stole the show at the police department and have used the phrase ""the wee lesbian"" soooo many times."
My Sassy Girl,Fuck-a-doodle-doo!
My Sassy Girl,Derry Girls and Father Ted are Ireland’s contributions to the pantheon of great TV.
My Sassy Girl,"It's really great, I wish we got more but I'll take it."
My Sassy Girl,Love it
My Sassy Girl,I can't believe I just got into this show and now it's over.
My Sassy Girl,"ETA to correct title of a recommendation 

It’s well written and has a great ensemble cast. They work really well together.  Michelle, Uncle Colm and Sister Michael are my favorites for different reasons 

If you enjoyed it, the same writer wrote London Irish which is pretty funny as well. A few of the same cast show up."
My Sassy Girl,"I really enjoyed it. But I'd be happy if they never revisit it. It really felt like they had a story that would take three seasons to tell and they told it, which imo is a lot better than just trying to keep making more episodes until it gets shit or people stop watching.   


Having said that I wouldn't complain if they did do more. That episode on the train where they couldn't figure out who the woman is was fucking gold."
My Sassy Girl,What are ya? Some sort of reverse paedophile?
My Sassy Girl,I’m a Derry Girl!!!!
My Sassy Girl,"I went to Catholic H.S. in the late 70's/early 80's in the USA and I feel like I went to school with these girls. 

No bombs, but the nuns and such are pretty accurate."
My Sassy Girl,"The relationship between Gerry and his FIL is my favourite thing. I love how it balances the lives of teenagers and the importance of the events happening around them, like the announcement of a ceasefire happening when they’re all off celebrating their prom."
My Sassy Girl,That's all well and good but when does the killer clown show up?
My Sassy Girl,100%.  it's fantastic.
My Sassy Girl,Such a great show. Just threw on the first ep on a whim and ended up binging the whole thing.
My Sassy Girl,"I agree, this show is fantastic. A film would be a great idea!"
My Sassy Girl,I loved it very much truly heartfelt and hilarious
My Sassy Girl,Brilliant show. One of those rare gems where every single actor steals every scene they’re in. That’s a rare trick and a treat to watch.
My Sassy Girl,I just started and it's a treat.
My Sassy Girl,You aren’t wrong there. I mean the show just has absolutely no misses. Every single episode is at least a 7/10.
My Sassy Girl,"Also, if you havent seen it, please check out Detectorists. Its another quirky show thats really heart-warming and 'cozy'. I think you'll like it!"
My Sassy Girl,i’m here for any and all poetic ruminations about this amazing show.
My Sassy Girl,"Yes to everything you said!

I am not sure I'd call it the best of all time, but it definitely gets  a place in my heart.

I also love to see a show about girls being human. They're not sexualized, they're not afraid to not be sexy and ever-cool. They're just normal humans. We need more shows like that in the US, because teens absolutely model what they see on TV.

I am not part of any Derry Girls discussion groups, so I didn't know James gets a lot of hate. I love him, he's obviously such a sweet guys, even with the mercilesscondemnation for being English. But the jokes about him are hilarious."
My Sassy Girl,Agreed 100%! When they performed as the Spice Girls I lost it 😂
My Sassy Girl,"I saw the cast on the Great British Baking Show and thought they had great chemistry, so I decided to watch Derry Girls. I’m almost done but I absolutely love it! The characters are so well written and hilarious. Michelle is definitely my favorite."
My Sassy Girl,The actresses show up for a Great British Bakeoff Christmas special that's pretty fun too.
My Sassy Girl,I am orla
My Sassy Girl,"My favorite episode is the one in S3 with Orla dancing her whole way home. It just cracks me up how in her own world she is, and she creates the little dance numbers."
My Sassy Girl,"Loved the relationship between Da Gerry and Joe. At first you think Gerry's just a doormat. Then you notice he puts up with the abuse because he loves his wife and daughters that much. Then you realzie he can see right through Joe, and has the respect to allow an old, emotionally-constricted man his dignity."

The Casketeers,"Some of the sketches are awfully tinny, though. I really like the woody ones."
The Casketeers,"I became a Monty Python fan in the mid-1970's, when the local PBS station aired the show at 10:00pm Saturday nights. I now have the series and the movies on DVD, and most of their albums and books about the show."
The Casketeers,"There are a lot of sketches that don’t translate well, but the great ones are still great regardless of the era. There were zwei peanuts walking down der strasse."
The Casketeers,"I think one of the greatest part of Monty Python is that very rarely (if at all) they re-use the same characters, punchlines, sketches, familiar patterns etc. as many other comedy/sketch shows do. They just constantly make up new stuff and characters and break the pattern whenever they just can. 


I probably get downvoted to hell for saying this, but that's why I dislike The Fast Show - especially compared to Python it's just awfully boring, unfunny, predictable and repetitive. Never understood what's so funny about that show."
The Casketeers,"I liked the show.  On one of the films were the baby is born and the parent asks if it is a boy or girl?  And the doctor says it's too soon to be putting roles onto the baby?  It hits home today.

And the Life of Brian when they mock repeating stuff in Church services makes me laugh whenever they do readings in my church.

It's when I got older some of the stuff they did in films and there tv show hits home"
The Casketeers,I saw them live at The City Center in NY in the 5th grade in the 70's. A life changing experience. Terry Jones and John Cleese were 3 feet away from me for the Albatross bit.
The Casketeers,How did you like Mrs Niggerbaiter explodes sketch ?
The Casketeers,My dream is that his family name be spelled out in r/AskOuija
The Casketeers,"Yup, it was great. Smoke a bowl at 9:45, then another at 11:30 for SNL, then we had Don Kirshner's Rock Concert."
The Casketeers,"I discovered Python in the 90s when I watched a copy of Holy Grail in my university library. It was hell of an experience trying to hold back laughter, still one of the funniest movies I’ve ever watched."
The Casketeers,"I pondered upon it. The exploding part was hilarious. Sure the world has changed since the 70s. We are talking 50 years later and such sketches will be tricky in present times. It worked back then, let it stay there and not bring it here.

Given that the Pythons are such Nihilist Beings, they won't and shouldn't care.

In the words of John Cleese *Now for something completely different*"
The Casketeers,hahahah....sounds familiar! Smoking during the 11 pm news for SNL with my BFF!
The Casketeers,The take your pick sketch was pretty cringey as well racism wise.
The Casketeers,"Even if the show was canceled, there's no way it'd be permanent. They'd wait just long enough for people to get nostalgic and forget what they were complaining about with it, and then reboot it back onto the air. Even that though, I don't think we're anywhere close to."
The Casketeers,"You need to chill out a bit. Ratings wise, Series 12 has ended up with the same kind of ratings that Series 10 ended up with, and those ratings aren't within cancellation territory.

> Do online users have ANY influence on whether a show gets cancelled or not, **or am I just delusional?** I don’t understand it! 

Yes, you are."
The Casketeers,"I really don't think the BBC is prepared to lose it, it's probably easily among their top money makers in terms of shows.

Other shows they make might get more viewers, but I've rarely seen merchandise for them."
The Casketeers,">Doctor Who’s end is on the horizon, Jodie Whittaker and Chris Chibnall will be seen as the people who killed Doctor Who.

Yeah, no.

The show has been at death's door many times, and all it takes is a new Doctor and showrunner to get it back on its feet. The only thing that killed it in the 80s was the BBC's controller hating the show. But today's BBC isn't that dumb. They know they have a cash cow and will continue to milk it.


So, enough of the internet melodrama. It means nothing."
The Casketeers,Waaaaaa. You really need to get a life.
The Casketeers,"Doctor Who is probably more popular now, and brinigng in more money, than it ever has. Ther is no danger of it going anywhere.

Series 12 was pulling \~5-6million UK viewer weekly. Similar to Series 9, 10. Series 11 was a bit higher, often pulling in over 7 million. Going back to Smith era or Tennant it sat 608 million UK viewrs. but viewing practices have changed significantly in the past 10-15 years.

And international viewership has only increased in that time. And international funding. Doctor Who is now a giant cahs cow for the BBC and BBC USA and others. They aren't getting rid of that anytime soon.

As for people complaining: Thats been the case for 50+ years. Complaining about Doctor Who is a favourite past time of Doctor Who fans."
The Casketeers,why the hell would Jodie Whitaker be blacklisted
The Casketeers,"*”Do online users have any day..”*

That’s a weird yes/no answer to be frank; sometimes writers will appease the masses of online bloodthirsty trolls or whatever but sometimes they’ll also utilize what people say online and poke fun at the situation.

Yes, there have been shows that have been canceled due to internet culture but they merely get less airtime basically (take Paw Patrol for instance, it’s still available).

It’s an arbitrary way to put it, but how the film/video industry works is an ever changing battlefield of appeasing the networks and people who buy the contracts, etc.

That’s as best as I can answer losesly to your question.

(Big Dr. Who fan and I love each doctor equally, albeit Eckelstein? wasn’t my most favorite to be honest, the acting was kinda dry and he just moved on from another series that was more serious if I recall? I like the new female doctor as it gives the show some new sound and feel, although others may view that differently and I accept the fact this may make some upset. I’m not a serious fandom kinda guy, but I appreciate when artists add some changes.)"
The Casketeers,"There's no chance it'll get canceled for good, or even just for more than a couple years. It'll still be running when you're elderly, and you'll still be complaining about it. It's profitable and it's a valuable cultural export/soft power supply for the UK; the BBC isn't getting rid of it."
The Casketeers,">Do online users have ANY influence on whether a show gets cancelled or not

No, they don't."
The Casketeers,"Jodie is good, the show is still good. Doctor who is going to be fine. Stop acting like it's the end of the world because you don't like the recent doctor. It'll reboot in a couple years like it always does and maybe you'll like the next one.

These overdramatic whiney posts are worse than anything that the show has done recently."
The Casketeers,"Dr Who has died before, yet was revived by Ecclestone et al

And, anyways - it *has* been running (on and off) for ***60*** yrs  
Just how long do you think a tv show ought to run for?"
The Casketeers,Doesn't seem to me that hte cast is the problem.  THe writing has just been kind of lame the last few years.
The Casketeers,"I miss Doctor Who since Matt Smith departed from the series. I liked Capaldi, but the stories weren't engaging. I abandoned the series when Clara left the story.

Everything after Capaldi is ridiculously bad."
The Casketeers,"> So, enough of the internet melodrama. It means nothing.

It ESPECIALLY means nothing when you consider that in October 2019 [it was announced](http://www.comicon.com/2019/10/29/the-bbcs-hbo-max-deal-yields-two-additional-seasons-of-doctor-who/) that the deal signed between the BBC and HBO Max meant that not only would all of NuWho be available on the then-not-yet-debuted HBO Max service (it launched May 2020), but that HBO Max owners WarnerMedia/AT&T would be providing money to help fund production of Doctor Who for the 12th Series (which actually had already been produced at that time and came out in early 2020), the 13th Series (which is both delayed and shortened to 8 episodes due to the pandemic, but is coming out later this year, roughly Fall 2021), and a 14th Series for 2022."
The Casketeers,"No, it's getting dumber by the day. The BBC is being overtaken by Boris Johnson's cronies and anyone not with their program is gonna get gutted."
The Casketeers,"> Going back to Smith era or Tennant it sat 608 million UK viewrs

That's a lot :-)"
The Casketeers,"> Just how long do you think a tv show ought to run for?

I want THIS show to run forever! There will never be another show like it! Try as they might."
The Casketeers,"dammit. 6-8million

I'm not going back to fix it."
The Casketeers,"Yeah, it's pretty much perfect.  I remember watching it live and thinking ""Man, Matt Saracen is the universe's punching bag.""  When he's shoveling the dirt at the end . . . just brutal."
The Casketeers,"I really want Zach Gilford to get a role that lets him shine again, as he really is a wonderful actor. "
The Casketeers,**Welcome to one of the finest dramas that packs emotional punch and coach Taylor speeches** Friday night lights without dialogue and just the music with the scenes is even emotional!  It's a superb series and was shipped away to direct TV with poor care by NBC!  It still had a big audience and loyal Panthers following because of the amazing characters and writing that's executed each episode!  It executes a sports trope so brilliantly because of the acting and writing and innovation.  I swear to you this series is primo!!  Its raises the bar of the quality of standard TV drama.  Your lucky 
The Casketeers,I love this show so much and it’s the complete opposite of shows that i normally watch but anyways mannnn did that scene when Matt’s crying/drunk in the tub completely break me. I forgot the exact wording but it was something like “why does everyone keep leaving me” that right there fucking broke me and still to this day i don’t know why he didn’t get some type of award for that scene 
The Casketeers,"Season 1 Spoilers!  

I absolutely love this show. I am not the type to get into dramas but this show absolutely changed me as a person.

The first episode I saw was episode 16 ""Black Eyes and Broken Hearts"". I was just channel surfing and saw something about football and thought, I like football, why not check it out. It is the episode where Coach Mac was in hot water for comparing ""guys like Smash"" to ""junkyard dogs"", which was seen as very racist. At the game which the black players almost didn't even attend because they wanted Mac fired, after Smash scores a touchdown to take the lead there is an all out brawl between both teams. They way that episode ended with Mac standing up for Smash even though he knew the whole team saw him as a racist and wanted nothing to do with him when the bus was pulled over had me hooked and I had to watch from the first episode.  


 I remember being devastated when it ended. I waited a couple years after the last episode aired to watch the final episode because I just couldn't accept that it was over. In my mind it was like if I didn't watch the last episode it was like time stood still in that small town of Dillon, and by proxy,, I didn't have to move on. 

Truly an amazing show."
The Casketeers,That show captures small town America in a way that very few mediums of entertainment have.  
The Casketeers,"As a Brit who doesn’t understand the whole small town high school football circus and is far too old to be watching teen dramas, I fucking LOVE Friday Night Lights.  The show is completely unknown in the UK but I wear my Dillon Football tshirt with pride!

I watched it through for the second time recently (£20 for a 22 disc box set, what a bargain!) and can’t believe how little appreciation this show gets.  The characters, cinematography, music, etc. are all so full of heart and it’s no surprise how many great actors have come out of it."
The Casketeers,"Loved this show almost as much as I loved The Leftovers.

Texas forever."
The Casketeers,This is my favorite show of all time and this is definitely one of the best episodes in the series. 
The Casketeers,This was definitely the standout episode of the series to me and the song at the end will always stand out.  If you loved this episode the show Six Feet Under might be a good call to check out.  I'm not saying one is better than the other but in terms of tone and atmosphere they evoke similar things and touch on similar themes.
The Casketeers,"He's on Good Girls right now. I like the show, but they are wasting his talent."
The Casketeers,"*""Why does everyone keep leaving me? What is wrong with me?""*

Oh yeah, I remember that one, hit right in the core..."
The Casketeers,I love that episode with the Smash and Mac storyline so much. 
The Casketeers,"Same here, this show is totally unknown in East Europe and I'm probably only person in 500km radius who watched it but I am about to order every single piece of merchandise I can get and wear it 24/7. 

"
Derry Girls,Our man Colm never fails me.
Derry Girls,You're a Derry Girl now James!
Derry Girls,"It’s so great.  One of the best things I’ve found on Netflix.  Sister Michael steals the show, but even for as great as she is, she doesn’t outshine the rest of the cast.  Each of them have their moments.  And the back and forth between Erinn’s father and grandfather is excellent."
Derry Girls,"I was their age at that time (so a teen inthe 90’s) and they got it so right. The costumes, hair, makeup, settings - perfect! Even the music at Jenny’s party is exactly what we were listening to. I just love how sweet the show is too. Love it."
Derry Girls,Who’s James? Oh! You mean the wee English fella.
Derry Girls,Oh Christ !!! Sister Michael is so entertaining.😂😂😂
Derry Girls,"Didn’t watch it first because I thought I wouldn’t get it because I know nothing about Ireland. But I saw gifs by an online friend with Michelle shitting on James about the British and it looked sooo funny. I finally gave it a try and holy crap, was that pilot episode perfect.

*”Did ye kill that wee nun, girls?”*


*""Of course we didn't!""*

*""THEN WHY WERE YOU PISSING ON HER DEAD BODY AND MAKING SANDWICHES!?!""*"
Derry Girls,Great show but I reaoly wish they had used the Clinton scene after the credits instead of ending the show with it.
Derry Girls,"If you fine folks haven't seen the British Bake Off special featuring the cast, please look it up. The cast dynamics are exactly what you'd expect, along with some bonuses lol"
Derry Girls,Poor Gerry
Derry Girls,"It’s the perfect TV show in my opinion. 3 short seasons, 6 episodes each. Every episode is funny, every episode has rewatch value, and is charming. Makes me sad I can’t get more friends to give it a chance. I think the name turns people off for some reason? They think it’s like a Gilmore Girls type show."
Derry Girls,"""I don't want to be an individual by myself!"""
Derry Girls,"If you love Derry Girls you should give Father Ted a go, classic sitcom and the most beloved in the country"
Derry Girls,I've already watched it three times. This post makes me happy. Derry girls forever.
Derry Girls,"I agree, and I’m going to miss it. This show would make my wife and me practically cry with laughter sometimes"
Derry Girls,"Saw it recently for the first time, and as a 34 year old man I absolutely loved it!"
Derry Girls,Derry Girls saved my 2020
Derry Girls,OP sounds like a total feckin' ride
Derry Girls,"I loved that Colm McCool even got an episode where he was the hero who came to the rescue!

“The thing about heroes coming to the rescue, is that it all depends upon showing up in the Nick of time. Not a moment too soon, but then again not a moment too late. A hero coming too late may not even be considered a hero, since…”"
Derry Girls,"If anyone new watches it, guess how old the actress playing Clare is and then look it up."
Derry Girls,"Sister Michael is one of my favorite characters of all time.  


""Thanks to Jennie's *awful* play..."""
Derry Girls,I still cry when I think about the ending. Just a perfect show all around and for all seasons.
Derry Girls,I loved the moms' flashback episode.
Derry Girls,"Great show, and nostalgic for someone who grew up in the 90s, the soundtrack is 10/10"
Derry Girls,It's fantastic. Saved my life during the quarantine.
Derry Girls,"You should check out London Irish,by the same writer."
Derry Girls,Derry Girls reminds me of Inbetweeners... Except it's with girls and set in Ireland
Derry Girls,"Wait, was season three released?? I love that show!!!"
Derry Girls,Nicola Coughlan was on one of the Taskmaster New Years treat episodes and she was delightful.
Derry Girls,"Americans, there's no shame in watching with subtitles. It's in English, but you know, only kind of."
Derry Girls,Took forever for me to actually watch it. Had it on my list forever. I regret not watching it sooner hilarious show and I love seeing Tommy in something.
Derry Girls,"I'm Irish and I'm really fascinated by how popular it is across the globe, especially as so much of the humour relies on Irish quirks and cultural references."
Derry Girls,The series is/was hilarious and really captured a feeling.  The last season I think got a little messed up with the actress playing Sister Michael actually injuring herself and the actress playing Claire having other commitments.  I wanted more Sister Michael and the finale clearly had to film Claire separately in several scenes.  They did their best though and still a very good send off.
Derry Girls,"My friend and I discovered this show randomly looking thru Netflix a couple months ago. Ordinarily I wouldn't have given it a second look but the trailer looked good and I was very interested in it being set during the Troubles. 

Very glad we decided to watch it, because it's become my favorite show that I've watched in the last couple years and it's now my go-to ""I have nothing to watch"" show, because I can throw any random episode on and be entertained. 

Simply phenomenal show."
Derry Girls,"Erin, It's me! Im the *wee* lesbian!"
Derry Girls,"Yea, show is absolutely brilliant, glad they ended on a high note but I could watch a few more episodes ;)"
Derry Girls,Just started watching it on Netflix and it's really funny. My girlfriend said that it reminded her of The IT Crowd because the plots are nonsensical until the end where everything comes crashing down together
Derry Girls,I love Derry Girls!  “Wee wains” and “the scoots” have become regular phrases around our house.
Derry Girls,"I can't wait for the prequel series ""Welcome to Derry""."
Derry Girls,Loved it!
Derry Girls,It is wonderful!
Derry Girls,"One of my favorites, season 3 wasn’t as good but still loved it"
Derry Girls,"I was so sad it ended. Hilarious and moving. If you haven’t checked out their Great British Baking Show Holiday episode on Netflix from last year, I loved it!"
Derry Girls,"It’s an astoundingly good show. I can’t believe it exists and it’s finished. Brilliant writing. Incredibly funny.

I love Colm and the paper doll story. That season 2 wedding episode is cracker!"
Derry Girls,"I was kind of sad that season 3 was the last one but after seeing it, it did seem like they were running out of ideas a little bit. 

Although I think the writer said she'd love to do an episode or movie taking place like 10 years later, which I'd like to see."
Derry Girls,"“Oh so killing nuns now, is it?”"
Derry Girls,The big name cameo in Season 3 as the policeman was awesome.  My jaw dropped with the surprise.
Derry Girls,"Part of me wants more people to know about this show, but the other part of me wants to keep it a secret. I’m glad others are watching it though, it really is a gem."
Derry Girls,The show is brilliant and anyone who hasn't watched by now really sit down and enjoy.
Derry Girls,Pulled it up and am watching the first episode.  Thanks for this.
Derry Girls,Are there any clips you'd recommend for those of us who've never seen it?
Derry Girls,Just saw the gbbo with them and decided to watch it. I haven't started yet but they seem pretty funny
Derry Girls,We are so obsessed with this show.. so great.
Derry Girls,"""It's me, I'm the wee lesbian.""

Loved that show."
Derry Girls,"I've been looking for a good show to binge and haven't been able to find one.  I'm gonna check this out, thanks OP!"
Derry Girls,I really enjoyed all of it especially the last season.
Derry Girls,Great show though I do feel it peaked in S1!
Derry Girls,I'll se ya'll in a week or two...gotta go binge watch now.
Derry Girls,"Just watched the first episode yesterday at the insistence of a friend, definitely going to binge this one"
Derry Girls,Just started watching it and it is Amazing!
Derry Girls,Love this show.... did need subtitles. But worth every bit
Derry Girls,"I was hesitant to watch it at first as its my home town and just felt weird the idea of watching it  but glad I did. I would have been roughly the age of them, in the time its set  and they nailed everything about growing up here at the time. The whole Clinton speech thing was hilarious to me as I was at that with my dad and all when younger as I think most people here were when It happened. Even down to the school buses being the ones we used to get on lol."
Derry Girls,I love that our wee city is talked about all over the world due to this show!
Derry Girls,Can I just just say this outfit makes my tits look crackers
Derry Girls,Pure joy.
Derry Girls,"Not only is it hilarious but it is a great time capsule on 90s culture, particularly the music."
Derry Girls,"I loved it too! Great juxtaposition of coming of age mixed with the troubled setting of The Troubles... lots of memorable, relatable characters and solid writing. I love shows that can make me laugh my ass off and tear up within just a couple minutes. 

If you haven't seen Reservation Dogs I kinda see them as being in the same vein, despite the many obvious differences. The first season is the only I've seen but it has a similar spirit."
Derry Girls,"I've begun saying ""wee"" and ""wee-un's"" & I love it."
Derry Girls,"The show is funny, heartwarming, has great characters, etc, but it so brilliantly uses the adults watching the news on tv to weave in the troubles and all the upheaval in the city. It's really a fascinating show."
Derry Girls,"Joe: ""What even is brunch?""  
Erin: ""It's a sort of half breakfast, half lunch.""  
Orla: ""Like a cornflake sandwich.""  
  
Orla is my favorite!"
Derry Girls,"Having grown up in that part of the world at that time  (I'm a couple of years older than the characters portrayed in the show) there are many wee details that are absolutely spot on.

For example, in one episode there is a mention of a kebab shop in Coleraine - Abrakebabra. Well that was a real place that a mate of mine ran...."
Derry Girls,"I loved it. It gave me a lot of hard laughs where I had to pause cause I was missing the rest of the scene. The uncle that rambles is my favorite character, cause how they react to him is how people often react to me when I'm recounting a story."
Derry Girls,As somebody who went to Catholic school for 13 years I can tell you the portrayal of the sister who ran that school is spot fucking on.
Derry Girls,Yes me and my daughter loved watching it. I was excited to read they were filming another season. It was a great ending.
Derry Girls,I thought they lost sight of what made the show so good in the final season. Felt a lot different from the others which are all excellent.
Derry Girls,Was there a fourth season?
Derry Girls,Can confirm.
Derry Girls,"It's the best, I've binged it twice."
Derry Girls,It is great. Suspend your disbelief and enjoy it.
Derry Girls,"This. This is one the best shows ever and it's over!

Derry Girls and White line is it anyway!!! NooOooOooo!!"
Derry Girls,"Good god this show mirrored many parts of my growing up. Absolutely loved it, absolutely cracker."
Derry Girls,"I’ve rewatched the entire thing like 3 times now and it gets better with each rewatch, I also love a show that has a nice wrapped up ending instead of dragging it out over 10 seasons because it got popular."
Derry Girls,">  I will miss those girls terribly(especially James).

There. Much better."
Derry Girls,I look forward to going to my friends wedding for the sole purpose of watching the Rock the Boat dance shown in DG with my own eyes.
Derry Girls,"Grandad Joe is my favorite. Love that show. Saoirse-Monica Jackson’s facial expressions are pure gold, she’s so funny."
Derry Girls,Absolutely amazing show. So many quotes from it have become commonplace in my family.
Derry Girls,When they're cleaning the chip shop and Michelle starts having a rave upstairs. I laughed so hard.
Derry Girls,Late to the party but my wife absolutely loves this show. Was one of her favorite shows to watch while breastfeeding. I would hear her cackling upstairs all the time.
Derry Girls,"Embarrassing, but I have to use subtitles 'cuz I can't understand folks ... and, yes, I speak English."
Derry Girls,"The episode where Sister Michael is stuck listening to Colm at the wake. That's fecking brilliant. ""Am I dead? Is this my wake? Am..am I in hell?' And then she's amused at the end of his story."
Derry Girls,I laughed my ass off at the show but my Irish born wife would not watch it. She grew up near Belfast a decade before when the show takes place and said it wasn’t a fun time. I can’t fault her after hearing her stories.
Derry Girls,I must be missing something. I’ve watched 3 episodes and can’t say I enjoyed it…
Derry Girls,I've always seen it like the Northern Irish Inbetweeners
Derry Girls,It is an amazing show.
Derry Girls,I watched it a few weeks ago and loved every second of it! I wish it'd been longer!
Derry Girls,*Derry Girls* and *Atlanta* were both amazing--some of the best television I've ever seen. Sad that both have come to an end this year.
Derry Girls,Totally agree.  Really captures the time period perfectly.  And just a nice show with a tinge of cringe.
Derry Girls,r/DerryGirls
Derry Girls,"> Since it is set during the 90s in Ireland, there is a perfect mix of comedy and drama.

?"
Derry Girls,Loved this show
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,Honestly one of the best animated shows in recent memory. They paid a great tribute to Anton Yelchin at the end of Trollhunters' run.
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"My dude, Toby is fuckin' back to kick ass and take names,  yo!"
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,was that a goddamn wilhelm scream at the end
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"Such a lively show. I'm excited to watch Wizards too.

What a great universe Guillermo created"
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"I’ve really struggled through this show but loved Trollhunters, did this get better as it went along?"
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"So freaking annoyed *3 Below* never got mentioned in the [Netflix ""What to watch in July"" spot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uzrpo_0XSH4).  Been waiting for this one (and all the *Tales of Arcadia* series) with bated breath. 

I'm only sad that rumors seem to be this is the final season, and that we move directly to *Wizards* from here.  I was hoping we'd get 3 seasons, like *Trollhunters* had."
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"Didn't enjoy it as much as Troll Hunters since I got far too attached to the characters in it, but I was invested by the end.  I'm looking forward to seeing where they're going with the universe."
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"I was waiting on some news for when the second season was going to start. Yeah, this show surprised me for how entertaining it was. I even enjoyed it more than Trollhunters."
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,Completely underrated show.
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,That did get a chuckle out of me.
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"I loved it from the get-go, but the first episode was necessarily exposition-heavy. Most of the folks who were hoping it would be identical to *Trollhunters*, though, have been disappointed. Those of us who were just happy to be back in Arcadia weren't, so it could depend. Most folks seem to enjoy both shows, but there is a minority who prefer one heavily over the other.  Even some folks who found *Trollhunters* from watching *3 Below.*

As the season progresses, though, it does become clear that the events in S1 of *3 Below* are happening **simultaneously** with the events of S3 of *Trollhunters* and that makes for some fun synergy.

BTW, there is an r/Trollhunters subreddit where both shows are discussed."
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"I really enjoyed trollhunters, I hope it's just as good"
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"My thought process while watching this:

**“This strangely reminds me of Trollhunters...”**

*from the creators of Trollhunters*

**“Oh, ok that make sense.”**

*cast of Trollhunters actually appears*

**“WAIT WAT”**"
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,So you’re saying trolls are aliens or just part of an extended universe ?
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"I watched too long before i realized they were the weird brother and sister from Trollhunters, looks fantastic and a great way to extend the universe."
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,[deleted]
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"Anyone know when the story takes place? [spoiler](#s ""I saw Jim in his human form"")"
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,I don’t like how they pushed Steve and Aja.... I don’t get it... do girls like guys like him? He’s awful 
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,Coming to the updoots late. This well worth a watch.
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"The animation looks kind of cheap, just my opinion."
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,So is this show a direct rip off of Sym-Bionic Titan?  Really sounds like it based off the plot summary on wikipedia
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"FYI, after this series there's supposed to be a climactic series called Wizards that sounds like a battle royale between everything that's come before."
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"""Tales of Arcadia"" is the umbrella overtitle for *Trollhunters, 3 Below,* and *Wizards* (2019)*.*  Apparently Guillermo del Toro had so much fun doing *Trollhunters,* they decided to keep the ball rolling. There were a ton of announcements before *Trollhunters* S3 came out.

And you've *already* met Aja and Krel. They were the weird foreign students who helped Jim, Claire, and Toby catch lightning in a bottle in [this episode](https://www.netflix.com/watch/80148764?trackId=14277283). :)

Also, it looks like the Creepslayerz will be regular supporting roles in *3 Below*, as well as our aliens getting some visits from the *Trollhunters* main characters. 

BTW, if you're an *Orphan Black* fan, Aja is being voiced by Tatiana Maslany.

&#x200B;"
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"Syfy Wire put up coverage of the NYCC panel for *3 Below* up on Youtube:

[https://youtu.be/5RFFC\_FeJoo?t=16949](https://youtu.be/5RFFC_FeJoo?t=16949)

Should answer most questions you may have. :)

BTW, if Marc Guggenheim's name seems familiar, it could be because you just watched the Arrowverse/Elseworlds crossover. He wrote the *Arrow* episode (Part 2), and had the story credit on the *Supergirl* episode (Part 3)."
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"Apparently it's sort of going to be a trilogy of shows. Trollhunters was the first, 3Below is next, and the last will be Wizards."
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"Just part of an extended universe of trolls, aliens, and wizards."
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"Dude, I miss 3rd Rock From the Sun so much."
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,I'm pretty sure part of it takes place during Season 3 of Trollhunters.
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,I think it looks pretty good. The Dragon Prince is what I'd consider cheap looking animation. 
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,Looks heaps better than Saint Seiya.
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"It's also the basic plot of Invader Zim. Alien comes to earth and disguises themself as human. It's not an original concept, but then again nothing is."
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"Psst, maybe not bring Marc Guggenheim, he's not a very popular person around here."
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,There are some pretty striking design similarities between the aliens and trolls though. I think it's possible we get a reveal that they're somehow related. 
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,I will only be happy if they regularly reference Zim.  That shit is easily my favorite cartoon.  Really a bacon soap joke and the doom song will get me through...
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"Eh, even more than just an alien coming to earth though.  Both this and Sym-Bionic Titan are about a group of 3 aliens, some of which are royalty on their planet, fleeing from their planet due to it being overtaken by an evil dictator.  They need to blend in with the small town they landed at, while also wanting to overthrow the evil dictator on their home planet.  


I mean, even the [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_Below) article on 3 Below calls it out for having a very similar premise to Sym-Bionic Titan.  "
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,Whoops! Sorry!
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"Symbiotic Titan is far from the first show/movie to have that premise, it's a very basic pulp sci fi concept "
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"Oh no problem but yeah if you want an idea of what people think about him you should go check out [/r/Arrow](https://www.reddit.com/r/arrow/), lol."
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"Yeah, ""royal aliens hiding on earth"" is such a basic plotline, because ""royals hiding in a foreign land"" is a basic trope from even early human writing."
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"Oh, no, no. I can imagine what you all think of Guggie over there (I stopped watching *Arrow* ages ago and only drop in for crossovers these days); I had the same opinion. But *Trollhunters* turned it around for me. His writing credits on *Trollhunters* are a whole different bag. And this *is* /r/television, where we're still more apt to be survey viewers.  But good point.  Maybe stick to mentioning him only in /r/TrollHunters. :)"
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"I liked Trollhunters/3 Below. I'll give Wizards an appropriate binge.   


I didn't see anything in the article, but with the loss of Anton Yelchin did they ever find someone else to voice Jim?"
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"I dropped out of 3Below (too quick to judge), but really enjoyed Trollhunters. Already knew I'd have to finish 3Below because I'm also interested in Wizards. I didn't know (or forgot) that there was also going to be a movie. Definitely more interested in Wizards / Arcadia now."
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,I both love and hate these shows. I can't wait to see a full flegged Dreamworks animated Trollhinters movie. Would've even gone to see it in theaters! Can't wait!
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,">Now the heroes from all three series have to team-up in order to fight the **Arcade Order**

Give them no quarter! Easy typo to make, I'm sure, if they're talking about the characters from *Wizards* it's the *Arcane* Order.

Anyway, between the ending of *Wizards*, its short length, and the premise of the movie I have to wonder if this was already planned or if they turned the second season of *Wizards* into a movie because of the pandemic..."
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"Trollhunters is the best, with great balanced tone and amazing storyline and character development. 3below is like rushed dramatic children's show. I wonder how wizards is? Rather that focusing on 3below, they could've extended trollhunters. Although the ending was pretty good!"
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"I liked the original show, I'm not excited for a movie when the original series already suffers from being too short."
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,You mean the character from what we do in the shadows has his own show? Awesome! Guillermo Berillermo!
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,Emile Hirsch took over the voice role for Jim
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"Yep, jim was voiced by some one else for the finale season if im not mistaken"
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,Emile Hirsch took over. They changed his voice in Trollhunters during the last season after the character turned into a troll.
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"Trollhunters seems to be the best of the bunch. 3Below feels like a spin-off and so does Wizards so far for me. I think this was a good idea overall, but it could have been executed better. 3Below just doesn’t seem as thought-out as Trollhunters and same goes for Wizards."
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,Pretty sure the plan was to have all 3 come  together in some way
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"You're not excited for them to extend a story that to you, was too short? Seems like they're addressing the very criticism you're levelling..."
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,I thought the voice change was pretty clever compared to other shows
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"> and so does Wizards so far for me.

Not sure how you got that impression, from the outset it's pretty clearly related to the events of Trollhunters (Merlin, etc), moreso than 3Below was. Just finished watching it, I thought it was really good."
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,My big problem is the Show tries way to hard to please fans by sticking the past casts into the new shows. I really liked the idea of 3 shows following 3 different sets of characters doing 3 different adventures in the same place with some minor overlap.  That is not how things turned out.
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"Well the original show is already done, so they can't actually expand that. It sounds like it might be a new villain and with all the different casts of the movie, it's going to be hard to fit in all the character, build up to the new villain, develop the world further and tie up all the loose ends in the length of a movie."
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,They don’t *have* to do all that in one movie. Maybe they’re planning on more than one.
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,Season one was ok. I miss the troll hunter. Will check out season two soon though.
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"Never heard of this, very interested because I love Del Toro and the inclusion of voices like Offerman and Yuen and Close make me even more interested. Is season 2 the end?"
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"Jim, and the other characters that left with him, will be back for the 3rd show later this year: Wizards."
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"So it is part of a larger universe called ""Tales of Arcadia"". The first show in the series is the 3 seasons of Trollhunters, 3below has the 2 seasons (the second season is the last for it), and the final show in the series is Wizards which isn't out yet."
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"Man, this is awesome!  I have been anxiously waiting for this to come out for legit a full year (okay, it'll be a full year on the 12th).

It really makes me interested in how Dreamworks prioritizes their animated shows for production - last time they did a Tales of Arcadia season was July last year, but they got two seasons of Kipo out within the past 6 months (nothing against Kipo, I was just shocked how quickly they released the second season)..."
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,Tales of Arcadia is some of the best children's content on Netflix
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"Do we know if there will be multiple parts of Wizards?

I believe there was 3 parts of Trollhunters and 2 parts of 3Below"
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,Sweet! Will miss Yelchin though.
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,Fuckin awesome - been waiting for this
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"My only sadness upon reading this is that *Wizards* is only one season and only 10 episodes. (sigh). They quote Guggie saying:

>Although ‘Wizards’ is the shortest of the three series at 10 episodes, I’m blown away by the amount of story we were able to push in this season."
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,Their deal with Netflix seems to come with full show orders which probably helps their production and explains why the seasons tend to come thick and fast. As for priorities I would assume the CGI animation team is mostly separate from the 2D one so I don't think the shows effect one another.
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"In an AMA the creator of Kipo implied they've already finished making the entire show, which also at least somewhat appears to be what DreamWorks did with Voltron and She-Ra. But that explains the quick release pace."
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"In that case I am a 29 year old manchild.

God dammit if Trollhunters wasn't one of the absolute best things I have seen on Netflix."
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"Is it children's?
Troll hunters definitely felt deeper than for little kids. I enjoyed the shit out of it"
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,I believe it's been confirmed to only be this season
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"Uh... you do know Yelchin died before *Trollhunters* was released on Netflix, right? Jim was voiced by Emile Hirsch in Season 3 of *Trollhunters* and throughout *3 Below*. That's why S3 of *Trollhunters* had the ""grave sand"" storyline: to cover the voice change."
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"Hmm, good point on the CGI being separate from 2D, I didn't actually think this through hah. That makes me even more interested though - generally speaking, I would think it takes less time to make CGI shows than 2D ones.  So that makes them getting out two seasons of Kipo in half the time it took to get one season of Wizards even more impressive, IMO.

Really, I'd love to get like a studio tour or something, or maybe just like a blog post detailing their process kinda thing."
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"Woah, that's interesting.   I'd love to see that comment, I wonder if he meant the entire show so far, or entire show, period...  Does that mean more seasons after 2 are confirmed? Or is it just that he has a plan for the rest of the show, and it depends on if Netflix will keep picking them up (like Dragon Prince)?"
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"I would classify them more as ""family"" shows, with a target audience similar to that of a Pixar movie."
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,I know he dies before S3 but I did not know Hirsch voiced Jim.
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"https://m.imgur.com/YIJ829v

Not officially confirmed as I guess Netflix doesn't like confirming future seasons until shortly before release for marketing reasons or whatever, but I think this means the entire show has been made."

3Below: Tales of Arcadia,Really excited for this. You could really tell by the end of season 2 they were trying new things out. The universe is interesting so here's hoping they keep the quality up
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,This is one of the most creative kids shows in the last decade. It reminds me a lot of Buffy. I'm happy that they are trying new things with it.

3Below: Tales of Arcadia,This Teaser is already half a year old?
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,I have so many questions right now and so many things started to somewhat make sense.
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,they spoiled the ending of trollhunters in this teaser
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,this looks terrible. Trying way to hard. Has a manufactured charm. I'm embarrassed for Del toro
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,why are you reposting a months old trailer ?
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"Good news! Your six year old can only possibly repeat if for a year, at most."
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"Yeah, I'm not sure why they put it out when they did. It would've made *much* more sense for it to have been released now since Part 3 is out, especially since this is very clearly supposed to be a conversation after the ending. Hence why I posted it."
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"Eeehh, I think they worked around it carefully enough. Only thing that's really spoiled, if you didn't already see it, is when Eli puts the picture of the aliens up. Other than that, this doesn't give away anything else you wouldn't already know from the previous episodes. "
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,I have actually watched Trollhunters. It is really really good.
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,Because it's relevant now since TrollHunters ended last night. 
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,Well I think they released with Part 2 because it was when they started putting the Tales of Arcadia subtitle on the episodes of Trollhunters and had made the deal for the 2 other shows to come after.
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,not really because we all knew there would be more stuff coming when this trailer came out months ago
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,Not everyone knew. I hadn't seen this before. Thanks OP!
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,Trollhunters was an unexpected delight! Consider me hyped as hell!
3Below: Tales of Arcadia,"Guillermo Del Toro unveiled a first look at his DreamWorks Tales of Arcadia: 3Below, the second chapter in the DreamWorks Tales of Arcadia triology Friday afternoon during the show’s panel at New York Comic Con.

3Below creator and executive producer del Toro was joined by voice talent Diego Luna (Narcos: Mexico), and fellow executive producers Rodrigo Blaas, Marc Guggenheim and Chad Hammes. The panel, along with moderator Whitney Matheson, unveiled the all-star voice cast including Glenn Close (The Wife) who made a surprise appearance at the Con.

DreamWorks previously announced the series will feature Luna and Tatiana Maslany in the lead roles of Krel and Aja. Nick Offerman, Andy Garcia, Nick Frost, Alon Aboutboul, Chris Obi, Uzo Aduba, Cheryl Hines, Tom Kenny, Haley Atwell, Danny Trejo, and Ann Dowd will be lending their voices along with returning talent from Trollhunters including Emile Hirsch, Charlie Saxton, Lexi Medrano, Steven Yeun, Cole Sands, Kelsey Grammer and more. Additionally, The Crystal Method created the main title theme that is heard in the opening credits video.

In 3Below, two royal teenage aliens, and their bodyguard flee a surprise takeover of their home planet by an evil dictator and crash land in Arcadia. Now on the run from intergalactic bounty hunters, they struggle to blend in and adapt to the bizarre world of high school all the while attempting to repair their ship so they can return and defend their home planet."

Diablero,Not too sure but sounds dark and supernatural .. I'm intrigued.
Diablero,"Thanks, but I meant more anything about the series. Release year, director, showrunner etc. :)  "
Diablero,Netflix probably register many trademarks for shows extremely early in the development process. It's fairly standard practice. I imagine the show probably is only in initial conceptual phases and will be a while before it gets any specific details like that.
Diablero,"Yeah, they do. Thing is, when you're trying to register a trademark, wouldn't the project it belongs to already been greenlit? All the other TV shows of Netflix on trademarks.justia.com are already out or we know that they're in development. I'm usually pretty informed when it comes to Netflix's Orginals, because I'm one of the regular editors of [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_original_programs_distributed_by_Netflix), but I know nothing about this series, not even a rumour, that's why a was posting here.   "
Diablero,"Whenever they release details, it'll be on https://media.netflix.com/en/only-on-netflix"
Diablero,"Eventually, yes, but the list is nowhere near complite and most of the new stuff turns up somewhere else first, because an outlet gets the exclusiv."
Diablero,[deleted]
Diablero,That dude's smille looks so wrong for this type of film.
Diablero,"I've read this is supposed to be tonally similar to Preacher. I'm looking forward to it, so far I've enjoyed all of Netflix's Spanish-language shows. "
Diablero,Looks horrendous and they didn't really even show anything....
Diablero,Oof
Wolf,I hated this character right up until this very scene and then I was blown away by this performance. The writing and directing just added to how good it is. I think it's got to be up there with some of the best stuff we've seen in Star Trek.
Wolf,"Man, did they replace the entire writing team or something? The difference between this season and the first two is night and day.

For a while now, I've thought it was kind of weird for Michael Chabon of all people to be involved with this show. I've enjoyed several of his novels, and he does have numerous writing credits on other projects, but it always seemed like an odd fit to me. Did he approach them or did they approach him?

My personal theory is that, as a veteran writer and screenwriter, Michael Chabon was there specifically to take everyone else's spontaneous and somewhat conflicting ideas and somehow help develop that hodge-podge amalgamation into something that made sense. Which sounds like a miserable nightmare. The show had ""too many cooks"" written all over it."
Wolf,Star Trek: Picard is a true successor to TNG in the sense that we had to wait until season 3 for it to get really good.
Wolf,"The actor playing shaw is really good.

They can definitely do a series with shaw and seven continuing the journey on the titan"
Wolf,"Could somebody please, **please** buy the production a f-ing light-bulb? Is that part of the legally-mandated-percent-difference in a contract somewhere? Are they trying to hide terrible sets?"
Wolf,"Shaw is the most understandable asshole I've seen on television in awhile. He's been right every step of the way while Picard and Riker kept fucking up. The first two seasons of Picard are unwatchable* trash, but this one has been surprisingly good."
Wolf,"“I’m sorry I tried to kill you, I was possessed by an evil alien entity at the time” is such a common apology in Star Trek there’s probably a section at Hallmark. No one is blaming Keiko O’Brien for trying to murder the Prophets while possessed by a Pah Wraith, we didn’t spend weeks on the Voyager tiptoeing around Kes because she might try to conquer the galaxy again like when she was being mind controlled by a dead dictator, and none of the people possessed by an ancient mask with the power to reshape their surroundings into an ancient temple got thrown in the brig for nearly killing everyone.  Why does Picard get so much shit for the time the Borg used him as a hand puppet?"
Wolf,Can this season be watched without seeing the previous 2?  I bailed s1e2.
Wolf,"wow, first time i've seen a nuTrek clip kind of trend. 👏"
Wolf,"I'd really love a Shaw series, most boring explorative mission in the history of Starfleet"
Wolf,You knows it’s good when even those schlubs over at RLM liked it.
Wolf,"""The only Borg so deadly the gave him a goddamn name"" is not one of my favorite Star Trek lines, just under ""Its a cellular peptide cake, with mint frosting"""
Wolf,I enjoyed the first season. I stopped watching season 2 after the third or fourth episode. I’m liking the new season
Wolf,[Now I know why they named him Shaw.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9S41Kplsbs)
Wolf,Why is it so dark in Star Trek now.
Wolf,He can not hate Picard more then Picard hates himself for his failure on that day and allowing himself to become a Borg. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuzoxcErOc8
Wolf,"This is good. I liked the episode.
But this is borrowed. We've already seen a captain (commander at the time) having an issue with Picard because of Wolf 359. I wish Trek would do something new. They keep referencing things over and over."
Wolf,"Wolf 359 is, of course, the darkly destructive planet that evolved as the result of a scientific experiment in season 2 episode 8 of the old ""The Outer Limits"" TV show."
Wolf,"I mean yeah, the backstory explains his behavior, but to me that didn’t excuse him from being an asshat.  :)"
Wolf,"I know this is nu-trek and I have to adjust my expectations of what a show with Star Trek in the title is BUT…everyone, without exception, is a *violent, emotional idiot*. 

I felt the entire character is so hacky and forced. 

Taking capt sisko’s backstory and giving it to another character was pretty lame. At least change the details a little! 

And sisko had more depth. There was the overdone survivor guilt angle, but also his desire to protect his remaining family and *leaving starfleet*

If you’re still *that* bitter 20+ years after the fact *and* still in the same organization that overwhelmingly praises the man that you solely blame for a significantly tragic moment in your life….how did this man reach captain? Oh right…you have to a violent emotional idiot to be a starfleet officer

This is not even close to what Star Trek is for me. But, unlike previous seasons/shows, at least it’s watchable. Is that what people are excited about?"
Wolf,Not a very captainly acting character. He's been a tantrum throwing bitch the whole season.
Wolf,I would have understood if the encounter with Picard had triggered PTSD or something. But that looks more like open resentment. Even though it was the Borg and not Picard himself. A distinction a Starfleet Captain should be able to make.
Wolf,"I'm sorry but this is still the same shit as the first two seasons. There's no difference between Admiral Hubris and Shaw. They're their just to berate and admonish Picard, Shaw will be doing it season long though (as Raffi did in S1 incidentally cause they can't write different characters).

Crusher introfuced exacrly as Seven was in S1&2, both guncrazed for some reason.

Worf is just Elnor now.

It also looks really bad. Why would I want to watch into something so dark, literally?"
Wolf,They pulled a Captain Jellico. Shaw is a terrific character.
Wolf,"Oh, I loved his character since the first scene. His lambasting of Riker and Picard is priceless, and in the end he places them in the lower decks! Yes he was an asshole, but a master-level one. 

Starfleet is usually too nice and clean and with too many heroic figures, so I like when the occasional deeply flawed - but still competent in the end - character shows up. Another example of that, with a personality kind of opposite to Shaw, is Barclay."
Wolf,"as a lover of 12 monkeys
I am loving that Terry matalas is getting his due and he bought in a 12 monkeys actor and let him shine too"
Wolf,"I skipped season 1 and 2, so if Captain Shaw was introduced there, I missed it.  In episode 1, I didn't like Shaw, but it was clear that he's trying to be a company man.  It was impressive that he wasn't evil or a megalomaniac, just doing what he thought he was supposed to do.

I haven't watched episode 4 yet, but this season is really shaping up."
Wolf,"The first 4 episodes of Picard feel like a lost Star trek Movie. Multiple great character arcs with proper setup and payoff. The ending is classic Trek, they remember that they are supposed to be scientists, diplomats and explorers, not action heroes."
Wolf,Haven't watched the past 2 seasons but that reminds me of the actors role in 12 monkeys show (also written/co written by matalas).
Wolf,"Chabon has talked about how much he loved Star Trek so he might have approached then. 

I absolutely love his novels, so I was very disappointed in how godawful S1 of Picard. The show violated Chekov's Gun rule and the producer has a Pulitzer Prize. Incredible. 

Also, someone loved Mass Effect,  because entire scenes and ideas were lifted from the game."
Wolf,"I think they had close to *twenty* producers in the credits. 

The first two seasons were all over the fucking place, with just random shit thrown in that never pays off. A major part of the first season was this Borg cube, which gets reactivated…then the Borg just get blown into space, and cube crashes, and that’s it. 

The second season just had the most kind-numbing my stupid ideas anyone could conceive of. 

It’s like someone in the writers’ room was like “We should have a storyline addressing immigration,” and someone else decided the most efficient way of doing that would be to travel back in time to the present day, have one of the characters get arrested by ICE, and get beat up by an ICE officer. 

Like…this is science fiction. One of the main benefits is you’re able to use allegory and get people to look at their world in a different way. 

And don’t even get me started on Q. Someone just said “Let’s have Q back!” Then all the writers cheered. And someone said “Oh, and let’s have him be *sick* and then he can *die.*”

Nevermind the fact that it’s not explained and has absolutely nothing to do with any of the other storylines. Like the one where Picard has been sad his whole life because his mom hanged herself."
Wolf,Terry Matalas is the new Showrunner. Michael Chabon has left completely along with Akiva Goldsman.
Wolf,"TNG season 1 and 2 were not mind-mindbogglingly horrendous. They're very much watchable; they just found their groove with season 3. Picard season 3 feels more like ""Welp, we can't come up with any good new ideas, so let's just use old ones because they worked."""
Wolf,"This season is what season one should have been from the get go. Just like the original run, it took until season 3 to find its footing and Riker growing the beard.

Unfortunately it’s reading like this will be the last."
Wolf,"Can't argue with that. A pity that it took so long though, you would have thought that with the rich source of material they had to reference it wouldn't have taken so long."
Wolf,can you just start watching season 3? i don't want to watch 2 seasons of trash to get to the good.
Wolf,Oof
Wolf,I think he's the best thing about Picard season 3 so far - an interesting character who is very well acted by Todd Stashwick.
Wolf,The showrunner tweeted that it’s some kind of bug for that episode and that they fixed it. It wasn’t supposed to be that dim.
Wolf,Strange New Worlds spent the light bulb budget for Star Trek...
Wolf,That's sadly been the norm for quite a few years now.
Wolf,"First season was at least watchable. Second was pure shit.

Third is what it should have been all along."
Wolf,Yes Picard is the badmiral to Shaw
Wolf,He's the Larry David of Star trek.
Wolf,"> The first two seasons of Picard are unwatacle trash,

Hard disagree."
Wolf,"> Why does Picard get so much shit for the time the Borg used him as a hand puppet?

Because logic doesn't override PTSD. 

Yes, Picard had no choice about being assimilated, or about leading the Borg assault on the fleet at Wolf 359. But he was still the face of that, he was the voice of that, and Locutus executed his job with apparent relish, to the point of tweaking Riker using Picard's own words. 

That's going to be remembered by Ben Sisko, who lost his wife at Wolf 359. It's going to be remembered by Shaw, who lost his friends and was then forced into a nightmarish choice. Those are events that leave powerful, fundamental marks on a person. And being able to think rationally that Picard had his mind taken over isn't going to stop the emotional feeling that he was somehow complicit, or that he could have done something more to resist, and maybe your loved ones would still be alive."
Wolf,"[This gets a bit long, so there is a broad-strokes summary at the end]

I agree that the various shows almost never properly explore the long-term consequences of a lot of the stuff that happens, and are very selective in who is treated as culpable for certain things, but none of the examples you list are really comparable in the least. Keiko did not actually succeed, neither did Kes (though the Voyager crew did actually become more wary of her as time went on, and with good cause), and nothing permanently bad happened at all because of the masks -- just another weird day at the office. The only of these three that actually killed anyone was Kes, and in ""Warlord"" most of the people directly affected by her possession are confined to one community in the Delta Quadrant. I can well imagine that Ensign Martin's friends or family would harbour a grudge about this (the only Starfleet officer killed in that incident, if I recall correctly), but Kes is no longer around and it's all a moot point.

On the other side of this comparison, the cube at Wolf 359 -- evidently with the help of insights shared by Picard while enslaved as Locutus -- killed some 11,000 Starfleet personnel, almost all of them probably with surviving friends, family, or colleagues who had a good chance of still being alive over the ensuing decades. This is a wound that cuts deep, with many open nerves still exposed, and the people most affected are all in locations that Picard is likely to visit or at least in which he is likely to be known and spoken of. It probably hurts a great deal to keep seeing headlines like ""Picard saves the day again"" or ""Picard brokers peace between X and Y at last"" or whatever, month after month, when all you can experience when you sleep is the fire in the black and that green glow and the screams being torn out of your friends' lungs as the bulkheads decompressed.

Beyond all this, the fact that Picard was enslaved by the Borg at the time may mean less to people now than it used to. That it would have been a traumatic experience is not something many would doubt, but at least he got to come back from it -- unlike so many others. Even then, as the UFP has encountered a wider and wider variety of Borg and learned more about how the Collective works / worked, many may now reasonably wonder just how totally a ""puppet"" he was during these events. There's like a whole civil rights campaign about how Borg drones can actually maintain their individuality and ""selves"" in spite of assimilation, with some even managing to reassert these aspects of their identity even before being liberated from the Collective. If they could do it, why not Picard? Did he not try hard enough? 

All of this, too, is happening within the context of a broad realignment of UFP policy about the Borg to begin with. Lots of people are trying to take a more conciliatory tack, studying and working with the X-Bs at the Artifact and now trying to form an alliance of sorts with Jurati's Legion, or whatever they're calling it. Lots of people must be pretty unhappy about this, given how many UFP people the Borg have killed on multiple occasions, so it is quite possible that some people are not ready to just treat everything as though it's water under the bridge.

**In summary:** For good or for bad, much as was the case with his role AS Locutus in the first place, Picard is the visible face of a nightmare from which many UFP people still cannot awaken. Even if the Borg were ultimately prevented from conquering the Alpha Quadrant, they still killed thousands with Locutus' help. It is worth remembering that Wolf 359 was likely one of the most traumatic events in Starfleet history for a generation, up to that point -- not only the fact of so many dead at once, but with no hope at all of defending themselves. It was a complete unsettling of certainty and security, comparable to something like the [Battle of Isandlwana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Isandlwana) during the Anglo-Zulu War. Maybe it's unfair that the pain generated by this kind of loss has been displaced onto Picard, but it should not at all be surprising or inexplicable."
Wolf,"Picard as Locutus didn't just try to kill people, he did. 11,000 people and almost 40 starships died at the Borg's hands, ""led"" by Locutus and if it wasn't for the crew of E-D, Earth would have been absolutely devastated. Before the Dominion War it might have been the single biggest loss of life in Starfleet's history, almost certainly certainly the biggest in the previous 100 years.

Wolf 359 was basically the Federation's equivalent to 9/11."
Wolf,Because he was so good at it?
Wolf,"> Why does Picard get so much shit for the time the Borg used him as a hand puppet?

Bad Writing.

> “I’m sorry I tried to kill you, I was possessed by an evil alien entity at the time” is such a common apology in Star Trek there’s probably a section at Hallmark.

This gets funnier the more I think about it. I regret I have but one upvote to give."
Wolf,">No one is blaming Keiko O’Brien for trying to murder the Prophets

ugg please don't remind me of that episode."
Wolf,"Yeah you can just start with this one, it's basically a reboot. Only one new character from the first two seasons is still around."
Wolf,"Yes, thankfully you can ignore seasons 1 and 2. They are pits of despair due to a lot of atrocious writing."
Wolf,"Yeah, I think there might be one fact from season 1 you'd want to know but it hasn't played a big role in season 3 so far, just maybe one minor mention.  Season 2 is utterly forgettable and garbage."
Wolf,"Yes. But you're cheating yourself if you don't at least watch S1. It starts a little slow, but it's worth it."
Wolf,Not the first one. I've seen quite a few Strange New Worlds posts getting upvoted.
Wolf,"It's also true. Man. 

https://www.britannica.com/topic/USS-Indianapolis"
Wolf,In the future electricity costs even more than it does now.
Wolf,Most if the power was going to life-support! All the ships in this season are almost on the verge of exploding... Except The Shrike but it's mandatory for the bad guys' ships to be dim and dark.
Wolf,"Strange New Worlds must have stolen all the lightbulbs, because that show is definitely brightly lit."
Wolf,"Well, alternatively, why was TNG and TOS so bright? I think it's fair to reason that they shot so much on a small budget that it was easier to just keep the set brightly lit all the time. VOY, ENT and DS9 are better compromises with the lighting IMO."
Wolf,"To be fair, it has been awhile since we saw such an interaction…and Shaw’s monologue is way more harsh / bitter than the one given by Sisko, which was buried, but still respectful anger."
Wolf,Hack writers can't move past Wrath of Kahn and the Borg.
Wolf,"Can you accept that everyone is going to have a different reaction to Picard's role in the Battle of Wolf 359?

Most of the younger officers revere Picard as a legendary decorated Starfleet officer. We've seen them reverently asking Picard for his personal view on events. We've also seen Titan's bridge crew hesitate when Shaw gave the order to leave Picard to his fate.

So far, we have only seen two officers who hated Picard's role at Wolf 359 - Sisko and Shaw. Both of them are also survivors of Wolf 359. I'm sure there are more, but given the statistical sampling we have been given, Sisko and Shaw are in the minority. 

This fits reality quite well. Not every hero is going to be viewed as one by everybody. Shaw's survivor's guilt has delayed his career, taking him a full 30+ years to painfully work his way up to the rank of captain. Surely you can allow for one man to not be aligned with the rest of Starfleet where Picard is concerned?"
Wolf,"> everyone, without exception, is a violent, emotional idiot.

When was Shaw Violent?"
Wolf,"> you have to a violent emotional idiot to be a starfleet officer

It worked for Kirk.   j/k"
Wolf,"First they took his hobby of cooking, since Pike does that now, and now they’re taking his tragic origin story"
Wolf,He used his engineering to follow the protocols exactly throughout his career and landed the Titan in the vacuum of Riker leaving. We only saw him while stuck with a former Borg first officer and seeing the man he blames for his cripplng survivors guilt. Definitely an ass but I bet he has more to show still.
Wolf,Survivors guilt seemed to be a major factor too. He survived by shear luck. So from then on he followed all protocol to a t.
Wolf,[removed]
Wolf,"I'd say he honestly works better than Jellico. Jellico came into his story throwing his weight around for no good reason. Shaw was even more of a jerk, but he has an entirely legitimate and traumatic reason for that behavior when faced with Picard and Seven at the same time. You can imagine Shaw probably being a pretty normal Captain removed from the biggest traumatic trigger he could imagine, meanwhile I can only assume Jellico was a control freak in every command he ever had including ones where he was only stepping in on a temporary basis as the ""supply captain""."
Wolf,"The first scene with Seven cemented it for me, yes the OPs scene they’ve linked was fantastic but that scene was just great.

“Hey Hanson, bang up job your heroes are doing with my ship, love the view”

Lifetime fan of the character after that line 😂"
Wolf,"All if Star Trek now is basically bad people and flawed characters to be edgy. It's bullshit, unoriginal and lazy. There is very little of the new shows that is Star Trek and they could work as a new standalone big budget sci-fi franchise"
Wolf,Deacon was a crucial part of the 12 Monkeys mix. The yin to Dr Jones' yang.
Wolf,Shaw is fresh for this season. Enjoy
Wolf,The first 4 episodes basically serve as a first act. If you took out the stuff with Raffi and Worf it could easily work as a standalone movie with threads left dangling for the sequel. I'm very impressed so far.
Wolf,"Star Trek: Discovery also had an obscene number of production credits. It's like, okay, I get it, all that movie-grade CGI isn't cheap. That series always looked pretty impressive for a TV show. A lot of the time, someone will be credited as a producer when all they really did the whole time was contribute money. But there's always the possibility that they might have also demanded some amount of creative input in exchange for doing that."
Wolf,"> The first two seasons were all over the fucking place, with just random shit thrown in that never pays off.

My pet theory has always been that season 2 came about when those twenty producers all got *really* drunk at a bar together one night and scrawled a bunch of incoherent random nonsense about Star Trek and other various unrelated topics on a bunch of cocktail napkins, then the next morning at the studio they gave each napkin to a different intern and demanded an episode script based on it by the end of the day."
Wolf,"S1 at least was bleeding awful early on. Like, people couldn't deliver lines ( Patrick Stewart to the side ). I do not recall S2 that much. 

My understanding is that things improved after they got Roddenberry less involved. 

> Picard season 3 feels more like ""Welp, we can't come up with any good new ideas, so let's just use old ones because they worked.""

TOS started in *1967*. The whole thing is a massive legacy property."
Wolf,"I don’t agree. I thought the first two seasons were boring and miserable.


Edit: apologies for any confusion. I was referring to Picard"
Wolf,TNG seasons 1 and 2 were like Hamlet compared to PIC seasons 1 and 2 lol
Wolf,"I'm just hoping it leads to a spin-off with Shaw, Seven, and the Titan. Maybe some other old cast (like Frakes\Dorn) stick around even if Patrick Stewart is done."
Wolf,">True, but bad as seasons 1 and 2 of TNG were they had some good, even great, episodes as well. I also have to say that even a bad episode of those seasons is better than the best episode of Picard seasons 1 and 2. 
>
>Also, even when it was bad, TNG was always fun, something that Picard seasons 1 and 2 forgot about (they are either too 'dark' or very clumsily go in the opposite direction and end up stupidly goofy).

We're talking about season 3 though, not rehashing older bad seasons to keep your hate boners erect."
Wolf,I'd say for most part yes. There are some call backs mostly as quick close offs or quick jokes so don't think you'll miss those. One of the characters has developed quite a bit in the intervening 20 years so that might be jarring. You'll be a little behind there but don't think it will hurt story.
Wolf,"If you know TNG and remember Seven from VOY, you should be good. Only one or two new characters (one having only a minor role for this season so far) from the first 2 seasons appeared only in Picard, and you'll manage. 

If you know nothing about the TNG era and the major story points and characters, I am not sure the series would work. (Even though they'll get you some basics for the major story threads, the characters and the story just won't have the impact.)"
Wolf,"You would miss one of the best ones, 2x9, the measure of a man. One of my all time favorites, there were some good episodes in season 2."
Wolf,">Oof

oof"
Wolf,"I think that's only half the issue. The showrunner was talking about more of a contrast/compression issue on streaming which kinda made things look muddled, but their lighting choices are also just on the dark and dim side. I don't mind it that much, but I think I would prefer just a little more warmth in the lighting like in the TOS films or SNW."
Wolf,But it's been every episode this season. I feel like no one on that ship can see a frickin thing!
Wolf,"Wasn’t there a “bug” the week before where everything was horribly oversaturated?

How is it possible to have a “bug” like this? They’re spending *millions of dollars* on every episode, then someone just uses the wrong settings when they export or upload the video?

And no one bothers to check it ahead of time?"
Wolf,"And they do a REALLY bad job of hiding the fact that they are up to some sketchy stuff. ""Oh yes, we'll just fly off to this random system in the opposite direction of our destination. It will impress people, or something."""
Wolf,"I think with Sisko the context is also important. It’s three years after he lost his wife and the mother of his child as well as his ship and presumably friends. He put his life on hold for those three years at Utopia Planetia then his first mission back out he runs into a Picard who has no idea who he is and even starts smiling when he realises Sisko knows him, mistakenly thinking he’s forgotten them meeting before.

Now that’s the setup for it, but by the end of the episode Sisko is far more at peace having processed some of his feelings in the episode and is far less hostile to Picard.

EDIT: Also for context for anyone not familiar with it, Wolf 359 was likely the single most destructive loss in the Federation's history. By the time of Wolf 359 the Federation had become accustomed to having amongst the most powerful starships in the quadrant with very little able to assail them directly. Wolf 359 saw thirty nine vessels destroyed in a battle with a single Borg cube; an unprecedented loss to a single vessel, of which the Borg have a large but indeterminate number. That cube then took a run at Earth and made it into the Solar system before being deactivated by fluke; a unique connection between the then recovered Locutus and the vessel itself. This was very much the Federation's 9/11 and their reaction to it was based on the horror that a probing attack by a single Borg vessel had nearly beaten the Federation.

EDIT 2: Also I suspect Locutus wasn't named because he was deadly, Locutus is slightly fluffed latin that seems intended to translate as 'speaker'. Locutus is fundamentally a borg/human diplomat designed to ease the Federation into assimilation. When Locutus says 'I am Locutus of Borg' he means he's the Borg's spokesman."
Wolf,There is also probably a hypospray they can give you that just removes the biological effects of PTSD.
Wolf,"Wow. Wow. Wow. Everything I just read makes me super super glad I stopped watching Picard halfway through the first season. That is all so dumb. I’m so amazingly dumb. I thought Voyager ruined the Borg, but fuck it seems like this show done *ruined* the Borg.  Fair enough. I concede that this dude in this stupid ass timeline where the Borg are no longer the Borg, may have a valid complaint."
Wolf,"Yup.  Wolf 359 changed the entire tone of the franchise going forward: Federation officers got more militaristic and rivals like the Cardassians got bolder.

Then that all started to spiral with the Maquis and later the Dominion - the next big cultural upset for the Federation."
Wolf,"lol

they just said fuck it and threw out the garbage huh"
Wolf,And that character wasn't even in this episode.
Wolf,But then you wont know why Picard is making out with someone that could be his granddaughter in the first episode!
Wolf,"> but it's worth it.

No it's not. Both S1 and S2 are a disaster."
Wolf,"Picard is literally some of the worst TV I’ve ever seen, made me want to scratch my own eyes out of my sockets as the pain from that experience would be more enjoyable than what I was being forced to watch

No one should EVER watch Picard 1 and 2. EVER"
7 Days Out,Only the space episode sounds interesting to me. 
7 Days Out,"I saw all of them, they are all good.  The league of legends one is sad though when one of the player's mother was killed by his brother during a game."
7 Days Out,If stuff like that is happening in there maybe I should watch all of them after all. 
7 Days Out,"If all the ad space sold at $7 million per 30 seconds that would be over $640 million in revenue!

Linear TV really is the NFL and then everything else combined."
7 Days Out,"This is why you're never gonna kill ads. Doesn't matter what a streamer tells you, the ads will also come. It's a massive industry."
7 Days Out,WHOPPER WHOPPER WHOPPER WHOPPER
7 Days Out,I am surprised that this is news worthy. Superbowl ads are the most coveted spots in all of advertising.
7 Days Out,"It has a chance to be the most watched program ever.

No crypto ads this year though."
7 Days Out,Oooh I wonder if we’ll get more crypto ads since that industry is clearly thriving with no issues whatsoever.
7 Days Out,Just trying to see how people feel about Super Bowl commercials - when do you think they stopped being innovative and/or funny? I feel like it was over a decade ago and now it's just based on notoriety more than anything else. It seems like now it's just 1-3 ads that people seem to actually enjoy but most of them are just meh... as commercials usually are.
7 Days Out,"The one thing about the countless ads on the SB are that they at least used to be good.  

It was common during the game that you saw 3 or 4 really great ads.  Usually funny.  And probably 5 or 6 that were pretty good.  

I think last year we saw 2 that were like “yeah that’s kinda cute”."
7 Days Out,Do they ever not sell out?
7 Days Out,"Doesn't hurt that it's likely to be a good game. If I were an advertiser, I'd be leery taking any slot past the halftime, given how many blowouts there have been."
7 Days Out,"The ""superman"" comic[ issue #326](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/superman-326-a-million-dollars-a-minute/4000-18718/), 1978 featured Superman revealing his secret identity on live tv (he was tricked into signing a contract or something, I don't remember what now) and the big amazing headline was advertising slots were ""A MILLION DOLLARS A MINUTE!
""

Now it's 14x that much to advertise chewing gum during a football game."
7 Days Out,Live Long ads!
7 Days Out,Can’t wait to see a multimillion dollar ad about a company that donated $100K to charity.
7 Days Out,And some people can't afford to eat....sigh
7 Days Out,"The commercials are always fairly overrated imo, they are indeed still commercials.  I'd rather them just pan around the stadium and just show what's going on, the fan cam, etc.  I don't understand people who are excited about commercials."
7 Days Out,"That’s serious inflation. I remember as a kid reading a comic where someone had mind-controlled Superman into agreeing to reveal his secret identity on TV, and commercial time was goi g for an unprecedented million dollars a minute."
7 Days Out,And yet none of those ads will persuade me to buy anything.
7 Days Out,They knew no one likes either team so all they have is the commercials.
7 Days Out,Can’t wait for the self written ChatGPT ad
7 Days Out,They should just call this game the Super Ad.
7 Days Out,Do the teams get a cut of ad revenue?
7 Days Out,[deleted]
7 Days Out,"Even more reason to mute the TV or turn it off when the commercials come on. Let's stick it to these companies who try to steal from us. What do you say, plebs?!?!"
7 Days Out,Wow ads so exciting
7 Days Out,Still less expensive than having your ad on a Mr.Beast video. Isn't it that crazy?
7 Days Out,Damn kelce looks good
7 Days Out,What a copy/paste article. Who gives a shit.
7 Days Out,This is disgusting.
7 Days Out,And we got people who can’t afford housing or food in our country. How utterly disgusting.
7 Days Out,Damn can’t wait to skip them all.
7 Days Out,"Sold out.  Dammit, I knew I shouldn't have waited to buy a spot to advertise my NFT art."
7 Days Out,"Overrated sport, over rated event. It’s all rather boring and meaningless. People should boycott it and stop watching. 

They commodified everything even people’s lives, literally they put a price tag on consciousness viewing an event which dehumanizes people and their value, time spent doing something to meaningless numbers."
7 Days Out,"Waste of money, its watches by less people every year."
7 Days Out,Well I won't be watching.
7 Days Out,"Also should be noted no crypto ads this year. Considering FTX went kaput and other firms are struggling there won't be any celebrity pitches for crypto like in years past. 

Can only consider this a good thing."
7 Days Out,"Anyone read the article? Apparently if the last line of this article is true, ESPN is going to be hosting the game at some point soon. 

Man. That's gonna be interesting to watch to see if the ratings drop at all and if there's any backlash to having it on a channel you have to pay for. 

I know over the air channels aren't really a thing now but I feel like this is still gonna cause a shitfit."
7 Days Out,"Jokes on them, I won’t be watching at all!"
7 Days Out,Ok?
7 Days Out,This is ridiculous.
7 Days Out,Puppy monkey baby?
7 Days Out,"Cool, I wont be watching."
7 Days Out,"Only proves inflation was a lie.  Corporate greed can’t pay their employees 15-25% more, the employees who keep their companies moving along, but they can pay 7 million in hopes to get the attention of potential customers in order to eventually come up with a new excuse to pay their employees less in the future.  Makes sense."
7 Days Out,I don’t care for football. I’ll watch the commercials on YouTube the next day
7 Days Out,"I'm so glad I don't watch football. 'Tis that season again, I guess-- time to only frequent bars and restaurants that don't have TVs for a while!"
7 Days Out,I thought the hand egg bowl already happened. Something about eagles. I’m guessing it was about why the fellowship didn’t take the eagles to Mordor. At least that’s the only thing involving eagles that makes sense to me
7 Days Out,Can't believe people still watch this ad invested glorification of brain injuries. At least change up the rules or smthn
7 Days Out,Egg toss is commercials with some sport sprinkled in. yuck.
7 Days Out,I can’t wait to never purchase any of those products or services 👍
7 Days Out,We could end hunger in this country
7 Days Out,Why? They haven't been entertaining in over a decade.
7 Days Out,"After the obvious refereeing bias against the Bengals, I won't be watching."
7 Days Out,"How much ad time total, throughout the super bowl?"
7 Days Out,Back in my day a 60-second spot cost $1 million! *Shakes fist*
7 Days Out,You Super Bowl only watchers aren't ready for the pain that is WHOPPER WHOPPER WHOPPER WHOPPER.
7 Days Out,Remember $7 million for thirty seconds was what the people behind the Jesus commercials thought was the best use of their money.
7 Days Out,And at least some of those Ewell Evangelical spots sponsored by fundamentalist billionaires.
7 Days Out,I swear to god if they suck like last year ima be pissed. Ill need to be compensated for the time waisted
7 Days Out,And people will still complain about what players salaries. Like these owners and TV stations aren’t making at least 5x what they’re players are making.
7 Days Out,NFL got the State Farm Bowl they wanted
7 Days Out,Sickening.
7 Days Out,Bread and Circuses. And the serfs lap it up.
7 Days Out,"One more reason not to watch the game at all. Don’t care for the teams, don’t care for the commercials."
7 Days Out,And now you see why the NFL can sell its TV broadcast rights for billions of dollars.
7 Days Out,Look up ratings.... Live sports trump all. Next is like NCIS or some shit
7 Days Out,"What i also figured is the Super Bowl ticket price is an average of $10k. I don’t know what the NFL is charging, but if they are doing that dynamic pricing shit then they can take in several hundred million more in just ticket sales. Probably close to what they pull in ad revenue."
7 Days Out,Uhhh. Excuse me? Are you forgetting the Puppy Bowl?
7 Days Out,It's not all the ad space. Some of those slots are reserved to promote their own shows.
7 Days Out,"Ads are fine when they are filling natural breaks. Athletes need time outs and there are breaks between quarters/ periods so might as well fill them with ads. 

Chopping up a movie or tv show to add ad breaks is annoying and where people have problems

Edit: I know that many professional leagues ad in TV timeouts and I agree these are unnatural breaks and should be removed but I wouldn’t bet on it happening."
7 Days Out,"I don't care about sports, but I'll watch the finals of any game. It's like how I don't give a fuck about gymnastics or swimming until the Olympics, then I'm HEAVILY invested the whole month.

But, even as a disgusting progressive ""commie,"" I kinda love the ads. 

I just love the whole spectacle of the superbowl. And I don't want to be left out of the next 2 months worth of memes."
7 Days Out,"With live sports in particular, cuz you know, can’t you exactly do re-runs of those."
7 Days Out,"As long as they still offer a premium ad-free tier, I’m all good. As soon as they drop that option? That’s when I drop that service. 

I will GLADLY pay more. I will NOT watch ads."
7 Days Out,"A headline about selling out super bowl ad space is really sad - *look look, we’re still relevant!* - ads might stick around a while but TV is fuckin dead."
7 Days Out,Of corruption. The religious ads are coming back full circle but fox would literally suck dick for big money.
7 Days Out,I really don't understand Americans' obsession with commercials. People literally tune in to see what their favourite corporation did for their 30 second spot during one of the 50 breaks in Super Bowl
7 Days Out,That’s why Google and Facebook are printing money
7 Days Out,Because they work. Even when reddit pretends they're throwing that money away.
7 Days Out,I just want to see if they managed to get the rights to use the Daft Punk Whopper remix
7 Days Out,WHOPPER 🍔 WHOPPER 🍔 WHOPPER 🍔 WHOPPER 🍔 JUNIOR 🤏 DOUBLE 2⃣ TRIPLE 3⃣ WHOPPER 🍔 IMPOSSIBLE 🤯 OR 🤔 BACON 🥓 WHOPPER 🍔 I 👁️ RULE 👑 THIS 😎 DAY 🌞 AT BK 🧑‍🍳 HAVE IT YOUR WAY 🫵 YOU RULE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
7 Days Out,"Eat like a king who’s on a budget.  Three tasty options, fries drinks and nuggets"
7 Days Out,"BEEEEEE KAY... HAVE IT YOUR WAY.

I'll never eat Burger King again."
7 Days Out,You're just incentivizing more annoying ads by repeating this
7 Days Out,Because were less than a week away. In years past SB ads were sold out before Christmas
7 Days Out,"I think your second sentence answers your question for why it's newsworthy. The Super Bowl, whether you're an NFL fan, has become an American tradition. If you don't care at all about the game, there are plenty of people who enjoy the halftime show or the ads. 

I'm actually glad you used that term. I'm a journalism teacher and we just finished discussing that exact topic. I think anything with the Super Bowl fits the multiple elements (prominence, impact, human interest, etc) that make up what is ""newsworthy."""
7 Days Out,It's also probably an amazing return on investment in comparison to random ad placements.  Large amounts of people actively watching the commercial is the holy grail of advertisement.
7 Days Out,Does the nfl insist it be referred to as “the big game” because no one can write “super bowl?”
7 Days Out,More FTX ads this time ? They were awesome
7 Days Out,Pretty much everything I see on this sub seems more like a press release than actual news.
7 Days Out,They’re having a problem with their advertisers behind the scenes this year (all the raping). It was big deal to make it to a full slate.
7 Days Out,But I swear the first Jesus ad and I am complaining!
7 Days Out,"Crypto ads are gone probably because of the bear run and FTX collapse. 

I wanna see the Flash trailer coz of the way Warner is keeping Ezra even after his scandals."
7 Days Out,Doubt.
7 Days Out,Why this year in particular? Less COVID restrictions?
7 Days Out,You think the super bowl is gonna get 2 billion viewers to beat the World Cup final?
7 Days Out,"~~Nah not this year. Fox idiotically has no way to stream it without authenticating with a live TV provider, they don't have a Paramount+ or Peacock equivalent.~~

I was wrong! [It's free in the Fox app, even in 4k!](https://tvanswerman.com/2023/02/06/can-you-watch-the-super-bowl-for-free-will-the-4k-feed-be-free/#:~:text=As%20Fox%20did%20in%202020,either%20one%20on%20the%20apps.)"

Perfume,"I like how parts of the choreography was synced with the song, reminds me of Michel Gondry's ""Around the World"" video. 

Probably reading into it too much but there seemed to be a few references to other works in there. The flashing strobe lights had a Twin Peaks vibe to it, the wild left arm a reference to Dr.Strangelove, the ballet part reminded me of Black Swan especially with her falling off the stage.

I interpreted his action as rather being that he went from wanting the best for his kids to feeling he owes them nothing!<"
Lion Pride,"Not much of an arc really. He starts as a dick to everyone, and ends as a dick to everyone. The character doesn't change. 

Don't get me wrong, I love the acting and writing on the show, but there's very little arc to Logan."
Lion Pride,K.
Lion Pride,"I think the change is there, but it's not in his actions but in his reasoning and perceptions."
Lion Pride,Fake worse than Bear a warm hotel Grills
Lion Pride,"What confirmed it for me is the amount of such great camera shots they capture of all the individual encounters or events.  There will be multiple angles of him doing something specific, especially wider scenes, yet you never catch a glimpse of any crew or equipment set up.  It’s tells me they have to be super careful and deliberate, probably taking hours to set up and film a 30 second reel.  Probably with multiple run through of the same task.

Reminds me too of wildlife documentaries where they make up a reasonable story arc of a random animal then clip together hundred of probably unrelated shots to try to tell that story.  There’s some especially hectic scenes in this (hunts, descents, etc.) that probably make little sense if you watched them without the narrative voiceover leading you through a mostly fictional scenario of out of order takes.

I do enjoy his style of adventure storytelling and what appears to be genuine excitement, but any of these expeditions would take half a year and be mostly mundane bush whacking or walking.  It’d be a tremendous waste of his time and the studio’s resources to actually have him complete these treks with a full crew in tow to then toss 99.9% of the film."
Lion Pride,">They never actually show him in proximity to the lions. When they do show the lions it almost looks some of them are laying next to side of a road, as if it is footage from a safari park.

...what is ""proximity"" when a lion who wants to eat your ass will come at ***50 miles an hour?***

what kind of ""buffer"" to oncoming traffic do you allow as you casually stroll across the freeway?

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastest\_animals#Mammals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastest_animals#Mammals)

The lion is the second fastest wild cat with a top running speed of 80.5 km/h, though only for very short bursts. This can be highly exhausting, hence lions have to be close to their prey before starting the attack.[\[55\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastest_animals#cite_note-:6-64)

>This leaves a deep hole there that another person or animal could step into and become injured or become trapped if it is a small animal.

so.. same as ***burrowing*** animals?

millions of holes dug by all kinds of creatures.. but ***THIS*** one is a hazard?

i doubt it."
Lion Pride,Who films it
Lion Pride,"Just watched the episode where he is in Norway with the Sami people and surviving in the arctic winter. And as a Norwegian, The fact that he is not using skis or snowshoe’s just shows how little he knows/cares. This also makes me question how real the show is."
Lion Pride,It's a pretty good rule of thumb to assume that any kind of reality TV is 100% faked.
Lion Pride,"My concern is more general... The simple fact that he is in the densest jungle in the world, where people get lost 10 feet in, and is tasked with finding a village deep in the heart of the Amazon seems ludicrous. Then he happens across what is likely the only walkable bridge in hundreds of miles that lets him know he is close to the village?! Hmmmm"
Lion Pride,"man i think the animals he “runs” into are fake, cause these “wild” animals like the snakes aren’t slithering away to safety how i’ve seen them personally do 9 times out of 10, especially when you get all close. one episode he just so happened to find this rare poison caterpillar on a leaf that was set up to hang from a branch. not growing off the tree/plant, but just placed there to hang. that one was just so obviously set up it ain’t make no sense😭🤣"
Lion Pride,"just started watching, s1e1: he doesn't grip the bow string correctly when he fires an arrow.  Also, his bow drill didn't have any pressure on top of it - u can see it bounce around as he uses 2 hands to ""pump"".  Staged and fake."
Lion Pride,"I love the show, but a lot of it is probably either embellished or outright faked. What irks me the most is when he just casually picks up venomous animals that are clearly very agitated by his being there"
Lion Pride,Hazen shows survival skills and respect for all the people he encounters. By the way most people outside the US speak multiple languages. Hazen himself seems to be multi-lingual. Granted he may have had an arrangement before showing to up to their village but it’s seems like a mutually respectful arrangement. I love how he engages with the people and culture 110%. I know a lot of shows that are not willing to do that. All in all Great show.
Lion Pride,I haven't seen the episode yet but he's one of my neighbors and from what I know about him he doesn't seem like the type that would fake content like the celebrity type shows.  I doubt he's even involved in the actual editing since he is not a techy person at all.  Next time I see him around I'll see if I can ask about the lions.
Lion Pride,The whole show is fake. But nor to our surprise all reality TV is faker than fiction. I'm sorry but lions don't sleep 20 ft from a herd. They hunt the herd. Seaon 2 episode 6 deadly waters shows him spear fishing with a homemade spear gun that has no Blue tether cord. But when he finally gets a fish there is a blue tether cord attached to the spear. This is most likely because he isn't competent enough to spear a fish fir himself and the show had to use a different video clip
Lion Pride,"It's a show. He has like 2 to 5 people around him all the time plus 10 more in a portable studio nearby. He will have guides and translators, of course.
Yet, he sleeps, makes fire, travels, hunts, builds shelter etc is real. Scenes can be over dramatised for the show, animals they find, placed better for a better shoot. It's a lot better than Bear Grylls for sure but is still a show and they have to sometimes, make things look nicer than they really are."
Lion Pride,Of course it's not authentic. It's dramatized as all get out. Doesn't mean it's not fun and entertaining to watch.
Lion Pride,"I personally don't care if it's fake. He's still showing us what has been done, what we can do etc. I don't need him to be in danger.  I didn't care that Bear Grylls was ""fake"". He still tells us how to survive and his experience is authentic.  

I just started watching this but I want to know what kind of compensation these tribes are getting. I hope they are paid in whatever currency works for their culture."
Lion Pride,Do you have proof of that. We would all like to see please!!
Lion Pride,"I was just thinking that with the all drone footage they use, they might show how close (or what buffer) he was to these lions. There are no roads where he is, but the close-up shots of these lions sure looks like one or more of them is laying right next to a road. Yeah, maybe he did come across a pride of lions and give them a wide berth, but did they use stock footage of lions to represent this?"
Lion Pride,"&#x200B;

Is that the show where he was roping the lead caribou?  The herd was about 200 and the lead caribou he was roping had a red collar and bell.  None of the rest of the herd had that.  That's crazy and silly.  The only tame one was the one he was trying to rope.  So fake!  How gullible does he and National Geographic think we are?"
Lion Pride,"Denmark has a military thing in greenland that patrols all of nort east greenland. Its called ""sirius"" and they use skis to get around in the snow. But still the camera angels seem a bit fake in most of these"
Lion Pride,100% agree but I do enjoy seeing how the real people survive on isolated parts of the world
Lion Pride,Also it just so happens all the people he runs into in that jungle they all speak english.
Lion Pride,Agree. But like he also happened to run by 3 stray horses that he rode on for miles before finding its owners. I still enjoy the show for what it is. The bee and insect stings did not look staged.
Lion Pride,"On épisode 2 now and there’s a clip of him wading through the savana and he has flip flops on. Five seconds later, you can see two buildings in the background."
Lion Pride,He is not an archer yknow 😂
Lion Pride,"I don't see him really conversing in their respective languages.  He's just nodding and going, ""yeah, yeah.""  He's telling us what they are saying but he's talking in sentences where they might have just said one word.  I don't believe he's multi-lingual at all."
Lion Pride,"that would be very cool, thanks!"
Lion Pride,He's your neighbor? That's awesome.  The show does seem staged at times - but he seems such a nice chill dude it's hard to not love the show
Lion Pride,"I’m binge watching the series now and I think the guy is not only talented and brave, but incredibly hot! You’re so lucky to have him as a neighbor!"
Lion Pride,Did u had an option to ask him about this?
Lion Pride,Crossing the river in episode 2 was like ok cameraman is in a boat watching you struggle lol or eating the honey as his only source of nourishment.  What's the crew eating? Lol
Lion Pride,I don't watch the show anymore.  This is off subject but I saw a photo of a very young girl in his Instagram who seemed to hangout for years with him and his family. She looked like she was middle school age not much older than his niece who was also in the picture.   He is about twenty years older than she is.  Now I see his posts in IG with her as his longtime girlfriend.  That seems so creepy that he was hanging out with such a young girl and then formed a relationship with her.  That turned me off in watching his show or social media.  You have a creepy neighbor.
Lion Pride,This is the answer ofc but still a better show than anything with bear grylls and far better at teaching unique skills
Lion Pride,"I bet they aren't compensated in the least yet he probably makes at least 2 million a year or per episode.  The show is scripted and monotonous.  It's like Ground Hog Day meets Primal Survival.  Each episode he walks across savannahs, jungles, forests, swamps and deserts, builds a fire and shelter, eats insects and plants.  After walking across a vast continent he happens to run across the three or four Indigenous people like they were expecting him.  He doesn't connect with Indigenous people here in the U.S.  They see right through him.  In fact he has only maybe five Indigenous followers on Facebook.  No one has heard of him and that's out of 5.79 million Indigenous people.  I know they have tried to share with him primitive arts dating back 2500 years.  Artifacts found by archaeologists in the Lovelock caves in 1929. These arts are precisely replicated and still made today by the Great Basin tribes.  His response was like yeah, yeah, interesting.  Good thing they didn't gift anything to him."
Lion Pride,I know he did one time because his family came up to join him while filming in Scotland.  He said it himself.
Lion Pride,Honestly in my opinion if they were able to clearly capture both the lions and hazen with the same camera i think he'd have a high likelyhood of getting shredded for daring to disrespect a animal like that.
Lion Pride,"Just watchin the show, people he's with is speaking mandarin. He obviously has translators, guides, cameraman's etc. Yet they interact to the minimum possible"
Lion Pride,"People speak English in Guyana, it's very unique that way. But everything else, yeah fake."
Lion Pride,THIS!!!!! I was just saying that this morning. Jenkins.....
Lion Pride,"Yes, randomly found some horses that he basically steals and happens upon the owners who are cool with a white guy on their horse."
Lion Pride,"I also caught that, he appears to always walk bare footed but I did see when has his back turned to the camera and the flip flops were definitely on, maybe he just wears them when his feet get too sore 🤔"
Lion Pride,Maybe an AMA is in order?
Lion Pride,The caterers bring it in.
Lion Pride,I just watched that episode and thought the same thing lol JENKINS?! Jenkins…. And they all speak English lol
Lion Pride,"Don't think they could have found a pair of more appropriately colour-coordinated fighting stallions if they had tried for a hundred years. 

Like something out of a freaking Disney movie. "
Lion Pride,Little birdie is like a god damn serial killer displaying his trophies. That's fucked up. 
Lion Pride,"Climbing the equivalent of two everest's for a drink just to get scraned by a smug bastard Iguana 

What a life"
Lion Pride,"As a programmer, I feel for the camera team's weeks of efforts to locate the bugs they were told to find."
Lion Pride,"I'm cool with bats in the air, flying about, eating buggies and being vampires in their spare time, or whatever.

I am not okay with bats using their wing joints as freaky forelimbs and crawling about on the ground like something HR Geiger rejected as being too darn unsettling."
Lion Pride,[deleted]
Lion Pride,I'm just gonna pretend that the squirrel survived...
Lion Pride,Could you imagine if locusts were carnivorous 😫
Lion Pride,"That shot of the lion after it failed to catch the Ibix was incredible, where the camera pans out and all you can see is this lone figure of a lion stood still in the vastness of a dead world. Absolutely stunning."
Lion Pride,That snake snuggling in the sand was absolutely adorable!
Lion Pride,"I would be too afraid to talk or open my mouth, those locusts will just fly in by the thousands. "
Lion Pride,"I like how most of the time they're so careful to not disturb the animals... then they get to the locust swarm and don't give a fuck. Played over a soundtrack that was like the white walkers attacking in Game of Thrones.

Also the mole was adorable. "
Lion Pride,"So after they got done filming the locusts, did that UN group hit them with a tasty cloud of bug poison, and wipe them out?"
Lion Pride,If only I knew how big Switzerland is.
Lion Pride,"I'm getting to see this for the first time on a up to date HD-LCD-4D-somethingelseD TV, instead of my nine year old crappy Tesco Value TV.

Oh my. Oh *my*. This is pretty damn fabulous stuff. It looks realer than real life. "
Lion Pride,"Thoughts:

1. The music during the locust scene was incredible

2. I don't at all understand how the horse fight ended. The white stallion missed a kick so he lost? All the kicks we saw were misses.

3. Bat v Scorpion was pretty creepy to watch, though the clarity of the footage filming such small creatures in a pitch-black desert is amazing"
Lion Pride,"Jesus Christ, goshawk, that man has a family!"
Lion Pride,"Got a big ""A Bug's Life"" vibe from those locusts!"
Lion Pride,Holy shit that mole was brutal. Black hole sucked in the poor bug.
Lion Pride,Hats off to those guys I wouldn't walk into a literal swarm of locusts. 
Lion Pride,"They don't seem to be great at biting, maybe something for them to work on."
Lion Pride,Chameleon made me jump 
Lion Pride,Nope nope nope nope.
Lion Pride,Sponge bird?
Lion Pride,Is that watering hole footage lifted from the Africa tv series they did? 
Lion Pride,You can tell hans zimmer was in Batman mode when he did the locust theme. The dark knight theme and the locust theme were very similar.
Lion Pride,"My favorite part of this episode was the way Attenborough says ""jazz hands"" "
Lion Pride,Brave men running in there.
Lion Pride,Everybody do the locust dance
Lion Pride,Oh fuck its lizards and snakes again. Although that snake does look nice and snug
Lion Pride,What happens to the billion or so locust carcasses after they die? Some lucky predator is gonna have a field day. 
Lion Pride,"Jesus, that bird having animal skewers is fucking brutal."
Lion Pride,Boom headshot!
Lion Pride,Isn't that butcherbird loggerhead shrike?
Lion Pride,A giraffe could kill a lion with a single kick? That's pretty badass!
Lion Pride,With love from Moses
Lion Pride,"That beetle is doing some stellar yoga moves there. Very impressive headstand, my buggy friend. "
Lion Pride,Damn cool that they could be on time to see a waterfall happen from rainwater and mud.
Lion Pride,Second best episode after Islands. All have been brilliant to be fair. 
Lion Pride,"anyone know what track is being played during the diary segment, immediately when the locust swarm is discovered? i don't see it in the soundtrack. maybe elsewhere? "
Lion Pride,"I had a thought and feel free to tell me how I am an uneducated pleb... But we are spending billions trying to get to Mars (which I am totally behind let me add) and I hear we have a collossal amount of (fairly)  empty desert. Would it not be possible to colonize the desert in much the same way? Can we not build semi underground structures? (yes I know sand does not make a solid foundation) Is the ground underneath not more solid? For a planet that is running out of room, can we not spend the same kind of money right here on home planet? I know infrastructure would be an issue but is that issue not also present on Mars?         I'm talking out of my ass. But still curious "
Lion Pride,Idk if anybody noticed but the footage of the various animals drinking water has been taken from another BBC production Africa. 
Lion Pride,"So for all the beauty (and horror) of a plague of flying locusts, they all end up dead in the end?

Damn nature! "
Lion Pride,Aah it's got an arm off
Lion Pride,Fantastic episode as always!
Lion Pride,"I'm not one to usually post on post show discussion threads but holy hell that locust segment...

The whole development during the scenes with the music becoming more tense then finally when fully developed and we see the swathes of flying locusts with the dramatic song playing really struck a note on me and the info on the swarm is mind blowing. 40,000t of food/crops consumed a day. Just wow."
Lion Pride,"It kind of threw me off because the initial giraffe shown wasn't the same as the one that stomped the lion. I get it though, it's about the story so they have to edit a lot of footage together."
Lion Pride,did they use Dexter's Theme song for the Butcher bird?
Lion Pride,That little butcher bird belongs in true detective or something. Creepy
Lion Pride,"fack, right in the noggin."
Lion Pride,Definitely thought that lioness wasn't going to get up after the long horse crushed her ribs.
Lion Pride,That scene where the mole just makes that creature.dissappear was creepy as fuck....
"Attention, Love!",The Orville was great this season!
"Attention, Love!","Julia was majorly slept on. A really enjoyable look at the life of Julia Child, with a brilliant performance by Sarah Lancashire. A great, entertaining show for older generations too. 

Yellowjackets was the show I thought was overpraised. Had a great first episode and concept, but just moved at the slowest pace. For a mystery show, it needed more reveals. The whole thing felt like a pilot episode."
"Attention, Love!","Slept on: The Wilds.
Hot take: I've seen a lot of hot takes about The Audition, but haven't seen any journalists do a real deep dive on it. Simple questions you could ask the people involved, or those who made the replicas. I know all reality TV is fake, but this one seems like a bit of bullshit (I wonder how many lines he fed the people to make funny situations. Her favorite movie happens to be Apocalypto? The little boy happened to ask the Jewish teacher if the Jews killed Jesus?) would blow up the premise entirely."

This should not be controversial. Stranger Things is in the same league as an average Marvel movie. It has extremely average and cliché writing and characters. I'm not surprised it's popular, but it's been extremely overrated this season on reddit."
"Attention, Love!","Slow Horses was a pretty faithful adaptation of the book, and it sounds like they already green lit season two before the premiere.  So why stretch it out?  The whole story takes place over 48ish hours, like most of the books.

Honorable mentions that would have been great had they ended a lot sooner

Heroes- the writers strike unfortunately killed this one.  It was one of the very few shows that was actually perfect for its first season. Then a steady decline from season 2 on.  Nerfing Peter in season 3 was the wrong move and hurt his character. 


The Flash CW- this one was amazing from the first season to most of the way into season 3. My biggest gripes were: how they seemed to repeat the same plot lines just with a different speedster villain.  And Iris... oh my gosh. She was great the first few seasons.  But they couldn't escape their formula they used.  Depower Barry. OHNOEZ guys!! Iris is in crisis.  Or Iris is mad at Barry or Iris needs rescued AGAIN.  It got so tired so quick


Arrow CW... this one was consistently good almost throughout the entire run of the series.  It was brilliant  with the exception of Felicity. They killed off original Laurel and shoehorned the actor who played Felicity into all of the roles Laurel should have been in."

"Attention, Love!","I really loved Legion, The OA, Broad City, Fleabag, mindhunter (s1) and then a bunch of anime"
"Attention, Love!",If we include limited series then Arcane should definitely be all the list.   I have never seen any show in any format quite so dense with symbolism and lore and meaning.
"Attention, Love!",I tried Band of Brothers many years ago. When I saw David Schwimmer cast as a hard ass sergeant that just totally broke the show for me. I couldn't watch it. How many episodes is he in? I'd like to give it another shot.
"Attention, Love!",Swedgin! Cocksucka!
"Attention, Love!",This is my top choice.
"Attention, Love!",Man do I love true detective season 1. It’s always my answer to this question
Love @ Seventeen,"Why the hell, did no one act appropriately to the woman with the torn off jaw? They kinda just stood there and ho-dummed around. "
Love @ Seventeen,Halfway in and the only scene I've enjoyed so far is the opener. This show is ripe with cliche plotlines and one dimensional characters from what I've witnessed. 
Love @ Seventeen,"It was Under the Dome, but with mist..."
Love @ Seventeen,"I'm at the end of the third episode and jesus fuck this is the worst show I've seen in a long while. I want to like it because Stephen King but fuck did the writers have a field day taking what should be a decent horror flick and turning it into a cluster fuck of nothing happening.

also I'll be damned if that ""gay"" kid isn't actually just faking being gay and was infact the one that raped his best friend instead of the football player.

upon further examination that kid is for sure a socio-path who probably had a gay phase."
Love @ Seventeen,I got so bored by the melodrama I almost missed when the mist actually got there. 
Love @ Seventeen,This was absolutely awful
Love @ Seventeen,Wow.  That was a stinker.
Love @ Seventeen,"I hate to say it, but the first episode reminded me a lot of the 'Under The Dome' series."
Love @ Seventeen,"Just watched this and omg cringey as hell. Acting is terrible. Typical stereotype of a bi guy having to act all girly. Damn this show is doomed

PS: Also is it me or does the whole cast have like the same square'ish face?"
Love @ Seventeen,It's airing already? I totally Mist it. 
Love @ Seventeen,"What is this shit? 90210 with moths and beetles? This isn't the mist i remember..

"
Love @ Seventeen,It's a shame this is trash. The movie is one of my favorites 
Love @ Seventeen,Is it just me or does the mist itself when people are in it look like a super cheap and shitty filter? By which I mean it makes sense budget wise to use digital effects on the recorded footage but the effect itself is really badly done.
Love @ Seventeen,"10 minutes in and my head hurts. This plays on network tv right? because it feels like every other teenage drama show.

No wonder they released three episodes at once."
Love @ Seventeen,[deleted]
Love @ Seventeen,"Who the fuck ok'd this hot garbage? 

This shit fucking sucks."
Love @ Seventeen,Could they not make ONE likable character? The only people I don't hate right now are the Black Guy and the Main guy both because they haven't really done anything yet.
Love @ Seventeen,"Quantum gender fruit loop in eye-liner, ""Football is white male aggression"".  Ok, I'm done with this one.  Someone tell me if a mist monster eats the SJW piece of crap so I can decide whether or not to give it another try."
Love @ Seventeen,Nothing like losing your job the day of the apocalypse. 
Love @ Seventeen,"http://www.slashfilm.com/the-mist-showrunner-interview/

Interview with the show runner. Notice this part. 

>We’re taking a slightly different approach to the mist. We didn’t want to do too much of a monster show. I love the movie and I love that about the movie but we felt for sustaining a long running series, we had to take it in a slightly different direction. We went out and pitched as Ingmar Bergman’s Jaws, which was a joke, of course, but there’s still some truth to the extent that we are less concerned about the shark and more concerned about how people react to the shark. So we did sort of dial it slightly towards more psychological drama and horror than the monster movie homage that was in the original movie.

Yup, not gonna be monster for a while. A novel written to be a monster series being slaughtered. "
Love @ Seventeen,">Brian Hunt

Love @ Seventeen,[deleted]
Love @ Seventeen,"Can we do without all the forced social clichés...It's literally like they went on Jezebel or some other extreme left site and just copied the headlines into the plot without any context.

Why can't writers for these shows follow the lead of Arrow? Arrow has a gay character (Curtis), a diversity that doesn't feel crammed down our throats (Digg, Mad Dogg, etc.), and even tackled gun violence once without necessarily choosing a side.

We have the opposite here, with this crap show boring us with social clichés before the monsters even come. I mean c'mon!!! You seriously couldn't go 1 episode without spraying politics everywhere Spike! No wonder the channel has nothing good to offer."
Love @ Seventeen,"This was so...fucking....bad

Opens with killing a dog, automatically makes me hate the show

40 minutes of towny melodrama I could watch on any number of other of channels.

Poor acting all around.

Stereotypical characters. 

Poor script"
Love @ Seventeen,"It physically hurts me how bad this is.

I was so excited too..."
Love @ Seventeen,"Am I the only one here who enjoyed this? Like, it's really bad, and awfully cringy, but it's entertaining in a stupid way. Definitely terrible tho. "
Love @ Seventeen,Christ that was awful. It's like they were doing paint by numbers storytelling...I'll stick with the movie or even the story.
Love @ Seventeen,"Just watched the first episode. I have to say this is most likely the worst pilot I have watched in a long long time. It feels like it's written by some millennial feminist.

The acting is so off-point it's cringe-worthy, not to mention the script seems written by some fan-fiction writer. The father is so unlikable, it's almost crazy to phathom. The mother just as much, I actually bonded more with the judgmental catholic woman. 

The characters have no self-awareness what-so ever. The father the least off all, playing the victim card right after it happened. 

I love this series and I'm seeing it get dragged through the mud. I hope the next episode is somewhat better, hopefully they have different writers for this show. "
Love @ Seventeen,"Very Under-the-Dome-ish, which means it might turn into another great guilty pleasure show to hate watch every week. "
Love @ Seventeen,well they ruined this show right off the bat! this concept could have been something really cool. Garbage! 
Love @ Seventeen,[Loving the script](http://i.imgur.com/TFfhM82.jpg)
Love @ Seventeen,"As soon as I saw that shot of the high school at all I screamed nooooo at the tv screen and sure enough it had to go teenage drama in a bad way. It's like they tried to make a mishmash of all the popular new Netflix tv shows but missed the originality part. Thaaaat being said pilots often suck and we are spoiled by the new out the gate awesomeness of full season shows in Amazon and Netflix etc, so I will give 'et a chance. Maybe they'll kill off everyone quickly please. Please"
Love @ Seventeen,"Not trying to slow down the hate train, but you might want to consider going to Spike's website and streaming the next two episodes. Then I believe everyone can formulate a more thoughtful opinion upon the show. 
Edit: I also found the premiere episode to be pretty meh."
Love @ Seventeen,"Now I know why cats hate being sprayed with a 'Mist'.

How could they mess this up so bad?

Oh well, will watch so I have something to shake my fist at a cloud about."
Love @ Seventeen,"First question: how are they going to change this to stretch it out into series length?

Second question: are they going to keep the book's ending, or the film's ending? Thoughts?"
Love @ Seventeen,"Yeah, the first episode is some grade A bullshit. 
I recommend skipping it. You get enough context later on.


Just for the fun of it i'll speculate: The ""gay"" best friend is going to turn out not to be gay at all. In fact he's the rapist. Why not have him confess it moments before sacrificing himself. What a twist Mr. Shyamalan"
Love @ Seventeen,[deleted]
Love @ Seventeen,"When he took the gun off her there is the sound of a hammer being cocked and chamber cycling but it was a 1911 and the hammer wasn't cocked. 


Poor editing"
Love @ Seventeen,Actually looks like Maine though. Props to the production company for the Nova Scotia locations.
Love @ Seventeen,"First, I am a huge SK fan, but when I saw that a) this show was on Spike, and b) they were going to veer from the story and make it focus on a small town, I knew it was bound to fail.

I watched it last night, and was bummed but I expected it to be bad. At least I saw the trailer for IT again."
Love @ Seventeen,"What a mess. I just finished rewatching Sorpranos and just wrapped up Better call Saul so I've been used to some high level tv but this is just so fucking stupid. I'm actually kinda pissed, the Mist was my favorite King story and the movie was even better. I can't imagine how they could fuck this up so bad. The show is stupid. Bad writing, bad direction and most of all boring. "
Love @ Seventeen,"Can we talk about the old women, she had it all figured it out, then why did she die if she was with the mist and why did alex get  attacked at the end if she survived it once since she would be the prime reason of this all. Thank you for replies"
Love @ Seventeen,"I think it's picked up a bit, now that the mist is actually here."
Love @ Seventeen,Why do they got put in these bullshit sjw story lines? It's so distracting.  
Love @ Seventeen,"""I send my scourge I send my sword, thus saith the Lord"""
Love @ Seventeen,To me it feels like it's written by a somebody who's not very proficient in his social skills. 
Love @ Seventeen,Watching the pilot. Seriously what the fuck am i watching. 
Love @ Seventeen,"Watched the first 3 episodes. It had so much potential, but it's trash. It's so horrible. It really is full of cliches, ignorant characters and everyone just plays dumb. No one saves weapons, reinforces doors, thinks of general safety. It's like no one has common sense. Just finished episode 3 and the old lady just got under my skin.

Maybe it's a spoiler, but they have the mentality to watch people die and just fall down for no reason to watch. Like I can't. It's just a poor attempt at anything."
Love @ Seventeen,"I could only watch about 10min. The insistence on forcing social ""issues"" down my throat was more than annoying. 


Also the mom's completely retarded. Who the fuck tells a guy your daughter likes ""she (17) is not old enough for a party?"". At least make up an excuse or something. "
Love @ Seventeen,Stop by /r/themist for additional discussion on this week's and future episodes!
Love @ Seventeen,I can't imagine any of those pictures coming out well.
Love @ Seventeen,I liked the show. The obvious sjw plotlines were almost too obvious though. I think they might surprise us with the gay friend being the real rapist though. Or at least it's not the suspected quarterback.
Love @ Seventeen,"As a Chinese viewer, I can only tell it's quite similar to the movie. I didn't read the original novel, but I know that the movie was good. So far, this new TV series storylines has resembled the some movie patterns and if you thought the movie storylines were intriguing to you, then you'd probably feel the same about this series. BTW, I just watched the first two episodes and they were not bad. "
Love @ Seventeen,Moth guy was alright I guess. CGI were awful though. I'll keep watching to see the other monsters but everything else is really bad.
Love @ Seventeen,Is this gonna suffer the same fate as The Dome did?
Love @ Seventeen,So the verdict = it's shit? How do they keep screwing these shows up; surely they have the best and brightest people on board with stellar CV's?
Love @ Seventeen,This is some great schlock. The 3rd episode is fucking *bananas.* My jaw was just slack at the nonsense onscreen.
Love @ Seventeen,"It's OK... still waiting for the giant monsters, but this would probably work better as a one-shot season."
Love @ Seventeen,Saw a commercial for it-date and time when it would air. So I used my dvr to go to the day to set a recording but it wasn't there!
Love @ Seventeen,I'm barely into the pilot and i'm already rooting for the Mist to kill everyone.
Love @ Seventeen,"On the bright side, not a single character in the premier is relatable or interesting so I'm looking forward to them all dying. Horribly.


Utterly shit rehash of a decent horror story. Best just to re-watch the movie (which was pretty good, if a bit of a downer)."
Love @ Seventeen,Didn't seem that bad to me not sure if it is justified or eveyroen overreacting about how bad it is.
Love @ Seventeen,Are we sure that Mrs Carmody is dead?
Love @ Seventeen,[removed]
Love @ Seventeen,I dig bad movies. But this is beyond me. Feels like I'm watching really sad forced movie about actors doing shit stuffs for contract and whole movie is just laughing at me.
Love @ Seventeen,"Just going to say this: the show is absolute shit. Cringe worthy acting, awful writing, every cliche and stereotype is blown out of proportion, and the plots are just plain stupid. I even held on until episode 5 and I just can't watch any more and waste my time with this show. "
Love @ Seventeen,"I give up on waiting for a story to happen or anything interesting to happen and the actors are terrible. I won't watch episode 6, no reason to.  "
Love @ Seventeen,"I remember the movie, or? Was that another film with similar plot. Must be thinking of John Carpenter's ""The Fog"" now that I think of it.

Steven King must be having some kind of Renessance right now, because there is also the ""It"" movie, and another series already out there? Or movie based on the Dark Tower? I forget.

Anyway, sorry to get off topic. I really liked the intro, where we don't know an thing more than the military guy, waking up in the forest, doesn't know who he is. That definitely will have some weight in upcoming episodes; like--why was he there to begin with and why didn't he remember anything?

The pilot seems to set things up rather quickly. Like the deputy who has a fear of bugs--look how that turned out! And the woman gets her jaw ripped off! Could that have to do with her saying the young girl lied about being raped? In other words, being a mouthy, horrible person? And of course the druggy girl, seeing her dead mother or friend before going into the church; a fear of hers? Did she let that woman down and regrets it?"
Love @ Seventeen,6-10 was great! You can really see some weird power trip and religious shinanigans during an apocalypse
Love @ Seventeen,"I actually liked it. I know the story and characters are different from what we know from the novel and the original movie, and I know the storyline kinda sucks and the acting was somewhat poor. However, it was made by some network I never heard of, they did good though, the details were good enough. If this was made by a better network, it would have gotten a 9/10 surely, it might have even surpassed Stranger Things(since both stories belong to Stephen King). I'd love to have a second season, even if it's poor as the first one, the story is all that matters."
Love @ Seventeen,MUCH to my surprise i didn't hate this first episode but i didn't love it either. it's just meh....i did like the friendship between the teen girl and her bi-guy friend. 
Love @ Seventeen,[removed]
Love @ Seventeen,"Great!
You hardly notice the complete lack of monsters, for all the interesting stories about people their feelings and problems.

"
Love @ Seventeen,I miss Under the Dome
Love @ Seventeen,"Opening scene, not a spolier per say, but some dog gets killed, and they show its head cut off...like fully gore...that alone is a huge thumbs down for me.  Rest of the show sucks...not returning, especially cuz of the dog killing though!!,,,,,,!,"
Love @ Seventeen,"I also disliked how think the mist was with how people were reacting to it. Sorry, but nobody is realistically going to drive home or try to ride their bikes in a mist that you can't see 2ft through. Sure a few people might try and give up, but everyone was acting like it was hardly out of the ordinary. "
Love @ Seventeen,"""No way a bear could have done that""

Ummm YES way a bear could have done that, that's EXACTLY what a bear could have done!"
Love @ Seventeen,"Well, to be fair, that character was really dumb and one dimensional. The other characters could detect this and decided it was okay since she clearly had to go."
Love @ Seventeen,/r/commagore
Love @ Seventeen,The forced social clichés are awful. It's the equivalent of Family Matters from the early 90s trying to force in a story about staying away from crack and street gangs. It's so on the nose and stereotyped that it makes you cringe.  
Love @ Seventeen,Is it another Under the Dome?
Love @ Seventeen,it will make it that much more enjoyable when they are getting ripped apart by the monsters.  
Love @ Seventeen,It doesn't get better in ep 2
Love @ Seventeen,It may actually be worse than The Dome.
Love @ Seventeen,So not worth watching?
Love @ Seventeen,"So, if under the Dome was my favorite guilty pleasure of the last 10 years...? "
Love @ Seventeen,So fuckin accurate it hurts.
Love @ Seventeen,Guarantee the bi kid is the one who did it and pinned it on the football player.  
Love @ Seventeen,I haven't seen the third episode yet but i also got the impression it was the gay kid. We will have to wait for the dna tests to co.e back first though. Or maybe the Mist will make him go insane...
Love @ Seventeen,You got it 2 months in advance kiddo
Love @ Seventeen,">third episode

Where?"
Love @ Seventeen,"Indeed. Or lying about something that happened due to repressed jealousy.

HE IS A SINNER!!!!!!"
Love @ Seventeen,"Lol, the mist took what - 1-2 days to get there? No one else noticed it in that time? You'd think a weather or military satellite would have picked it up and they would be talking about it on the news..."
Love @ Seventeen,"That sums it up for me. 1 episode was plenty to see this was just going to be stupidly written characters, and lots of things jumping out at people."
Love @ Seventeen,Only with a smaller budget.
Love @ Seventeen,"I was thinking the same thing. is this show really gonna be one big rape drama? and really the bi guy who wears makeup has a muscly dad who hates him and also has a spite-boner against athletes in high school. I think I might fucking die from how typical this is.



people better start getting eaten by monsters FAST or this show is doomed."
Love @ Seventeen,The mom has no idea idea how to deliver lines. 
Love @ Seventeen,You mist nothing.
Love @ Seventeen,And the story is an all time great. This...is something else.
Love @ Seventeen,">Is it just me

 Probably not"

The King of Romance,"King of the Hill never leaves my Watchlist on Hulu. When I finish it, I immediately start it over. I'm in double digits for rewatches for sure. And it's not like I'm watching it every day, but that show is timeless for me."
The King of Romance,Yep. This is great news I'll tell you hwhat.
The King of Romance,Resplendent
The King of Romance,"“Yeah, man I tell you whot man, that dang Ol’ Greg, talking about O.G. and then that Mike Judge … Inspirations, man … the original show, dang ol’ classic … Got my kids, man, walking around talking about ‘That’s my purse!

The King of Romance,bAAUhhh
The King of Romance,"I notice there's no mention of Toby Huss in the returning cast. There's zero chance he's going to voice Kahn this time, I wonder if they're going to kill him off or recast him.

Also wonder if they give Huss another role. Obviously can't be Cotton unless they do flashbacks or he's a ghost lol. Maybe he voices Good Hank?"
The King of Romance,"if this somehow revives interest in King of the Hill Youtube Poops, I'll definitely watch it."
The King of Romance,Judge killed it with Silicon Valley. I'm expecting this will be great.
The King of Romance,"Yay but sad that there’s not gonna be any Luanne, Lucky or even Ladybird."
The King of Romance,[where boomhauer came from interview](https://youtu.be/rd_rty0ovgQ)
The King of Romance,They saw the numbers. r/kingofthehill are the real heroes for this.
The King of Romance,"I'm a MASSIVE fan of this series, so this news could not be more welcomed!  

Interesting that as they're talking about the original cast returning, there's no mention of Kahn.  Toby Huss is incredible in the role, but I wouldn't be shocked with today's climate if they decide to recast Kahn with an Asian voice actor."
The King of Romance,"I hope that they give Lucky and Luanne a ""happily ever after"" sorta ending. Please for the love of god just have them mention how they just moved away to a nice big house and are just raising their baby."
The King of Romance,"Details:

>Hulu is laying out the welcome Matt for the Hill Family: the streamer is reviving King of the Hill from 20th Television Animation, with co-creators Mike Judge and Greg Daniels set to return, as well as the beloved former cast.

>Judge will reprise his role as Hank Hill, while Kathy Najimy will be back as his wife Peggy, Stephen Root as Bill, Pamela Adlon as Bobby Hill, Johnny Hardwick as Dale and Lauren Tom as Minh. The reboot has been in the works since the 2017 San Francisco Sketchfest, where Judge and Daniels reconnected with the cast and celebrated the 20th anniversary of the old Fox animated show."

The King of Romance,Hulu's just leaning all the way into the revival game...
The King of Romance,No mention of Toby Huss probably answers that uncomfortable question.
The King of Romance,"I’m so excited, the new Beavis and Butthead movie and show both slap, he’s still got it"

The King of Romance,This news made my day. Really hope the rumored time jump is true. Bobby in his twenties would be something else.

The King of Romance,"Love the show, but just wish they would make new stuff instead of trying to go back to nostalgia. ( goes for movies and tv shows)"
The King of Romance,"Mike Judge is great. He always holds on to his vision, he doesn’t approve shitty knock offs or let studios pressure him into watering things down. And his influence on 90s music culture is still very overlooked IMO. There are so many bands I learned of through Beavis and Butthead that I otherwise probably never would have."

The King of Romance,"This is one of the best things I've heard this year thus far!! Now this show may not be for everyone but for those who enjoyed it or grew up with it being a presence on their TV this is awesome. Some may say this show is dumb, but this show teaches more values, manners, cultural differences, being thankful, acknowledging a mistake and manning up to own it, respect to others in our lives, and how different people can be. I can't wait for this to aire, just as I'm sure John Redcorn can't wait to fix Nancy's next headache. Lol"

The King of Romance,Time for some spa-Peggy and meatballs!
The King of Romance,I’m honestly a little worried with what they’ll do with it. I worry it might become a lot more political than it was in the past.
The King of Romance,RIP Luann
The King of Romance,Not a single mention of Luanne. Wtf?! RIP Brittany
The King of Romance,"I mean - Dale has gone full QAnon - or he is Q. Peggy has been exposed on Twitter as a Karen. Hank’s been canceled. Boomhower is killing it on Tender. Bill has lost all his money due to an Onlyfans addiction. Bobby has been radicalized on YouTube. Connie’s GPA has slipped because she’s decided to be a TikToker. Life was so much simpler in 2010, I’ll tell you what."
The King of Romance,"I *loved* King of the Hill, but I don't like this at all. King of the Hill was a show of its time through-and-through, and that time has passed. 

I want to be clear: gatekeeping reboots or sequels is dumb, this is not me saying that anyone excited for this is enjoying themselves wrong, I'm saying that I have serious doubts this particular revival can be done well."
The King of Romance,"**Hank:** Get that dang gum phone outta my face Bobby. What in the hell are you doing?

**Hank:** What the world is a TikTok? 

**Bobby:** It's social media. See you can make videos and share them all over the world. I'm trying to go viral! I'm an influencer!

**Hank:** if you don't out that thing outta my face...

The King of Romance,Not Brittany Murphy :(
The King of Romance,No Tom Petty though. :(
The King of Romance,I’d imagine they’d *never* recast Luanne in respect of Brittany. So does this confirm that they’re retiring the character?
Love by Design,"I think this has enough sunk cost to go till season 4, and then promptly get canned."
Love by Design,"The two can easily co-exist and don’t seem to cover the same material.

The movies probably won’t be out until the show’s final season if not later."
Love by Design,"I mean...yeah? What is the head of the studio supposed to say otherwise? She'd be fired if she was doing interviews, claiming the show was doomed and everything is a disaster."
Love by Design,>And then something happened that the ring did not intend.
Love by Design,"Does anyone know how well the series is doing?  I don't ever see it talked about, a la The Last of Us or The White Lotus."
Love by Design,"Literally everyone when Lord of the Rings movies came out, even my mom who would never in a million years read the books or any other fantasy genre stuff: Did you see Lord of the Rings yet? You HAVE to see it.




No one at all, even the most hardcore fantasy nerds I know: Did you watch Rings of Power?




I had to google the title of that TV show to write this, that should tell you how that shit show is going.


Edit:  I get it's not completely without fans, but to act like it's in any way a hit is insane. It cost an astronomical amount of money to make for a show no one will remember in 5 years. It's an undeniable failure."
Love by Design,Who else peaced out of Rings of Power forever the second that Galadriel tried to swim back home from elf heaven? That has to be one of the most unintentionally hilarious scenes ever committed to film.
Love by Design,"Remember when every episode included at minimum one speech per episode, each less inspiring than the one that came before it? It was like a reverse Bill Pullman from Independence Day, it was kinda hilarious, even the people listening in the show looked bored every time."
Love by Design,No Jennifer you don’t
Love by Design,"And that's coffee all over my laptop. Thanks, Jennifer."
Love by Design,"Warner are going to have for fantasy lotr on film and GOT on tv if it all works out.Good combo. I hope they do get to do the films and it turns out great. Plan it out properly.

Also hoping the dune 2 and dune sisterhood hbo max shows are great and a hit.

Amazon will be fine either way. I know the show is a bit hated in these parts but its a solid base so far. They can definitely up the pace and improve on what they have built.  At the very least the budget, production values and Score will carry hard. Amazon in general seems to be going hard for big shows recently with fallout, possibly god of war, mass effect and blade runner all coming later."
Love by Design,"Fan love? Do they mean actors paid to look like fans?


This show is an insult to Tolkien and actual fans."
Love by Design,I'm curious to see if Amazon will retrench ROP to be... good?
Love by Design,yea maybe she should be fazed cause that first season was hot garbage
Love by Design,"The producers of RoP are still trying to pretend it was a success? I wouldn't say it was the biggest flop recently, but it absolutely failed"
Love by Design,"Genuinely surprised at the hate this show got. It was definitely in my top 10 seasons of last year. 

It wasn't perfect, of course. I found the ""Mordor"" text reveal super jarring and out of place. I thought the first episode and the finale were weaker than the rest of the season. 

But overall I found it really beautiful, exciting, and different!"
Love by Design,"Anyone ever think about, I don't know, coming up with an original fantasy setting for movies or TV?"
Love by Design,"
The show was so terrible that the new movies can only help. People will get excited about the world, will want to see more, and will put up with the shows terrible writing and character development."
Love by Design,"Do you though? 

RoP had good number 100% because of the franchise, if you just make bad content that will not last indefinitely. Kinda like Star Wars."
Love by Design,"Oh, yeah. Everybody *loves* your show."
Love by Design,"> One of Salke’s defining moves at Amazon was to secure television rights to the same literary works, which she achieved at great expense. **The first season of Amazon’s “The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power” premiered in 2022 with** a big global marketing push and critical acclaim — as well as **a reported budget north of $450 million for the first batch of episodes.** Previously, **Warner Bros. pushed out two massively successful film franchises with auteur Peter Jackson beginning in 2001. Those films grossed over $5 billion at the worldwide box office** and brought home **a best picture Oscar for one of the entries.**


> **“We’ll see,” Salke told Variety when asked how much “LOTR” would be too much for the market.** “We love our original series. We’re extremely proud of it, and invested long term. So, we definitely think there’s enough fan love to sustain ours for a long time.”"
Love by Design,Watching this right now really really hard for me to get past episode 3 but gave it another try and now I’m liking it. It’s not perfect or anything but it’s entertaining
Love by Design,The problem with the show isn’t that it has competition it’s that it’s not that great
Love by Design,Huge lord of the rings fan. Rings of power had its issues for sure but I fucking loved it.
Love by Design,Still think it was stupid to have us wait 2 years for season 2 rather than film 1+2 back to back and have the wait for season 3
Love by Design,Glad to hear they are sticking with it. I really liked the rings of power series. Slow burn but loved the buildup to the finale.
Love by Design,"Not anymore, I expect.

But I guess time will tell."
Love by Design,"The way the narrative is stuck in slow motion (season 1 was basically entirely backstory) I wouldn't be shocked if season 4 was the big climax anyway, with 5 planned to be all falling action"
Love by Design,By the time season 4 comes around I can guarantee the thought of canning the show won’t be in consideration at all
Love by Design,"I think that their line of thinking is: ""*We are still better than Zazlav*""."
Love by Design,As opposed to being fired because the show IS doomed and everything IS a disaster.But that's Hollywood: failure goes UP.
Love by Design,"I feel like on the scale of ""The Witcher"" to ""House of the Dragon,"" the public is lumping it more in the Witchening camp. 

I don't think it's anywhere near that much of a lost cause, but I do think it'll have work twice as hard in season 2 to convince people otherwise."
Love by Design,"According to Amazon 4th Quarter Results, It was viewed by 100m individuals with a watch time of 24 billion minutes.

[Source](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2023/Amazon.com-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-Results/default.aspx)

How that relates to expectation or Subscriber growth they didn't go into."
Love by Design,"It's Amazon's most watched show ever, but that's not exactly a high bar and the network has been cagey as to its actual numbers. They've spent far too much money into it to cancel it. Unless someone on the inside leaks, we'll likely never know."
Love by Design,Well those are newer but I'd say it's been a dud as far as entering the public consciousness goes.  Amazon butchered both rings of Power and the Wheel of time shows imo.
Love by Design,"It’s terrible lol. Terrible writing, super slow pace to start, and the story feels randomly slapped together. They made Galadriel as a naive stupid girl instead of the wise badass elf that she is supposed to be. Overall terrible show for people who love Tolkien’s work."
Love by Design,"It's apparently their most watched show and is beating things like The Boys, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, or Jack Ryan which all did decently well so I'd say it's doing pretty well."
Love by Design,I watched a couple of episodes right after seeing the LOTR extended editions. The gulf in writing and acting quality was huge. Reacher is the best show on Prime for me and it likely cost less than the costume budget for Rings Of Power.
Love by Design,"It was the only non-Netflix show, along with The Boys, to make Nielsen's annual top 15 streaming list.  It's a huge hit for Amazon (as the hated The Terminal List and The Wheel of Time are). 

This sub has serious problems accepting that the opinion here is not necessarily validated by real data. Just like twitter, this is a closed bubble. Possibly this comment will disappear with negative votes, but the reality is that it was as or more successful than House of the Dragon and The Last of Us. 

No one was more successful than Yellowstone, though (another truth this sub can't stand)"
Love by Design,"I feel like reddit is weird when it comes to shows.  Reddit hivemind either hates a show or loves it.  Sadly I feel like reddit disliked ring of powers more than liked it, so the only time you would hear about it on here is if it was something bad."
Love by Design,"That was my thought as well. People that don't know much about LOTR or could care less about anything other than it being a fun story probably watch it. 

From what I've seen, it is the people that grew up loving the LOTR books, talking to their friends about the lore, anecdotes about Tolkien and CS Lewis, WW2, Elvish...those are the ones that hate the series with a passion, but that group is probably pretty small."
Love by Design,"My nerdy friends and I talked a lot about it, from admiration to criticism to speculation.

Get out of your bubble, man."
Love by Design,"I remember there were lines all the way out of the cinema for the LOTR films, every session was full in a way I haven’t seen in a long time. I think the original avatar was the last time I saw similar"
Love by Design,Haha spitting facts up in here! I 100% agree
Love by Design,"2001 when streaming platforms didn’t exist and social media was a tiny fraction of what it is today

2022 when there are dozens of entertainment outlets all producing quality IP every single week"
Love by Design,I was literally asked this weekend if I'd seen it when I met up with some old friends
Love by Design,You being out of touch tells us nothing
Love by Design,Our whole family loved the show. There’s a lot of people outside of the Reddit circle jerk that feel the same.
Love by Design,[deleted]
Love by Design,Part of me was wondering WTF were the writers thinking. But then I realized that they weren’t thinking and are just terrible.
Love by Design,"To me, that scene is emblematic of one of the show's worst issues: fake tension.

There are so many scenes that are shot like something that's supposed to be tense, but what's going to happen is so painfully obvious and it's dragged out *so much*.

It's the beginning of a ten hour show and we know Galadriel is around in LOTR, of fucking course she isn't going to leave Middle Earth and she's going to jump off the boat.

So many scenes like that, where they shot it like a tense moment but you 100% know what's going to happen because you've seen movies before and/or it's a prequel to one of the most famouse stories of all time.

Like the elf guy getting the orc blade close to his eye. OMG, what is going to happen to this main character? Oh, he was saved a moment before being blinded? No shit.

Are they gonna make the three elven rings? They are? No shit!

Is Galadriel going to join Sauron? She isn't? Who would have thought!

Rings of Power is so painfully bad.

Edit: Added thoughts."
Love by Design,"That horseback riding scene just took me out, and not in a good way. I have a handful of episodes left to watch but I just can't be bothered."
Love by Design,"Idk, I can imagine an elf not having too much of a problem swimming long distances.

I didn't really have much issue with the show. I watched maybe six episodes and then kind of forgot about it. I keep meaning to finish it but just haven't been bothered. The thing is, it just never had much of a hook besides being LOTR. The entire time I was... Whelmed. It was just very mid-tier."
Love by Design,"I watched the whole thing but she is the more unlikable main character ive seen in a while, by the final episodes i was actively rooting for someone to kill her"
Love by Design,"So funny, that's exactly when I stopped watching."
Love by Design,Yep that’s exactly where I noped out
Love by Design,[This scene?](https://youtu.be/gIrIK6Z8ybg)
Love by Design,"when you start with the rock and ship one it can only get better, in theory. Then you have Galadriel's amazing rendition of one of George Formby's best, ""You have not seen what i have seen when I'm cleaning windows"" and you just want to burn the world to the ground"
Love by Design,"They are indeed going all in on genre shows but I hope they really get some good writers/showrunners. Their last attempt Peripheral had a huge budget but absolutely middling writing that completely let it down. I don't understand how skimping on scripts in mega budget shows helps. I really hope they get better because most other streamers, including HBO, are backing off of many big budget genre shows."
Love by Design,I'm an actual fan and I quite enjoyed it. Read through the main series every 2-3 years and have read The Silmarillion twice.
Love by Design,"I'm a Tolkien fan, a stupidly obsessive one with the reddit history (complete with pathetically obscure Tolkien reference of a username) to prove it and I like it well enough (not all of it, eg anything Sauron was a big meh, but enough) ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ Didn't even get a Kit Kat. Fuck off with the 'actual fans' gatekeeping twattery."
Love by Design,"> I found the ""Mordor"" text reveal super jarring and out of place

that made me laugh pretty good. the guy asks a question and just walks away as if he saw the title and got his answer.

Felt like a video game cutscene moment"
Love by Design,"The show is gorgeous. The music is great. The acting is fine. Just the dialogue and plot are terrible. 

Really the show should just ignore everyone else and follow the elf and the dwarf. The only cast members with chemistry and fun to watch. Make them meet up with the other characters on their journey."
Love by Design,I'm not surprised but the hate people hold towards any show like this is genuinely weird.
Love by Design,lol why would anyone downvote this comment?
Love by Design,"Fantasy is an absurdly expensive genre to produce, especially with audience expectations these days that TV shows should look just as good as movies.

Not much chance of studios dumping hundreds of millions into projects that don't have built-in audiences or name recognition."
Love by Design,because audiences don’t care as much about original IP
Love by Design,"It’s bizarre, it’s super slow in most parts, but then they skip past the creation of the rings in like 10 minutes."
Love by Design,"The show is planned for 5 seasons. So, yes."
Love by Design,"We'll see. This is not even unique to this show. Almost no huge budget streaming genre show has gone past 4 seasons, 5 at max. And I really doubt this will break the trend."
Love by Design,"You know this show will probably outlast Zaslav's term at WBD, lol."
Love by Design,Alex Kurtzman has just entered the chat
Love by Design,"a female boss getting fired? Not going to happen today, and certainly not on Amazon, the most diverse and inclusive place in the universe according to themselves"
Love by Design,I wonder if they actually care about subscription gains like the rest do. It’s an entirely different value proposition.
Love by Design,"Clarkson's Farm had higher viewing numbers in the UK than Rings of Power. The UK being the birthplace of Lord of the Rings.

I love this little fact."
Love by Design,"... except it's not. First two episodes were, and then viewership tanked. It didn't even make the Nielsen Top 15 streaming shows of 2022, and was number 15 in Top 15 Original Streaming BEHIND The Boys at number 11."
Love by Design,Do you think it is potentially an awards show contender?
Love by Design,"I liked wheel of time more, but that’s probably because I haven’t read the books"
Love by Design,ok
Love by Design,"I think starting the story on a Galadriel who has been shaped by the Great War is a interesting idea that actually kinda fits in with Tolkien's own life experience. But for that to work we needed to also see the Galadriel we would come to know within the character and their writing just didn't have the nuance to deliver that. Galadriel is allowed to be impulsive and angry, but she also needs to be able to access a sort of grace and instead she is unlikable and rude."
Love by Design,Wasn’t the boys the most watched Amazon original last year? Maybe I’m misremembering the title of the article.
Love by Design,"I hear what you are saying, but people talk about Yellowstone.  It's a water cooler show. I was just curious why LOTR hasn't become a water cooler show."
Love by Design,Do you have any sources to back your claims regarding its success?
Love by Design,"Where's the actual data showing that it was more successful than HoTD besides your comment? I am sure you know the Nielsen list excludes HBO shows and you are not ignoring this to satisfy your made up statistics.

Edited, See below."
Love by Design,"Top 15 Original Streaming list, and it was the at the very bottom at 15, behind The Boys at number 11. Look at the money Amazon spent on production and promotion, plus the number of built in audience because of the IP they were adapting, and then tell me again how failing out of Top Streaming completely and crawling into Top Original Streaming 4 spots behind another Amazon title with a fraction of the budget and promotion is somehow ANYTHING for them to brag about.   
Yeah ""real data"" is important, but only when pair with context."
Love by Design,"You’re knit picking data. You’re looking at the initial popularity of the show, and neglecting the sharp decline of viewers once people realized the show was terribly made. 

So here’s the history, the show was released to a number of people excited about it. People watched and the many stopped watching. People have been giving terrible ratings on the show throughout the series and the last episode was better received and watched more. 

So you’re completely missing the fact that the show had a huge drop off. Your grabbing onto the initial hype of the show and forgetting the downward spiral the show had after the initial release lol. Amazon had to turn off the ratings option for a long time because people were giving terrible ratings for the show when it first was launched. 

https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2022/09/05/rings-of-power-is-getting-review-bombed-so-hard-amazon-suspended-reviews-entirely/?sh=6a75620f762f"
Love by Design,"I fall into this category.  I really enjoy the LotR books, but never read any of Tolkien's other works.  So I don't know what the back story should be, nor do I care.  I was entertained enough to watch the season, and I'll watch S2.  I'm interested in where the story is going to go.

Maybe an unpopular opinion, but I didn't think the show sucked as hard as people seem to think.  I think it's just judged overly harshly, which is fine because I judged the Uncharted movie pretty harshly because I LOVE the games.  But for those of us who don't care that much about the source material or how much the show strays, the show is fine.

Wheel of Time is the same.  I never read the books, so have no clue about the story.  The show was ... OK.  I'll watch the second season as well b/c it scratches a particular TV itch and I don't have to think too hard about it."
Love by Design,"thanks for the pointless observation from the years 2001-2003

doesn’t really apply anymore in the era of streaming services"
Love by Design,I think the point still stands that it made zero dents culturally. That’s a kind of rare thing to accomplish for something so high budget with a well-known IP
Love by Design,"Not trying to make it go away nor do I hate it, just stating my experience with it. 


Now you and your assumptions I want to make go away, that would be excellent."
Love by Design,"Well they were thinking. “She has to meet hot Sauron at some point”. So instead of doing something that makes more sense, they just went “uhh, how about in the middle in this gigantic oceans?”  And it wasn’t like Sauron did it on purpose either, he was literally fighting the majority of the show to not be around Galadriel"
Love by Design,I was on board for the show despite the bad writing right up until the final episode. I like the cast and I found the mystery compelling because I could envision how it would add a lot of intrigue later as they revealed the truth to the audience. But then in the final episode they squander every bit of that mystery in such a bland way...it was like popping a balloon and all my interest was gone.
Love by Design,"Trying to swim across the ocean is exactly the kind of crazy shit a First Age elf would do, this complaint has always confused me. Its not like she even made it."
Love by Design,"A first age elf is superhuman and they probably could do that. We know they don’t need to sleep if they don’t want to, don’t fatigue easily, and have been good messengers by jogging across the landscape for 2 weeks straight.

But it still comes off pretty weird because they don’t even mention that she’s doing anything unusual. They don’t mention any of these abilities or make it look like she’s performing a feat. Maybe they think the viewer will already know this about elves, which is a bit of an assumption because I don’t think the movies (which is how most of the audience knows the series) mentions it. She jumps into the sea hundreds of miles from shore and plans to swim for weeks and it’s naturally bizarre if you have no reason to think that would seem reasonable. They could have remedied this easily by including a mention of these abilities during the Elrond-Durin conversations, which already feature discussion of elf/dwarf/human differences. Elrond and Durin even go off on a days-long hike later, and that would have been a nice topic to expand on then."
Love by Design,"it would be nice if the 'conversations' in the show weren't two characters saying something that sounds profound but has no meaning, then just walking away when they're done.

Noone talks to the other person. They talk at them like its a contest to out purple prose eachother"
Love by Design,Thats good. Thats what entertainment is for anyway. For me i didnt like it. That is fine. We have the og books. It is enough
Love by Design,">Felt like a video game cutscene moment

This exactly."
Love by Design,"If you ignore the lore, as the showrunners did, it's not brutal. It's not terrible. It's .. ok. The main character is unpleasant as she repeatedly goes places and threatens them in order to speak to the manager. I call her Karendriel.  Hopefully they tone that down in S2 and stop her from acting like a crazy person (in one episode she threatens to murder all of Adar's children in front of him to make him watch and then in the next episode when a guy's like 'hey i hate those orcs' she says 'don't hold hate in your heart' like it's supposed to be profound but really was just first draft writing  that noone fixed)"
Love by Design,"Interesting, I found the dialogue quite in line with the movies! Heartfelt and powerful, if not a bit cheesy."
Love by Design,"Yeah, to me it's just kind of your standard expensive show with high production value and good actors propping up a lacking script. Not that good, not that bad, frustrating at times, with the occasional cool moment or cheesy trope. I wouldn't exactly recommend it and I don't see myself making it to season 5 if it doesn't get a little more interesting, but people act like it's My Mother The Car"
"Marry Me, or Not?","I do it as a basis of scheduling.

If I find out a show is cancelled without closure, I don’t bother watching."
"Marry Me, or Not?","What's difficult for me about this is that the show's that are in their first or second season who inevitably get cancelled, didn't have the viewership to begin with *because* people were waiting for like season 3 or 4 so they can binge it when they have the time and interest in a longer show to enjoy.  


It's a snake eating its own tail. The network/streamer cancels the show that doesn't get ratings vs viewers not watching it as it comes out because they've been burned before by cancelled shows they wait for more content to watch it lol"
"Marry Me, or Not?","The real abomination is cliffhanger endings. 

When I commit myself to a season of television, I want closure at the end. 

A contrived cliffhanger ending is a cheap and unnecessary trick."
"Marry Me, or Not?","Finally, some data to hear what I've heard anecdotally A LOT over the last couple of years."
"Marry Me, or Not?",The Babysitters Club was cancelled?! Nooooo! That was such a cute shot of nostalgia
"Marry Me, or Not?","As someone in the UK, I hate when a show is cancelled with the excuse of poor viewing figures, but it's neither advertised or not available till 6 months after airing in the US if made available at all"
"Marry Me, or Not?","Well, yeah.

Paper Girls. Good show, didn't deserve to be cancelled. I think we were five episodes in when it was announced, and then just gave up because we just didn't see the point.

The kicker is that it, and hundreds of cancelled shows just like it, are littering streaming services. With every show we choose to watch we have to look up whether it's been cancelled, or if it's popular so we can gauge if it will be cancelled."
"Marry Me, or Not?","Yeah it depends on the show.  But I will do this for some shows.


My wife is really like this tho, she almost always waits until is finished before watching.  We’ve been burned so many times before especially with Network tv before streaming was big and they’d cancel them mid season smh"
"Marry Me, or Not?",I just wait for 2 seasons before I start watching most shows.
"Marry Me, or Not?","In reading all of these comments, I find that there is a critical component of the problem that only a few point out: the market is oversaturated. There are too many shows. It's impossible to watch everything all at once. But the studio execs seem to maintain this mentality of making as many large budget shows as possible, in the hopes that a handful will become megahits. 

It's unsustainable."
"Marry Me, or Not?","\*gasp\*

well imagine that.

constantly cancelling shows after one season becuase they didnt break the ratings in 5 secs has affected viewership.

who could have possibly seen that coming?

im not sure how many /s's to append to this, so just assume infinite sarcasm please."
"Marry Me, or Not?",">A quarter of U.S. adults wait for streaming originals’ finale before starting, citing fears over the show’s potential cancellation with an unresolved ending (27%) or because they do not want to wait for the next season after a cliffhanger (24%). Nearly half (48%) of the participants who said they prefer to wait until the series ends before starting it cited a preference for binge-watching shows."
"Marry Me, or Not?",I've started listening to audio books instead. Considerably less likely just stop before the story is over.
"Marry Me, or Not?",Netflix: I didn’t do fuckin shit. I didn’t rig shit.
"Marry Me, or Not?","Still mad about OA. And recently, 1899. Fucking hell

And yeah, Mindhunter"
"Marry Me, or Not?",I’m still so mad Dark Crystal Age of Resistance was cancelled.
"Marry Me, or Not?","I'm looking at you, Netflix!"
"Marry Me, or Not?","I know it's been going on for decades, but I really wish they would stop making the season finale of a show a cliffhanger. Thankfully not all of them do it. 

There's other ways to wrap story beats up without leaving the viewers hanging with no resolution due to a cancellation. 

This is partly why I don't watch things until I know they have an ending."
"Marry Me, or Not?","This is mostly me. If there is a show I am interested on, but it didn't pop off, I won't be watching. However stuff like Rings of Power, Last of Us, Yellowjackets and more are on my list because I know their future is safe. 

Which basically means I watch the mainstream shows and ignore smaller, interesting and maybe even better projects.

And yes, The OA changed my watching habbits."
"Marry Me, or Not?","There's  TV Tropes entry for this: [The Firefly Effect](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFireflyEffect). It's been happening for a while, not just with streaming.

I *still* think that streaming doesn't cancel shows any more or less than broadcast TV has ever done or does now, so I don't really feel like it's that big of a deal. 

I strongly suspect that most people in this sub don't understand that there are viewers-per-cost metrics people look very closely at, and chances are your favorite show didn't make the cut. I *do* think they probably wait too short of a time before they make the decision--streaming habits *are* different--but I also think they *know* this. They have more metrics than we every will."
"Marry Me, or Not?",Only a quarter? That seems a little low
"Marry Me, or Not?","Yeah cliffhangers at the end of seasons have the exact opposite intended effect... instead of making me drool with
anticipation, i think about the year+ i'll have to wait and i get annoyed. GET TO THE FUCKING POINT

Every season finale should behave as if its a series finale"
"Marry Me, or Not?",Streaming services have spoiled us.  TV shows on networks get canceled all the time.  One of my favorite shows growing up was canceled in the middle of the 2nd season lol.   But what did we do?  We found another show.
"Marry Me, or Not?",Who the hell wants to invest 10+ hours into something with no ending? My time is valuable. Either the networks need to see a show through or they need to tell the writers to make every season completely self-contained.  No cliffhangers and no open ended bullshit.
"Marry Me, or Not?",Especially if that show is on Netflix.  Apple TV on the other hand does a great job of sticking with their titles.
"Marry Me, or Not?","That’s me, 100%; I’m looking forward to starting Carnival Row this weekend when the last episodes come out. I’ve been burned too many times and I HATE cliffhangers. Finish your story while I am paying attention. Don’t leave me hanging so you can assure I’ll come back next year. Tell a good story and I’ll be counting down the days while telling everyone how great the show is. Drop a cliffhanger and I’m out, and trashing your crap storytelling every chance I get."
"Marry Me, or Not?","I hate that some shows I love were cancelled after ending with HUGE cliffhangers, but at the same time I don't really regret watching those shows!

Cancelled shows are part of the life cycle of TV, and even though I have a hard time letting go, I can always rewatch things and just be glad that those episodes got made and are available"
"Marry Me, or Not?","I feel like everyone forgot the good old days where they would randomly change the time a show aired without warning and then would cancel it mid-season, never to be seen again🤣"
"Marry Me, or Not?",It's funny I made a post about this about a month ago and I was told it wasn't happening.
"Marry Me, or Not?","I'd bet  long-arc shows are more at risk of this cancellation phenomena than an old-style ""monster of the week"" show.

If I was a showrunner with a netflix commission I'd get rid of my fancy long arc and switch to an old style show where every episode can stand alone.

With the long arcs viewers want to sit down and digest in big chunks, so they wait until there's an arc completion to get to.  Unfortunately by the time the arc completion is broadcast those ""wait until it's fully baked"" viewers habits have sealed the shows fate by staying away.

This is just some stupid theory I've concocted based on nothing but guesses."
"Marry Me, or Not?",Unpopular Opinion: most of the stuff that streaming services canceled `early` deserved to be canceled.
"Marry Me, or Not?","I don’t get this sub sometimes. People complaining about cliffhanger season finales, and yet Severance gets praised, which has a HUGE cliffhanger"
"Marry Me, or Not?","I've been saying this (not that it's never been said) for a longgggggggggggggg time. It's a toxic relation that dates back to network TV shows. Pilot season starts and network TV shows beg you, with all of their promotional ads, to watch their shows. Give them a chance. Be a loyal viewer. Then when the viewership isn't good enough, which sometimes is based on realistic needs but often seems to be a desire for their show to be the next big hit, they cancel it. Each time it damages the relationship between content producer and viewer. After long enough I was done. I wasn't watching first seasons or even second seasons of shows, I was waiting. 

Then came streaming, it was great at first, but now so many shows get one season or two and then cancelled that I don't start watching. It is even more damaging for streaming because a large part of the value of their subscription service is tied to their library of content. Well, Netflix's library of content is a freaking grave yard of uncompleted series. Who the F\*\*\* wants to start a series that doesn't have any conclusion? It's like libraries only stocking book series that are missing the last 1-3 books of the series and they will never be released. 

So, now I say if streaming wants to survive or thrive they must change their way of business. There's the HBO model: being very picky with what is greenlit for maximum odds of success, investing heavily in the shows so their quality is as high as possible and having a relatively low amount of original programming. HBO pumps out S-tier quality shows but they pump them out slowly because they only put so much on their plate at a time. 

Or, the other option is to overwhelmingly prefer anthologies, mini series, and series that end in 1-3 seasons. From the start, no matter how successful the series, keep series its pre-planned length. [All these shows](https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/coming-soon/new-netflix-series-coming-in-2023-and-beyond/)? 80% or more should be 1-3 seasons long from the planning stage. Increase quality by reducing quantity of episodes. Make each series jam packed with story, character development and reduce fluff, filler and stretching out stories beyond their natural length. Netflix already cancels so many shows after S2 anyways, just make most shows 2 seasons long so their library starts to fill with easily binge-able series that have tight beginning, middles and most importantly; endings.

This would also encourage writers and creators to come to the table with Netflix with more than just a pitch for a pilot and a very loose, general outline and barely an ending. No, come to Netflix with at least most of the first season written and a strong outline for the second season and an even stronger outline for what the ending of the series is going to be. Reducing the ""up in the air, we'll write it as we go along, we'll make changes based on focus group testing's and how the viewers are reacting"" should help increase quality of series as well. 

I would also mention I imagine Netflix would all of a sudden become a very desirable place for writers and showrunners to want to work again. Instead of never knowing their shows numbers and being on edge expecting cancellation after their second season, they would know Netflix is the place to bring your mini series, 1-3 season long story or anthology story and get to make it, completely."
"Marry Me, or Not?",I do this. Too many shows have burned me
"Marry Me, or Not?",I haven't started a new show in my favorite genre since the OA was cancelled. Just realized it actually
"Marry Me, or Not?",I'm more and more in this boat. I'm not going to take the limited time I have to invest in a series that's going to end prematurely and without a real ending.
"Marry Me, or Not?","I'm a weirdo


I usually watch 1-2 episodes to see if I like it, then I will wait until the season is over so I know it actually had a finale"
"Marry Me, or Not?",I’m still pissed about Last Man on Earth
"Marry Me, or Not?",I love how the algorithm introduced me to Tuca and Bertie’s existence AFTER it got cancelled. Thank goodness for Adult Swim. The only animation that’s safe on Netflix these days is freaking Big Mouth.
"Marry Me, or Not?","More shows need to be like Dark. 3 seasons, complete story, satisfying ending."
"Marry Me, or Not?",i wont watch attack on titan until it is done
"Marry Me, or Not?",here's to 22 more seasons of stargate
"Marry Me, or Not?",Last man on earth 😭😢😭
"Marry Me, or Not?",This is the way.
"Marry Me, or Not?","I don’t even start watching a show until there is like 3 to 5 episodes out, so I can spread them out until the final. 

I blame the writers and how they write. You 10 episodes season but you only have enough material for 6 episodes. So you come up with a bunch bullshit filler. So you will have like 6 episodes really good and 4 bullshit filler episodes."
"Marry Me, or Not?",Sad about Pantheon never getting marketed properly or at all and getting cancelled. It supposedly had a second season that was already produced but might never get released.
"Marry Me, or Not?",I actually started this practice way before streaming was a thing. #Firefly
"Marry Me, or Not?","I mean lately it seems like I find out shows exist when I see an article about them being axed. These companies aren’t giving things enough of a chance at all. If it’s good, people will find it, but not every show is going to be number 1 and go totally viral the first week."
"Marry Me, or Not?",The whole point of Netflix was always binge watching. It is what sets streaming apart from cable TV.
"Marry Me, or Not?",And people said that this wouldn't happen.
"Marry Me, or Not?","I used to disagree with this idea of waiting, but the cancellation of Reboot (Hulu) was the last straw for me. Give me a real finale, and I’ll watch the whole show start to finish. Otherwise I’m not getting invested"
"Marry Me, or Not?","Why are smaller streamers not buying rights to these shows and making follow-up seasons?

Surely ratings/viewings that are ""too low"" for Netflix or HBO would work fine for others."
"Marry Me, or Not?",Show runners who write cliffhanger season endings should be fucking fired
"Marry Me, or Not?","Frankly, it strikes me as that so many people still watch stuff week to week."
"Marry Me, or Not?",My cousin's been doing this for years after Netflix cancelled a show he liked.
"Marry Me, or Not?","Lmao yeah it’s not hard to understand. People in US like to act like we’re the only people who exist, but other countries still do the classic broadcasting format and get good ratings. UK (BBC specifically I believe) have like at least 3 prime time drama series that get good consistent ratings cause they’ve been on for like 20+ years. Why do you think the highest rated US series are NCIS, Law and Order, CSI, Greys Anatomy, etc.? Cause all those shows came out during a time where networks weren’t trigger happy to cancel everything, and are still going. Why do you think most modern network series get canceled today? Because that’s the expectation they set"
"Marry Me, or Not?","Yes Netflix, I am not watching your shows anymore until I know they aren't going to be cancelled. And then you cancel them because no one is watching because they are waiting to see if you cancel the show. Nice little problem you've created for yourself by over green lighting things in an effort to stay on top."
"Marry Me, or Not?","Right it's not exec bros that don't know what they're doing, it's the viewrship's fault."
"Marry Me, or Not?","This just in - ""Show business execs are detached from reality, and don't give a fuck about what the viewers want."""
"Marry Me, or Not?",/#SaveTheOA
"Marry Me, or Not?","This is them reaping what they sow by ending each season on a cliffhanger.

Stop doing that so at least we can feel GOOD when we've watched that one season of a show."
"Marry Me, or Not?","Yeah, the whole “release an episode a week” just stops me from watching a show. I cancel the service and forget. Then remember a year later, and watch the whole in a week or whatever."
"Marry Me, or Not?","I just don’t like having to wait week to week for that shit, and prefer to wait until all episodes are available so I can binge at my leisure. Sorry but Netflix spoiled me, so F your “watercooler talk” BS argument."
"Marry Me, or Not?",Looking at Netflix mainly
"Marry Me, or Not?",Television exists to sell ads.  Period.  The shows are mindless fodder.  Networks give zero fecks about YOUR entertainment.  Toss the TV remote and go fly a kite.  Or take walk.
"Marry Me, or Not?",That’s me.
"Marry Me, or Not?","Yeah you dumb dorks at Netflix. That's why your views hip is shrinking, you're untrustworthy"
"Marry Me, or Not?","Yeah, I won't start most shows. Unless I know its going to atleast given a chance. Been burned too many times."
"Marry Me, or Not?","Wow, what a shocking news story. They could’ve titled this “The thing everyone has been saying for years is true.”"
"Marry Me, or Not?",I don’t start any new show until at least season 2
"Marry Me, or Not?",I wait years to watch anything now. I’m not going to get into something just to never have it finished.
"Marry Me, or Not?",If a show doesn’t have two seasons I don’t bother anymore. I don’t have Netflix for this exact reason. They either cancel or take two years for a new season.
"Marry Me, or Not?","If you told people that tv used to be 22-26 episodes a season and a wait of a few months for the next season it’ll blow their mind.

Now it’s 10 episodes or less and several years to wait for the next season."
"Marry Me, or Not?",[deleted]
"Marry Me, or Not?",That’s a heck of a last sentence. Big twist ending there.
"Marry Me, or Not?",I’ve gotten really good at giving up on bad series or waiting until multiple seasons are out.
"Marry Me, or Not?","I also love a good binge…

Edit: Except for mandalorian. I watch every episode and can’t wait for the next one. Same with the lord of the rings series, so good! Can’t wait to the end."
"Marry Me, or Not?",I do this with a lot of science fiction type shows on major networks. Too many times I have gotten invested in a show only for it to be cancelled season 1.
"Marry Me, or Not?",This is half of it. I also don't waste time watching anything that gets poor reviews.
"Marry Me, or Not?",I often wait for a full season to be out to start watching a new show.
"Marry Me, or Not?",I can't dedicate enough time to TV shows to bother with something that I either won't get closure on or have to wait months or years at a time for the next step.
"Marry Me, or Not?","I guess I am one of those who wait as I am not a ""diehard"" viewer of most shows, ""hot"" or not.   I can just sit it out, wait for the ruckus to die down, then catch it later. As dedicated viewers breathlessly wait for each episode of The Last of Us. or whatever is hot at the moment,  I am one of those who simply add the show to my queue, to be watched at some future date. 

I never realized my viewing habits had life or death ramifications for at risk series. Goodness!"
"Marry Me, or Not?","I usually watch as the episodes come out, sometimes I’ll wait a few weeks. It depends on how much time I have. I spend all of it looking for work now."
"Marry Me, or Not?",I’m not afraid of cancellation. I’m afraid that I’ll start watching a show tomorrow and it will continue for ten years with a lackluster resolution.
"Marry Me, or Not?","I typically don't watch new shoes until they are old shows now. If it REALLY popular, I'll catch up to watch the last season live (Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones to name a few)"
"Marry Me, or Not?","I've been doing this for years. I wait for whole seasons at a time to finish with animes i want to watch. like My Hero Academia and Attack on Titan. I watched the first seasons of these but now i'm waiting and will them all over again.

same with Demon Slayer and Shield Hero. 

SO MANY animes will start and literally never finish. There are so many 1-3 season shows that just stop without a proper end. There's literally no point in watching them. It really sucks. no I don't want to read about what happens next.

then occassionally some will end up getting a new season after 5-15 freaking years...and then end on a cliffhanger again.

Some will have over 100 episodes and and just stop without a proper end. It's annoying as hell. Same with old shows that ended in the 90's. Sliders just stops and ends on a horrible cliff hanger. Moeisha ends with her little brother being kidnapped by lil Kim or something and it's never concluded.

There should be a law that canceled and airing shows should be allowed to have at the very least 5 episodes to try and conclude. And if it's canceled after a season is over, they get 10 episodes."
"Marry Me, or Not?",Very few shows do I watch week by week. Mostly I wait for the season to end and watch at my leisure. Because screw cliffhangers and waiting for a show.
"Marry Me, or Not?",Yep. Stopped watching plenty in the middle of a season because it was cancelled. Not worth it to me and it’s a dumb thing to include in if you continue to produce a show.
"Marry Me, or Not?","I’m the same way when it comes to books in a series. Thank you, George RR Martin and Patrick Rothfuss."
"Marry Me, or Not?","Same behavior here.  I usually wait until the next season starts before I'll watch the previous season.  Some days, I want to watch a couple of episodes.

When it gets canceled, I end up losing interest."
"Marry Me, or Not?","For me, if I have to wait a whole week for the next episode it increases the chances that I may not get around to watching it. And if I miss a week, I probably won't bother to watch anymore. I have to REALLY be into a show to schedule time to watch it, and I can't think of more than two or three shows in my whole life that I ever watched all of."
"Marry Me, or Not?","Streaming services are just graveyards now for shows cancelled after 1/2 seasons, especially Netflix."
"Marry Me, or Not?",netflix in particular gave everyone severe trust issues
"Marry Me, or Not?",I just procrastinate and rewatch the same cartoons over and over again while I browse Reddit and tiktok.
"Marry Me, or Not?",This tracks with me. I'm no longer willing to commit my time to incomplete projects. I'll wait to hear whether or not the series was given a final season to close the story.
"Marry Me, or Not?",I definitely think twice about starting a show simply because so many get cancelled...so many good ones too.
"Marry Me, or Not?",I’m kinda leaning towards doing this because I’ve been burnt more than I’ve liked lately. I’ll still tune in for bigger shows that I know won’t be cancelled like House of the Dragon or TLOU.
"Marry Me, or Not?","I've been doing this for ages.

If shows would actually wrap up a season I'd be willing to get into them while they are ongoing. Even if I'd like more, and there's some threads dangling, I could be OK with things mostly wrapped up at the end of the season. But no, the networks seem obsessed with cliffhanger endings. Which then go unresolved when the show is cancelled.

I stopped watching current shows as soon as the cliffhanger endings became common."
"Marry Me, or Not?","I watch anime. True, many anime don't get a second season, and that's based on them being long ads for the manga/light novel source material."
"Marry Me, or Not?","Duh, there is no reason to trust streaming services to finish a show, not even finish it well if they finish it at all. I’ll wait for years before watching a show I want to see. If almost everyone says it ends poorly I’ll just read all the plot points and skip watching it."
"Love, Timeless","I was blindsided by the ending. Didn't expect it to be so emotional! I was choked up. Damn when they were dancing and he saw her as she was when she was young. Damn. 

And the Sam Cooke song playing was the perfect choice. "
"Love, Timeless",It was easily one of the most bittersweet endings that I have ever seen. Definitely gonna go read the book now. 
"Love, Timeless","Definitely was not Franco's best performance yet.  Entertaining enough show, though. "
"Love, Timeless",Thoroughly enjoyed it.  Also was one of my favorite books to read.
"Love, Timeless","I'm 3 episodes in right now, really liking it so far.  "
"Love, Timeless","After reading the book I couldn't understand how the greatest love story I'd ever read was written by Stephen King.  I thought the show couldn't possibly capture it.  The last episode nailed it. 

I was lukewarm on the rest of the series but bravo on the ending. "
"Love, Timeless","It is literally THE most romantic and THE most heartwarming 1960s show EVER and LITERALLY James Franco's BEST performance period

No hyperbole here at all."
"Love, Timeless",It was pretty good
"Love, Timeless",I'm pretty surprised by the muted reactions. I'm pretty snobby about tv shows and I was absolutely floored. I thought it was incredible. 
"Love, Timeless","I never really thought of it that way -- it's a great insight though. I got so wrapped up in each episode in this lens of a man desperately trying to change the past in a suspenseful mystery-thriller drama. But now that I think of it, I really did get pretty wrapped in the '60's nostalgia and romance. And that makes perfect sense because it wraps into why he couldn't change things for the better and simply had to let it go, including the Sadie that he came to love. 

It makes the ending that much more powerful with how he comes to terms with it but can still connect so profoundly with the older Sadie despite all the experiences she never shared with him. And yeah, Franco and Gordon had such crazy good chemistry. It was insane.

Also the crazy time traveling guy with the hat and the card in it. I never read the book so it was confusing at first but when he shared his shit about his daughter drowning every time and how that influenced Jake to let it all go, that tugged at me."
"Love, Timeless",i felt like Franco kind of sucked but i liked the show overall 7/10
"Love, Timeless","it really was very good. franco cried like 8 times.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_MrLdo1YLI"
"Love, Timeless",This show is so good. Its like a mix between Titanic and Back to the Future
"Love, Timeless","It was certainly a Stephen King tale. As long as you enjoy King it was great fun. Really likable characters and lots of interplay. I really felt for Billy. He's a classic King creation the wounded puppy and he was such a tragic counter to Jake's romantic entanglement. To tell the truth after a couple of Days I'm still not sure i can forgive Jakes betrayal, but then we knew he was a bit of an arrogant son of a bitch on his first day buying the bright yellow '58 after being told to keep your head down and don't draw attention.

The end was certainly bitter sweet, but I'm almost certain that once he got home from dancing with Sadie, he walked right back in. The guy with the Ouroboros card in his hat pretty much seemed to have picked him as fellow obsessive. Doubt he gave a shit about saving JFK anymore, but he is definitely was/have/going to/will be/was done going to go back to 1960 try and live happily ever after.

"
"Love, Timeless","> i think that a show hasn't touched me as much as 11.22.63 since I first watched Six Feet Under

*SFU* is one of my favourite TV series of all time, on certain days it's my #1 favourite. An endorsement like this makes me want to check it out immediately. "
"Love, Timeless",I really enjoyed it and was so touched by the ending. 
"Love, Timeless","Such a brilliantly written show. The emotion was palpable, right up until James Franco was on camera. 

He has no range, every single emotion looks the same. Happy may look different, but there wasnt a lot of happy in this show. 

Everyone is saying they were crying during the finale, but I just couldn't get behind him being genuinely hurt. It felt fake, while everyone else felt like they were their character. "
"Love, Timeless",Is this show good? It sounded stupid.
"Love, Timeless","Finale was awesome, on par with other time-travel related romantic films and episodes: The Constant (pretty much every Desmond/Penny centric episode with time travel), Groundhog Day, Terminator 2. 

We all know how great of an illusion of the possibility of changing past or preventing things in future the time travel provides and we also know that no matter how we try destiny is destiny: it all ends up the same. 

Time travel is a grandiose setup for a grandiose setback. Works like a clock on emotions. "
"Love, Timeless","Where can I watch it?  
"
"Love, Timeless",I... I've seen this thread before...
"Love, Timeless","I loved this show. I'm kinda torn on the ending though, because [spoiler](#s ""nothing really mattered"") but fuck me if it didn't tug on the 'ol heartstrings."
"Love, Timeless",As someone who read the book but has yet to watch the show: Do they keep Derry in the TV show?  As someone who loves *IT* that was one of my favorite parts of 11.22.63
"Love, Timeless","I just finished reading the book and it was amazing! Who knew King could write such a touching romance? I watched and finished the show before the book and look at it this way: The book is the best due to the detail and added moments that really create the emotional attachment for the characters. The show does a great job of condensing that into an 8 part series and does justice to the ending. If you just watch the show the ending is touching, but reading the book it made me quite emotional."
"Love, Timeless","I guess I remain in the minority. I thought it was an interesting show but the ""tale of timeless love"" felt rushed and cliche. The pilot, every scene with Josh Dummell and some of the early dallas episodes are the most interesting part. I just felt like the plot wasn't coherent, you get so into JFK in the pilot, then you spend the next 6 episodes focused Sadie, Bill, Jake's teaching job and saving Harry. 

The romantic story and JFK are both part of the show but they feel completely unrelated in the end. Sarah Gadon is stunningly beautiful but I found both their performances to be mediocre. "
"Love, Timeless","Just finished, what a phenomenal series"
"Love, Timeless","Very good show, but nowhere close to JF's performance in 127 Hours, not even vaguely close."
"Love, Timeless","Never got that into the show - would sort of half-watch when my SO was watching it. But the ending? I bawled like a baby. Really tugged on the heart strings!

Now I want to go back and really watch the show!"
"Love, Timeless",It was a boring soapy drama with an intriguing premise that crushed into relationship swamp midseason.
"Love, Timeless","Holy fuck guys, it REALLY wasn't that good."
"Love, Timeless","The show was King's best on screen adaption. It didn't feel rushed like The Stand and it wasn't drawn out (and shitty, lol) like Under The Dome."
"Love, Timeless","Here's a crazy idea... What if they do a SEASON TWO?  He could go back and try to get it jusssttttt right this time.

This series needed at least one or two more resets. :)"
"Love, Timeless",no. 
"Love, Timeless",Is there a new rule saying that we have to have one of these posts every day now?
"Love, Timeless",best performance? you mean the least shitty one? his acting was so bad actually
"Love, Timeless",The ending sucked...........it was the worst part of the show.  :(
"Love, Timeless","This show was stupid. The love story was stupid.  Everything about it was bad, Franco can't act. "
"Love, Timeless","Same here. I completely lost it for the last 10 minutes or so. I typically hate love stories forcibly added to otherwise good films and shows, but this was done so perfectly. "
"Love, Timeless",Sometimes Hollywood ending works wonders and is exactly what is needed. 
"Love, Timeless",YES! That Sam Cooke song was perfect 
"Love, Timeless","I've actually come up with a few better songs lyrically but they wouldn't really fit the time period. 

Bing Crosby had a song called My Ideal with very poignant lyrics ""will i ever find the girl in my mind, the one who is my ideal? Maybe she's a dream and yet she may be just around the corner waiting for me. Will i recognize the light in her eyes, the one that no other eyes reveal? Or will i pass her by, never even knowing that she is my ideal?"" But that would have been released in the 50s, so a little early for them.

I also like the song Time in Bottle by Harry Chapin. Or If by Bread. But those are from the 70s, so a little later than their love story."
"Love, Timeless","It was like LOST, in that I didn't give a single fuck about the ending, or the stupid love story,  because I signed up for a cool Sci-fi story, not a stupid soap.  Hated it. "
"Love, Timeless","It's incredible. I had such low expectations, having just read Cell (so, so bad), but it blew me away."
"Love, Timeless",I am always internally debating as to whether or not James Franco is a good actor.
"Love, Timeless","I thought he was really good in this. Also watched 127 Hours the other day. Gotta say, I've really become a Franco fan."
"Love, Timeless",Best King in years. I love that book. 
"Love, Timeless",[deleted]
"Love, Timeless",">I'm 3 episodes in

Well then you should not read this thread. People are spoiling here."
"Love, Timeless","Best performance by JF? I thought his acting was the only negative thing about the show. He wasn't bad, he just wasn't very good at convincing me that he's actually Jake Amberson - his often exaggerated facial expressions and some of his line deliveries made it feel like he was acting too hard. Still going to stress that he wasn't half bad. 

I would actually argue that Sadie (played by Sarah Gadon) absolutely stole the show and made this such a great 60's romance. Casting deserves a medal for this one.

edit: nice edit OP"
"Love, Timeless","> One of the best mini-series of all time and absolutely in the top 5 of Stephen King Adaptations.

"
"Love, Timeless","James Franco always looks like he's acting his very hardest, to *Not look like James Franco trying to act*.  He's terrible. "
"Love, Timeless",He wont go back.  He realized that if he tried to be with Sadie in her time she would die young and tragically every time and he would become stuck in a loop like the yellow card man trying to get it right over and over.  He chose not to subject himself and Sadie to that torture and he chose to move on with his life in 2016.
"Love, Timeless","I think the premise is really interesting, so I'm curious why you think it sounds stupid, but, yes, the show is good."
"Love, Timeless","If you haven't read the book it isn't bad.  While I understand that they always change things from books, they took it a bit far in my opinion and ruined the story."
"Love, Timeless",Its fucking terrible. 
"Love, Timeless",Hulu
"Love, Timeless","No, Jake is from Lisbon, Maine on the show. There are some King easter eggs, especially in the last episode, but none of King's fictional Maine locations feature."
"Love, Timeless","I thought it was better than the book, myself."
"Love, Timeless","So, are you referring to only TV shows, or do you think it's really better than *The Shining* and *The Shawshank Redemption*?

"
"Love, Timeless","Then you didn't get the fucking point of the show at all.

Jesus christ."
"Love, Timeless","Yep. Sidebar: ""There must be a new post every hour praising the majesty and wonder that are the masterpieces of 11.22.63 and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia."""
"Love, Timeless",How does it make sense to call it a soap? I'm not following.
"Love, Timeless","Its a tough sell when it starts with time traveling. You and I went into it with the expectation of it being a SfiFi themed series, but it turned out to be a drama/romantic thingy, you stuck with your wish of it being scifi, i let myself be a little more open to what the series tries to become, and i liked it. still somewhat disappointed that the timetravel didnt do more for the story other then being in it. But i liked it. And James Franco killed it here. On of his best non comedic performances id say."
"Love, Timeless",He is.
"Love, Timeless","The book, IMO, was much more enjoyable. It's 800 pages so the story is much more detailed and thoughtful. The show was good and true to the book in the beginning and end but the middle really went off the rails due to time constraints. "
"Love, Timeless",A lot of book readers have been vocal about detesting the show. I was a non book reader going into it and loved the show. So take that how you will.
"Love, Timeless","He was better as Desario, he was made for the role. It also wasn't better than his Oscar nominated performance in 127 Hours."
"Love, Timeless",I thought his more dramatic scenes were rough at times. But I really enjoyed him otherwise.
"Love, Timeless","> Best performance by JF? I thought his acting was the only negative thing about the show.

I thought there were more negatives but I agree that JF was poor. He looked uninterested at time - don't know if that was meant to be the way the character was but shit, I could have played a bad actor if thats what the part required!"
"Love, Timeless","Not available in Canada, I don't think.  

I'll find it another way, as I am not funding Russian websites.  "
"Love, Timeless",With Stephen King it's not that hard to achieve.
"Love, Timeless","As an adaptation, The Shining wasn't very good. Excellent movie, nonetheless, but it deviates from the book in such a way that the only thing in common are the names of the characters and locations. 

Shawshank is still WAAAY better, though "
"Love, Timeless","I loved The Shining but consider it a Kubrick movie more than I do a King adaption. 

And Shawshank Redemption was great, but it was a short story. I guess I'm referring to the bigger reads. I was really hoping for Netflix or Hulu to pick up The Dark Tower series.

Anyway, I see your point. I had low expectations going into 11.22.63 and was blown away by it. I wish I could that with all aspects of my life. :D"
"Love, Timeless",You might want to read the book (and be less rude)
"Love, Timeless",It's weird. Sometimes he is so wooden and unbearable to watch. Then you watch 127 Hours and his acting is incredibly natural and organic. I think he's just made for certain roles.
"Love, Timeless",[deleted]
"Love, Timeless",[So good.](https://media.giphy.com/media/12zfAjyQ3RZNSw/giphy.gif)
"Love, Timeless",Learn how to google better stupid.  There are a million torrents or streaming sites you could use. 
"Love, Timeless","For me that would depend upon the book. Stephen King is hit or miss. He has written some novels which are just astoundingly great in their quality. He has also written some novels which are flat out bad.

A lot of people are big fans of 11.22.63. I thought it was flawed. And I think it's overrated within his oeuvre. But I also think it's a spectacular premise.

The writers of 11.22.63. did an excellent job of reorganizing that premise into a more coherent structure. The book is fairly rambling and meandering. The show reorganizes that meandering into setups and payoffs that feel much more cohesive and rewarding than the book felt, to me.

I consider Stephen King's conclusion that Oswald must have acted alone to be completely outlandish and obviously wrong. And it makes for a disappointing ending, because so much of the book is an exploration of the alternative theories about the assassination, that it feels anticlimactic.

And yeah, I get that it was pretty unlikely that Stephen King was going to be the person who finally solved the mystery of the Kennedy assassination, for real. But it still makes for disappointing, anticlimactic dramatic payoff.

And that problem still exists in the show, but the writers did an excellent job of clarifying stakes where Stephen King did not, so that they could payoff in a specific, rewarding way, where Stephen King did not.

Giving Jake a partner was a really, really smart decision on the part of the showrunner. Giving Jake someone to talk to is the storytelling framework that made those improvements possible.

That's why I think the show is better than the book."
"Love, Timeless","The book was more about the three characters living in the hotel while the movie was just about Jack Nicholson acting crazy, which was fun to watch.  The movie and book had different intentions, that's all."
"Love, Timeless","It's hard for any actor to be great in every role. De Niro is in a lot of shitty movies. Brando is in some shitty movies. Gary Oldman occasionally stinks.

But Franco is a great comic actor and a solid dramatic actor. There are some things he is so, so good in -- Freaks and Geeks, Pineapple Express, 127 Days -- and those performances can't happen by accident, it's impossible.

A bad actor can't be *that* good in multiple things.  But a good actor can occasionally be bad."

"Love, Timeless","He was actually pretty good in Apes, tbh. "

"Love, Timeless","Great write up!


I'm not familiar with most of these, and I watch a shit-ton of TV and movies. I really like the effort, and the writeups are perfect in length.


Again, not knowing these a lot, is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show? (Nothing against non English speakers of course) 


Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.


Totally agree with the couple from White Lotus being great characters, I much preferred season 1 (which seems like a hot take) but those two, specifically the woman, were very interesting characters to me."
"Love, Timeless","""hidden gems of 2022 for me"" might be better title for this post.

i must admit some of these plots engaged my curiosity. im gonna look for them. rhanks for the list."
"Love, Timeless","How you pick what to watch? I’m overwhelmed with all these shows in Netflix and I always seem to pick the limited series or those talked about in reddit, especially regarding to the foreign shows or K dramas. There isn’t much write-ups or reviews in English."
"Love, Timeless",I am glad and surprised Prisma is number one. Well deserved
"Love, Timeless","This is Going to Hurt: I'm a medical student and I thought I'd seen every medical show but this one is on my list now! I've heard that this show shows the reality of a doctor's life without all the glamor of medicine.  
  
This show compared to other medical shows what do you think and what other medical shows have you watched I'm curious!"
"Love, Timeless","Insanely odd for the 2 anime to show up to be an average romcom (with crazy production value) and a good but lesser known sequel.

(Oh NVM I thought this was a list from some website not yours! Still surprised to see MDUD though!)"

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ❤️"
"Love, Timeless","Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
"Love, Timeless",Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.
"Love, Timeless",No Atlanta? Both seasons last year were incredible
"Love, Timeless",Pachinko is the most slept on series of 2022
"Love, Timeless","1. She hulk
2. Ted lasso
3. Ms Marvel
4. Harley Quinn show
5. Lord of the rings
6. Spy x family 
7. Chainsaw man
8. Loki
9. Mob psycho
10. Hot D"
"Love, Timeless",Which ones did you see? 🤔 amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?
"Love, Timeless","> is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
"Love, Timeless","i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
"Love, Timeless",🙂💕
Jojos World,Skoden.
Jojos World,It’s an amazing coming of age show already with just the first season. And the fact it’s made for and by native Americans is so great. I am Hispanic and feel sometimes there’s not enough good representation of our culture but I can’t even imagine how little there is for native Americans. It’s great to see
Jojos World,Reminds me of Derry Girls on a lot of ways but with a bit more focus on drama. Love both.
Jojos World,Easy comparison to 'Atlanta' IMO.  Similar vibe to the shows.
Jojos World,I was laughing my ass off throughout the season 2 premier…my roommate came to check in and I literally described it as the funniest shit on tv that apparently no one knows about.
Jojos World,This show is great and being from the rez myself it hits on a different level.
Jojos World,I'd say LetterKenny and Atlanta both has a lot of similarities.
Jojos World,Word.
Jojos World,I've watched the first few episodes of this and it is absolutely MAGNIFICENT.
Jojos World,"Great show. Emotional, smart, and weirdly funny. Love it! We need more like it. Not native either."
Jojos World,"Just watched season 1 yesterday, loved it. Now to decide if i start watching the new season right away or wait til it's all available. Probably the former since I'm terrible at waiting 😂"
Jojos World,Have you seen Dark Winds?
Jojos World,The best.
Jojos World,"Is it on TV? I thought Season 1 was on FX. Now it is all on Hulu. Branding this show as FX on Hulu is confusing.
Great show but making it hard to find is stupid."
Jojos World,It started ok but i think it's pretty mediocre. I watch a lot of shows but this didn't stick.
Jojos World,Started this show last night and am 3 episodes in. I’m pleasantly surprised how good this show is. Definitely hooked after the first episode. Can’t wait to see where it goes!
Jojos World,Stoodis.
Jojos World,Are there any shows out now or from the recent past that would be about Hispanics coming of age?
Jojos World,"this is an apt comparison. both are set in times/places that are really challenging and focus on kids getting through some traumatic experiences, but both find ways to bring in so much joy and humor. stellar casting and chemistry"
Jojos World,"Great show, wish we were getting more"
Jojos World,I actually got into Atlanta after watching the first season of Reservation Dogs.  They are very similar in vibe while each being their own thing. Both are excellent.
Jojos World,[deleted]
Jojos World,Yes! I just made the comparison to Letterkenny the other day. Check out Shoresy.
Jojos World,"Is it a comedy show? What's the tone of it? It's made by Taika Waititi, is it not?"
Jojos World,"Great cast.  Shit writing.  Those last 3-4 episodes were a total mess.

I'm hoping they'll do better season 2.

Reservation Dogs is in a whole different league than Dark Winds IMO."
Jojos World,What is that on? I’ve been wanting to check it out.
Jojos World,"Just because they both feature native Americans doesn't mean the shows are in the same league.

Reservation Dogs is so much better than the absolute mess Dark Winds was.

Dark Winds started out good but after 3 episodes it turned into a weird amateuristic trope fuelled mess. It was shocking to see how the level dropped half way through the season."
Jojos World,"Just because it has Native actors? That’s like saying try Rutherford Falls if you liked Dances with Wolves. 

Genres and quality are totally different between all four of these examples."
Jojos World,It’s all still TV. Hulu or FX.
Jojos World,"Not many shows, certainly nothing about coming of agereally. but specifically I am Dominican.

Theres a movie called ""Cocote"" that was made afew years ago that is really good, very arthouse though so might not tickle everyones fancy, but is a really good movie about culture clash within Dominican society. its about a christian priest in america whose father is murdered in dominican republic and hes goes back to the island and his family is more traditional vudu believers and demand he take revenge on those who killed him, but he is a peaceful man so its a huge claseh for him.

Closest coming of age thing i can think of is ""Reinbou"", about a young boy learning about his father who he never met that fought in the dominican revolution. thats a good coming of age film i suppose, but its more about generational trauma/gap themes.

Trailer for Cocote: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaCrqgEL3pw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaCrqgEL3pw)

Trailer for Reinbou: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxpmRjhBz5E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxpmRjhBz5E)

&#x200B;

both movies are on iTunes to rent/buy"
Jojos World,On my block is amazing
Jojos World,"Dave is more a parody disguised as a tv show if we’re being honest. Decent show, but it doesn’t compare to Atlanta or Reservation Dogs in terms of grit."
Jojos World,"It's a nice mix of drama, comedy and the surreal. The acting is great, there are some real laugh out load moments but also some really tender ones too. Both of which made me really invested from the off. I only intended to watch a few episodes before bed but ending up watching the whole of Season 1 (8 episodes 25-30 mins each). As far as I've read, Taika was heavily involved in the creation of the show and getting it up and running but played more of a supporting role in the end as he wanted to let the people from the area tell their own story. I would say it has a similar tone to something like High Maintenance or Atlanta, in that the primary focus is not on ""main characters"" but more about exploring lives of people and situations that might be unfamiliar to a lot of viewers."
Jojos World,"It’s a comedy but it’s not the usual zany, wall to wall jokes you expect with Taika. It leans more into serious and dramatic moments than something like What We Do In the Shadows (which I also love to be clear)."
Jojos World,"Sterlin Harjo is the lead producer and creator.

Taika is an executive producer."
Jojos World,"Agree the casting is really good on both shows, disagree with your take on Dark Winds writing though. I liked them both-a lot. The shows are different in focus and I think I like that the most. Too many shows assume communities only have one story line or one story to tell"
Jojos World,AMC
Jojos World,"Uhm no, not only because they both have Native American actors (also see my response to Juzolitami) but indeed representation matters. Both shows, and also Yellowstone btw, show a part of US culture and geography that many in this country know little or nothing about: The longstanding effects of disenfranchisement, rich cuisine, and self-determination are clear in both. Plus, I liked that I recognized real locations (as opposed to stage sets) in Dark Winds that brought back memories of my time there. I didn’t like Rutherford Falls."
Jojos World,When on FX? Not tonight.
Jojos World,My sister-in-law's dominican! Dang that priest movie sounds pretty good.
Jojos World,like jojo Rabbit?
Jojos World,"Ah gotcha, it was easy to read your original comment as unfairly superficial. The point about shedding light on an often ignored part of the country and importance of that representation is totally fair/true."
Jojos World,Hulu is still television is my point. It doesn’t have to be on cable to be on television.
Jojos World,DE LO MIO!
Jojos World,"No, more like Atlanta as others have said. It’s got a little of that weirdness of other Taika projects but is overall a pretty subdued dramedy"
Jojos World,[deleted]
Jojos World,This season is not on FX at all.
Jojos World,[deleted]
Jojos World,ON FX? When does Season 2 premier because it wasn't on tonight.
Jojos World,Please... someone dress as Squilliam Fancyson and faint during half time 
Jojos World,Is there a big overlap between Maroon 5/Sponge Bob/football fans?
Jojos World,As long as Twisted Sister gets to play Goofy Goober Rock as well..
Jojos World,They really should have gone full tilt with it. Invite the whole voice cast. Have Maroon 5 dress up in those uniforms. Have extras dress as the characters. And make it a super quick 4 minute half time show
Jojos World,I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE TOM BRADY AND PUSH HIM SOMEWHERE ELSE
Jojos World,"I just said, outloud. 'Squidward will be introducing Maroon 5 at the Super Bowl.' 

I'm not sure what has happened, I feel I don't understand this world anymore. "
Jojos World,"Maroon 5 is the official band of moms in their late 30's.

Many of those moms have kids who are/were into Spongebob.

I'd say the crossover is pretty significant."
Jojos World,"Well, you did it. You took my one chance of happiness and crushed it. Crushed it into little tiny, bite-size pieces. I really had expected better of you people. I guess I'm a loser for that, too. Don't bother showing up tomorrow. I'll just tell them you all died in a marching accident. So, thanks, thanks for nothing."
Jojos World,"I’m a Cowboys fan.

Cowboys... Dallas... Texas.... Squirrel jokes

I’m a fan of both!"
Jojos World,I miss the days when MTV would run a special episode of Beavis and Butthead at halftime.
Jojos World,"Gotta do something to counter program against NXT's counterprogramming. The return of Halftime Heat! First time since 1999, just a few months after the Undertaker threw Mankind blah blah blah."
Jojos World,"No Sweet Victory.
Riot ensues.

My leg!"
Jojos World,...but not David Eisley?
Jojos World,Should get Ween to do it instead. 
Jojos World,Sigh... 
Jojos World,"Ok, came for Sweet Victory, leaving disappointed. F it. "
Jojos World,"Wasn't familiar and didn't see a link...

[show link](https://youtu.be/k9iYm9PEAHg)

[full song link](https://youtu.be/xyNW_evwoRA)"
Jojos World,"Man this is crazy. 

Pewdiepie has a superbowl add

Maroon 5  will be singing a song from a cartoon

The world is freezing over

The president is an angry carrot controlled by russians

2019... You know what I meme?

"
Jojos World,So much for that
Jojos World,"This is what they should do with the Super Bowl every year. Instead of some lame ass dick waving “look how big I am” pop star performance, they should host entertaining surprise performances of unconventional songs and acts. Fuck, you don’t even have to make it all music based. Throw in Cirque De Solè or a magic act or something like the Blue Man group. Throw a pop artist in there for the promo aspect but don’t make them the centerpiece of the stage. Making it mysterious like that would be such a great way to reinvent the half time show tradition because the novelty is starting to wear off."
Jojos World,"Hey that’s pretty cool that they’re even trying to get the song on the half time show. If they end up singing it, then that’s going to be a very wholesome thing that we shouldn’t take for granted no matter who sings it. "
Jojos World,Maroon 5 disrespected my boi spongebob
Jojos World,Those bastards lied to me.
Jojos World,When memes become real life
Jojos World,Yiu got something wrong here
Jojos World,SOILED IT! SOILED IT!
Jojos World,"Let it happen. I personally think it'd be a great tribute to Stephen Hillenburg, for creating one of the most recognizable cartoons of all time. "
Jojos World,Well that was a let down...
Jojos World,"I had to double check this wasn’t The Onion, it may has well have been because I’m in tears right now!"
Jojos World,I don’t think Levine has the voice for it
Jojos World,"Wow, I can't wait to be surprised by this performance that I now have all the details for."
Jojos World,They should get David Glen Eisley to sing it
Jojos World,*This is a load of barnancles*
Jojos World,Isn't this the same guy who said Rock is dead or something like that and Corey Taylor told him to go back to the voice? 
Jojos World,"Adam Levine’s voice is WAY too high and nasally. They’ll probably have to change the key to fit his annoying ass voice, and i have a feeling it’s gonna be kinda lame and top 40s sounding. I hope not, but that’s my prediction. "
Jojos World,Amazing how we were able to get this to happen as a collective but we can't elect political officials worth a shit. 
Jojos World,"It would be funny if the entire voice cast comes dress in costume, gets lifted up onto the field, plays theirvroutine and then gets freaked out disgusted when they look at the audiance. It would be a liver version of this scenc

https://youtu.be/k9iYm9PEAHg"
Jojos World,Fuck the NFL
Jojos World,"They better be doing everything they can to get casual viewers, god knows a large portion of their traditional fans don't give a fuck about the superbowl this year."
Jojos World,#AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Jojos World,Maroon 5s voice guy doing sweet victory? His weird piercey voice is going to sound very weird.
Jojos World,I'm gonna watch the puppy bowl
Jojos World,A Maroon 5 version of Sweet Victory is going to sound like an aural STD.
Jojos World,NO WE WANT THE FUCKING ORIGINAL SINGERS
Jojos World,I'm very concerned as I don't think Adam can't pull this off at all honestly love him but ehhhh
Jojos World,MY BOY RODGER BUMPASS
Jojos World,Fuck this will be a disaster
Jojos World,This feels like a plot to get millennials to watch the super bowl... and I think it's working on me
Jojos World,"Maroon 5 is going to ruin it, you need a rock band to sing sweet victory"
Jojos World,Maroon 5 is going to butcher it
Jojos World,"You had me at Spongebob, you lost me at Maroon 5."
To the Dearest Intruder,I imagine she's not looking forward to spending another 7 months alone in Romania shooting season 2.
To the Dearest Intruder,"She's not making any friends in the writer's room, I'm sure, but everything quoted in the article about Wednesday is accurate.

The show is infinitely better during the first, Burton episodes, the love triangle is forced and stupid, some of Wednesday's dialogue is completely facile, forced, and out of character."
To the Dearest Intruder,">There was a line about a dress she has to wear for a school dance and she says, ‘Oh my god I love it. Ugh, I can’t believe I said that. I literally hate myself.’ I had to go, ‘No.’”

Hell, that is some bad writing, kudos to her for not just going along with it, despite her young age. But now she seems to become the next big thing, so I guess it worked out."
To the Dearest Intruder,I don't like how much this sounds like the Witcher writing room.
To the Dearest Intruder,Her criticism about the writing actually reads pretty mild. Sounds like she had to rein some thing in because they just didn't fit right.
To the Dearest Intruder,Wednesday didn’t feel like the Addams Family. It felt like they used it as a skin to do a typical teen mystery show.
To the Dearest Intruder,"I thought it was weird that they had a forced love storyline and turned Wednesday into a hero.

In the first episode she dumps piranhas in a pool. She should've stayed chaotic evil."
To the Dearest Intruder,"Good lord, she's not holding back. It's a shame that the show that got her so popular wasn't as enjoyable to work on as she probably would have hoped. Hopefully her reputation leads to projects she's more passionate about though, because she seems a lot more interested in bigger projects than teen drama, which, y'know, good for her."
To the Dearest Intruder,"I'm always curious as to why certain shows blow up the way they do. 

I thought Wednesday was pretty average to be honest."
To the Dearest Intruder,[deleted]
To the Dearest Intruder,Listening to interviews with her you can tell she’s really into film. If that’s what she wants to do then all the power to her
To the Dearest Intruder,"It's a real shame this article fails to mention she's been bumped up to executive producer on Season 2, which is a big deal."
To the Dearest Intruder,It's great to see an actor so aware of the character to help improve the show.  Disappointing that they have to do it secretly.  I imagine The Witcher would be a better show if Henry Cavill's input was taken more seriously than the show runners who don't like the source material.
To the Dearest Intruder,"I guess she's trying to go the robert pattinson route, the problem is wednesday was way better received than twilight, and she's the sole face of the project. I don't think it will end up going well for her, to be honest."
To the Dearest Intruder,"All this ""controversy"" is so cringe. The show isn't a masterpiece, it's a decent tween drama with a solid premise that falls into classic tropes.not only that but it's clear they want to franchise so hard.


An actor is allowed to not love the work they are a part of, and not want to sign on to being a single character for the next 10 years BCS execs want to churn out an endless line of spin offs for an attempt at an infinite money glitch"
To the Dearest Intruder,Talk about confidence. I'd have taken the first offer to be in a Netflix show.
To the Dearest Intruder,Let’s acknowledge the possibility that this is all just marketing to blur her character and public persona like they did with Aubrey Plaza.
To the Dearest Intruder,"I was so underwhelmed with Wednesday, I was expecting something darker not some teen mystery shit.

I have enjoyed Jennas other work and do look forward to her films."
To the Dearest Intruder,The writers just wanted to make another 08/15 teen highschool drama out of wednesday.
To the Dearest Intruder,"Legend. The show needed to end after 1 season, and now it can."
To the Dearest Intruder,She's probably still pissed at them for making her keep working when she blatantly had COVID and was just just waiting on the test results
To the Dearest Intruder,If she didn’t want it to be a hit she shouldn’t have made it better by pushing back against the insipid teen drama shit they were trying to pull off.
To the Dearest Intruder,">“Everything that Wednesday does, everything I had to play, did not make sense for her character at all.""

Netflix writers and not understanding the source material, name a more iconic due."
To the Dearest Intruder,Even Katherine Heigl is rolling her eyes at this one.
To the Dearest Intruder,Ironically anti-Ortega article that explains why she is right
To the Dearest Intruder,"It's unfortunate that her lack of workplace experience is showing in these exchanges. Her popularity exploded thanks to this show, but the public's love is fickle. They don't take kindly when they think you ungrateful.

Jennifer Lawrence learned the hard way that it's a small trip between internet darling to internet boogeyman."
To the Dearest Intruder,"Given that the WGA are negotiating a new contract and may strike in May, it was incredibly ill advised to make these comments. She may find out sooner rather than later how hard it is to make a tv show without them."
To the Dearest Intruder,I’m sure George Clooney would have preferred Movies as well when cast for E.R.
To the Dearest Intruder,"TV is such a communal endeavor, and having input from actors on the scripts and their characters is invaluable. Disagreements on creative are going to happen and its good that Jenna had a POV and told the writers as such for the betterment of the series. That being said, dragging the writers and other crew like this in such a public way is really unprofessional and simply unnecessary. Other cast and crew could go their entire lives and never work on a show as popular as Wednesday, and now knowing that the star hates it this much, looks down on it in many ways, and wishes she was doing something else is an unbelievable downer. It's completely fine for Jenna to feel this way, I have no issue with that. But repeatedly discussing it in the press is wrong and ultimately hurtful."
To the Dearest Intruder,It's so crazy how after hype dies down everyone is so willing to say the show isn't as good as everyone originally tried to make it sound like it was.
To the Dearest Intruder,Glad to see people see this show for the overrated teen schlock that it is
To the Dearest Intruder,"Not being successful; that’s a bold strategy Cotton, let’s see if it plays out for her."
To the Dearest Intruder,I did not like the show tbh. Didn’t get the hype at all. Just seemed like another angsty teen Netflix show with a recognizable brand and director attached to it.
To the Dearest Intruder,Just don’t do season 2 then.
To the Dearest Intruder,"Some of these actors are unbelievable. A starring role, millions of dollars and still they are not happy."
To the Dearest Intruder,"One of the writers is responding to her on Twitter, calling her out. But with the things she said she changed I feel like the only way it will play out is that writer won’t be able to return for next season. She’s much more important to the show and I feel like it was a mistake on his part to respond publicly.

https://imgur.com/a/Fyl5BPS/"
To the Dearest Intruder,"Oh sure, she hates all the success lol. She’s young and dumb like all of us at that age."
To the Dearest Intruder,I gotta be honest... I'm a little shocked that the show was as popular as it was. I grew up with the original movies and the cartoons and didn't think it would really be such a hit with the modern crowd.
To the Dearest Intruder,"They can change the whole writer's room, and it would probably benefit the show. They can't change the lead actress without tanking the show. JO knows that. I don't blame her for not wanting to get stuck on some mediocre CW show and watching her career get tied to that kind of junk. She is right to speak out. Wednesday is mediocre, but has the potential to be good. Let it be good."
To the Dearest Intruder,The first mistake is thinking she’s not replaceable. Everyone is.
To the Dearest Intruder,Really looking forward to her no longer being the flavour of the month.
To the Dearest Intruder,It’s obvious she’s already over doing scary/horror.
To the Dearest Intruder,The Honest Trailer for Wednesday really nails this
To the Dearest Intruder,Jenna Ortega; I didn’t ask for this 🥴
To the Dearest Intruder,"Honestly, the series felt really corny.  The writing and plot were so teen driven and predictable.  I watched it with my 8 and 10yr old.  They loved it, it worked for a family show.  But it wasn't written well at all.  I guessed every silly plot point the entire way.  Jenna carried this thing on her back.  I kind of hope they wrap in s2 and she can go on to do better things."
To the Dearest Intruder,I am always surprised that she is just 1.55m.
To the Dearest Intruder,"Can’t blame her. She’s really talented. Wednesday’s fun, but move on."
To the Dearest Intruder,The Henry Cavill syndrome. Love it.
To the Dearest Intruder,"I'm honestly surprised by how many in here dislikes the show, or only likes the first two episodes, because ""Burton"".  
 I had no Idea he was only involved in the first two episodes. I think the show was quite good, so does everyone else I have talked to about it.  
Also in this interview she's so ""in character"" that I would guess it's part of marketing for the show. It seems like everyone in here is taking it at face value? Am I missing something?"
To the Dearest Intruder,Sometimes it’s scheduling…a movie requires them to shoot for 6 weeks and maybe a few reshoots but a tv show requires a lot more time
To the Dearest Intruder,And look because of the show she's starting in a Beetlejuice sequel with Michael Keaton.
To the Dearest Intruder,"My niece loves this show so that’s cool, but I can’t see myself ever watching an episode of this."
To the Dearest Intruder,Probably doesn’t wanna be trapped for 7 seasons
To the Dearest Intruder,"Thank God, because I know I can’t live without the stellar acting in films the like of SCREAM 10

/s"
To the Dearest Intruder,"As someone with really specific tastes in show that usually hates mainstream things, I absolutely loved Wednesday beginning to end. Something about it just felt like a geniune effort from a team to make a fun show with a teen thematic. It felt like discovering a super fun show on TV back in the 2000s, not just another entry in the endless things under either DC, Marvel or weird solo actor projects that end up big only because of Controversy. Ironically, for all the teen dialogue, Wednesday actually made me feel quite young and innocent again while watching it, despite some of the dark subject matter.  


  
I honestly feel much of the people hating on Burton and his writers for this show just shows how much differently they approached this show compared to other modern hits. Their writing wasn't focused on tying it into weird worldbuilding and lore, or shocking viewers with random deaths, etc. They just went it at from a very clear goal and aim for the kind of things Wednesday as a character would work with and the stuff she wouldn't. This is especially fine considering that contrary to what most people are saying here, almost NONE of the Wednesday family members have ever had any sort of consistant characterization, especially Wednesday. They're all ""weird"" but the way in which they express it in their dialogue has never been a standard in any of the versions of the family. Wednesday here I feel actually did by far the best job of combining the aspects of a loving family with one that is weird not just because of their gothic style, but because they're geniunely involved in fucked up shit like murder plots and more. Wednesday herself felt interesting to watch as her dialogue wasn't just a gimmick. Her constant bite at other characters ends having both small and big consequences, from pushing people away even when she doesn't want to, to almost killing one of the people she actually considers a friend.  


  
This show honestly feels old in the best ways possible while still being awesome in terms of camera work and pacing and I really hope they stick with it instead of just forcing itself to be new and hip like people in these comments want it to."
To the Dearest Intruder,She is really putting her foot in her mouth recently isn't she?
To the Dearest Intruder,Loser didn't even eat real chicken on hot ones.
To the Dearest Intruder,"I really dislike her attitude and demeanour. I know a lot of people are loving her “girl boss” nature - which is a weird trend right now where people are celebrating female celebrities for being rude and off putting for some reason. 

I just really don’t need to hear celebrities whinging. The gall she has to criticise the writing team and complain about it proves how untouchable she feels and how lucky she is. The average population has to do things they don’t want to do at work. Instead of whinging about what you have to do, why not express gratitude. She has plenty of films on her resume and can keep doing it in the future. She will not struggle to be booked, and she knows it, which is why she has such an asshole attitude. 

She is pretentious and I’m completely over hearing about her interviews. I’ve never seen anything from her except for frowning and bitching, or just being unbelievably rude to interviewers. 

Her attitude has deterred me from viewing things she is in because now her acting just annoys me. 

She is ridiculously cocky and the complete opposite of down to earth. See Brendan Fraser and  Ke Huy Quan at the Oscar’s the other day - imagine Jenna in their place. I’m tired of celebrating celebrities like her and would much rather celebrate the ones who are grateful"
To the Dearest Intruder,"This is starting to give me shades of Jennifer Lopez' ""Movieline"" interview back in 1998 when she was first blowing up (basically trashed a bunch of actors & scripts as she felt pretty untouchable at the time).

&#x200B;

I get that Ortega might be unhappy with some of the writing - I get that she may prefer film to TV.  She may regret playing it out in public as much as she has been."
To the Dearest Intruder,"Girl, just be happy you’re an artist getting a hefty paycheck to do something you love for a living."
To the Dearest Intruder,"She is right though, the plot is beyond stupid and full of tiktok baiting scenes."
To the Dearest Intruder,😭 I’m too popular and have too much money- Her
To the Dearest Intruder,"I do feel bad for actors giving shows a chance, trying to pad their resume, and the show becomes this cultural phenomenon and now they have to spend the rest of their life playing and reliving that character and acting like it was this great experience. Even if they go on to do work they love and are proud of, its that one character they'll be asked about."
To the Dearest Intruder,"So girl get popular but wishes she wasn't on popular show to do film to become popular?  

Did I get that right because from what I've seen, she's everywhere now and doesn't seem to be not enjoying the spotlight?"
To the Dearest Intruder,This must be her 15 minutes of fame that she's being plugged roughly every fifth article.
To the Dearest Intruder,the fandom for this girl hasn't even formed yet and she's already alienating the hell out of everyone
To the Dearest Intruder,She's kinda starting to annoy me and she's to young for that. Quit it.
To the Dearest Intruder,"I liked this girl (as in public person) at first, but after seeing some recent public appareances, I feel she believes she is entitled.   


Just my feeling."
To the Dearest Intruder,"Sounds to me like she wants to be on that Robert Pattinson, Daniel Radcliffe abstract film actor in a rush. She’s barely been famous for a year and she already wants what they spent about a decade of work doing and building a reputation and their acting skills. Girl needs to chill out and just ride the wave and fluff her resume"
To the Dearest Intruder,"People are so negative. I thought it was a decent show. That being said, Ortega obviously helped a lot."
To the Dearest Intruder,"In another universe she could be a waitress in LA trying to land a commercial

In this one she's a 20-year old multimillionaire"
To the Dearest Intruder,She is sounding more and more insufferable every time she talks. Hate to tell her but Hollywood history is littered with young starlets just like her.  There are 50 girls waiting in the wings to take her place.
To the Dearest Intruder,"I mean people are sucking her off now, but I’ve seen Scream this weekend and it was meh, but her performance was a standout in terms of how bad it was. Like shockingly bad. In Wednesday she didn’t have to emote, but I reckon the more she stars in projects where she actually has to act, the more people will realize that she’s not all that."
To the Dearest Intruder,"the show is good and all, but Wednesday herself seems like from a different world than everyone else. That's the point, yes, but if she's so obsessed with death and pain and loneliness how... is it... that she's the most popular girl in school with all these friends and love interests? it just doesn't fit.  It's incredibly CW.  I wish there was a bit more ACTUAL gothic odd-ness going on in the story."
To the Dearest Intruder,"I never watched it, seemed overrated."
To the Dearest Intruder,">There was a line about a dress she has to wear for a school dance and she says, ‘Oh my god I love it. Ugh, I can’t believe I said that. I literally hate myself.’ I had to go, ‘No.’”

""Oh my god, I love it"" is never something Wednesday Adams should say. Fire the writer who wrote that line for her."
To the Dearest Intruder,Girl has one hit show and thinks she is Streep.
To the Dearest Intruder,She sounds like a spoiled brat.
To the Dearest Intruder,So tired of hearing about this actor and how the show supposedly revolves around her decisions (and not the showrunner/writer/director/studio). Such PR nonsense.
To the Dearest Intruder,Ahh tv is so much better than film these days… you’d think these kids would get that.
To the Dearest Intruder,"I get where she is coming from (not wanting to be stuck doing this show for years) but she has got to stop slagging off the thing that has brought her the success she is now enjoying.

She is a professional. There is a way to handle frustration with a project and slamming it in the press ain't the way to go about it."
To the Dearest Intruder,She better be careful or she’ll end up like Constance Wu if she comes off as too ungrateful.
To the Dearest Intruder,She uh... really wants to just tank the goodwill she gained in the last year hm?
To the Dearest Intruder,Wow starting to really not like her
To the Dearest Intruder,Man if i had a nickle when an actor who got famous thanks to some  tv show thought they should do movies and are for movies. I'd have lots of nickles.
To the Dearest Intruder,Such an annoying face
To the Dearest Intruder,"I liked Wednesday, but Ortega gave off an off putting vibe on SNL."
To the Dearest Intruder,"Haven't watched the show, but the headline immediately made me think of Krusty the Klown.  

Basically ""They asked me to do their crappy show, and I threw those phony suits out on their ass!  Then they came back with a dump truck full of money...  and I just had no choice."""
To the Dearest Intruder,I still can’t figure what it was people liked about that show. She’s clearly an It girl but damn that show was not good on any level.
To the Dearest Intruder,I wish I got famous so I could whine about it
To the Dearest Intruder,I like how everyone that films a Netflix show comes out of it and talks like they were serving time in a POW camp.
To the Dearest Intruder,"She’ll eventually gain a reputation of being hard to work with.

We really need another monotone, blank actor?"
To the Dearest Intruder,"She sounds very ungrateful. Not every show is a great experience, but a lot of people didn’t know who the hell she was before this. I only knew of her from the Scream movie and Wednesday. She isn’t doing herself any favors by saying stuff like this ( I’m sure writers aren’t happy)"
To the Dearest Intruder,"Sound a littel douche for a relative newcomer. 

On the other hand, yeah, amazing films like Sream 8 & Scream 9 surely “prove herself”."
To the Dearest Intruder,She sounds like An absolute stinkin brat
To the Dearest Intruder,She is definitely not movie star caliber.
To the Dearest Intruder,"Oh, she'd rather be making little money doing obscure indie films and having to scrap for each new role instead of having a massive hit propel her to huge paydays and producers throwing prime roles her way? 

Shut. The. Fuck. Up."
To the Dearest Intruder,[deleted]
To the Dearest Intruder,This bitch is insufferable.  Some new shit everyday.
To the Dearest Intruder,"I'm sure she's crying herself to sleep every night on a huge pile of money.  

Meanwhile my students are struggling to afford gas for their cars to come to class but You Da Real Victim, Jenna."
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,"It was very very dull. I am a huge fan of Ellen but I didn't laugh out loud once. All the jokes felt like I had heard them before and it felt that she had just done this stand up show for the sake of it, to tick it off her bucket list. 

Also interesting to see that the 8-10 people who asked questions in the end were white blonde women. I thought she had a more diverse fan base but I guess she doesn't."
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,I thought it was really funny! Ellen has still got it. She should keep doing stand up. 
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,"I thought it was okay. I liked it for the most part, but have to agree with someone else who said it was a bit bland. And I didn't find it hugely funny. I liked it in that I enjoyed watching it and laughed at a few things, but mostly smiled more than outright laughed. I liked how frank she was at parts, talking about serious issues. I found some of the detours a little strange, though, and not sure the use of videos brought anything to it. It definitely wasn't as funny as her earlier stand-ups, but that's probably to be expected for a variety of reasons, including that she's older, has evolved more, and hasn't written a comedy special in a while. Not sure I liked the concept of her being unrelatable or relatable because she's rich. Seemed like a one-joke concept stretched a bit thin. I would have either made that joke in passing but not built the show around it, or just ignored it altogether as you can still be rich and make observable jokes about life. All in all, I thought it was okay and wouldn't mind seeing her do more of them."
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,"As much as I love Ellen's stand up, this wasn't as funny as it should have been.  There were parts that were too preachy, and some of the jokes were just not that good.

That said, there were some spots where she shined like she did in her classic stand up.  She has a gift for comedy, especially in her delivery, and there were places in this special where that was on display.  It's just a shame there wasn't more of that in this special.

In the end, I enjoyed this as more of a look back on her career than a pure comedy special.  She worked hard for her place in comedy in the 90's, only to have it snatched away unfairly over her sexuality, but she came back and proved everyone wrong, so I'm willing to give her a little leeway to take her victory lap because she has earned it."
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,I enjoyed it
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,"I loved Ellen in the past, but with her TV show saturating the media with severely cheap comedy, I feel like she's lost her edge. This special is a prime example, it was a shadow of how good her stand up use to be before her talk show. I even found myself cringing through some of it, because it was just so awkward. I expected so much more. At the end, there wasn't even some sort of smart end to the show, like I expect from a comedian, where they tie up all the loose ends. It was part forced jokes and part TED talk. "
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,"I laughed at some parts but I was still disappointed. My favorite routine she did was her “Here and Now” special from 2003. Comparing that one to this one, “Relatable” is just bland. "
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,"I wanted to like it. I wanted her to do well, but it was awful.

She seemed dead inside, she has no spunk anymore. I'm not sure if her daytime TV career truly took her edge away, or if she's being deliberately censored to preserve her daytime TV career and housewife audience."
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,"After this special, I'll convinced Ellen is extremely narcissistic and preachy. Also, does she do shrooms?! Those stories were high stories. "
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,My wife and I thought it was hilarious. But it's definitely not even remotely edgy so I'm guessing everyone in this thread who hated it might have been expecting something else.
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,"The first 6 minutes are an in your face assault into how poor you are in comparison to Ellen. The next 6 minutes are about her sexuality and the rest of the show is a feeble attempt to ""relate"" to the average American. It was absolutely horrible and not comedic in the least bit. I did not laugh once."
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,"A bit meh. I thought it started off alright, although I did cringe at some of the rich-jokes, and then got progressively worse. A lot of the jokes felt like they could've just been from her monologues on her show, these little bits here and there that didn't really connect to each other. Some of the jokes I also recognized from her earlier stand-up, which was a bit disappointing. She's had what, 15 years to write new material, and she's reusing some of the old stuff? I was expecting a bit more. Also the one recurring theme seemed to be her talking about how filthy rich she is, which felt funny and self-aware in the beginning, but got a bit tired towards the end. Like, we get it. You have loads of cash.

I didn't hate it, to be clear. But at best, I thought it was amusing, not really laugh-out-loud funny. The biggest reaction I had was a slight chuckle. I think it's the kind of stand-up that gathers an audience because people already know her and a lot of people already love her. On its own, the material was quite weak. 

&#x200B;"
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,"It just wasnt funny, i mean im not a huge comedy special viewer but the ones i do watch are from big names maybe thats why i expected it to be funny. She has a very small presence on stage with very little energy."
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,"Like it has been said here I also thought it was just ok, not a lot of laughs, but just interesting enough to make you smile a bit and keep watching because there are a few good jokes. Kind of like Ellen to me in general being a 40 something straight dude. For not doing it for 15 years you can see she is a professional so good for her.

I watched this with my mom because she doesn't like a lot of cursing and violence so Ellen would be a sure wholesome thing. Everyone knows about how she likes to dance on her show, so no surprise she would dance on this special but then my mom asked me do I know this song since I know rap music, I said yeah thats ""Back That Azz Up"" by Juvenile

    ""I know you can't stand it, dick bandit
    Done landed, see your drawers handed
    Freak to get it y'all, game spit at y'all
    Put the bitch on the wall and I hit it y'all
    Lookin' kind of lonely, I'm feelin horny
    Put the dick ""in the Middle"" like ""Monie""

    Girl, you looks good, won't you back that azz up
    You'se a fine motherfucker, won't you back that azz up
    Call me Big Daddy when you back that azz up
    Hoe, who is you playin wit? Back that azz up
    Girl, you looks good, won't you back that azz up
    You'se a fine motherfucker, won't you back that azz up



Then I said it's kinda weird Ellen is using this song cuz it's kind of X rated and my mom said what do you mean so I pointed out the lyrics which she apparently couldn't hear at all, saying how back that azz up he's basically talking about having sex with her. Then right when I said that as she was dancing Ellen started doing the slap that ass thing, you know like when you're fucking someone doggy style (be it with a strap on or an actual member) and you start slapping the ass cheeks as they move up and down in and out.

I realized then I said too much and that at that very moment my mom knew exactly what I, and Ellen was talking about, and it was akward silence time until the next laugh which was waaay too long lol. 

Why do this if you are Ellen? We were completely offended and will now be boycotting her show, this is disgusting behavior!. Just kidding but yeah wtf Ellen lol"
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,"lmao haha, they say it dont be like that but it really do"
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,"this special made it apparent to me that she detests her fans. she only talked about herself and basically bragged the entire time. i know it was intended to be received as ironic, but it was so excessive that it should be taken as nothing more than a promotional stunt for herself. she beat her lame jokes to death in between jokes about how rich she is. she even defended hollywood and protested that common people view them as anything but rich and entitled. we are supposed to feel sorry for them? the entire thing (with the exception of maybe 5 min or so) was completely about her. she is obviously an egomaniac with little concern for anyone but herself and her partner. to her fans -- pay close attention to her in this special and in the show. watch her face as no-name guests and fans interact with her. you'll see the malice she has for you.

&#x200B;

one fan stood up and exclaimed that her entire family watches her every day, nearly in tears. the fan then asks, ""is there anything you would like to know about me as a fan?""

&#x200B;

ellen's response was, ""how long have you been watching my show?""

&#x200B;

the fan's response was, ""since about season 5, i think""

&#x200B;

ellen's response, ""sit down""

&#x200B;

WOW SO FUNNY."
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,"Agreed. I get the punchlines, but I just didn't really laugh a lot. I laughed maybe once or twice."
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,[deleted]
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,"Yeah. This one is absolutely terrible compared to her two HBO special, the Beginning and Here and Now. She was more relatable back then. "
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,"She definitely has a gift.  I think if she stuck with stand up for a while, she could get back to the the level of classic Ellen, which was hilarious.  "
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,What was too preachy?
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,The price of a daytime TV gig is giving up everything that made you special. No exceptions.
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,"I think her energy matches her being the most powerful and monetized woman in entertainment. She's not hungry, and she's not putting in 5-7 days a week of real comedy set work like she was when she did stand up. For 16 years she's recited mostly SUPER lame material written by others who specialize in Starbucks-level ""comedy"" that can be consumed by as many women as possible. This is a total 180 from the days when she worked comedy clubs with a 1/2 hour TV special being the pinnacle of success in her group of contemporaries. Imagine the life of a road comedian and compare that to the life she describes in the opening of her set. I havent heard of her doing any stage time at clubs in LA, so unfortunately I think this was more of an hour long monologue as opposed to an original, all-Ellen set. Which sucks because while she was never a comedy juggernaut her personality and material were really unique and funny. "
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,">The first 6 minutes are an in your face assault into how poor you are in comparison to Ellen. 

.....that was the joke.

"
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,Yeah I'm about 30 minutes in now and it's fucking terrible. I read she was considering ending her talk show. I hope it's not too do more of this. 
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,Ellen in general seems to think her inability to relate to people makes her come off as really relatable. 
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,"I said ""INTERESTING"", not ""annoyed"". I could care less since I'm neither white nor black."
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,That ending bit was a little too preachy for me. I for the most part enjoyed it and I was genuinely shocked when she said “Fuck”. 
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,"Yes. You don't get to keep two demographics at the same time. Inevitably, you're going to burn one. 

You don't get the adoration of housewives making deliberately controversial comments or anything remotely cheeky, lewd, or suggestive. 

You don't get the adoration of stand-up comedy fans by being the hero of cooped up housewives dancing and whooping over-excitedly in the audience to interviews with celebrities, watered-down jokes, wholesome ""gags"" and dance-a-longs, and occasional kids from viral YouTube videos. 

She maimed *herself*. She's the Dr. Oz of stand up comedy, peddling snake oil for big bucks."
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,Seriously though....that was *literally* the joke. Are people really that dense?
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,"I think she was SO PREACHY ""everyone feels this"", ""everyone wants that"", ""that's what we should do"", ""that's how we should""."
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,Evidently they are. Not the brightest bulb on the Christmas tree these folks
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,"I give it two, maybe three months until we find out about a Netflix show in the works."
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,It peaked at special guest Rich Evans.
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,"Remember when Oprah was ending her show and the whole season was filled with hype and celebration and build up to that final episode and it was like a really big deal?  

Remember when Ellen ended her show and nobody even realized it was still on till they saw link in their news feed about it?"
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,I still really hate her for how she treated that translator lady. Even if all this other news about her never came out I’d have zero respect for her after that segment alone.
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,"Worked on a show for Ellen online and it was one of my top 5 worst experiences in the last 20 years.

The worst part about all this is that all of those producers and production people that learned how to work under those conditions, and have been conditioned to think that's how the business runs will now bring those terrible habits elsewhere and continue to treat people like garbage.

Good riddance Ellen you phony piece of shit."
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,"If you watch the bit where Ellen and Andy go to the Porsche Experience she makes Andy get dressed in Porsche-brand clothing from their store, and it appears to be intentionally too small for him. Then she goes to pick a car but she wants to ""talk"" to them first (yes, I mean the cars), so she sits in each car honking their horns. 

While she's doing that Andy says to the Porsche guys something like, ""This is my life. Every day, it's like this."" That comment hits very differently when you realize what a terrible person/boss Ellen really is."
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,She hired scabs in Hollywood during the pandemic. She's dead to most film crews in LA for that reason alone
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,"It's a shame she was such a horrible boss to her crew because she had such a positive forward facing image. Loved watching her segments but once all that came out, off it went. 

I've heard nothing but negative things for people that worked for her, and then for her to take basically 0 blame and push it all onto her 'team' last year just shows even more about the type of person she is."
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,Ellen Disingenuous
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,"Her thank you / good bye speech was basically, ""Thank you everyone for making me shine like the beautiful star I am.""   Right up to the end, everything was about her."
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,I have to wonder if she ever joked with Portia about no eye contact. That's like cartoon villian type stuff.
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,If you actually watch early episodes of the show you can see why it became successful. If you watch later episodes of the show it transformed into something ugly and glamorous.
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,"Chris Pontius, who seemingly loves every person he meets, said that she was trash. That’s all I needed to hear."
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,The only fitting end is if they go the Seinfeld route where all the people she's mistreated over the years show up to testify how awful she is before pulling the plug on her.
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,"I never disliked Ellen, but I feel like people who were real fans of the show were all the kind of bob-cut soccer moms who would play the victim if you tried to stop them cutting the line at Starbucks."
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,It is a glorified infomercial.
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,"She destroyed her own reputation, and that is why no-one cares about her anymore."
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,"the show was still going?

only now was the last episode?

and people still came on, and even hugged her?

&#x200B;

thought it got cancelled after all that shit came out."
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,I never liked her she always gave me insincere vibes.
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,She abused her staff good riddance
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,"I worked on the first 2 seasons of the show for. It was a great experience for me because the EP that hired me ended up ghosting the show almost immediately and the other producers thought I only worked for and answered directly to Ellen. Thanks to Ellens riff with the EP she never even learned my name and no really knew what I was suppossed to do so they left me alone. Got to know the Warner Bros. commissary and back lot pretty well.  

One of my best jobs ever."
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,[deleted]
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,Employers abusing employees can FUCK RIGHT OFF
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,"My elderly mother cried watching that final episode. For all the cynicism, both from critics and DeGeneres herself, the show actually did mean something to a significant number of people."
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,Who’s even still watching this shit?
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,"From r/deuxmoi 

> I genuinely wonder what public reception she will get once she passes. Don’t get me wrong, she likely isn’t the nicest person considering the stories numerous people have about her but she’s done a lot for gay people, especially women, in the entertainment industry.

> The fact still remains that it was groundbreaking for someone like her to come out as lesbian on a widely viewed sitcom when gay people had far less representation in the media so she became a role model to lots of gay people and to top that off, she hosted one the most successful daytime talk shows of all time that inspired lots of people around the world.

> There were longtime rumors about her actually being a less than nice person behind the camera but her public image was still relatively healthy until a few years ago when reports about workplace harassment also brought to light the rumors about her mean attitude in addition to instances of her bullying people on her own show which were previously dismissed by many as just being a part of her humor.

> In spite of all that, she still has a legacy so it will be interesting to see how people will react to her passing and how they will grapple the good with the bad about her."
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,[deleted]
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,"Good riddance.  It's been a year since she announced her ""retirement""."
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,Good riddance. Such an absolutely phony fake ass persona. You won’t be missed
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,She treated Dakota Johnston and Mariah Carey so poorly. Their interviews were total disasters.
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,A show I have only seen when in a doctors office and it's on that little TV in the upper corner of the room
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,It’s over?  Yessssssss
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,Bye don’t come back
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,"She had the audacity to put the streamer Ninja of all people on her show, and when she asked for a tutorial on some of the games he played, he gave a good explanation on what she should do, yet she always messed around with the controls and in the end she said “You’ve taught me nothing”. She must be at most 5 years old."
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,"Mixed about Ellen. At times she did some good things for people, but anyone who worked for her called her a monster. It came to a head when the lockdowns hit and she turfed her staff, only to bring in cheaper, non-union workers. That was the death nail for her. However she didn’t walk out broke, her reported net worth is over $300 million."
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,I can happily say I never saw a single episode.
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,"Why does this write up seem to completely skip the contraversy, or why the show was cancelled? I know the former was basically ""she is awful to those who work for her in every conceivable way"", but i actually dont know if that caused the latter?

The entire write up is about how her being gay changed the industry. Which it did! She did amazing things! And made things better for other LGBTQ people in the industry. 

Its just that she is, by all accounts, a shitty, shitty person."
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,Great win for the people. Who is next?
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,"Funny they still push the narrative that Ellens show was cancelled cause she was gay. If anything it boosted her ratings greatly for a short period of time. Then the lazy writing continued and people lost interest again.

She went from a fucking season average of 9.6 to a 23.4 for the coming out episode.

That episode along with just the remaining two episodes of season 4 lifted the average rating to 16.79…an insane increase.

Season 5 had an average rating of 12.4
Far better than the 9.6 average they had in season 4 across the 21 episodes before she came out in episode 22.

Her coming out didn’t kill her show. It was a last gasp attempt to save a dying show. And it actually worked and kept them on for another season. It saved the show. It didn’t kill it. It’s funny how everyone wants to rewrite history now.

Let’s also not forget Will and Grace premiered the same year Ellen ended. And was a massive hit that ran for 8 seasons. And I’d argue that show was way more about a gay lifestyle than Ellen ever was. Difference is, it’s actually a fucking great show. 

Ellen has always been a horrible person who has only gotten away with her bullshit by falling back on the “oh I’m gay” crap. Today I like to call this the Spacey defense.

Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,Fuck Ellen and her show.
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,Ellen and James Corden finally off TV. HUZZAH
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,If there like a thread or like that points out all the bad things she has done? Or is she disliked because  something she said?
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,I was such a fan that I found out about the cancellation right here
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,"Isn’t she leaving bc she was exposed as a beeyotch behind the scenes , or something?"
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,I honestly had no idea her show was still on. I thought she was cancelled awhile ago.
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,"Subtitle insult, love it."
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,Never liked her
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,I didn’t know this was still on the air. I legit thought they stopped making this show years ago.
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,I hope I never hear her name again.
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,Making fun of people is not comedy. Her shows were awkward and juvenile.
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,Good riddance
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,She is evil
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,"Wait, it just ended?  Shit I thought that trash was over a couple years ago when we all found out she was a piece of shit."
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,Good riddance. She has no relevance in today’s world. Empty and vapid.
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,"She always seemed extremely phony to me. Well, ever since I saw her “dance”. Just seems like a total sleaze."
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,"Not gunna lie, I thought the show had been canceled years ago around when it first came out how shitty of a person she is."
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,Fuck that hoe
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,My real question is that someone actually gives a fuck about this?
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,"First time I caught her dancing with that fake dj fist-pumping was the last time I ever watched it.

Garbage"
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,Did she ever appologize?
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,Good riddance.
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,"There's an awakening and Ellen's downfall is part of that.

She's hurt so many people along the way. She's used movements to her own advantage from MeToo to BLM to LGBT. She's helped those causes without a doubt but she's been an absolute hypocrite and has empowered those that hate those groups trying fight tooth and nail for equality.

She has no clue how much damage she's caused nor does she care outside of how it hurts her."
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,Kind of sucks when you’ve always liked the personality someone portrays themselves to be only to find out they’re actually a garbage human being.
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,Wait. She still had a show??
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,It was still on?
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,Good riddance…hope she takes this as retirement.
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,"Gotta be honest, way before the controversies I used to enjoy tuning in to Ellen’s show on the treadmill (since our treadmills had cable LCD monitors). The pump-up or lead-in segment with the DJ and everybody just dancing was a good mood those days.

Eventually everyone just started to uncover the evils behind that woman and that show…"
Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable,I found out how fucked she was from My Favorite Murder.
Man Like Mobeen,"I'll have to give those a go. I've been hooked on their comedy panel shows. 8 out of 10 cats does cowntdown. Taskmaster. QI. The big fat quiz of the year. 

All available on youtube"
Man Like Mobeen,"So many you should see. I'd add to your watchlist: Peep Show, the IT Crowd, Spaced, The Thick of It, Black Books."
Man Like Mobeen,"I'll be honest, I didn't read what you wrote, I'm just still pissed off they took Detectorists off Netflix."
Man Like Mobeen,"I've pretty much watched nothing but British shows during these months of lockdown, mainly thanks to Acorn and Britbox.  I'm much more into British crime shows (my favorites are Vera, Line of Duty, Scott & Bailey, No Offence and Shetland) but there are a few comedies that I've loved.  Mainly GameFace with Roisin Conaty (both seasons are on Hulu - to me, it's better than Fleabag) and Benidorm, which is not exactly highbrow humor, but the first few seasons still make me laugh out loud.

And can I please recommend this hilarious show I discovered on Youtube (thanks to Vicky McClure from Line of Duty) called Charity Shop Sue?  It's like if the British version of The Office had taken place in a thrift store with a female David Brent as manager lol."
Man Like Mobeen,"I am not sure which regions its available in, but its available in my region: Don’t miss out on Line of Duty and Peep Show. Some of the very best British TV has to offer"
Man Like Mobeen,If you like Monty Oython type humor; Zapped on HBO Max was surprisingly good.
Man Like Mobeen,"Watch You're the Worst on Hulu, not a British show but gives the vibes and main character is British"
Man Like Mobeen,Have you seen Fleabag? Funniest show I’ve seen awhile.
Man Like Mobeen,Bodyguard is an excellent drama. Only 6 episodes so it is a quick watch. It is on Netflix.
Man Like Mobeen,"Try Brassic! It's this charming, hilarious little comedy-drama about the lives of a bunch of lovable small-town crooks. It embodies compassion and fellowship and striving to be who you're meant to be, *and* it also features capers about stealing ponies or weddings and it made me cry laughing at one point, it was so ridiculous.

Joe Gilgun was one of the creators, and I guess quite a lot of it is semi-autobiographical (he lifted stories and elements from his previous life of crime...? and yes, he lived in a shack in the woods). It also features an honest portrayal of his life with bipolar disorder, which I find super-admirable."
Man Like Mobeen,"If you haven't already seen them, you should definitely watch Derry girls and Still Game.  Though you will need subtitles for the latter and may need them for the former"
Man Like Mobeen,Check out People Do Nothing on Netflix. It's a much better Trailer Park Boys.
Man Like Mobeen,"Have you seen Would I lie to you? If not, rectify immediately"
Man Like Mobeen,I'll have to check that out as well.
Man Like Mobeen,I appreciate the honesty?
Man Like Mobeen,"Just here to second the *Line of Duty* recommendation. It's one of the best shows out there. *Bodyguard* is written by the same person, also excellent, and is available on US Netflix. That show is what got me into *Line of Duty* in the first place"
Man Like Mobeen,Peep show is one of those greatest shows of all time that no one I know has watched.
Man Like Mobeen,"I don't think theyre available in america, it doesnt show up."
Man Like Mobeen,I'll check it out thanks
Man Like Mobeen,"I've watched Derry girls a little while ago. It's good i enjoyed it. I always use subtitles, don't really need them tho lmao"
Man Like Mobeen,"Of course, thats another good one! Does the U.K. have only 20 comedians? They all seem to be on the same shows"
Man Like Mobeen,Check out if its available for streaming. Don’t miss out on them
Man Like Mobeen,Line of Duty is on Amazon Prime.
Man Like Mobeen,AMC has been re airing in time for the new season.
Man Like Mobeen,"I also watch Breeders, which I enjoy.

Sherlock if you haven't seen it.

I like British shows as well. 😂"
Man Like Mobeen,"It's self-dealing. The big management companies also have production arms, so if an Avalon show hires an Avalon comedian, Avalon gets to pay Avalon its own commission. Case in point is Avalon making Last Week Tonight, starring John Oliver, who is managed by... Avalon."
Man Like Mobeen,I'll definitely check them out
Man Like Mobeen,"Sherlock is alright, i watched it before. Have to check out breeders though"
Man Like Mobeen,Peep Show should be on Hulu. Do it!
Man Like Mobeen,Both of them are on Hulu! I just checked and added them
Man Like Mobeen,I use Pluto tv for that fix if need be. I like bouncing around between the old music video channels to see what's what. Find all kinds of old videos from the way back times.
Man Like Mobeen,I'm the opposite. I don't miss the commercials even a little bit.
Man Like Mobeen,"PlutoTV scratches that itch, too. Completely free."
Man Like Mobeen,"Channel surfing is like wandering through a bookstore or a record shop. There's a serendipity to it that has been lost in the all-online culture we have now. It's so much harder to just stumble on something and think ""Hey this looks interesting!"" or ""Hey I haven't seen this in awhile!"""
Man Like Mobeen,"Whenever I go to my mom's with cable tv I really enjoy watching random nature documentaries.

When streaming it feels like 'work'. A task I gotta finish. Channel surfing is totally casual and uncommitted. A lot more relaxing overall, but I prefer it is limited doses so I don't get sick of it"
Man Like Mobeen,"Nope. I grew up channel surfing and don't miss it in the slightest lol.

Any time I'm in a hotel or hospital and have to flip through channels, I get so annoyed"
Man Like Mobeen,"Reddit isn’t the target audience, but yes, a significant portion of users enjoy the channel experience. Not the ads, but the act of choosing a “channel” that automatically plus from a select pool of shows that is on a schedule and blends in new content. It’s an older audience though, and the content is ad packed so it’s not going to get any more attractive to younger viewers, especially since the ads can’t be skipped within live content."
Man Like Mobeen,"There is no nap that rivals a weekend afternoon nap with an 80s/90s movie on the tv with a billion commercials. Back to the Future, most Nic Cage movies of the era, Shawshank…"
Man Like Mobeen,"I've been ""streaming"" for longer, and get you. Once a year or so I visit relatives who have cable/satellite, and I spend a few weeks channel surfing. It is a different experience, and enjoyable in many ways. But I am always happy to be back on my computer with my various sources.

I think if I had the choice of channels (and budget) I'd be happy to have a decent cable package."
Man Like Mobeen,"I was at a hotel a couple of weeks ago, the channel surfing thing has zero appeal to me, and my kid simply can't stand it. She kept on telling me to switch to Bluey and I had to explain to her how TV works in the olden days. I didn't think that went through to her 4 year old brain at all..."
Man Like Mobeen,Yeah let's talk after the 2nd hour of commercials.
Man Like Mobeen,That's kind of the beauty of Pluto TV.
Man Like Mobeen,I don’t miss commercials but I do miss stumbling onto shows while waiting for another show to come back.  Theres so much great stuff out there.  Id usually get sucked in by something I would pass up on netflix today in a heartbeat.
Man Like Mobeen,"Every once in a while I like the nostalgia of commercials and the ability to grab a snack or something without having to purposefully decide to pause. Feels nice not to have to make a firm decision on what to watch too, if that makes sense."
Man Like Mobeen,"Having stayed a hotel recently I've gotta say. I don't miss TV at all. I haven't had a cable sub for 15 years.

I don't miss the obnoxious commercials. 
I don't miss the chopped up, censored movies. 
I don't miss not being able to pause it when I want more food or use the bathroom.
I don't miss planning days or nights around when something was going to be on.
I don't miss any of it."
Man Like Mobeen,"I’m with you, man. There’s so much content spread over so many streamers that choosing to watch something is kind of paralyzing. 

I really do usually prefer to see what’s running on tv and drop in on whatever is the best thing at that moment. And then let it ride, usually as background."
Man Like Mobeen,Watching TV in a hotel makes me realize that a huge portion of the population must take a LOT of pharmaceuticals.
Man Like Mobeen,"Never gave up cable and never will. I find the whole experience way better than streaming. After a long day of work I find channel flipping way easier to for turning my brain off than deciding what *exactly* I want to watch on streaming. I also like an hour of one thing, and a couple episodes of another rather than binge watching one thing all night. And I know this one will sound crazy but I don't see red at the thought of commercials. I grew up with them, I don't like them but they aren't the biggest deal to me. A commercial comes on, I go start dinner, next commercial comes on I get something else done. 

I know cable didn't work for a lot of people but I still find it the more enjoyable TV watching experience to streaming."
Man Like Mobeen,"Oh god no. I pick up the remote on parents' TV and flip to the guide: 200+ channels - PPV movies, Cable News, Diner's Drive-ins and Dives, 30 minutes of sports recaps rerun over and over, and usually a few Hallmark movies.

So I try... Ok, maybe a bit of news. I'll put on CNN a bit.

Have you guys heard about the 3 Ps of Life Insurance from Colonial Penn?  
Drunk Joe Namath says I should call to see if my Zip Code gets money back on my Social Security check!  
Should I ask my doctor about Zurblamoflek?"
Man Like Mobeen,"Only time Ive watched live tv in years is when Better Call Saul is on and my god the commercials. 

But it does bring me back to when i was younger watching cartoons after school like Samurai jack, ed edd n eddy,Avatar the last airbender etc. loved that feeling of being there when a new episode is about to air."
Man Like Mobeen,"I don't have cable, but I still channel surf on the local channels with an indoor antenna. If you feeling nostalgic about channel surfing, There's Tubi, Pluto TV, The Roku Channel, Crackle, or Sling TV."
Man Like Mobeen,It’s nice for a little while but not as the only option. I always bring my laptop or firestick
Man Like Mobeen,"It similar to the dopamine hit you get from scrolling facebook and finding a video you want to watch, you can sit there for 20 minutes just scrolling till you find the nugget.  where is streaming, you're sifting through a library of videos, looking for one you want to watch, there is not really any FOMO involved as its not going anywhere, but the live TV can change every 30 minutes or so, Also sometimes the absence of Choice is just easier.  


for whatever reasons the idea of Sifting through 60 channels feel like im doing something, where is browsing a list of movies on Netflix feels like i have not achieved anything..  Just my thoughts."
Man Like Mobeen,I do miss just flipping on a TV and there is just something on. Sometimes I miss my shows being picked for me.
Man Like Mobeen,"One of the biggest problem for me with streaming is finding what I want to watch, and, honestly channel surfing is actually a great way to deal with that. 

It's like, I have a lot of problem finding where I want to sit, but, just put me somewhere and I'll probably have no problem sitting there."
Man Like Mobeen,I feel the same! I have been reintegrating regular old tv into my watching habits! And I like the commercial breaks for the same reason!!!
Man Like Mobeen,"I just recently got a kickass Televes OTA antenna hooked up and I'm getting around 46 channels. Love watching reruns of the shows I grew up watching from the 70s, 80s and 90s. Commercials don't bother me a bit."
Man Like Mobeen,"I haven't had cable for 21 years.  I went to pirating, then eventually to streaming services.  I do have some nostalgia for channel surfing back in the day, including watching movies out of order in multiple sittings on TMN because I rarely caught them at the beginning.  But I left it for a reason and never went back.  It's just so inferior to choosing exactly what you want to watch.  Although I do find choosing programs on Netflix or whatever pretty tedious when I don't already know what I want to watch.  I actually still prefer to download stuff because then I'm choosing exactly what I want ahead of time and then just playing it easily over the home network instead of flipping through some clunky streaming service interface that always seems to change frequently.  Streaming services are decent, but nothing has ever come close to downloading.  If all I had was streaming services, I'd probably welcome cable now and again just so I didn't have to figure out what the hell to watch.  Unless you know what you want, it's almost impossible to find anything on the streaming services."
Man Like Mobeen,"Right? 

Idk why or if it's just me but when I watch live tv I feel like I'm more in the mix/connected to the outside world? Like up-to-date/plugged in? Maybe because alot of the world is watching the exact thing you are at the same time? It feels some type of way. Communale maybe? I can't explain it.

And when I am on netflix or whatever I feel like I'm cut off in my own lil world. In a box kinda. A Netflix channel with a scheduled program would be cool. 

I'm wierd asf I know."
Man Like Mobeen,"My head categorises TV that happens to be on a channel as more valuable than streaming, can't say why.

If I turn on the TV and see an episode of the Simpsons etc is just starting I'll watch happily, but would never stream it independently."
Man Like Mobeen,">Maybe it’s just nostalgia,

It is, the novelty would wear off after a few days"
Man Like Mobeen,I realized this during a recent hospital stay. It's how I found out how funny Seinfeld actually is lol
Man Like Mobeen,"You don't have a physical TV?  You should just get one and tune into local channels over the air for free, i get like 25 channels.  I barely watch the networks anymore but i like watching MeTV, Antenna TV and Buzzr."
Man Like Mobeen,"I have DIRECTV up at the cabin.

I find that having a channel listing with what's on/coming up is 200x easier to find something than flipping through a streaming service.

I miss that part of streaming. I know some live TV versions have versions of channel guides but its never the same."
Man Like Mobeen,"I miss it when channel surfing was actually fast, whereas now it feels like everything has to load."
Man Like Mobeen,"To this day I still pay for cable. Nights when I don't know what to put on, then I flip on the TV and Rush Hour is on TNT, or Shawshank is on FX... so easy to just pop something on midway through that I've already seen before as opposed to surfing through Netflix or Hulu to find something to watch"
Man Like Mobeen,"Oh cool that's on!

Commercial

Flip through channels

This is fine

Commercial

Flip back to first channel

Commercial again

Flip through channels some more

This sucks

Go to Netflix"
Man Like Mobeen,"Channel surfing is fun for like one minute then it just gets old real fast. I still have cable but never use it but when I do it’s just weird and not in a good way? Like commercials? Can’t pause? Can’t watch what I want but having to settle for what’s airing? News network? I probably haven’t watched the news in *years*. I find it more annoying than anything, I wouldn’t go back"
Man Like Mobeen,Nope. Huge waste of time and usually ends with me turning the TV off unhappy because there is nothing to watch. With steaming I can take 5 seconds to do that and move on to waste time with something else.
Man Like Mobeen,"I'm the exact opposite. I was just at a hotel winding down for them evening thinking ""these hotel TV's should have built in Chromecast or something""

I was at Disney World earlier this year thinking ""surprised these TV's don't have access to Disney+""

I was somewhere... Worst thing is when cable doesn't have a guide menu to browse channels. Instead has one of those slow scrollers where half the screen is commercials.

Nope. I want none of that. If I went to waste my time ... Well, here I am on Reddit"
Man Like Mobeen,"Nice try Comcast.

In all seriousness,  download PlutoTV. Channel surf all you want."
Man Like Mobeen,I don't pay for cable and don't get over-air channels so I don't get ANY live TV and I genuinely miss it.
Man Like Mobeen,Because of my job I'm at hotels more nights than I'm home and I don't think I've turned on the TV in like 5 years.
Man Like Mobeen,"I don't miss it for a second, last time i did i was reminded how 99% of the content on TV is pure garbage. between all the reality tv trash, the terrible family friendly sitcoms, cooking shows, awful drama shows, the list goes on, so i prefer to whittle it down to my preferences."
Man Like Mobeen,Just reminds me of how awful programmed network tv is. Real Housewives and home renovation shows remind me that China is probably winning.
Man Like Mobeen,Nice try Big Cable.  Get your propaganda out of here.
Man Like Mobeen,YTTV with movie channel subscriptions is kind of like having cable experience while you're streaming.
Man Like Mobeen,"God no! Any time I'm at a relative's house who only has cable or satellite, I can't stand it. XD"
Man Like Mobeen,I'd pay anything to not watch commercials
Man Like Mobeen,"It's always down voted here, especially during school breaks, but cable television with a PVR is better than streaming.  

Fast, reliable, compatible.  Everything in one bulletproof interface.  No commercials. No previews, credits, fluff, recaps, ""previously on's"" and other junk either.  Fast forward, skip and rewind that actually work.  Organized.  200 new hours of available content choices every real time hour.  No endless scrolling.  

Live news, live sports\*, live business, live weather, live talk, none of which is available on streaming.  HBO, Showtime, PBS, BBC America, CNN, ESPN.  Every talk show, day AND night.  Discovery family of channels.  History channel family of channels.  Bravo family of content.  All major networks real time. Plus loads of junky niche content to fit any viewers interests. 

No app updates, crashes, bugs, seizing, freezing, errors, pop ups, errors, error reports, reboots.  No forced ads.  Instantly flip between 100+ content providers, all on the same interface.  

Whenever I'm stuck somewhere with streaming only I'm reminded how primitive it is compared to PVR.

Only two drawbacks are the sound and video aren't ultra blu-ray level, and you pay the bill to scumbag companies.  But I'd argue the same two drawbacks often apply with streaming services too.

People have been trained to say cable is bad, but they're clearly not using it properly."
Man Like Mobeen,The over 45 crowd probably agrees with you
Man Like Mobeen,"Not at all.

I have cable still and I use Xfinity's voice controls to auto-navigate to whatever channel or show I want to watch most of the time. The rest of the time, I use the guide to find something. I never actually aimlessly channel flip and don't look back fondly on doing so as a kid at all. Just a waste of time."
Man Like Mobeen,"I get this, I am much more accepting of commercials now than before streaming."
Man Like Mobeen,"Honestly I can relate. I know it’s such a “first world problem”, but I get overwhelmed by the choices of streaming services. Sometimes I just wanna kick back and choose from the more limited options playing on regular TV."
Man Like Mobeen,Nope. I bring a streaming stick with me when I travel.
Man Like Mobeen,I'm  marking the date: *Entering the first phase of cable TV nostalgia.*
Man Like Mobeen,"I'm fine with the streaming but I really wish there was the option to play a random episode of something; particularly any show with 4 or more seasons. Don't make me try to pick one, just play one randomly and if I happen not to like it, I'll hit shuffle again."
Man Like Mobeen,"The last time my partner and I went on vacation was to Colorado, with intentions to just relax. The plan was there was no plan. And we absolutely brought our Roku so we could have our own streaming accounts in the hotel room. (Of course, we also scored some edibles.)"
Man Like Mobeen,I enjoy it. It’s one of my favorite parts of starting in a hotel. It must be the nostalgia
Man Like Mobeen,"I hate it. I barely watch tv streamed or otherwise but if it’s not where I can watch it commercial free there’s 0% chance I’m tuning in. I went to visit family last Christmas and it reaffirmed my hatred for “regular tv”, 500 channels and nothing on but old crime TV and reality garbage."
Man Like Mobeen,I like PlutoTV for that sometimes
Man Like Mobeen,"Our TV antenna blew down a few years back and I never bothered to reattach it, as by that point we were watching mostly YouTube content and TV shows on Plex. 

The only time I missed having broadcast TV is last night when I realized Channel 7 were doing a ""Best and Worst of Red Faces"" two night special and I had no way to watch the whole thing. However it's on 7now, so I can watch it online, it was more of a minor inconvenience to not be able to watch it, than anything."
Man Like Mobeen,"I appreciate the appeal of having someone else do the selection, much like I still scan through radio stations when driving sometimes. But to me the commercials ruin it almost completely. Unless it s a very specific type of marathon (Star Trek, for example) where I am willing to mute each commercial break and go on my phone, then I am just completely taken out of the experience and reminded how much easier it is to watch TV online with adblock.

I do take your point that having other people curate selections can be fun sometimes, especially if you're looking to discover new things. But I bet there are ways we could replicate that on the internet without having to spend 15 minutes out of every hour attempting to avoid being brainwashed."
Man Like Mobeen,"Honestly? I don't miss it at all. No ads and you watch whatever you want at any time is 100x better, I wouldn't go back."
Man Like Mobeen,"I liked channel surfing when I went to Europe and flipped through all the German and Dutch channels. I even found like a Dutch version of Reno 911... I think. It was in dutch so it might have just been their version of cops.

That said if I am in America channel surfing is annoying and I just want to watch something I already know, not discover anything."
Man Like Mobeen,"Having the nice lady on the BBC (UK) telling you what's coming up between shows is nice, especially around Christmas when there's actually some festivity around the potentially exciting programming but otherwise absolutely not."
Man Like Mobeen,"Until nine months ago, I hadn’t streamed everything I watched for over fifteen years.  While it’s nice to stumble upon some shows I would otherwise never have heard of, and to find NCIS on at nearly every hour of the day, the commercials are so fucking obnoxious.  Medicines, lawyers, insurance, and Safelite seem to make up 95% of the American economy.  And when the primaries were on… holy fuck was that a special piece of hell.

But watching Jeopardy! during dinner is cool."
Man Like Mobeen,"I've found Pluto TV scratches that itch. I can watch garbage cable shows or random news, plus commercials. There's something comforting about it."
Man Like Mobeen,"I cannot stand commercial breaks. If you need a bathroom break or get a phone call that is what the pause button is for. As for channel surfing, as soon as the program guide became a thing on cable tv I would just skim through that to find what I want."
Man Like Mobeen,"One of my favourite things to do on vacay is channel surf during down time, bonus points for countries where English is not the primary language. You never know what gems you will find."

Ashes of Love,"I loved her in CollegeHumor's ""Actually Ironic"" Alanis Morissette parody video from like over a decade ago"
Ashes of Love,"I'm shocked that this show had been going on for so long. I knew ""Pokemon"" shows had been on but for whatever reason I just assumed it was like Digimon or something where every few years they shifted focus to new people and a new series. I was blown away to realize that shit I had watched when I was 7 was still following the same protagonist ever since."
Ashes of Love,"[I’ll always remember when I met Veronica Taylor, the original US voice actress. ](https://ibb.co/J3B0jMt)"
Ashes of Love,she made good money
Ashes of Love,If we don’t get to meet his dad before it’s over I won’t accept it.
Ashes of Love,"Me, a grown man who hasn’t watched the Pokémon anime in 20 years: “this SUCKS”"
Ashes of Love,Has Veronica Taylor (original English voice of Ash) made a tweet on this yet?
Ashes of Love,"Meanwhile, Matsumoto Rika(singer of the Original Japanese op theme, and Kamen Rider Ryuki's ""Alive a Life""), the JP VA for Ash/Satoshi will continue being in the franchise, voicing the Master/Owner(who looks suspiciously similar to Ash/Satoshi) of the Cafe the new Protagonists are working part time at.

Edit: I can't seem to find the source of the characters. Maybe it was shut down(or it was fake?! *le gasp*)

Nevertheless, she will continue voicing Ash/Satoshi in the upcoming Pokémon movies featuring him."
Ashes of Love,i wonder if the new main characters will stick around for awhile or only for a couple years like with digimon and yugioh. honestly i’d prefer the latter and would love to see different storylines and spin-offs.
Ashes of Love,"I would imagine the voice actress most fans remember is the original one, Veronica Taylor, who voiced the first 8 seasons. This one, Sarah Natochenny, voiced season 9 to the present, which are the post-zeitgeist seasons"
Ashes of Love,Those residuals for 17 years of voice acting will keep her grandkids well off
Ashes of Love,"Ash returns home, his mom is pregnant and Professor Oak turned his room into his new lab."
Ashes of Love,It's time for Heather Anne Campbell to take the reigns.
Ashes of Love,She is 35 years old. 18 when she started voicing Ash. That's one hell of a run.
Ashes of Love,"They're not killing off Ash really, they're gonna Boruto the shit out of this new anime. So Ash will likely be the new female Protag's father. Judging by her eyes, I'd say Serena is probably the mother."
Ashes of Love,"I saw a TikTok of her reminiscing on her time as the voice of Ash and it was both cool to see her time as a VA for such an iconic character, not to mention the joy she saw on kid's and fan's faces when they either met her or saw videos about her, and sad to see her time coming to an end."
Ashes of Love,Veronica Taylor will always be Ash to me. I could never stand to watch the show after the woman pictured here was hired because I found her voice really unconvincing as a young boy.
Ashes of Love,The original voice from the first seasons is much better
Ashes of Love,Yo she’s kinda fine tho
Ashes of Love,What a hell of a career. Thank you for all the amazing work you did through my childhood!
Ashes of Love,I thought his voice changed many years ago. Definitely sounds way different not then in the beginning. More feminine these days
Ashes of Love,I hate this picture of me but I met her at [Tampa Bay Comic Con](https://i.imgur.com/YO9mITI.jpg) and she was awesome! I’m sure she’d like to move on and do something else though.
Ashes of Love,She’s a good actress
Ashes of Love,Oh so that’s why I always subconsciously wanted to bang ash
Ashes of Love,Veronica Taylor is the one and only Ash in my mind. Dropped the anime as soon as the 4Kids actors got replaced.
Ashes of Love,Her voice as ash really sucked to be honest. He hasn’t been cool for a long time.
Ashes of Love,She’s not even the best voice of Ash.
Ashes of Love,I'm not ready 🥺🥺
Ashes of Love,"I never was super into Pokémon after the first region, but I couldn’t watch it at all once they changed the voice actor the first time round"
Ashes of Love,[deleted]
Ashes of Love,Veronica Taylor from the first few seasons will always be the official voice for me. Hers was much better in my opinion.
Ashes of Love,"Good lord, this show is still making new episodes?  I guess I foolishly assumed during the hiatus after yellow/pinball that the popularity waned long enough that the show wasn't around anymore.

It's so weird how something can basically be unintentionally dead to you after you grow out of it.  I knew there were new games and whatnot, didn't realize that the show continued on."
Ashes of Love,Alright but then why did Ash’s voice completely change when they replaced him with that fucked up doppelgänger?
Ashes of Love,Episode cut's to black... Ash ash can you hear me you've been in a coma for the past 20 years.
Ashes of Love,GOAT
Ashes of Love,"I'm more upset about this than I would be if The Simpsons ended. I still remember getting up early so I could watch Pokémon at, like, 6 a.m. before I had to get ready for school. This sucks, LOL"
Ashes of Love,"~~It’s been 17 years. I’m finding it a little hard to believe that Ash hasn’t said the word “goodbye” yet.~~

##Edit:         
I just realized that they article wasn’t talking about the character. Man I feel dumb. 

Still, I’m finding it a little hard to believe that Sarah Natochenny hasn’t said the word “goodbye” in 17 years. It’s impressive.          
/s"
Ashes of Love,So next pokemon VA for the mc will have a stable job for the next 17 years?
Ashes of Love,She’s so hot. I wish I had her 😢
Ashes of Love,I was not surprised ash would look like that
Ashes of Love,[removed]
Ashes of Love,Will pikachu no longer be the face of the franchise?
Ashes of Love,will miss her
Ashes of Love,Did he get ‘em all?
Ashes of Love,Ash is a babe
Ashes of Love,Wtf I thought it was a dude. But then again Bart Simpson made sense. Man she’s not. Can you imagine?  Mmmmmm
Ashes of Love,YouTube has a video in which she explains how they dub the series into English. https://youtu.be/B35E8QleVhg
Ashes of Love,Her bleep bloop with the CH guys where they play Pokemon games where Pokemon don't actually fight is one of my faves.
Ashes of Love,"Lyrics for the curious:  


An old man turned ninety-eight, he won the lottery and died the next day…of a shock-induced heart attack  
 It’s a black fly in your Chardonnay……poured to celebrate your apartment fumigation  
 It’s a death row pardon two minutes too late…’cause the governor was busy watching Dead Man Walking  
 And isn’t it ironic…don’t you thinkIt’s like rain at a dehydration victim’s funeral  
 It’s a free ride to your bankruptcy trial  
 It’s the good advice to never listen to me  
 Who would’ve thought…it figuresMr. Play It Safe, he was afraid to fly  
 He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids goodbye  
 He’d waited his whole damn life to take that flight  
 And as the plane crashed down he thought  
“Now I’ll never make it to that Fear of Flying seminar”  
And isn’t it ironic…don’t you thinkIt’s like rain flooding an umbrella factory  
 It’s a free ride to an overpriced car dealership  
 It’s the good advice from the guy who just got you fired  
 Who would’ve thought…it figuresA traffic jam when you’re already late…to receive an award for reducing automobile congestion  
 A no-smoking sign on your cigarette break… at the R.J. Reynolds tobacco company  
 It’s like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife…to rob a soup kitchen  
 It’s meeting the man of my dreams, and then meeting his beautiful wife…who’s also my relationship therapist  
 And isn’t it ironic…don’t you think  
 A little too ironic…yeah, I really do think…It’s like rain on your wedding day…to the Egyptian sun god Ra  
 It’s a free ride when you’ve already paid…for a stolen car  
 It’s the good advice someone advised you not to take  
 Who would’ve thought…it figuresI have a funny way of defining rhetorical devices that I use in songs  
 Songs have a funny, funny way of getting things wrong  
 Getting things wrong

Ashes of Love,"Ironic is a meta-joke: nothing she mentions in the song is ironic, which is ironic for a song about irony!"
Ashes of Love,Need to check it out.
Ashes of Love,They kept Ash and shifted focus to new regions where each new game took place.
Ashes of Love,"It is kinda crazy to think about. I haven’t watched it since I was a kid, so idk how it’s been recently - but I imagine Ash probably kinda fell to the background of finding new Pokémon, people, and lands. It felt like it was less about him after the first season, really."
Ashes of Love,"Detective Conan has been trying to solve the same mystery for decades now.

Doraemon still hasn't gotten that Nobita's life on track.

It's fun stuff."
Ashes of Love,"Yeah not too long ago, I heard Ash became champion and thought maybe it was just some one off thing or some comic book. I didn't realize the show was still going on."
Ashes of Love,"Naruto’s been doing that shit too. The show went from them being kids, to adults, to being about *their* kids."
Ashes of Love,"Well it would be anti-climatic if he never ended up doing what he set out from his house to do. Im sure they planned this a few years ago but had a few other stories to tell. It was a nice ending, and as you said well overdue."
Ashes of Love,Just came across this pretty great video where she goes through her process. Definitely felt odd to see Ash voiced! https://youtu.be/B35E8QleVhg
Ashes of Love,"The classic episodes are still on Netflix. Going back and watching them, it's jarring to see the difference between then and now on what the show was like."
Ashes of Love,[Wait until you find out why fire red was called fire red](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhjZhyzW2g)
Ashes of Love,You mean that motherfucker still doesn’t have all of them? He doesn’t deserve anybody watching at this point.
Ashes of Love,I’m so tempted to try to watch the rest of the series but that’s a LOT of episodes
Ashes of Love,Once they switched I stopped watching
Ashes of Love,I met her at a con a few years ago. She was really nice and we talked for a bit about the classic episodes. She still goes to cons every now and then.
Ashes of Love,That's a cool cosplay
Ashes of Love,She's a really lovely person.
Ashes of Love,Wonder what she actually made through all those years
Ashes of Love,"Definitely good money, but this'll be the end of the line, I bet. Voice actors for foreign programs aren't entitled to residuals. Otherwise the actors in *every* language would be entitled to some and it'd be a huge mess. 

Somewhat on the subject, this was actually a major issue during the dubbing of the Digimon movie. For those who don't know, the ""Digimon Movie"" wasn't actually a movie. It was a collection of three separate short films that were all cut together and merged into one ""film"" because Fox wanted to capitalize on the Pokemon hype train with a movie of their own. However, there *were* no feature-length Digimon movies. So the result was a huge mess.

SAG actually got into a major dispute with the studio over this. As mentioned, voice actors of foreign programs are not entitled to residuals for their work. However, SAG argued that by combining three separate films into one new movie, the studio altered so much of the story and dialogue that it qualified as an original film. And they won. I've honestly never heard of anything like this before or since."
Ashes of Love,Mr Mime was in the first episode I believe my dude
Ashes of Love,Bro he went back at the end credits and found Butterfree we gotta be grateful for that.
Ashes of Love,Everyone knows that Ash' dad is President Zelensky of Ukraine.
Ashes of Love,"Didn't the manga go the ""It was Giovanni and that's why he was never around"" route decades ago?  Do people not head canon that anymore, 20 years removed from the theory?"
Ashes of Love,"Ikr the longest run of ""How i met your father"""
Ashes of Love,I’m of the mind that Giovanni is his father.
Ashes of Love,Yes. She posted a video doing the voice of Ash reflecting on his journey.
Ashes of Love,[removed]
Ashes of Love,Where can I find some art of this? Been looking around
Ashes of Love,Link?
Ashes of Love,Maybe most fans of a certain age but one did it 7 years and the other 17. Pokemon never left the zeitgeist for kids.
Ashes of Love,Maybe post *anime*-zeitgeist. Pokemon may not have tons of tv commercials anymore but you do remember that a lot of stores had to stop selling pokemon cards because people were getting into fist fights over them *in the past two years* right?
Ashes of Love,">	post-zeitgeist 

The latest games continue the tradition of breaking the previous’ sales, with Gen 9 being the highest selling Pokémon game. Pokémon never left the zeitgeist."
Ashes of Love,"Yeah I only really remember the first voice, since I started watching the show right as it aired in the US for the first time. I don't think I could identify the new voice out of lineup even after having seen some newer episodes, but I'll always recognize the original."
Ashes of Love,The majority of people who have watched the show in the past 15 or so years think of Natochenny when they think of Ash.
Ashes of Love,"What bugs me is, after a few google searches, I've never seen Sarah acknowledge Veronica in any way. I get real Sean ""I'm Goku and no one else"" Schemmel vibes from her."
Ashes of Love,"> voiced season 9 to the present, which are the post-zeitgeist seasons

Pokémon has peaked and dipped. It has been zeitgeisty many times. You just think your peak was the main peak."
Ashes of Love,Ahhhh okay
Ashes of Love,And some people wont remember the moment Meowths voice changed! that messed with me
Ashes of Love,I'm feeling old because she's still the new voice to me.
Ashes of Love,"Yeah Pokemania in the 90s from Gen 1 to 2 was the peak of Pokemon popularity, particularly with the anime in the US.

Since that initial dip in the 2000s its been relatively consistent in popularity until recent years.

I think Pokemon Go, Sword and Shield and now Scarlet and Violet has helped Pokemon hit the highs that it did in the 90s. At least in game sales. But not sure if thats true with the anime in the US as well."
Ashes of Love,"Pokémon is the biggest grossing franchise of all time. It beats Star Wars, Harry Potter, Marvel, etc.

Want to know number 2? Hello Kitty"
Ashes of Love,"Pokémon is a non-union gig, would they even get residuals?"
Ashes of Love,She also works as a video editor. I don’t get the impression that she’s doing THAT well
Ashes of Love,And his son is a Mr. Mime hybrid of Ash
Ashes of Love,Came here to comment this. She can also bring the Resident Evil 4 merchant for guest appearances.
Ashes of Love,"I really don't think they're going to do a 20+ year timeskip. If they wanted to bring back literally any character, they'd have to come up with a new design for them, and there are hundreds of relevant characters at this point. They'd have to consider whether every single Pokemon would have evolved or been retired by that point too. And do you want Team Rocket to be in their 50s? Most of the professors would be retired or dead. The latest series really showed what you can do with the wider Pokemon world. I don't think they're going to shut the door on that concept or completely revamp it."
Ashes of Love,The rule 34 was right
Ashes of Love,They're not going to retire Ash because the American voice actress is retiring. Pokemon is produced in Japan.
Ashes of Love,I have not kept up with the anime at all. Are Ash and Serena a thing? What happened to Misty?
Ashes of Love,[removed]
Beck,"The writers: ""so you want the Dexter ending, got it"""
Beck,"He's needed what was coming to him since season two at least, let's be honest."
Beck,"Jfc, if Joe doesn’t get what’s coming to him, imma be ticked off. 

His character makes me so mad. I know Penn is tired of Joe, but he plays him so well.. there is a look that Joe has that just crawls under my skin."
Beck,Penn is tired of being joe
Beck,"You know you’re so over work shit when even the bags 💰💰 don’t matter anymore (I wish I had that problem, lol)."
Beck,"Honestly it’s getting more and more ridiculous how Joe keeps getting away with everything.  The plot is having to twist itself into more and more pretzels.  And everyone else has to be written as stupid constantly.

Also the characters in Season 4 weren’t a good/interesting as in previous seasons either imo."
Beck,"It’s hilarious to me how everyone just falls in love with Joe even though he’s shady AF and kinda boring without the inner dialogue. Also, no one recognizes him when he wears a hat. It’s a freaking hat, not a mask! Either way, his way of life cannot last very long. He needs to get what’s coming to him eventually."
Beck,"They made a huge mistake by >!killing off Victoria Pederetti's Love!< in Season 3. That dynamic between the two of them could have been stretched over two more seasons and they let that opportunity go.

I liked the first half of season 4 but the second half was a mess. They made so many non sensical choices."
Beck,I liked it
Beck,What’s about the piss jar?
Beck,[deleted]
Beck,"I don't want Joe to win, but I also don't want his downfall to come out of nowhere, exactly like in this season >!Nadia suspected of him out of the hat!< because the plot required so.

He's an incredibly clever individual, has a sharp criminal and anaytical mind, and now is more deranged than ever because he's embraced his more psycho aspect rather than the empathetic one. He is dangerous, and now has endless resources to act as he wills.

He'll fall, but the person (or people) who will take him down will need to do so because they proved themselves to be as smart or more, have a good plan and not just get OP because the plot required him to be defeated. He needs to face his nemesis in this season, an anti-Joe, it's the only way his demise will pay off the fans."
Beck,Wait I thought this season is supposed  to be the last. What happened?
Beck,"Considering 'You' is an almost-sequel to 'Gossip Girl', I wonder what show they will make for Penn to play a creeper in next."
Beck,"This could have been great if it was just one season, adding a wife and baby was the most moronic shit I have ever seen."
Beck,I liked most of season 4 except for the last episode or two. It seems like they just no idea what direction to take it in
Beck,"I tried to watch Season 4 with my GF and this show needs a B plot. Joe cant carry the whole thing. He needs more interactions with that female student, she’s good"
Beck,I really hope that it would be the last too. I feel like the move of splitting this season into 2 parts didn't work either. Maybe they wanted the audience to theorize and stuff about the whodunnit but the payoff was not worth it at all.
Beck,The newest season was fucking terrible. I couldn’t even finish it :(
Beck,why is everyone so afraid of letting a bad guy win for once
Beck,"Just finished season 4 and ugh, worse than season 3. Easily gets away with shit done in broad daylight and some lame twists."
Beck,I couldn’t finish season 4 after 4 episodes.
Beck,"Sounds like they have a plan and knows how the show should end. I hope Netflix listens and gives them a fifth and final season, rather than pushing for more. 'You' deserves a good ending while the show is still good


Considering where season 4 ended, I think they can squeeze out 10 more good episodes of Joe... joe'ing his way through love, murders and mayhem. Anything beyond a 5th season would probably end up feeling tired and repetitive"
Beck,Should’ve stopped at season 1
Beck,AGREED.
Beck,So can anyone explain why Kaye is perfectly fine being with a serial killer?
Beck,Plus the show gets worse with every season
Beck,I wanted season 3 to be the last.
Beck,"Season 4, at least the first part has been the best since season 1. Season 3 was clearly quite weak"
Beck,He hates this show. Every interview he gives his disdain for the character and everything around it is so palpable
Beck,"I’m about to be done with season 4, so I’m not really reading most of these posts. While I don’t like Joe, any hope of “redemption” is out the window when I look back and remember he straight up murdered that woman in the first season."
Beck,Can I stop at Season 3 or 1 as series finale?
Beck,"US shows that star a vilain always end with them getting punished. I get why, but this certainty has become lazily redundant."
Beck,"Honestly, S4 is dreadful when compared to the first three seasons and it’s well and truly gone beyond suspension of disbelief. S4 should have been the last."
Beck,"There's going to be *another* season??? I thought 4 was the wrap. I forgave many things in those last 3 episodes just because i was convinced it would be ending.

I have no desire to see Joe/Love redux. I'm out."
Beck,Season 4 was the best season yet! Love this show.
Beck,Honestly couldn't even really finish the third season. Not even sure if I made it halfway... Saw previews for the fourth and thought wow the same bullshit...
Beck,Been watching the new season and near the end and disappointed as I liked the first half they released. I was like really....Mr. Robot vibes and not feeling creative.
Beck,"Wtf kinda spoiler bullshit is this 

I got 2 episodes left of this season. Not everyone watches the entire show the day it's released.

God damn"
Beck,They've been trying to make Joe look good by having him run into people crazier than him and making him out to be some kind of Dexter. He's a creepy serial killer that preys on women.
Beck,Yeah 5 season of the same shit. I'll say 1st season was suspenseful. After that it's just a money grab.
Beck,"The way this show treats this horrible monster of a protagonist is just gross at this point. It’s not remotely self aware. They will continue to milk the sexual intrigue and glamour as long as they can, go deeper into cartoonish depictions of mental illness, yeah. I have never understood how people enjoy this show, it’s like a trashy soap opera/reality TV/true crime hybrid."
Beck,Unpopular opinion : This season is TRASH .
Beck,What do you mean? I never said that!
Beck,Can't believe Netflix granted a final season for this show when it has a perfect ending in Season 4.
Beck,Isn't he like a pedo or smtn how is he still like staring in a show
Beck,"I was very relieved that that one person survived, but how is she going on with her life knowing that young lady that helped save her is locked up in prison for things Joe did???"
Beck,I wish I still had Netflix 😢
Beck,Love the show but yeah it should probably end next season with Joe seeing the chickens come home to roost.
Beck,Are they making 5?
Beck,And so he can play Reed Richards in the MCU
Beck,God damn it!! Articles like this spoil the fact that he doesn’t die at the end of S4!!!!!
Beck,not watched the 2nd half yet but I thought this was gonna be the last season...that maybe he was moving on to errr bigger things like possibly fantastic 4
Beck,"Didn’t they say 4 would be the last?!? I’m in shock. But yeah, the way Joe won and got his “dream” & “love” happy ending left me unsatisfied. Joe does need to get what’s coming to him and I hope Marianne is the one to serve it to him on a silver platter."
Beck,HE CAN’T KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH IT!!!
Beck,It's time
Beck,Which Dexter ending?
Beck,"I mean he's needed what's coming to him since season 1.

This season has kinda just taken away the allure of Joe I guess."
Beck,>!I think a lot of the twist this season was a way of reminding folks Joe is the bad guy.  Spent so much of the season acting like the hero and thinking he was trying to save lives and then BOOM.!<
Beck,"The impression that I got from reading the article is that he's actually pushing for another season, which has not been confirmed yet. Did you gather something else from the article?

Second paragraph:

*""It feels to me like we need to do another season. It feels to me like Joe needs to get what’s coming to him, and now he has further to fall because he has all this power and wealth,” Badgley said. “But of course, that’s not up to me. I don’t know where it’s going. But to me, with this concept and with this character, we always wanted to be responsible and it’s not just the kind of thing we can let keep going because it’s doing well.”*"
Beck,[deleted]
Beck,Does this add to the rumours of him being cast as Reed  Richards?
Beck,"Which is fair. 

Season one was great when he was a villain but then the show decided “wait, what if we just keep sticking him with worse and worse people so he can be our protagonist”. It’s so stupid and kills the whole point of the show."
Beck,He's may have signed a 7 season deal though so he may not have much choice.
Beck,"Yeah, he probably makes more in a year than most Americans make in their life."
Beck,Yeah. >!he's managed to find two separate women who can basically buy off the entire police department for a city who also have no qualms about dating someone like him. It's absurd at this point.!<
Beck,Penn Badgley said a few years ago that the show was about how far people will go to forgive an evil white man
Beck,"Will probably get downvoted hard (I know there’s a lot of fans of her out there) but her character started to get on my nerves in season 3 and I felt it was a blessing to have her killed off. I think season 4 should have been last, especially when >!Joe jumped in the water!<"
Beck,The show should have wrapped up there.
Beck,I was hoping he died and she became the protagonist. Would be a cool twist.
Beck,"they seemed terrifed to change the status quo.

But going from the lead being a stalker dude
to him and his murderous wife dealing with shit  would be a great move"
Beck,"Loved the first half of season 4, hating the second"
Beck,Yeah the ending was pretty disappointing
Beck,"Show was definitely fraying bad this season. Is 5 just going to be 3 all over again, or...? 

He can't keep getting away with it!"
Beck,I feel like >!rhys!< could fill that role pretty well
Beck,Agreed and honestly not creative to me. I was immediately like wtf the plot foundation regarding his mental health like Mr Robot.
Beck,Yes! It was super bizarre and the two sections didn’t make sense as a whole.
Beck,Me too! I know it gets difficult to continue a story when the main actors or creators are just burnt out. But I’m here for it whatever they do and hope they keep going for more than one more season. I love this show.
Beck,"I like season 4. Good change in direction, the whole murder mystery angle freshen it up. It just needed the writers to tighten up the plot holes and it would have been so much better."
Beck,"The fight club twist in s4 upset me, like poor writing to a pretty well written show"
Beck,"True. People want everything to be sunshines and roses, they want the cliché ‘happy ending’ where the bad guy finally gets what’s coming to him and all the people he wronged (the ones still alive at least) get redemption. But that’s the thing, in real life sometimes (maybe a lot of times), the bad guy gets away with it and comes out looking like the hero, or the victim. It’d be interesting to see a show where they actually parallel reality for once and stop pretending the bad guy always gets caught in the end.. because most times, they fucking don’t. And it sucks, but that’s the harsh reality."
Beck,Yeah I felt it was very weak as well.
Beck,"The second half is a little better. It solved the problems of the first half while creating new, different problems and potholes."
Beck,"Same.

I just went and watched the YT channel ‘The Recaps’ to finish off the season, summarized."
Beck,SAME! I even tried to go back for the first episode of season 4 and couldn’t get into it.. my coworkers said the same thing
Beck,"At this point, I suspect the plan for season five is “back a money truck into Jenna Ortega’s driveway and have her come back to be the one who kills Joe.”"
Beck,Fr would have been great as a limited series. But Netflix gotta Netflix and milk the cash cow until it runs dry. You can only write so many clueless idiots until it gets boring
Beck,because she's a weirdo
Beck,Because of her own past she feels like she is just as bad as he is
Beck,Seems like they are gonna build her up as another Love
Beck,you can hate the character without hating the show. it would be weird it anyone playing Joe didn't hate the character
Beck,Did you miss all his other murders
Beck,Which one?
Beck,Like Ozarks?
Beck,[deleted]
Beck,"It would be better if it ended here. Sometimes the villain wins, that’s just how life is"
Beck,You have to finish season 4
Beck,"You just list three genres that a very large and devoted population of the United States adore. 
If you went to pitch a show and said it’s a trashy soap mixed with reality mixed with true crime all the investors would hear is a “cha-Ching”."
Beck,"I feel like season 4 was very self aware. 
It did the about face at the end that joe was the killer regardless of him being unaware. 

It really was a way to show viewers he is just a murderer. 
There’s no absolution for that."
Beck,worse than S2?  Hoo-boy..
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,"Although the standalone episodes were really good, it's a shame that Zazie (and the rest of the main cast) had so little screen time this season. She was excellent in the finale."
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,"Bernthal has been great so far in WOTC, but he was on another level here."
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,Zazie is a fantastic actress and I'm glad she's getting so many good roles.
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,"I've really been enjoying Barry S3. Sarah was fantastic last episode, especially in that monologue."
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,Proud of Drag Race being recognized in this list!
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,Haven’t seen the new Atlanta or Barry yet but can confirm Jinkx is a national treasure and I think she’s going to be overlooked and win Drag Race AGAIN!
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,I'll never look at a baguette the same way.
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,"Sarah Goldberg shoutout, yes! I'm so glad Barry's been renewed for a 4th season"
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,Sarah Goldberg has been phenomenal in this latest season of Barry.
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,"Beetz really showed her talent in this last episode. A lot was asked of her as actress in this one and she really pulled it off. Very deserving as performer of the week.

It was a weird season of Atlanta but not a bad one imo. Every episode was really interesting imo."
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,This was a weird ass season. I dunno I wasn't dying to go watch.
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,Susan Kelechi Watson finally deserving the shoutout she deserves
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,Limiting the main roles made this season somewhat shitty
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,Seems like these lists consistently ignore Better Call Saul. Rhea Seehorn it as good as anything else there is on tv.
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,"I love the first couple episodes of we own the night so far, I just wish it was a little more focused on Bernthal's character. I'm not up to date so maybe in the next episodes it will focus on him more. I dunno if going back to Baltimore David Simon felt like he needed to do almost a Wire sequel, but from what I've watched so far I feel like it def could be even better than it is if it was more focused like his past few projects."
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,Love Zazie. Domino miniseries on Disney+ when?
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,"Jon Bernthal seems to get typecasted  now, all i can see is his Punisher Character that lives in an alternate universe. 
Even his mannerisms are always the same."
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,Anyone else notice the cast of Atlanta never appears in the most controversial episodes?
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,She's adorable.
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,W Zazie her fake french accent was really nice
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,She’s my tv wife
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,Her accent was absolutely horrible
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,"I think they had about 1 episode each, with some mixing in between.

I know they postponed Atlanta because the actors weren’t available, maybe they limit their roles for that reason"
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,Absolutely.  I just wish I would've known before the season that half the episodes would be standalones that don't feature the core four cast members.
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,"I really hope the final season features all of them in the majority of or all of the episodes. I don’t mind the anthology episodes either, I enjoyed all but one, but waiting years for them to come back with half of a season of Atlanta and half of what felt like a sort of spinoff kind of sucked. I know my expectations were super high because of s2, but Donald saying this would be The Sopranos levels is also weird to me when pretty much every episode could’ve been just a standalone ep. I think it was the weakest season of the show so far."
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,I was still a great season but it is kinda wild we really only got one episode each of the main cast considering it took something like three years to come out. It has to have been one of the most impossible to make shows if they had to essentially make it an anthology series and it was still so difficult. I know Donald Glover is the busiest man in Hollywood but still.
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,"""You robbed a midget stripper?""

""C'mon, don't put it like that, man."""
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,He was born to play a son of a bitch cop
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,IT'S WAYNE JENKINS DAY
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,Can’t recommend the movie Nine Days enough!
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,It rivaled her monologue from last season sitting by the pool. She’s an excellent actor.
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,Yeah I think that episode was the first time I actually liked her and appreciated how great an actress she is. She's been a bit annoying and oblivious before but I think this was a great turn for her and her character.
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,"Yeah I'm probably in the minority, but I didn't really like Barry season 2 all that much, but man I'm absolutely loving this season."
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,"Jinkx Monsoon's performance as Judy Garland in this week's *Snatch Game* was quite possibly the best impersonation-based performance anyone in the show has ever done with only Ben DeLaCreme's one-two punch as Dame Maggie Smith & Paul Lynde even coming close to it. They even called back to Dave the Marine's famous ""I think I might have killed Judy Garland"" moment in season five!"
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,Same here. Huge letdown from the past 2 seasons
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,"Felt the same, but at least with this season's direction I can have tempered expectations for the final season."
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,yuup
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,What are you talking about? Yes the series is a little convoluted because it keeps jumping Back and forward. But i finaly see Berenthal in a role for him(Never cared for him as an actor. All i have seen from him is acting like a Gorilla)
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,He did do great in “King Richard” a complete 180 from the roles he usually plays
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,Controversial to who?
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,"I wish I had known before too so I could temper expectations. I thought this season was good, just not want I wanted or expected."
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,what exactly is not clear?
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,"nice tip, gota check it out at the next opportunity."
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,"What the fuck, doesn't Nancy Pelosi have some shit to do"
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,"LMAO, I'm more excited about Cameron Diaz than Naomi or Pelosi..."
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,when AOC did she tried to glam herself up but Nancy just looks the same as she always does
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,"ITT:  Conservatives offended that Nancy Pelosi might taint a drag competition with liberal values.

The irony pains me."
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,"Yo! California, when we waking up?"
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,Pelosi and Ronan Farrow fucking kill me
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,"I don't know if I personally would have chosen Pelosi to be on the show, but the show is pretty political at times and isn't the first time a member of congress has been on the show."
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,Neolib moment
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,Shes a sack of shit. A traitor to her own country.
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,"Earning the votes of one's district through shallow PR appearances is some of the shit she, and every other politician, has to do.  Nancy Pelosi's district is San Francisco.  

Get it now?

We don't complain when rural politicians appear at farm shows.  A San Franciscan politician appearing at a drag show is little different."
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,Me too!!
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,I want to see Bernie in drag
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,"Yeah, this is the second time Nancy Pelosi did an appearance."
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,You sound exactly like the people who tried to violently overthrow the government.
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,Only if he wears bedazzled mittens.
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,BABAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! That would be amazing.
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,AOC was on season 12.
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,"Nah man. I just watch financials. 3 hedge funds beat the S&P 500 last year. Nancy Pelosi beat it 3 times over insider trading through her husband firm. She used data from government briefings to make millions off Americans struggling. Shes a public servant. Instead instead of doin thier job both Democrats and Republicans are playing the American people against each other and laughing as they get rich. 

Just like big banks collected record break overdraft fees from Americans already struggling. We The People does mean anything anymore. We are a country run by the banks. Thomas Jefferson warns the people not to let banks do what they do now because they would supercede the people. Thats exactly what has happened. 

No threats of violence from me. Just want my country to stop drinking the Kool Aid and wake up. The fighting each other has to stop. Thats the power of propaganda.

Fact check everything I said here. 💯"
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,"Grant looked like he was have a grand old time with his costume. The way he was swishing about his cape for dramatic effect. If can you steal a Loki scene from Hiddleston, that's no mean feat. And he did it."
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,"Richard E Grant was a good Classic Loki. Side note, do they even try with these lists?"
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,"We’re forgetting about Richard E. Grant’s best role - as the gay ex-husband of Edina Monsoon in Absolutely Fabulous.

RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,It’s absurd how good justice smith is
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,This performance fails in comparison to Hudson Hawk! Grant “Bunny ball ball”!
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,"I’ve never heard of these performance of the week things, but everyone here absolutely slayed"
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,That cape swoop/laugh/collapse into the chair  was amazing!
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,"His final scene was great as well. Just the way he’s in tears as he laughs at the end, you could tell he almost welcomes it."
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,"Of course they're not ""trying"". These lists are paid marketing. Also having a ""performer of the week"" is an idiotic concept."
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,As in?
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,His best role is clearly Withnail. By epic margins.
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,"It is too bad he didn't get more scenes, there was definitely dramatic material to work with:

RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,ill ban them... for money.
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,"I'm happy the show will get the exposure of Showtime, but it is a bit taxing on fans. We're supposed to watch on cable, subscribe/watch on WoW Presents, and now subscribe/watch on Showtime. That just encourages piracy honestly."
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,"I find it very interesting that Showtime has ended or about to end some of their biggest shows in Ray Donovan, Homeland and Shameless and now this is something they're trying out."
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,Big white tits
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,Wish this show would disappear.....lol
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,Why

RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,"This is one of those ""duh"" renewals. "
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,What makes this announcement hilarious is that they literally just finished filming this a few days ago. The Nancy Drew's over on /r/SpoiledDragRace & /r/rupaulsdragrace have had the filming dates and cast figured out for a couple months now. Same for S11 of the main show. 
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,I always wondered about this show.  Is it drag queens in sports cars?  Or it just Lypsinka crap?
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,Weeerrrrkkkk
RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,They even already finished filming it and RuPaul mentioned it on his podcast a month ago

RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars,Why is it garbage?
Ugly Duckling,"Ooh this seems like a toughie, I'll check the TV tracker I'm on"
Ugly Duckling,"Agents of Shield was pretty terrible the first half season, but it found its stride.  I am hoping the same for Supergirl."
Ugly Duckling,"I am enjoying it so far. Super cheesy and awkwardly written at times, but it's fun.

So I strongly disagree with your 'not worth watching' verdict."
Ugly Duckling,"A very nice summation of the show in my opinion. I am really hoping they can turn a new leaf in the latter half of the season and break from the mold they've been recasting so far, but I don't think it's likely. The writing doesn't indicate anything new will happen at any point. I find myself most frustrated with how frequently they compare Kara to Clark, but there are plenty of other frustrations to have as well. They could still certainly make a good show out of the pieces they have so far, but it'd take some really inspired choices from the folks behind the scenes to make Benoist shine to her full potential."
Ugly Duckling,"I liked your review on You're the worst, its one of the best shows on tv right now. I tried to like Supergirl I really did, but it's just awful. Especially with a lot of high quality superhero shows out at the moment. "
Ugly Duckling,"I'm still surprised this is a CBS program.  If it were on CW it could have the opportunity to redefine some of the tropes of the superhero genre, maybe even push for more female superhero led shows/movies.

However it's so formulaic you can break its faults down without really seeing it.  Maybe it can break the mold it's made like Agents of SHIELD and even Gotham did, but it seems like major network shows don't realize or appreciate what makes superhero shows intriguing."
Ugly Duckling,"Well this is the Internet, so I'm obligated to get into an argument and tell you that you're so wrong. 

Jokes, to each his own. I'm glad you enjoy it so far :)"
Ugly Duckling,Thanks! It really was disappointing b/c the show has potential but seems satisfied with taking a very safe approach. So bland. I had no desire to keep watching past the first few episodes.
Ugly Duckling,"Haha, sorry if my comment came off a little short. Wrote a longer one but accidentally purged it and so left a much briefer one! 

The long and the short of it is that I do agree with a few if your points but see a lot of potential in it!"
Ugly Duckling,Oh not at all it was a polite disagreement!
Shtisel,"Something about this title sounds like Pootie Tang.

Who by Fire: Leonard Cohen in the Sinai, I'm going to sine your pitty on the runny kine!"
Shtisel,Neat
Shtisel,"I discovered this tv show only 3 weeks ago and I have binged the first two seasons. It is so good and beautiful, never would I thought I'll be this interested of the lives of orthodox jews"
Shtisel,Yay!!  I thought it was over!
Shtisel,"On a side note, you can watch Baker and the beauty if you want some rom com drama in your lives. Very well made show with some classic rom com tropes, yet dealing with few serious topics as well."
Shtisel,Which version?
Shtisel,Israeli one
Shtisel,Thanks!
Shtisel,"Everybody Hates Chris was a great show, but this just seems lazy :("
Shtisel,there are a lot of interesting titles in that article
Shtisel,"Shtisel is pretty good, I wondeer what Panther Baby is like. Anyone watch?"
Shtisel,Lazy as in it's an easy way to pander and put black people in animation for inclusion points
Shtisel,"It’s interesting that that’s not at all what the original program of Shtisel is about. Sounds like a basic CBS simplification of plot to hit that lowest common denominator in the market. 

Star-crossed lovers is such a basic trope."
Shtisel,"This show is AMAZING and I highly recommend it as an Orthodox Jew (though an American one, and from a somewhat less insular community) and also just as a TV fan. It's entertaining, dramatic, funny, and often even heartwarming, and it treats its subjects with a tremendous amount of respect while also utilizing their unique setting for storylines. But as very different as their lifestyle is from a ""normal"" Western one (and I've been codeswitching between the two my whole life), the emotions are all quite universal even if manifested differently. 

I do want to point out that neither cousin nor extremely young teen marriage are typical. It's definitely just added to the show for dramatic effect."
Shtisel,[removed]
Shtisel,[removed]
Shtisel,Yeah Shtisel is great. Another reason I prefer Netflix over Disney
Shtisel,Which scene did you gasp at? I love the show
Shtisel,Do you have any other dramadies you would recommend? Or something very realistic?
Shtisel,The scene where the father paints over the painting's hair to cover it. That scene was so deeply moving to me.
Shtisel,Such a great show!!!! cant stop watching
Shtisel,Highly recommend. It’s extremely interesting!
Shtisel,Where the hell is the article? I see a synopsis.
Shtisel,"This article is paternalistic garbage.

It arbitrarily picks *Seinfeld* as a ""high point"" of Jewish comedy, and then uses this unearned distinction to pick apart the lack of Jewish focus?

It dismisses *Marvelous Ms. Maisel*, which is arguably a love letter to New York Jewish society of the 50s, because it's lead isn't Jewish despite a *deep bench* of accomplished Jewish talent both on camera and behind the scenes?

Lastly, it attacks the very idea of non-jewish playing Jews as ""an exception"" to casting authenticity pressures while being amazingly ignorant that the whole point is that black/gay/trans actors are being actively crowded out of media by being relegated to ""their"" type of characters, who are then split with more conventional actors on top of it. Jewish actors are welcomed into play many types of roles, which *does in fact* take off the pressure to always cast authentic Jews as Jewish characters.

Ok, done kvetching for a while. But garbage."
Shtisel,"I have to say the basic premise that we don't see Jewish people on television is pretty laughable. 

Curb your enthusiasm, the marvelous Mrs Maisel, The Goldberg's, and Seinfeld are just off the top of my head, there are tons more."
Shtisel,"I've just watched the documentary and it does highlight a lot of problems with anti-Semitism in modern society that are legitimate, if not exactly original. However I had a major problem with how it downplayed a lot of other equality issues.

Like, the whole thing where Baddiel brings up that they are expected to take responsibility for Israel as something that Muslims have no point of comparison for. While Muslims are expected to take responsibility for everything from grooming gangs to the 7/7 bombings. 

Or like he seems to think that whitewashing casting is a thing of the past for other ethnicities or that disabled actors aren't struggling when able-bodied actors are cast as disabled people.

Its irritating watching him condemn every other progressive cause as excluding Jewish people while sidelining the very contemporary discrimination that other people suffer. He didn't even touch on transphobia in liberal organisations.

Then they roll out David Schwimmer and do lip-service to the fact that Friends was terrible at ethnic diversity, and that the Jewish Representation was sort of there but is left out of the conversation. But they don't talk about how all the casual homophobia on Friends?

I'm not saying every social justice documentary needs to talk about everything. But Baddiel should have been a lot more careful about representing other oppressed people, given the general message of this documentary is that progressives don't care enough about anti-Semitism."
Shtisel,"Always funny to see someone that was [happy to do black up multiple times](https://youtu.be/BhHq4m_Bi5g?t=116) moan about fair representation on screen.

https://news.yahoo.com/violated-many-levels-jason-lee-113825432.html"
Shtisel,David baddiel cries anti-semitism at everything these days. Might take him more seriously if he tries properly to make amends for his black face in the 90s
Shtisel,"From the article:

>	The high point is probably Seinfeld, but it’s hard to say exactly what’s so Jewish about Seinfeld, beyond Jerry himself being Jewish. Arguably, it’s less that and more to do with New York, and with endless discussions about the tiny details of life, described once by producer Larry Charles as “a dark Talmud”.

EVERYTHING about Seinfeld is Jewish. Arguing is a part of Jewishness. They meet at a Deli. NYC is Jewish. George, who’s not a Jew, is Jewish. Elaine, who’s not a Jew, is Jewish. Kramer is the Shabbos goy of the bunch.

That’s the point of “dark Talmud” - we have a mandate as Jews to debate. So even if this article agreed with everything I say, I’d still find a way to pick something apart. My mother taught me this."
Shtisel,"I saw the advert for this and felt the premise was extremely presumptuous. There are no completely unacceptable forms of racism, and Baddiel himself has an anti-Black past."
Shtisel,"Cashed in on being English as fuck, now cashing in on being Jewish.

Bet he don't talk about cashing in on doing blackface though..."
Shtisel,"Go watch Shtisel, great show. Shababnikim is also nice"
Shtisel,Funny how two out of three people I saw on the trailer for this including the creator have done black face
Shtisel,[deleted]
Shtisel,Can’t be worse than how TV always portrays cleft lip people. They are always the villains… rapist and child molesters with the exception of Joaquin Phoenix.
Shtisel,I went to his show just a few months ago and it really just amounted to jealousy of black people being treated with sympathy.
Shtisel,Not to mention Badiels past of appearing in black face.
Shtisel,"Jewish people are so well represented on TV that when I was growing up as a Jewish kid, I never even realized how much of a minority we were in the general population, because so much of what I watched seemed to have Jewish representation in one form or another."
Shtisel,"According to the article, not Jewish enough apparently, or in the case of Mrs Maisel, the actress isn't Jewish."
Shtisel,*The Patient* and *Fleishman Is In Trouble* are two very recent examples.
Shtisel,"Jews are the most overrepresented demographic on tv and in film by far, it's not even close."
Shtisel,"Nearer him, Hapless. https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/oct/24/will-this-quirky-sitcom-be-the-uk-answer-to-curb-your-enthusiasm"
Shtisel,"He's apologised to Lee in person after 25 years. As part of his tv show about how antisemitism is a special kind of racist...  

(Sponsored by Ford)"
Shtisel,It's apparently in this documentary where he says he's very sorry and tells Jason Lee he thought he was a brilliant footballer. Conveniently enough.
Shtisel,"No, no and no."
Shtisel,What?
Shtisel,Seeing him of all people saying that some types of racism are dismissed is actually mind boggling to me
Shtisel,"Right? Like, that's not a problem for us. I don't have to be mad about Michael Fassbender playing a Jewish magneto when half the Avengers are Jewish actors playing non-jewish roles. Working Jewish actors are doing okay as is.

But when Idris Elba is ""too urban"" to play James Bond and Laverne Cox doesn't get cis character roles, they have a much better argument for authentic casting than we do."
Shtisel,"I really enjoyed what the Jewish element brought to The Patient. The ending sucked, but the story was really interesting and the conflict between orthodox and just the mother who sang Jewish songs was one of the more interesting aspects. There was a parallel to him and those in a prison camp too. Shame it didn’t knock it out the park, but was decent.

I don’t feel like Jewish life is under represented at all, but it’s still nice to explore it. There are lots of types of families and cultures to explore in the world, you mainly see (American) Catholics, Italian, Jewish and black."
Shtisel,"I’m saying, Jews can sometimes be portrayed shitty on tv but not like how bad cleft people are portrayed."
Shtisel,">But when Idris Elba is ""too urban"" to play James Bond 

Is this an actual quote from someone? Any time this idea comes up it's always fans clamouring for Elba, the producers saying they'd love to cast him and Idris saying he's never had any desire to play James Bond."
Shtisel,"The Patient felt like an actual Jewish story because there is  actual cultural tension between Orthodox and Reform/Conservative jews and it added meaning to the main story. 
Transparent is probably the most Reform Jewish show ever.
Admittedly Mrs.Maisel doesn't hit right for me- sure she talks a lot about making briskets, but her complete obliviousness to civil rights or like hiring/housing discrimination in the 1960s drives me nuts!"
Shtisel,https://time.com/4018556/anthony-horowitz-idris-elba-james-bond/
Shtisel,"Midge Maisel, besides her involvement in the very Jewish comedy circuit, is embodying the mostly-forgotten archetype of ""the Jewish Princess."" Upper middle class to upper class, materialistic and pop-culture savvy, not especially interested in ethnic or religious tradition or history beyond a superficial level, somewhat apolitical, thoroughly Americanized and ""white"" despite her parents being much more entrenched in a lived traditional Jewish experience.

Remember that it's been over a century since the Jewish diaspora hit America in its biggest wave, and nearly a hundred years since the Holocaust. Jewish culture in America has become extremely secularized and mainstreamed, so the notion of ""Jewish girl behaving like a white girl"" doesn't really hold water anymore as a character archetype. But you get a lot of Jewish Princess jokes in the earlier works of Mel Brooks, Allan Sherman, Neil Simon (whose distinctive style is aped STRONGLY by Mrs. Maisel), etc."
Shtisel,"Thanks, hadn't heard that before. Thankfully the writer seems to be pretty much alone on that and not in any position to influence casting.

>“For me, Idris Elba is a bit too rough to play the part. It’s not a color issue. I think he is probably a bit too ‘street’ for Bond. Is it a question of being suave? Yeah.”

I'm not sure exactly what 'street' means it sounds like he doesn't understand the difference between Stringer Bell and Idris Elba!"
Shtisel,"Oh lol like literally the princess in Spaceballs? I guess that was what he was doing. I loved that movie, even though I had never met or heard of many Jews. And I hadn’t seen Star Wars."
Shtisel,"Yes, the Drewish Princess is a pun on “Jewish Princess.”"
Shtisel,The writer of the article distinguishes orthodox from hasidic. What is the practical difference?
Shtisel,"You'd think with the Jews controlling the world, that this would have happened a lot earlier in TV history. 

/s"
Shtisel,"Ouch!

“Because no Orthodox Jews were involved, there are some silly inaccuracies that could have been avoided, 

and there is some fake Yiddish in the show, 

which is inexcusable and would be strongly called out if fake Chinese or Spanish were used for a Chinese or Hispanic TV character.”"
Shtisel,Kanye is livid
Shtisel,?
Shtisel,"A historic move: A show focuses on a Jewish guy. 

Next week, the NBA drafts an African-American!"
Shtisel,Shtisel exists though
Shtisel,"A show having a white protagonist is not a ""historic"" move. In all honesty, with the insane amount of shows out there, practically every ethnic/religious/ethno-religious background imaginable has probably been represented in some capacity by now"
Shtisel,"Level of religiosity. Hasidic are very strict in their beliefs - the most obvious being their clothes. Orthodox might wear a yarmulke (the little head covering) or they might not. They both will follow the diet and celebrate the holidays. 

(Not Jewish so take this with a grain of salt!)"
Shtisel,"Lol, fake yiddish.  Thats literally the equivalent of a tv show going to Italy and having the pizza restaurant waiter start saying ‘ a beepity boppy, a bippity boopita boppy’"
Shtisel,Name 3 more American shows where the main character is an orthodoxic Jew
Shtisel,"An Israeli show.

There are several which focus on orthodoxs. even as a jewish israeli, their world is so alien to me that i find myself captivated by their... primitivism."
Shtisel,"and unorthodox, maybe you can even count the patient"
Shtisel,Jews aren’t white.
Shtisel,"Mama mia, thatsa offensive stereotype!"
Shtisel,Yeah they are. Having a deep and longstanding culture doesnt make them not white
Shtisel,"Whiteness is uniquely American obsession, I should not have to buy into it or identify as white because someone else decided that I find a criteria of their choosing. My roots are Semitic and I am not white."
Shtisel,"You are white, that doesnt make you any less 'cultured' or whatever you think it does"
Shtisel,"Kim’s Convenience is getting a bit more attention now that one of its actors just got cast as a lead in a Marvel film, but it’s a really great Canadian show about a Korean family who run a convenience store in Toronto."
Shtisel,"I'm partial to the foreign (granted, predominantly Japanese) stuff:

* Terrace House - multi-series reality show that's actually got quite a following r/terracehouse
* Midnight Diner - feel-good drama-ish episodic food-related series
* Samurai Gourmet - retired salaryman looking to expand his food horizons
* Rea(L)ove - oh-so-trashy-yet-engaging ""looking for love"" reality show
* The IT Crowd - classic Britcom about an IT department
* Kingdom - zombies + medieval Korea
* Kantaro: The Sweet-toothed Salaryman - Japanese salaryman pursues and reviews desserts while doing sales visits
* Mr. Sunshine - semi-historical Korean drama series set in the 1900's, the protagonist is a KorAm USMC officer
* Hyori's Bed and Breakfast - another reality show, Korean k-pop superstar hosts various guests at her house
* Stay Tuned - very short (4 eps) Japanese comedy about a Sapporo TV station news reporter
* IRIS - Korean action/espionage series
* Episodes - Brit comedy series, notably starring Matt LeBlanc as himself-ish
* Instant Hotel - Ozzie reality show featuring competing ""airbnb-ers""
* Jack Whitehall: Travels With My Father - Brit comedian travels the world with his dad"
Shtisel,"Taco Chronicles is an amazing show about love for Mexican food. 

Probably completely eclipsed by netflix's other cooking shows but it showed me a real love of a food that is a cultural and national treasure.

Highly recommended as a show about Mexican food made by Mexicans."
Shtisel,Shtisel is so good!
Shtisel,Two I love are Borderline and Toast of London
Shtisel,"Blown Away - reality glass blowing competition show, shockingly engrossing

Secrets of Great British Castles - amazing history doc series

Kim's Convenience - feel-good Canadian family sitcom

Jailbirds - doc series about inmates at a Sacramento jail, ridiculously fascinating (they communicate with each other through an elaborate system that takes advantage of the buildings plumbing - the literally talk through the toilet bowl - worth it for that alone)

Fake or Fortune - for if you like Antiques Roadshow and smart British people talking in museums

I Think You Should Leave - bizarre sketch show, easy to binge (beloved by a lot of people in my social circles, but not sure how popular this ever really got)"
Shtisel,"**most beautiful thing** - brazilian series, set in 1950s, women central characters, drama with comedic elements - kind of like **mad men** meets **marvelous mrs. maisel** meets **good girls revolt**.  gorgeously shot, too.  (i loved it)

**merli** catalan (spain) series about a lethario-ish middle-aged teacher at a high school, fun.

**45rpm** spanish, set in early 1960s madrid, about the formation of a rock record label.  i'm only halfway through the first episode but so far am finding it quite enjoyable."
Shtisel,"Fat, Salt, Acid, Heat - especially the episode on fat

The Chef Show - especially the episodes with Aaron Franklin"
Shtisel,"Started watching Lady Dynamite last night. Sitcom about a crazy female standup comedian. It's wacked out, kind of like Bojack Horseman but live action. I loved the first ep (my gf hated it). Zany."
Shtisel,"I can't remember the name, but I enjoyed a food show where he would travel the world eating street food, and sometimes trying to make his own version of it.

The host is a black man from England(?) and his first name is in the title"
Shtisel,"I don't know it's availability in most regions, but the Radio-Canada show *Série noire* is one of the best pieces of television I've ever seen. The second season is pretty good, but the first is a goddamned masterpiece. Well-written, well-acted, absolutely hilarious, gah, wanna watch it for a third time now"
Shtisel,"Lovesick aka Scrotal Recall, really heartwarming romantic comedy with an interesting way of telling a story."
Shtisel,"""Big Dreams, Small Spaces"" definitely sounds suspiciously similar to ""Britain's Smallest Pies"" from an Alternatino sketch

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xL58d1l-6tA"
Shtisel,I enjoyed *Car Masters: Rust to Riches* as background viewing.
Shtisel,Lords and Ladles.  Three chefs go to a different Irish Castle and prepare a feast based on menus used at that particular castle hundreds of years ago.  Combination of food show and history show.  Couple of seasons available.  Good fun for those into food and history.
Shtisel,"I found Wild Wild West pretty underrated. There is no narrator, the doc series simply allows people from both sides to tell their stories. the score is fantastic too."
Shtisel,Huge in France is a show about a French comedian who moves to LA to connect with his estranged son. Its similar to Episodes on showtime.
Shtisel,"For comedy fans, hope you find Extras and your welcome"
Shtisel,"She Ra and Voltron and that Korean Zombie show I forget its name but it was well done and a neat twist on the zombie genre.  Also the british crime dramas that are probably popular in the UK but are totally new to me in the states.  Bodyguard, Happy Valley, Paranoia, Broadchurch, The Fall."
Shtisel,The Naked Director needs more attention.
Shtisel,"Conan Without Borders - Loved that, I’ve watched clips of his show on YouTube and enjoyed them and watched this pretty much as soon as I stumbled on it. Every episode had me laughing my head at various points, even episodes I thought weren’t going to be as good as previous ones.

The Last Czars - Part drama, part documentary of the last decades of the Romanovs, detailing their downfall. I haven’t seen anyone else talking about it. I thought it was well made, clearly had quite a budget and would recommend to anyone who likes history or maybe wants to watch something with a lot of drama in it.

Roman Empire - Similar style to Last Czars, I’ve enjoyed the three season so far of it, which recount the lives of Commodus, Caesar and Caligula (in that order). In the end I was surprised how fast I got through the seasons, I hope they make a fourth one."
Shtisel,"Well I don't know if Sacred Games counts, because it's big only in the Indian community but that show is incredible. Go check it out if you haven't already!"
Shtisel,Sneak attack Janet!!
Shtisel,thats a CBC show but yes its actually really good. So easy to watch
Shtisel,"It's one of my favorite comedies right now.  Okay, see you!"
Tidelands,"Well that sounds right up my alley, added to the list. "
Tidelands,[deleted]
Tidelands,"I feel like they wrote that expecting me to be less interested than i was before, but all they did was intrigue me even more."
Tidelands,"Random acts of nudity... hmm. 

Gratuitous nudity I’m perfectly fine with.. but when you say “random” it makes me flash to Jason Segal in forgetting Sarah Marshall where you’re like huh, did I really need to see Jason Segals dick there?

However, the Gratuitous nudity on Altered Carbon was A+."
Tidelands,Elsa Pataky tho...
Tidelands,All I read was random acts of nudity. 
Tidelands,Is that supposed to be a bad thing?
Tidelands,I saw that Dustin Clare (Gannicus from Spartacus) is in this. Hope he has a sizable role.
Tidelands,There's a charm to Aussie film/TV that I hope isn't lost in this production. I assume they hope to garner as global an audience as possible.
Tidelands,I just finished it. It's quite good imo. 
Tidelands,"I just watched [the promo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhsjoQLKaiY) for this, and it looks almost exactly like the Freeform show about mermaids called Siren."
Tidelands,The last part makes me want to see it....hmmm.
Tidelands,"After seeing all the episodes, it has a promising start with a great build up for their ""world"" (I think this is one of the better world-building fantasy series I've seen in a while) and fun soap opera-esque drama.  However [MAJOR spoiler](#s ""the show pulls a Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows type of massacre at the end, so there's not really any investment to see the story continued.  Almost every character worth following is in a pool of their own blood, and Cal is a stereotypical Mary Sue.  In the end, it wasn't the B-movie-ness of the show that disappointed me, but that it was written as if for only one season."")"
Tidelands,"I just finished it and I was actually surprised how good it was, love me some sirens "
Tidelands,"I'll tell you what. They say you can play a drinking game every time there's nudity etc. But I'd you want to get real drunk watching this, drink Everytime an actor walks out of a scene. Almost every single scene. They'll be taking and one of them will suddenly have to go do something important. I couldn't keep up. You'll see. You'll all see!!"
Tidelands,Almost every netflix original gets nudity into the first 5 minutes. It'd like it's a rule.
Tidelands,Are they saying it like that's a bad thing? Pretty sure there's droves of people who enjoy just that.
Tidelands,What's that one website that shows you what time obscene scenes occur so you can umm avoid them?
Tidelands,"I'm two episodes in. Not bad, but it doesn't seem near trashy enough."
Tidelands,"This is the second review I’ve read that reveals the “secret” of the show, The one they don’t tell you until episode 3.   Not sure why these TV reviewers can’t manage to write a simple “is it good or not” article.   This one mainly describes the first episode scene by scene with some snarky remarks, spoils the big mystery, and calls it a review.   "
Tidelands,"Spoiler    
I liked that it had some good Aussie actors, but I could barely keep up with who hated who, who wanted to kill who and why the fuck Calliope was so special to warrant a visit from the pearly white Kardashian fish."
Tidelands,I wasn't interested until the last word.  is this good nudity or bad nudity?
Tidelands,"I started watching and got into it. Not getting too invested though, bc of Netflix habit of only doing 1 season shows."
Tidelands,I’m currently watching this because I’m too lazy to look for anything else. There is a ton of nudity and it’s pretty cringy. Think the soap opera passions set in Australia with nudity and more sex and that’s basically this show. 
Tidelands,Good. Give me the Roger Corman renaissance and I will be happy.
Tidelands,i totally forgot about this show! thanx for the heads up/reminder! going to watch it tonight! 
Tidelands,"For a show that's supposed to be about mermaids, I was a little disappointed that we went the whole season seeing so little of them, if you can even say we truly saw them at all. "
Tidelands,Can someone tell me who is the asian woman in the opening scene of episode 1. The one that was nude and poked the dudes eyes out.
Tidelands,"Netflix's ""Life Below Zero"" was reality TV with random acts of nudity.  Why did they think I wanted to watch a nude man cross a stream?"
Tidelands,Heck yeah.
Tidelands,"Internet's being regionally compartmentalised in time for WW3, guess I gotta change the location of my VPN. Sigh. Life's tough."
Tidelands,"Convince me to watch more. I watched two episodes. Feels like a show for 13-year olds with a little skin here and there. Canned, stock dumb dialogue, pretty-looking empty lifeless acting, marginal unconvincing plot, cliched directing, choppy poorly conceived scenes. Even the topless scenes feel lifeless. If it had good nudity i would watch more perhaps. Finally it does not feel Aussie to me at all. "
Tidelands,Love this show hope it gets renewed. 
Tidelands,"Pretty much what everyone else is saying. Plenty of eye candy is the only good thing going for it, really. Acting is solid, but the characters are bland and one-dimensional. They seem to know their budget limits so they're pretty sparse with the special effects (which is a good thing). The main actress looks a lot like Kukudio from OITNB and it's distracting. 

Too much random, meaningless sex. By meaningless, I don't mean that there's no connection between the characters when it happens (though chemistry is kind of nonexistent), but that it just happens constantly and doesn't add anything to the plot. Basically any time two hot characters are enter the same scene for the first time, there's a sex scene without any clear reasoning why other than to get your attention. 

&#x200B;"
Tidelands,the plot is crazy. Like okay it sucks you were in prison but you can't just burst onto the scene beating people up and trying to kill others for stuff you don't even know the full story about. Honestly Cal seems like a child in a adult's body with serious anger and entitlement issues. Like who acts like that.
Tidelands,"""With random acts of nudity""

Well, you try swimming around in shirts, pants, socks, underwear.

Also, any one who watched the series, can you tell me if it has the same horrible pacing as Haunting of Hill House and the ending is better than The Order?"
Tidelands,\*Tidelands is a  B-picture TV with random acts of nudity that steals it's premise from shadow over innsmouth
Tidelands,let me guess its about a women who is a....
Tidelands,"Well, at least it's better than that other recent TV show about sirens ;)"
Tidelands,"So much crap tv on Netflix....South Park's interpretation of them is spot on...""Hi your greenlit, this is Netflix"" "
Tidelands,I just finished it and I watched it before reading any reviews. I really liked it. It's not the next Breaking Bad but it's better than a bunch of the other shows Netflix puts out.
Tidelands,"Binged the show. While it's not Game of Thrones, or any other high budget quality show it's very good for being a new show. And about the ""random acts of nudity"". The only nudity that comes up in the show is where you expect it to be.. Also it's fucking mermaids, there's bound to be nudity. The last epsiode also sets up for an interesting season two. I recommend you to watch a couple episodes too decide for yourself, this review is stupid in my opinion. "
Tidelands,Sounds like fun trash in this review. 
Tidelands,Its not trash it might not be the next GoT or sth but definitely not trash. I think its a fun show and with 8 episodes in the first season a nice length.
Tidelands,TV critics have been proven to be worthless anyways. 
Tidelands,I thought it was the worst thing I've ever seen haha.  
Tidelands,this is lot lot lot better than Midnight Texas. 
Tidelands,">Evidence suggests that this is part of an ongoing campaign from Apatow, whose previous credits include Knocked Up and The 40-Year-Old Virgin. ""America fears the penis,"" the film-maker said recently. ""And that's something I'm going to help them get over. I'm gonna get a penis in every movie I do from now on.""

https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/apr/17/news1"
Tidelands,"> huh, did I really need to see Jason Segals dick there

It didn't have the same white whale effect as Dirk Diggler's, but come on man! After hearing it slapping around? Had to happen! "
Tidelands,I thought the dick made it a great scene. Very vulnerable and uncomfortable. 
Tidelands,It was a stunt cock.
Tidelands,I've got a surprise for youuu. 
Tidelands,Whoever designed her wardrobe needs a raise.
Tidelands,random acts of nudity. That depends? Them? No. Amy shumer or Lena Dumham yes
Tidelands,he does.
Tidelands,"I watched it last night.  I'm an Australian and I felt like there was none of that charm at all.  It felt very 'Americanised' (not using that as a negative, just meant it felt like an American TV show rather than an Aussie drama).  "
Tidelands,Aussie television is not to be trusted since canceling Strange Calls so quickly.
Tidelands,"its much better i watched the first episode of sirens and it was awful this is more like a ""Banshee"" type Sirens"
Tidelands,"#Um, No. I watched Sirens. This has as much to do with Sirens as Riverdale has to do with Real housewives.

Yes, there are women that sleep around in both but thats about it.

Sirens is flesh eating, non speaking Merpeople who get dry and transform into people for a while.

Tidelanders is more about people who can both live on the surface and in the ocean but chose to live on land. And love sex and money, and fucking over surface people with drugs."
Tidelands,It's more reminiscent of the siren story from TVD from what I've seen.
Tidelands,"Used to be Cinemax (see: Banshee, Strike Back, Spartacus, etc) but I believe many premium cable shows are starting to rein it in."
Tidelands,isnt that hbos territory?
Tidelands,Haven't watched that many originals but Lina Esco is naked in the first scene in Flaked then never again. In fact I'm not sure there was any nudity in the rest of the show at all. 
Tidelands,"I'm thinking of GLOW, what else?"
Tidelands,"Netflix not only keeps track of what you watch, but for how long and where you stopped.  There was an article a few months ago about Netflix finding out that if you watch the first 3 episodes of a tv show you were more likely to watch all of the episodes of a show.  

It wouldn't surprise me if Netflix has algorithms about exactly when it's the best time to put in Nudity to get you to watch the whole thing.  "
Tidelands,"lol I watched the first episode of ""Dark"" and like 10 mins into it a pretty hardcore sex scene happens."
Tidelands,But you can tell what they are in episode 1...unless you are completely new to them 
Tidelands,"Well it depends on who her mother is. We must have been watching different shows, those pearly whites didn't have mac truck butts, they were lean mean machines.  ;P"
Tidelands,There's bad nudity?
Tidelands,Good nudity
Tidelands,It's actually not a ton at all. More than many other shows? Yes. But still only a few minutes in total of the entire season's runtime.
Tidelands,"Jet Tranter as Leandra, s01ep01 @ 23:29"
Tidelands,*'cuz it's provocative. It gets people goin'.*
Tidelands,Why would they think I would want to watch a nude woman doing X
Tidelands,Because many of us enjoy watching a nude man cross a stream. :)
Tidelands,"Yeah, they should be following Ghostbuster rules: Never cross the streams. 

Especially with your dick out. "
Tidelands,"I just saw this two days ago.  I'm sitting there eating breakfast and BAM, glens dick.  I was like wait, WTF am I watching?  I thought this was a cable show"
Tidelands,Woman?
Tidelands,"Martin takes way to long to write, doesn't give a fuck about main characters and is too ponderous when he does release a book.  But yes I want it to go on for a while. Its good."
Tidelands,">and with 8 episodes in the first season a nice length.

That's what she said..."
Tidelands,"You haven't seen much. I can point you to movies so back you will go wtf five minutes in and still wonder after an hour. 

This is good."
Tidelands,"Ah, a penis proclamation. Interesting. 

Hey we could all walk around shirtless for all I care. In fact let’s put it up for a vote, I suggest Kate Upton and a unusually obese man as test subjects. "
Tidelands,I think it fit right in with how awkward he wanted Sarah to feel during this break up. 
Tidelands,"Wouldn’t say I’m afraid, just not a big fan of seeing other men’s junk"
Tidelands,"I never believe that claims like this are truly genuine. There is a good chance that the edgy(?) stuff he throws in out of this *totally* benevolent attempt to make people ""get over their fear"" is going to make them avoid the movie anyway...Only the people that are already okay with it or go to a movie just to see this stuff are going to watch it. I think that commentary like this is just for attention and PR.  "
Tidelands,I think that is even weirder that putting your real penis on display.
Tidelands,Apparently it was a semi-chub per [this interview](https://gawker.com/381182/exclusive-forgetting-sarah-marshall-director-gives-us-the-most-penis-tastic-interview-ever) .
Tidelands,Does she take off her wardrobe a lot in the show?
Tidelands,Meh butts and boobs are all good imo
Tidelands,Ah. Thank you. 
Tidelands,"It felt Aussie enough for me and I've watched dance Academy. I can't your shows that much because its near impossible without a vpn and an address. 

What do you think is Aussie enough?"
Tidelands,This has happened with other Netflix international series from what I've seen - the shows come off jarringly Americanized.
Tidelands,"Yeah, but Ludo Studios are doing *Bluey* now though so it all works out."
Tidelands,I'll love them far more than US based stuff.
Tidelands,"you mean ""Banshee like [""Banshee""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5AtxSndgJw)? if so, i am in. "
Tidelands,"Okay, relax there, tiger. Point taken. No need for giant font and bold. We can all read just fine. I was just saying the trailer looked just like the Freeform show."
Tidelands,Banshee was such a fun show to watch
Tidelands,They certainly had lots of nudity. As far as making sure it's in the first 5 minutes is something I've noticed about netflix originals.
Tidelands,"If I start a new series and decide I don't like it, instead of stopping right then; I'll watch up to the last episode and stop, just to fuck with Netflix. I go so far as to start the final episode and turn it off after the first few minutes. Just so they know that I know that the episode exists. That I care so little for the show that I'm fine with never finding out how it ends."
Tidelands,"Haha, yeah true. I was thinking more of their faces!"
The Innocent Man,/r/theinnocentman for those interested
The Innocent Man,Seth Myers and Wally go at it on Seth's show all the time.
The Innocent Man,Good thing they didn’t use the zoom call pic it would break the internet
The Innocent Man,Hello fellow Jackals.
The Innocent Man,"my god, I thought this was another death announcement"
The Innocent Man,"Caught him holding cue cards in a 30 rock rewatch recently, love Seth's show and Corrections"
The Innocent Man,Cue Card Wally's getting more attention. Seth's not gonna be happy about this
The Innocent Man,"Wally on Seth Meyers show is gold. 


HEAR ME NOW EXECUTIVES, DON’T MESS WITH A GOOD THING!"
The Innocent Man,"Everyone watches Seth Myers for A Closer Look, I watch Seth Meyers for Wally"
The Innocent Man,His brother is Spike Feresten. Writer for Letterman then went on to write the Soup Nazi episode for Seinfeld. He has a podcast called Spike’s car radio where he will talk about Wally occasionally and have Seinfeld on as well.
The Innocent Man,I was just telling a friend about Wally last night... I thought I read that he was given lines as a way for him to get a SAG card and/or extra money due to a medical issue with him or a family member? I love Wally's bits on Seth's show and think he was the Cue Card guy from SNL as well...
The Innocent Man,He now runs a personal cue card business. That's hustle
The Innocent Man,WALLY!!! *shakes fist*
The Innocent Man,u/cuecardwally is the GOAT 🐐! Love him and Seth and love seeing the jackal presence in the comments
The Innocent Man,I fucking love Wally!
The Innocent Man,Here is a video featuring Wally and how he does cards https://youtu.be/3djg59JUrmc
The Innocent Man,God bless Wally.  I hope he's actually as cool as he seems.  He's one of my favorite parts of Seth Meyers' show.
The Innocent Man,"His cue card business made for a fun gift last year. My wife loved it, and I had fun emailing with him to create it. Good stuff!"
The Innocent Man,Love his handwriting.
The Innocent Man,Love Wally
The Innocent Man,I love that man
The Innocent Man,That is one sexy W
The Innocent Man,This is the last thing I would have ever thought to be so interesting. Now MY shoulder hurts.
The Innocent Man,For a show that nobody watches or likes SNL really has a hold on this sub
The Innocent Man,I flash the same cue card to the Mrs on weekends..
The Innocent Man,"Wow, it's destroying his body. You would have thought they would have moved to a tablet by now.

Weird how this is written as a ""feel good""."
The Innocent Man,So nice to see all the Jackals in here
The Innocent Man,"Am I the only one that finds Wally’s involvement to feel a bit forced?  He’s a likeable enough guy, but I just don’t find the bits very funny. Feels like they’re going for a Jimmy Kimmel and Guillermo relationship, but it just doesn’t land for me."
The Innocent Man,Seth Meyers still brings that zoom pic up regularly on his show and it makes me laugh every time.
The Innocent Man,I love you guys... Jackals untie!
The Innocent Man,Where do you display your Mac Tonite merchandise? Mine is in the dining room for fancy guests.
The Innocent Man,Explain yourself
The Innocent Man,Just got the mug on my recent trip to NYC. I use no other now.
The Innocent Man,"I know, I felt my heart skip a beat. GIVE THAT MAN A THIRD CAMERA"
The Innocent Man,"In the first episode when it has the clip of jack memorizing everyone’s name, the first one he says is “Wally the cue card guy”"
The Innocent Man,A slow motion coup he grows more powerful by the day
The Innocent Man,The show simply doesn’t have the budget for him to appear more.
The Innocent Man,Found Wally’s alternative account.
The Innocent Man,"Corrections has such a weird vibe, I love it."
The Innocent Man,I came here looking to confirm this. But I see you’re not certain either. :-)
The Innocent Man,"I've wanted to a buy a cue card from him for a while but I can't quite figure out the perfect thing for him to write. Is it too boring to just go with ""live from [my city] it's [my name's] house""?"
The Innocent Man,All of the people Wally has trained were first instructed to master his handwriting style. They all use it now too.
The Innocent Man,I think that’s what actually makes it funny. It feels forced and a little awkward which makes it more realistic. You can feel the audience wants more Wally because he’s always just a little off on timing. It’s just a sweet and funny thing.
The Innocent Man,"I feel like the early Guillermo bits were created around the idea of “I’m a white guy laughing at this Mexican immigrant” kind of thing. 

Maybe I’m mistaken. Jimmy Kimmel’s early career is mad questionable."
The Innocent Man,"That’s the schtick. He’s not an actor.

Guillermo has also been doing the sidekick bit for nearly 2 decades now. Wally’s been in the role for only 2-3 years now

I mean, we could have the Sea Captain or the attic wasps back if you don’t like Wally /shudder"
The Innocent Man,Yeah shit is both cloying and annoying.
The Innocent Man,It’s the definition of cringe. Wally needs charisma
The Innocent Man,"I agree, I like Seth but the Wally bits just aren’t funny"
The Innocent Man,'tinue*
The Innocent Man,Mine is in my half bath. It’s known as the Mac Deucenite Suite
The Innocent Man,"Corrections is so great because it’s like a love letter to the crew

And sometimes Samberg"
The Innocent Man,Animal Flubs!
The Innocent Man,"Yeah and it also helps that a major part of Seth's show is committing to the joke even if it does stink. He makes fun of it all the time, but then doubles down on it until it somehow becomes funny. I know it's not for everyone, but it consistently cracks me up."
The Innocent Man,They still make a tequila joke every episode so hasn’t changed much.
The Innocent Man,">That’s the popsicle schtick. He’s not an actor.

FIFY"
The Innocent Man,Corrections is the best! Nobody knows how to handle a pause like Seth. The crew dying laughing in the background is so funny
The Innocent Man,This has been…Animal Deaths
The Innocent Man,Is will forte singing Animal Flubs?
The Innocent Man,"Corrections is quite possibly some of the most pointless, dumb, bad jokes that constantly never land. I love it and watch it weekly. Hilarious thing that brightens my week."
The Innocent Man,Kimmel is the “safe” white racist comedian.
The Innocent Man,That's kinda what I miss about the 20+ minute episodes.
The Innocent Man,Don't show the picture!
The Innocent Man,"No, I think it's a group of animals."
The Innocent Man,"Absolutely.  I only watch Corrections and Jokes Seth Can't Tell, and they're the best.  Seth's fear and hatred of Mac Tonight is only heightened for me by the fact that I'm a huge Doug Jones fan (he played Mac Tonight, most of Guillermo del Toro's creatures, Billy Butcherson, and currently Saru on Star Trek Discovery.)"
The Innocent Man,Oh oh yes. Corrected. 🧐
The Innocent Man,"You forgot Animal Flubs, especially the Animal Flubs intro song"
The Innocent Man,"Umm, actually, Animal Flubs is already part of the Corrections segment, so I do watch it.

</jackal>"
The Innocent Man,I stand corrected!
The Innocent Man,"The original Chilean ""documentary"" was nominated for an Oscar and it's absolutely brilliant."
The Innocent Man,"Alright! I have to admit this sounds a pretty interesting premise, and with Schur and Danson I have a feeling it will be a hit."
The Innocent Man,Add Jason Schwartzman and Zach Galifianakis and just make this a continuation of Bored to Death.
The Innocent Man,Ted Danson and Michael Shur just feel like it has to be on NBC
The Innocent Man,Not bad for an intern.
The Innocent Man,I’ll watch anything Schur makes. He’s banked so much goodwill that I’m excited for this despite it being a Netflix property
The Innocent Man,is the main character gonna be called sam moleswell?
The Innocent Man,Schur and Danson? Sign me up please.
The Innocent Man,"...okay, I'm interested"
The Innocent Man,Just wish it wasn’t Netflix. I like my sitcoms to have more than 8 episodes a season.
The Innocent Man,I am 100% onboard with that
The Innocent Man,"Oh man, I need to watch the original, they say it's beautiful."
The Innocent Man,Who taught Mose sex?
The Innocent Man,"Had to read the article, but Mike Schur is actually writing this.  They aren't just putting his name on it for extra traction.  Im down.  That guy has written some of my favorite shows."
The Innocent Man,Netflix will cancel it after one season so that's a big pass from me.
The Innocent Man,"I looked up the documentary and it says it's 'docufiction', what does that mean?"
The Innocent Man,What is known for sure - jazz is going to be insulted in some way.
The Innocent Man,Isn't it actually a documentary?
The Innocent Man,Michael's new twist on his human life.
The Innocent Man,Well this is a Universal Television production. It's likely that either NBC and Peacock passed on it or Netflix just offered more money.
The Innocent Man,"really cool to see how he’s grown in his time at meadowlark, i think he has potential"
The Innocent Man,I’m assuming the main character lives in Sacramento and is investigating why the Miami Heat suck so much as an organization and are ruining the NBA.
The Innocent Man,"Agreed. While Rutherford Falls didn't hit for me, it was still pretty decent. And if THAT is his stumble? Then bring it on.

P&R and Good Place are incredible."
The Innocent Man,Sam Moleone ^^^^(Malone)
The Innocent Man,Lance Manion
The Innocent Man,Epic joke Elon!
The Innocent Man,"It really reads plot-wise more as a movie or mini-series to me anyway.

So because of that, it's a big pass from me also."
The Innocent Man,"I watched the original. The main character is hired to live in a retirement home for a few weeks to check up on a particular resident. I didn't read anything about it, but I remember he actually had a cameraman and sound technician following him around recording him a lot of the time. 

So the residents and staff would have known what was going on, and I guess would have been instructed to just act as natural as possible."
The Innocent Man,"It's as staged as a film can be and still qualify as a documentary. I don't have a problem with it being labeled a documentary, but I wouldn't want to suggest it to people without qualifying that it's not what a lot of people think of when they hear the term."
The Innocent Man,"Yea, Schur is signed with NBCUniversal, all of his projects are gonna be Universal Television projects."
The Innocent Man,"This article confirms that Miguel and Ryan had a falling out over HoTD, I wonder what that was about."

Sunderland Til I Die,"FUCK YESSSSSSS. One of the best sports docs I’ve seen, along with Last Chance U.

Edit- only 2 episodes?!"
Sunderland Til I Die,"> The two-episode mini-series will focus on The Black Cat's charge up the League One table and the Wembley Play-Off Final victory, which secured their position back in the Championship.

Very cool that is back, kind of blows it is only two episodes."
Sunderland Til I Die,RIP Sunderland
Sunderland Til I Die,"Good to end on a high note, I was wondering why they didn't film anything when they actually did get promoted back but I guess they did"
Sunderland Til I Die,Do they actually die this season?
Sunderland Til I Die,"Apparently there were reports that a crew were planning to film during a press conference in August. 

However the conference was cancelled at the last minute because Alex Neil buggered off to join Stoke.

Kinda have a feeling they decided to just scrap the filming for the rest of this season and wrap it up on a guaranteed high note at Wembley"
Sunderland Til I Die,"With Mowbray in charge, they're guaranteed years of midtable finishes with a post-Christmas death spiral. It wouldn't have made exciting viewing."
Sunderland Til I Die,"Perry:

Sunderland Til I Die,Honestly thought he got clean years ago
Sunderland Til I Die,">weight went down

Well, it went up and down….when my wife watches clips from the show and they’re all out of order, it’s interesting to see if it’s “puffy Chandler,” or “regular Chandler.”

I feel bad for the guy; he has never seemed to be able to really stop doing the shit."
Sunderland Til I Die,Getting clean is comparatively easier than staying clean.
Sunderland Til I Die,Glad he’s alive and with us
Sunderland Til I Die,I really hope he makes a comeback
Sunderland Til I Die,"I used to down 25-30 10mg methadone pills in the morning, and then do 3x 80mg oxys in the afternoon before they became tamperproof (I found away around it but you lost so much and the time to do it wasn’t even worth it) and then did the same 25-30 10mg methadone pills in the morning and then a .5-1gram of heroin in the afternoon and even drank on top of it sometimes. addiction is no joke. I’m one of the few who got out. Unfortunately I drink often; but that’s all I do. No weed, no pills, no nothing. Even when I had some intense surgeries, I opted out of opiate painkillers because I knew where I would end up. I can’t believe I’m still alive and I truly can’t believe that life I used to live. Scammin, Robbin, selling dope, doing dope, and ruining families while ruining my own. Never again. People who have never had an addiction that will truly cripple you if you don’t have it don’t understand. I applaud everyone who has gotten clean and has stayed clean."
Sunderland Til I Die,"I preordered his book the other day. I WAS in recovery until about a month ago.. Granted, my DOC is not opioids. But I’m slowly making my way back to not using and this seems like a great read to remind me not to fuck up."
Sunderland Til I Die,He was so talented. Not just for comedy. Even in drama like studio 60.. he could have been a great actor
Sunderland Til I Die,It must have been rough working on that awful odd couple remake. It's a shame because he's pretty talented. Studio 60 was ahead of its time.
Sunderland Til I Die,"I was addicted to Vicodin in HS. Took 10 or so one night, mixed with alcohol, by the time I went to bed, I had a seizure, and nearly choked on my own throw up. Never went back after that, but it took years to feel like a person without it. Feel like I had a crazy tolerance for those things back then, so hearing someone take 55 is crazy to me."
Sunderland Til I Die,"I knew it, he looked awful in the Friends special. And always suspected he looked like had been brain damaged, like an aneurism or something."
Sunderland Til I Die,"Thought he had addiction issues during the Friends run, and then he got better and kicked the habit? 

If he didn’t get clean and sober until 2018, it suggests he maybe has been much worse addicted, for longer, or had a huge relapse. 

Regarding colon issues, don’t the docs encourage stool softeners and laxatives while taking painkillers? Or do patients have intestinal blocks anyway, if opioid use is high enough? 

Whatever the story, hope he stays healthy now. He sounds very lucky to be alive."
Sunderland Til I Die,"
Being rich is a double edged sword. You have the money and resources to basically do whatever you want, including destructive things like this. You also have the money and resources to help get you through all the bullshit you are doing. It has to be tough saying no to a lot of the shit."
Sunderland Til I Die,"Where do these percentages come from?  As a physician myself, I've never seen someone actually give a specific percentage for survival for any condition.  I guess it just sounds good to make one up."
Sunderland Til I Die,"Addiction does not care about fame, money, anything. Dude was at the top of the world, money fame, everything, fucking pills bought him to death's doorstep. Never underestimate the destruction wrought by addiction."
Sunderland Til I Die,Could he be any closer to death?
Sunderland Til I Die,What’s crazy to me is how he learned his lines while high on so many Vicodins. I don’t use opiates and learning my lines is hard enough as it is 😵‍💫
Sunderland Til I Die,"Sometimes I get a little disappointed that opioids don’t seem to affect me much (like when I got my wisdom teeth removed and even norco’s didn’t help). 

Then I read titles like these."
Sunderland Til I Die,"Based on his behavior during the Friends reunion show, he seems brain damaged.  I wonder if falling into a coma deprived his brain of oxygen."
Sunderland Til I Die,"Dude is a warrior. 

That being said, imagine being poor & having these issues. Its good he has friends money, but millions of ours here in the US struggle with addiction."
Sunderland Til I Die,Anyone know why the intestinal perforation from Vicodin? Is it because he couldn’t shit so it blew up?
Sunderland Til I Die,Poor guy I know what it is to be an addict and I wouldn’t wish it on anyone
Sunderland Til I Die,I say this with respect but is this why he looked awful in the reunion?
Sunderland Til I Die,"So there was definitely a moment in 2018 where it wasn’t his day, his week, his month or even his year."
Sunderland Til I Die,"I was once on Hydrocodone/10 MG. 4 times a day for nerve damage. I also lost certain sensations in my brain that make me feel good. (Martial arts/fighting and motorcycle accidents)  I never once abused them. A couple of times I taken an extra one because for some strange reason, they didn't work so well when the rainy weather came in. 
So, one day I felt pain and it wasn't in the usual spot. My doctor ran tests and said that my liver is being damaged from the acetaminophen.
I decided to stop taking them and now use Suboxone for my nerve damage."
Sunderland Til I Die,">Doctors said 'I had a 2% chance to live'

Why are they making it all about themselves? What was Matthew's chance of survival?

^^/s"
Sunderland Til I Die,MJ and Prince were not so lucky
Sunderland Til I Die,Damn. Hope he stays well.
Sunderland Til I Die,"As a healthcare professional, a huge shout out to the hospital and staff that honored his privacy. Yes, we all know about HIPPA violations, but money talks, and there were many, many people caring for him (it's not *all* just nurses and doctors!)."
Sunderland Til I Die,“Could I BE closer to death right now?”
Sunderland Til I Die,guess no one told him life was going to be this way
Sunderland Til I Die,I always wonder how doctors come up with all these really specific percentages
Sunderland Til I Die,"Every time I hear a story like this about Matthew Perry, I always think to myself, ""oh i'm glad hes clean now."" but then like 2 years later i hear that 2 years ago he almost died from taking 4 pounds of cocane or some shit. 

Drugs suck man."
Sunderland Til I Die,"In other words, doctors said if you were poor you would be gone."
Sunderland Til I Die,"I hope he's in recovery but I think it's questionable if he has stopped--just watch his appearance on the Friends reunion special, slurring his words and looking out of it."
Sunderland Til I Die,That explain a lot of things...
Sunderland Til I Die,"Could I be any more close to dying? But seriously, I near that point in 2019 and somehow made it."
Sunderland Til I Die,"Why do doctors always say ""you had a 0.0000001% chance to live"" 

I wonder if they do it to help with recovery, they think the patient will think they're lucky to have lived and go on with that knowledge."
Sunderland Til I Die,Not surprising. Dude has battled addiction for a while. He had that car crash he blamed on ‘back pills’ I believe.
Sunderland Til I Die,"""Well ain't that a kick I'm the head..."""
Sunderland Til I Die,"His career, however, was given less favorable odds."
Sunderland Til I Die,Didn’t he say he doesn’t remember an entire season of Friends because of opiates?
Sunderland Til I Die,I’m really looking forward to his book coming out next month
Sunderland Til I Die,"Wow, he said he was taking 55 Vicodin a day. The most I was ever prescribed was 30 and that was after open heart surgery. They were supposed to last me through my entire recovery. I can’t imagine taking them all in one day and then some. It’s shocking how celebrities can get just about anything they want through connections. It’s shocking and scary."
Sunderland Til I Die,"Wasn't he already addicted to opioids in the 2000s, and that was after he had drug problems in Friends? This is what having too much money does to you, you have the means to keep relapsing."
Sunderland Til I Die,"Do American doctors always give you odds on your death? Seems like everyone with a medical story in the States has a ""they said I was going to die"" story."
Sunderland Til I Die,I don’t know how he has a liver left from all that Tylenol that’s in vicodin
Sunderland Til I Die,"Man I don’t like friends and don’t know shit about Matthew Perry but I hope he finds peace and a life without addiction. Seems like he’s been struggling since I was a kid (am 26 now) 
He (hopefully I’m not wrong) deserves a better life"
Sunderland Til I Die,"2018? Geez, for a sec I thought this was old news from his well-known pill addiction during Friends."
Sunderland Til I Die,"The ""Opioid Crisis"" isn't what it seems, and it's mainly because of the media and how they portray it that's the problem.

People who hold a prescription for legal Vicodin and Fentanyl aren't overdosing and killing themselves in record numbers. It's the illegal Vicodin and Fentanyl that's killing folks. By ""illegal"", I mean opioids not gotten from a prescription, but from a ""dealer"".

I've been on prescribed **Vicodin** *(\~50mg per day)* and **Fentanyl** *(25mcg/hr, per day)* for years. I'm prescribed this and a number of other drugs *(upwards of 35 pills per day)*. Crazy, right!? I have a legitimate high opioid tolerance.

The real crisis is that people are getting them illegally and then misusing them accordingly. The attention it gets from people that don't understand the legal side of it makes it harder to jump through the hoops to get my prescriptions.

This is just my r/unpopularopinion ."
Sunderland Til I Die,"So he was a junkie, or is that derogatory term only used for poor people?"
Sunderland Til I Die,Oddly specific percentage
Sunderland Til I Die,Could those odds BE any lower?
Sunderland Til I Die,Could he be any more lucky?
Sunderland Til I Die,Everyone’s didn’t know when I screamed out “Matthew Perry”
Sunderland Til I Die,File this under:   I don’t care…
Sunderland Til I Die,Could he BE any more of an addict?
Sunderland Til I Die,"Of course, this “article” is for publicity about an upcoming book release of his. How convenient."
Sunderland Til I Die,"Could you BE, any, dumber?"
Sunderland Til I Die,Can he now wear a 2%er patch on his motorcycle jacket?
Sunderland Til I Die,Anyone that says doctors said I had a X% chance to live is probably full of shit. I have to imagine with how vulnerable they are to lawsuits and malpractice stuff that putting odds on someone’s likelihood to survive and revealing those odds to said person would never be something that would happen.
Sunderland Til I Die,It’s OK Matt you didn’t miss nothin.
Sunderland Til I Die,Ring-a-ding-ding baby
Sunderland Til I Die,I once took 60 or so Ambien and 50 Vicodin in a suicide attempt and all that happened was 18 hours sleep
Sunderland Til I Die,This reads like spin
Sunderland Til I Die,Doctors make those numbers up on the spot.  Sure he had a low probability of survival but there isn’t any way a doctor could calculate it to such a precise number
Sunderland Til I Die,Seems disingenuous to blame the medication.
Sunderland Til I Die,People like that screw things up for the rest of us.
Sunderland Til I Die,Honestly not a terrible way to go.  The OD would suck and all. His liver and kidneys prolly in bad shape. But the idea of drifting off to sleep in a massive opioid high—worse things have happened
Sunderland Til I Die,Is this like chandler talk 🤣
Sunderland Til I Die,Done please return
Sunderland Til I Die,"I don’t think doctors usually give a number like 2%. They would just say vague terms, no?"
Sunderland Til I Die,Doctors always say shit like that as if they can guess those percentages lol
Sunderland Til I Die,Dumb ass
Sunderland Til I Die,The title should instead read: Matthew Perry is selling a book about...
Sunderland Til I Die,Why are we just hearing about this now?
Sunderland Til I Die,Um ok… the fifth dentist caved and now they’re all recommending opioids?
Sunderland Til I Die,Why would his butthole blow up?
Sunderland Til I Die,Did he use the Magic Johnson cure?
Sunderland Til I Die,"Wasn't he already known for kicking a bad drinking habit?

I guess this guy just goes hard on things. I smoked for 20 years of my life, I know what it can be like just considering even stopping a bad habit, so it's hard to not have a little sympathy. Not being a terrible person helps. I'm not sure I felt sad when Rush Limbaugh had a similar story about popping pills."
Sunderland Til I Die,He should def. Try to beat the odds again…why does this matter at all to anyone?
Sunderland Til I Die,🤷🏾‍♂️
Sunderland Til I Die,2% for a millionaire= 98% normal people
Sunderland Til I Die,"His life was a Joke and broke love life DOA   
he was stuck in second gear"
Sunderland Til I Die, I'll.    Hbb h by by h BB BB BB bball.  Need CVS bubble BBY g. hhhhñ n BB
Sunderland Til I Die,Should have let him die
Sunderland Til I Die,Am I supposed to feel sorry for him or something
Sunderland Til I Die,Dumbass
The Protector,"Turkey kinda sucks, man"
The Protector,"This is in addition to them removing all scenes related to Usman being gay in Love 101.

I will give Netflix some kudos for actually attempting this in the first place. You can say they should refuse to release the series censored or whatever but I do admire they gave this a shot. While it didn't have anything LGBT they also were daring with a show called Jinn that showed Jordanian teens actually acting like teens. It caused some kerfuffle in Jordan too."
The Protector,Foreign intervention made the whole place suck first.
The Protector,"Well, Erdogan is doing his best to ruin the country."
The Protector,they should refuse no matter what
The Protector,"In this case as it's a Turkish production they can legally demand censorship of certain scenes, I think even for export. I just don't expect Netflix to write off the cost of a whole series to make a point. :/"
The Protector,[deleted]
The Protector,"They could have just not even tried in the first place like any other company does, is my point."
The Protector,Don’t be obtuse - America has worse problems not getting called out
The Protector,Good. Don't legitimize hate. Let all those that refuse to lose their funding. If capitalism is the reason discrimination is allowed than we all need to rethink our place in the world.
The Protector,It was a nice watch. One of the rare production where the city of Istanbul is reflected with its ins and outs.
The Protector,"I'm enjoying it. Watched the first half in one sitting last night, will finish it here soon. The story feels a bit cliche in some places, but it's fun. The short run time for most episodes helps it move along quickly, too.

The show is already renewed for season two I read, my only hope is that the show will go deeper into the mythology and fantasy elements in the future. "
The Protector,[deleted]
The Protector,"Historical fiction is something rare for Turkish TV, so it's something fresh and fun.

But, there are way better Turkish series, so, it's just meh."
The Protector,"**spoiler alert**


I watched the whole series. I don’t know anything about turkey or Istanbul (except that Istanbul was Constantinople, now it’s Istanbul not Constantinople). I’m an American. I enjoy watching foreign crime/detective shows. I started watching this for no good reason. I really liked it except some stuff made no sense. If you know the answer to any of these, please help.

Why didn’t Faisal just shoot Hakam after he took off the shirt and gave him the bloody dagger?

What blood was it that resurrected the other immortals? It looked like Hakam’s blood.  But it had a very delayed reaction if it was. It was laying there for the whole conversation/fight and then just went to resurrect the immortals at the height of drama.  If it was Faisal’s blood that wouldn’t make any sense.

Should I expect a season 2?

Why did Constantinople get the works?"
The Protector,"I really love this show!  I'm glad I gave it a chance as I really don't like those Swedish/Finnish Scandi mystery shows which move so slowly and are all grey/gray :)   I was in Turkey a few years ago and love seeing the sights of Istanbul again in this series.  All the actors are convincing and the plot is better than the Da Vinci movies/books so far.  I like the fact that there are mythic elements to the backstory. There are the odd cheesy moments, but they are few and far between.  Will keep watching for sure."
The Protector,"I can't believe Hakan didn't take Leyla to the fucking hospital you absolute idiot I'm so pissed. Continuing after that is debatable, can't handle this characters idiocy. Infuriating. All the stupid stupid turns this show makes forcing the plot to do things that don't make any type of sense. I can't I can't I cant! Couldn't even show up to the meeting with the immortal with ANY type of plan, just hands over everything, HERE YOU GO!! EVERYTHING YOU NEED RIGHT HER BUDDY! The way Zaynups dad dies how underwhelming..... really?!?! That's how he goes?!?! Great idea for the show, but executed carelessly. Plot isn't complex enough for the story they are trying to tell. At the end of the day sure it's an okay show, but it almost felt rushed. It's going to let you down over and over. Maybe just the fact I'm going on about this dissproves everything I just said? Not sure, but it's how I feel just an opinion. I like the show, but I wish I loved it. 
"
The Protector,"Finish it, a few hours ago and I enjoyed it"
The Protector,Episode 1 about 1 minute in --- the guy has a copy of Bill Cosby: Time Flies next to his bed. 
The Protector,Is it just me or is the english verison horribly dubbed?
The Protector,I enjoyed it. I did not enjoy the romances/love triangle. Just felt like watching a train plow into a soap opera. 
The Protector,"I love this show. Very well made romance on middle of a chaos. Im just hoping to see Zeynep and Hakan smash next season, like it was going that way this season too but it ended short."
The Protector,"In my point of view, Hakan should have left Faysal and Sofia alone because it would have been only fair that Faysal wanted her to to be resurrected not the other immortals. Hakan should have listened to Faysal's reason and ended the centuries-old fight. After all, according to the Faysal's point of view Hakans's father started it first."
The Protector,I really tried to like it but the character of the protector was literally...the worst protector and kept making the same dumb mistakes over and over
The Protector,"Pretty good, slightly cringy at times in the beginning and sometimes slightly predictable, but I'd say overall pretty [solid](https://solid.It). It is fantasy, but very grounded.

It is what Iron Fist should've been (kind of similar premiss, but way superior acting and better writing).

I'd definitely give it a chance."
The Protector,"'Bad' does not come anywhere close to defining this piece of turd. Simpleton story mixes all super-hero genre cliches, add bad dialogue, rational loops and horrible acting and you got yourself something less than watchable. "
The Protector,I saw it pop up this weekend and didn't know it was a foreign language show. I might try it out after watching Cathedral Of The Sea (I can't watch more than one foreign language show at a time)
The Protector,"Spoiler Alert:
Entertaining but the plot holes are huge and the script is all around not well thought outFo example Hakin the main characters dad was said to have killed 2 of the immortals but their graves are in a tomb under the Hagia Sophia that they say hasn’t been opened in 500 years in the show. Tons of stuff like that in the show yet some how still watchable"
The Protector,"The protector is a fun show, but it does have is plot holes. Season 2... if you're going to make a callback to the most famous plague in history, at least read the Wikipedia first. EVERY SENTENCE WAS WRONG. does turkey not have history class?"
The Protector,"I randomly found it while sick one day and binged it in 1 sitting. It's got some issues, but they dont take away from the entertainment.

Something I really like about it is that it feels almost like a take on Assassin's Creed - a favorite game series of mine despite its glaring shortcomings. There a ton of parallels between the two, and I'd be incredibly surprised if the show runners weren't drawing inspiration from the game series. This show has cemented my opinion that games shouldn't be adapted to movies, but TV-series' instead."
The Protector,"i just wanted to say i just saw a mini trailer for it on netflix, 

and i thought it was extremely cringe worthy listening to the english dub they used for the trailer, i was happy to find out that its actually watchable in the original language , Turkish.  with english subtitles

&#x200B;

Really really really cringy the English dub. dont watch it with dub."
The Protector,"Season 2 was very amateurish.  Not sure who decided to approved the absurd acting and script!  Such a sad let-down when compared to Season 1.  Additionally, Season 2 ended on a cliffhanger, which was badly executed.  All in all, Season 2  was pure crap.  Not sure why these seasoned Turkish actors decided to sign up for that crap, so disappointed!"
The Protector,"Just streaming it now, can anyone explain how all the revived immortals that have been dead for over 100 years know how to use modern technology within a day?  Pretty sure if I never saw cars, planes, buildings, electricity, tv, phones, the internet I wouldn’t know how to use them within hours of being alive."
The Protector,"Hehe, I was pretty sure this comment was in the wrong place, but I can't imagine where it would be at home."
The Protector,Any recommendations for Turkish shows?
The Protector,Can you recommend some good ones? I thought this was meh but would love to explore some more interesting ones. I am not a native Turkish speaker so something with translations would be nice if you know something like that
The Protector,"> What blood was it that resurrected the other immortals?

The ""fallen one"" told the other loyals peeps in ep 9 that the immortals wanted the protectors blood.  Seemed pretty inconsistent with the mythos they had built up until that point.  To me lot's of things in the show felt poorly thought out, like just plain bad writing. Though some of that might be due to translation.

Stuff like the immortal dude finding his former chief of security killed and then jumping to the conclusion that the new chief of security must be involved with the protector, despite the fact that immortal dude was the one character who should've guessed the dude he had just demoted might be angry about it.  And it's not like Hakam used the dagger to kill the security dude. Immortal dude just jumped the gun and turned on a character he'd trusted up until this point over nothing and despite evidence to the contrary that the show ignores.

There were too many stupid 'this is a TV show' decisions and moments, but looking past the poor writing/translation, I felt that the show was fairly engaging and enjoyable in concept, in visuals, and in audio design.

6/10 from me. Not great. Ended up watching most of it whilst busy cooking."
The Protector,"Maybe it is the blood of the murderer. For example, Hakans dad killed Faisals wife, therefore  he needs the blood of hakans father or hakan himself.. Soo what if faysal killed the other imortals himself, therefore his blood can revive them. Maybe that’s also why he tells hakan that he only wants his wife alive and not the others, because he killed them... Hope my theory was clear though... haha"
The Protector,"lmfao yup. They fought so hard for the shirt for him to just be like OK HERES THE SHIRT, HERES THE BLOOD, HERES THE DAGGER SEE YA. Her dad dying like that after being rescued to begin with was dumb AF."
The Protector,"Completely agree. The whole plot is just about trying to fix hakan's fuckups, but still failing. MC is an idiot.   


On the other hand, Leyla's actress is hands down the most beautiful person i've ever seen."
The Protector,"I think that's something that makes sense in the show though. Faysal - being an immortal - would have a holistic view of things while Hakan - being mortal - wouldn't. On top of things, Hakan's been taught - by the person he trusts most - that Immortals aren't to be trusted.

I think Hakan's actions made sense there for his character, even if they were non-sensical from a holistic view."
The Protector,"the main actor is pretty good, compared to the iron fist this deserves an oscar lol"
The Protector,"I thought the acting was good, especially from the guy playing the protector Hakan. "
The Protector,[deleted]
The Protector,"I finished it to give it the benefit of the doubt...

Really want my time back..."
The Protector,"I noticed that one as well, but it didnt really take away from how much I enjoyed the show - which is a good sign. Show knows what it is and stick to is."
The Protector,">history, at least read the Wikipedia first. EVERY SENTENCE WAS WRONG. does turkey not have history class?

They do have history class, but they don't have Wikipedia"
The Protector,"Masum and Şahsiyet are simply the best ones. They are streaming miniseries.

They are much longer, but in Netflix, there are Ezel, Filinta and Şubat."
The Protector,"Definitely Şahsiyet. It's a mini-series and it's a very good one. And also you can watch it from a streaming service from Turkey (Puhu) for free with English subtitles:

[https://puhutv.com/sahsiyet-1-bolum-izle](https://puhutv.com/sahsiyet-1-bolum-izle)

Imdb Link: [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7920978/](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7920978/)"
The Protector,"Dirilis Ertugrul, i love it, they are in their 5th season now (you can find two season on netflix)"
The Protector,"I'm Turkish and in the last 15 years I loved 2 shows.

""+18"" It was a sitcom but unlike 2 hour episodes like other Turkish shows, it had 25 min episodes, was filled with references from all around the world and had a great cast. Cancelled after 6 episodes.

""Acayip Hikayeler"" translates to ""Strange Stories"", A comic adaptation anthology series similar to Twilight Zone or Black Mirror. Scifi themed episodes were the best.

It got cancelled after a season :/"
The Protector,"Normally I hate Turkish series because they are too long (2 hours per episode) and that ruins the scenario, but some of the new ones are great. You can watch Şahsiyet. It's a mini-series and it's a very good one. And also you can watch it from a streaming service from Turkey (Puhu) for free with English subtitles:

The Protector,"Faysal knew that Hakan was the protector only because he didn't have a scratch on him. He concluded that he was wearing the shirt. That combined with the 'evidence' showing that Hakan was part of the dagger robbery, it wouldn't have been hard to come to the conclusion. "
The Protector,Thank you
The Protector,I think Faysal knew he was the protector the entire time making him get close to him as he said. He only went after Hakan after they killed the dude Hakan thought was the immortal because now Hakan realized that it wasn't him who was the immortal
The Protector,"After watching some episodes of the second season, I guess that makes some sense now."
The Protector,"I see iron fist metioned and all i can say is hakan and iron fist are both characters who just seem to be entirely stupid and idiotic. That kind of ruined the complete story for me which had some good potential, i sadly had to sit there quite alot and could just swear at the idiot."
The Protector,"The acting is good, but the writing wasn't that good. I could tell from the first episode that Faysal was the real immortal. It was just so obvious that an immortal wouldn't defer to some businessman for basically no reason. I really liked the setting, but the writing definitely brought it down. Also as an english speaker the fact that the subtitles and the english dub would literally have completely different meanings kinda threw me off. Like the English dub would say one thing, and the subtitles would say a completely different line and sometimes the dub would say things in a completely different order than the subtitles leading to getting information before you should."
The Protector,"i thought it was a 6/10, and like the other poster said, basically a better version of the iron fist which imo was a 3/10"
The Protector,"'Utter pile of garbage' is an exaggeration. Sure there are plotholes and the plot lacks here and there, but the acting is not as terrible as you make it out to be. Certainly not cringey all around"
The Protector,"in my other comment I had originally started into a whole rant of everything I thought was dumb about the dagger robbery but I didn't want to bother rewatching it to get my facts straight, so i deleted it. Maybe it was fair enough that the botched robbery was a red flag on Hakan's record. But now Im gonna rant about this instead:

>he didnt have a scratch on him

During that whole sequence there were like three things that might have left a mark on hakan, two of which could have easily not have left any mark on a normal human; wrists tied wont bruise unless you struggle or put weight on them, and the table shattering with glass everywhere would've had to have gone through a thick suit coat and a shirt before breaking skin (I went back and checked, Hakan was in a leather jacket, glass wouldn't get through that). Glass is sharp but a well dressed person can get lucky. Finally the only thing that I think probably should've left a mark was grabbing the glass shard to jab it in the dudes neck. Probably should've cut his hand, but not unreasonable to think that a trained fighter might look after himself in such a situation or again get lucky. (and note with a leather jacket and with Masar's use of that dirty rag, there is actually very little luck required to excuse Hakans clean escape)

Hakan was knocked out with a chloroform rag so he wouldn't have been wounded prior to the chair scene. Maybe if the cops had done their job and found the chloroform and rag that chief used for that. Maybe if they actually investigated a little, found out that chief had just been demoted and had a huge motive to assault hakan...

And then look at the security chief's corpse. No evidence of a struggle. The two didn't have a punch on. No evidence that Hakan should have been wounded. The only wound between them was in chiefs throat. 

For gods sake when the girl walked in on them hakan still had ropes on his wrists! And she apparantly just ignored his side of the story entirely. Fair enough, both of them were in shock, but there would have been so much evidence in hakans favor. (There would have been glass in his damn jacket)

Feysal is so distrusting of his chief security that he basically fires him, after saying things earlier in the episode like 'you're so suspicious of hakan that you're stalking his friends'. And then this whole scene happens where security chief proves to the audience that he's a loose cannon... and Faysal suddenly flips and ignores the entire crime scene, doesn't give Hakan a chance to tell his side, instead opting to believe that the loony chief (whom he'd just given a motive to attack hakan) was right all along. What kind of age old immortal being rushes to conclusions like that? 

It was a dumb decision that only coincidentally brought him to an accurate conclusion."
The Protector,"Agreed. Mazar even threw the damn rag on the table which obviously was still there, yet nothing....that whole thing made 0 sense"
The Protector,"Fuuck you are right about everything you just said. I was looking for a Protector thread because I wasn't satisfied with the ending. I really liked the show so I overlooked a lot of the flaws, until you just said this. Its like hearing that Santa is not real, the whole illusion surrounding it is shattered :("
The Protector,[deleted]
The Protector,I watched the episodes I described again in an attempt to criticize justly. Do you have any specific concerns with my complaints?
The Protector,More Iron Fist than Iron Fist
The Protector,Looks...cliché
The Protector,"Looks dope.  

Is there a chance it is getting dubbed in English later? Or will there only ever be subtitles?"
The Protector,"This looks like a film student's final project.

I predict: Awful dialogue, bad acting, terrible cinematography and worse fight choreography."
The Protector,Good lord does Netflix even try any more?
The Protector,[deleted]
The Protector,With some Assassin's Creed thrown in.
The Protector,I'm pretty sure it'll be dubbed in English from the start. That's how it goes usually
The Protector,Every Netflix live action original has been available with an English dub right away. 
The Protector,"Watched two episodes and I agree the dialog is horrid. The acting is more like overacting, amateurish. "
The Protector,Yikes. I thought subtitles were a thing?
The Protector,thats the reason a lot of people dislike americans...
The Protector,Racist?
The Protector,Me too
The Protector,Dash of Wanted.
The Protector,Awesome thanks. 
The Protector,[deleted]
The Protector,You really find subtitles to be that annoying that you will write off all non English content? You're missing out on a lot of quality stuff by limiting yourself that way.
The Protector,"I'll admit it's not the greatest show out there but i did enjoy season 1. 

Also iirc there was this actress who was just absolutely gorgeous."
The Protector,"Noice, was surprised by the first season, will watch second."
The Protector,The main actor is similar to the iron fist main character. Completely idiotic and overacts to everything. Makes me irritated watching shows like this but yet I can't stop because the actresses are so beautiful :D
The Protector,[deleted]
The Protector,"I really enjoy this show for its ability to be entertaining while also being pretty fucking silly at times. Not every show needs to be a well written masterpiece and this show is the furthest thing from that but it never fails to entertain which I can’t say the same for a lot of other poorly written shows I watch. 

It does the job which I can very much appreciate."
The Protector,Yes. Its even confirmed for season 4 already. We are gonna continue to watch it for a while it seems like.
The Protector,"Honestly, that's Turkish shows for you. They are almost ALWAYS silly, it's just that some are higher quality than others. I fucking love shows like these."
The Protector,"I'll give it a go.

Sigh, I hate 'Coming Soon'. Just tell me when."
The Protector,"Netflix's first Turkish show. There are rumors that historic characters like Fatih Sultan Mehmet also will be shown.

&#x200B;

""Given mystical powers by a talismanic keepsake, a young man embarks *on* a quest to fight shadowy forces and solve a mystery from his past. """
The Protector,"My dad loves Turkish tv shows for some reason. 

Not sure why, I just set him up with a Netflix profile and checked back a year later to find him knee deep in Turkish historical dramas.  


This looks kinda cool maybe I’ll try watching it with him when it comes out. "
The Protector,"Looks decent to me. If the story is good enought and well developped it has potential. Hopefully, the acting is on par also. 

Then again, I am a sucker for those type of shows. "
The Protector,Hey is this show voiceover it because something is completely wrong and I’m watching at the talking does not match the mouth’s and it bothers me way too much
The Protector,"This series is good, but so much have  commonplace-cliche , Better than the trailer."
The Protector,Not tomorrow. 
The Protector,Yes it is. You can go to the audio/subtitles option and see what the original language is the next time you're curious.
The Protector,Problem is they had just some months to finish season 2 and barely finishes those 8 episodes cause of the main character being in jail. I wish they did 10 episodes and finish the show cause I dont think season 3 has a lot to tell.
The Protector,"I am late to this but god, season 2 is awful. Season 1 wasn’t great but it was entertaining. Season 2 is horrible and the character progression is the worst I have seen in any TV show. Not only from Hakan but from many other characters, too. I am at episode S02E06 now and it gets harder and harder to watch or stay focused because all of them act like idiots. Not only the good guys but the bad guys too. Lived for hundreds of years and are silly as hell."
Z4,"Showing hairy ballsack in episode numero uno, how very bold of them"
Z4,Enjoying it so far. It is uncomfortable in a tense way but also humorous in a quirky dark way
Z4,"Loved it! Coolidge immediately getting clingy with that employee was so spot on for these resorts and retreats.

Had no idea that was Murray Bartlett's real accent, lol. For some reason I always thought he was an American actor. I like it, makes him more interesting."
Z4,An Emmy is being delivered to Jennifer Coolidge’s house as we speak
Z4,A plethora of unpleasant people.
Z4,I'm betting it's not the guy's wife being loaded onto the plane. Love Jennifer Coolidge in most anything. Will stick with this but I don't like that a show set in Hawaii has to have that sepia tone (yellow) look. Thought it was just the HDR and switched to standard HD but it looked even worse. Still it was engaging enough.
Z4,"Armond and the staff are in a Coen Brothers movie, while a totally different movie happens around them"
Z4,"I have a feeling this show is going to tease a lot of mysteries, but ultimately, the suffering will be brought upon the rich people themselves. Like the honeymoon suite, it wasn't some huge conspiracy, the hotel just fucked it up and double booked it, but the guy is making such a big deal out of it that he's ruining his own honeymoon."
Z4,What about how the woman in the spa said there was no way Coolige could have a massage that day but then was booking someone in at 3pm over the phone that same day as she was leaving?
Z4,Ok the teenage girls are the worst characters.
Z4,Fucking Mike White is the man. Is this his first series he’s directed? I’m already impressed.
Z4,"The melancholy, the tropical paradise, the relaxed atmosphere give me Alexander Payne/The Descendants vibe"
Z4,"That's the school of rock guy, right?"
Z4,Liked the first episode a lot. Some really funny moments.
Z4,"I liked it more than I thought I would, mainly because I am a huge Connie Britton fan (loved her cutting the teenage son's lobster for him because ""lobster meat is so tough"") and her hair is as fabulous as always.

I have to agree with pretty much everything the manager said, especially how the rich want those serving them to be generic."
Z4,"For Survivor fans, it's worth noting this was created, written, directed and produced by [Mike White](https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Mike_White), the runner-up in Survivor: David v Goliath."
Z4,"Its very Mike White. ""It's labeled as a comedy, I'm not quite sure I'm watching a comedy, is it a comedy?"""
Z4,"I’m loving it so far. 

Everyone makes me so uncomfortable"
Z4,"I really think the young wife isn't the one who died, I know it's being implied but not really confirmed in the first scene of the episode.. Something else went down on that island."
Z4,"Super intriguing first episode, I'm already hooked and ready to see how this vacation pans out. 

LOOOVE the hotel manager. And the theme song is super cool. Excited about this one"
Z4,"I was excited about this because I love Alexandra Daddario and Sydney Sweeney. Definitely an intriguing premiere; interesting characters, a nice setting and an ominous tone. Though I do feel like this “someone dies in the opening scene/episode and who is it/did it?” device is becoming cliche. So many shows anymore are ultimately murder mysteries."
Z4,It's interesting but kind of slow. I dunno if ill be able to keep up with it weekly.
Z4,[deleted]
Z4,LMAOO I didn’t expect the fucking dick shot up close like that in the beginning wtfff 😭😂
Z4,I’m thinking HBO got anotha one.
Z4,Im sure this was pointed out already but i watched it again and noticed Belinda was booking a same day massage with a bunch of extras when jennifer Coolidge went to tip her. Im liking this show so far
Z4,"I think just go ahead and give Jennifer Coolidge and Steve Zahn the golden globes or Emmys for their performances. Sometimes comedic actors can give the best dramatic performances. It is true in this case. I have always thought she was hilarious l and goofy, but this performance has made me respect her even more. Love her performance"
Z4,If the family is so rich why do they only have one room for the husband and wife only. Can’t they have 2 more rooms for the girls and the brother? It doesn’t make sense where they’re sleeping
Z4,I loved it. Still cannot figure out why one of the teenagers was reading Freud lmao.
Z4,"r/TheWhiteLotusHBO is the sub, come join us!"
Z4,Second episode was much better than the first. I think they want us to think Alexandra is in the coffin but it’s a swerve
Z4,"Only now getting around to this show. After episode 1, I am hoping the two mean girls die."
Z4,Alexandra D'addario is more than a pretty face. She's that but she can actually act
Z4,"Hanging dong has become a lot more prevalent last few years, but the world still has a distinct shortage of shots hanging brain. I applaud White Lotus and Steve dahn, or Mr Zahns nut double, for their commitment.

Oh also I liked the show will definitely watch ep2"
Z4,What on earth is this show about?
Z4,"So glad I have a show to look forward to, it's been awhile since The Undoing. Love the drama, funny dialogue, different blend of characters and well rounded refreshing cast."
Z4,"There's something so ominous about this show. I'm so excited to see how it pans out. I might be totally off base but I feel like something unbelievable, maybe unexplainable, is going to happen."
Z4,I feel like they’re all playing older versions of themselves
Z4,I’m still meh on it. First episode though so I’ll give it another go in episode 2
Z4,"What a great start. Amazing episode. Great setting. Great cast. HBO is just on another level than everyone else.

Sydney Sweeney is hot, but she plays such a bitch in this. I would guess it’s pretty accurate portrait of a lot of college students these days"
Z4,"It's fine.

Only thing that left an impression is how obnoxious and mean that two girls are."
Z4,Love it so much!
Z4,I liked it! So far so good. I loved Enlightened.
Z4,Not sure how I feel about it so far.
Z4,"Imagine an actual white lotus show, about the origin about the secret society"
Z4,The name had me thinking it was an AtLA spinoff
Z4,"As someone who has a near-physical aversion to cringey drama, I found this show unbearable. Great cast, fantastic production values, all in the service of forcing me to spend time with characters who seem to have been engineered in a lab to be as transparently unpleasant as possible.

Also, don't be misled by the ""comedy"" label into thinking it will contain anything resembling ""humor"",  unless you're one of those people who finds pure cringe funny."
Z4,"Interesting setting and atmosphere.  No actual laughs, per se.  Some cringey tropes (what happens with the Trainee)

It will be some bite sized entertainment to mark time for other HBO series to return later in the summer."
Z4,So many comments and none of you recognized the Battlestar Galactica opening theme? I'm disappointed lol
Z4,"The teenage girls are just so awful and I am beyond tired of the trope of young kids glued to technology and missing life and being blase about paradise no one can afford anymore. And the music is so, so, bad; what a missed opportunity. Some of the best voices (and music; slack key guitar, anyone?) on the planet reside on those islands, and instead we have a harpy (or mouse?) chorus set to South American rhythms, and an over production. Insulting, as it disregards the rich musical heritage in place.  I am not rooting for anyone, yet, though the acting is superb."
Z4,This show is not good. I like the actors but the writing and direction is very basic
Z4,Nudity 🤝 HBO
Z4,Was a fairly hamfisted latex appliance
Z4,"I looked away for a second and looked back at the TV, all of a sudden im staring at Steve Zahn's balls"
Z4,Common HBO move
Z4,"We've got Alexandra Daddario, Sydney Sweeney, Connie Britton and Jennifer Coolidge but instead we get a dick in hand hairy ballsack for nudity."
Z4,They've done it in literally every new series just to get an article written about it for publicity. It's sad and not organic at this point.
Z4,Best part of this first episode. Those fake balls made it bearable.
Z4,"Having even just worked retail before, it’s crazy how starving for attention people can be. It’s annoying af but you also have to pity the people who cling on to those they interact with in the service industry because they’re either extremely lonely or just crave human attention."
Z4,"Man she completely nailed the oblivious, out-of-touch, Xan'd out of her mind, upper-crust white woman."
Z4,Which is a lot of tv nowadays.
Z4,Literally none of the characters are unpleasant
Z4,I'm predicting the death will be Steve Zahns character. He's creating a self fulfilling prophecy for himself thinking he's going to die.
Z4,"Yeah, she will probably breakup with him during the honeymoon which is why she's not with him at the airport."
Z4,"He’s definitely revealing how big of an ass he is but I hope this doesn’t go down the all too predictable “I’m a good girl who married this rich douchey guy too quick without realizing how much of a narcissist he is, and I’m going to leave him (not die) on our honeymoon upon that realization” route. It’s just too obvious at this point that I’m hoping for some other spin."
Z4,"Sadly I am this man irl, focus on the smallest most unimportant shit and then it ends up biting me in the ass every single time lol"
Z4,"Yes, they lingered on that dialogue for much longer than necessary. Just to make sure everyone noticed. 

I feel like that and the whole private plunge pool obsession are the two biggest clues so far."
Z4,She was talking about 3pm the next day.
Z4,"She couldn’t get the massage that day because all the masseuses were booked, but maybe the lady on the phone was asking for another service from the spa"
Z4,did she say the woman on the phone was getting a massage?
Z4,The Hillary Clinton bit was great.
Z4,Kinda hoping something bad happens to them
Z4,"Yeah, they kind of ruin the whole show for me. They're unrealistic too. No one acts and speaks like that 100% of the time."
Z4,Hot though
Z4,You should check out Enlightened. It's phenomenal.
Z4,With a bit of a Jordan Peele thriller type vibe.
Z4,You mean expert Survivor contestant
Z4,""" uh hello, this is ned schneebly"""
Z4,He's also the creator of the cult HBO show Enlightened and participated on Survivor with his father.
Z4,She was awesome in Friday Night Lights.
Z4,"Not quite getting how her character is supposed to be a captain of the business universe, but she's acting as if the character is an average soccer mom."
Z4,"Always find it weird that Ned Schneebly would be known as ""that guy from Survivor"""
Z4,"Also, for The Emoji Movie fans, he wrote the screenplay for The Emoji Movie."
Z4,"Nice! I looked up Mike White after watching this and i was like ""I've never heard of the guy yet he looks so familiar"" Now it makes sense."
Z4,Most of his writing is so character focused and beautiful imo
Z4,"ah!! that's why the name is so familiar, I couldn't make the connection!"
Z4,"That actually annoyed me. Why label it a comedy when that's clearly not what it's aspiring to be? Nothing wrong with calling it what it is, a character-driven ensemble drama."
Z4,Ya I have a feeling maybe she wanted to stay behind/decided the marriage wasn't for her ?
Z4,Yesss def!
Z4,"I really enjoyed it too! The trailer gave me Agatha Christie""death on the Nile"" vibes for some reason lol"
Z4,"I agree. Almost all of HBO's most recent miniseries have been murder mysteries - Mare of East Town, The Undoing, Big Little Lies, Perry Mason and this show. There have got to be other ways to hook people."
Z4,"> I love Alexandra Daddario and Sydney Sweeney
>

Do you now..."
Z4,They definitely have good non murder mysteries though if you want any recommendations.
Z4,Bonk
Z4,Intruxx would have been so tight as the opening theme.
Z4,yes ... added it to my spotify immediately after watching the show... opening theme wallpaper is also sick.... i need a shirt made of that stuff
Z4,"That shit turned me off hardcore against the show. Nothing lewd at all and then bam hard cut to closeup on a dick. Not trying to see that, hard pass"
Z4,I’ll bet the dock was fake but the boobs were real
Z4,Zahn is easily one of the most underrated actors of his day.
Z4,They’re college students. It’s discussed in the post episode interview.
Bad Banks,"Wow, this looks actually really good. I loved Dark. Checked out Babylon Berlin but stopped watching after a few episodes. 
I will try to watch the first episodes of this tonight. Thanks for bringing this up here."
Bad Banks,"I know one of the writers, it's a really great show. Fast-paced and intelligent. Everyone should check it out!"
Bad Banks,I've honestly been dying to watch this. I hope someone uploads the English subtitles for it.
Bad Banks,It looks like ZDF site only has German subtitles now. And it doesn't appear to be on anywhere else.
Bad Banks,I hope they get a steady cam for next season
Bad Banks,"just watch this series, wow it's really good"
Bad Banks,"Four years later - I just watched S1 via Hulu with english subs. It's a really decent drama filmed with nice sets, energy and quite a bit of style. Paula Beer is exceptional in this. Lots of back-stabbing and memorable characters but it's main flaw is there simply isn't one likeable character in the series, they will all sell you out in a hearbeat, but you will end up rooting for Jana.

You're gonna need this site for recaps cause the plotting goes by quickly and if you miss a name you'll have a hard time catching up.  https://en.everybodywiki.com/Bad_Banks_(TV_Series)"
Bad Banks,"I loved Dark as well. And you should definitely try Bad Banks, it's worth watching. "
Bad Banks,"Fast-paced and Intelligent, True! And I hope they continue this way. Do you know btw if they're gonna release the next few episodes soon? :D I want to know what happens next haha! "
Bad Banks,"Yes, unfortunately. I failed to find it on some .to websites as well. I really hope this show be released with English subtitles soon."
Bad Banks,"Well I noticed the shaky cam, sometimes it felt like watching a documentation. But ya, it didn't bother me much in the end!"
Bad Banks,"I watched the first three episodes last night. It's really great. I hadn't even heard about this show until this thread. I also read they already confirmed a second season, so thats fantastic."
Bad Banks,No but I'll try and find out! Hold that thought...
Bad Banks,I assume Netflix or something similar will play a role in the worldwide distribution. ..? (I guess Deutschland 83 with its Sundance Channel US premiere was a unique case)
Bad Banks,did they ever produce english subtitles for it?  I've been waiting all along...
Bad Banks,"Yes, I read yesterday about the second season confirmation as well, great!"
Bad Banks,"Just read an article that Federation Entertainment holds the right for international distribution and the series has already been picked by HBO Europe, Channel 4’s Walter Presents or SBS for Australia. Didn't see anything about the series being picked up for US though!"
Bad Banks,"In Germany, No. But it's been added on Hulu, they must have added subtitles now. "
Bad Banks,Interesting 
Bad Banks,"Turns out you're right, it's been out for a couple of weeks now with subs, thank you! :D"
Bad Banks,[deleted]
Bad Banks,He better record his lines from home for the foreseeable future. Terrified this man will get coronavirus and die before they can wrap up Better Call Saul.
Bad Banks,"I really like this show and have watched it again when i feel like comfort tv (maybe im fucked in the head) but i dont see how it broke through the 3 seasons and youre out mold of netflix. It doesnt seem to be that popular and definitely not a system seller. i guess because its cheap, but with (now) two highly regarded but not household name stars. Dark bleak comedy with who knows what niche they're going for. Cool. Im happy avout it. Gonna stick my head through a fuckin wall"
Bad Banks,Bet hes gonna be Bill's dad
Bad Banks,Reading that almost gave me a fricken heart attack.
Bad Banks,Believe me kid everyone is Meryl Streep with a gun to their head
Bad Banks,[deleted]
Bad Banks,is this show any good?
Bad Banks,I love bill burr but this shows is so meh. Gave up after a season and a half. Funniest joke was in the second episode of the first season.
Bad Banks,"I quite enjoy this show, but I really dont ever feel like rewatching it; hard to put my finger on it, but feels like it wouldn't be enjoyable to watch multiple times. Idk anyone else get what I mean?"
Bad Banks,[removed]
Bad Banks,"Fucking heart attack reading the first half of this title. I was fearfully reading each next word saying “please don’t be dead. Please don’t be dead” to myself out loud. 

And people are always “breaking bad star” or “Better call Saul” star Jonathan Banks. Why does no one ever start off with “Beverly hills cop henchmen” star Jonathan Banks?"
Bad Banks,He was so funny in season 5 of Community.
Bad Banks,Community Star
Bad Banks,Hes a terrible voice actor.  Hated him as Jim Gordon.
Bad Banks,Community
Bad Banks,They go with the most popular one which is still BB by miles
Bad Banks,Don't you whisper those words into the ever vigilant ears of the universe you sour punch straw dicked midget fucker.
Bad Banks,Coronavirus should be more worried about getting Jonathan Banks.
Bad Banks,[deleted]
Bad Banks,Terrified this man will get coronavirus and die ~~before they can wrap up Better Call Saul~~
Bad Banks,"The 3 seasons thing isn’t like a rule, it’s just when most of their shows either run out of steam or just aren’t getting good enough ratings to justify their cost."
Bad Banks,"Says that right in the article, like first sentence lol"
Bad Banks,"Not the biggest mystery, they announced it in the YouTube video etc"
Bad Banks,"Not a fan of his stand up, but I really like the show. It's not on my mind when it's off season but I always binge the season when it comes out."
Bad Banks,"I fucking love it. My exposure to Bill Burr has been a couple of YouTube clips and his appearances on Breaking Bad, and that's it.

Seriously, give it a go. It's great IMO. Very quickly went from being ""that show I put on in the background"" to one of my favorite Netflix shows."
Bad Banks,"It's funnier on mushrooms or lsd, but its still funny sober"
Bad Banks,I don't see why every show needs to be rewatchable.
Bad Banks,u/jimetc certainly doesn't
Bad Banks,"Honestly I can barely get myself to watch them once. I want to love it so badly as a huge Burr fan, but the show is way too predictable without enough clever dialogue to keep me entertained. It's like the punchline of every joke is just ""things were different back then, isn't that funny?"" There's only so many episodes of satirizing the same thing over and over that I can laugh at."
Bad Banks,"I disagree, I love this show and I often have on when I’m doing stuff around living room. Can’t wait for the new season."
Bad Banks,"I've rewatched it about 3-4 times already. Seriously, it's great to rewatch. No worries there at all!"
Bad Banks,"I rewatch almost no show, but especially not a mid-tier animated comedy sitcom."
Bad Banks,"probably because bad stuff keeps happening to the main character until the last episode of the season. It's stressful, honestly. I want the wife to invent something and be successful. I want the husband to get promoted and finally be happy. Real life sucks. I wanna see something good happen in fiction cause it sure aint happening out here."
Bad Banks,"It's pretty dark and messed up. I would dare say even more so than ""Bojack Horseman."" It's definitely about looking back and highlighting the very worst aspects of the 70s. You definitely are there to laugh with the pain and see how Bill definitely came from that atmosphere"
Bad Banks,He was in a season of Community as well
Bad Banks,Also Beverly Hills Cop.
Bad Banks,JIM GORDON FUCKING HATES YOU AS JOHNATHAN BANKS!
Bad Banks,"-Hickey, what do you got?

-Heartburn, and it doesn’t help me solve crimes"
Bad Banks,"I love better call saul but this is absolutely true, you shouldn't be getting downvoted"
Bad Banks,"> you sour punch straw dicked midget fucker

*Furiously scribbles down into notebook for later*"
Bad Banks,[deleted]
Bad Banks,Holy crap! That’s one of the best insults I’ve ever heard.
Bad Banks,"I normally don’t just comment a subreddit, but r/rareinsults"
Bad Banks,I pray for it daily
Bad Banks,"yeah totally.. still think santa clarita could have cleared that bar over this, saying as a fan of both"
Bad Banks,"https://deadline.com/2019/03/netflix-tv-series-cancellations-strategy-one-day-at-a-time-1202576297/

You might find this informative."
Bad Banks,"Yeah I can imagine The OA was expensive. I loved that show - it was so damned good My heart broke when it got cancelled RIP. 

Shame on Netflix, they could have atleast given them one more episode to wrap up."
Bad Banks,I reckon this actor will be playing the father of Bill.
Bad Banks,"For me rewatchable comedies are usually stuffed with constant jokes (30 Rock, Arrested Development, etc) or kind of wholesome hang out shows (Parks, The Office, Friends, etc) 

F is for Family is neither of those things, but it’s still good for one run through"
Bad Banks,Okay sorry to have a different opinion
Bad Banks,"hey! you thought of me! thanks, I get where theyre coming from, everyone watches things in diffrent times in their lives and affects them in different ways probably because of their own lives and thats what makes talking about art and comedy great hey.
once again, thanks for inviting me back into the convo!"
Bad Banks,Good for you
Bad Banks,">> you sour punch straw dicked midget fucker

>*Furiously scribbles down into notebook for later*

The new writer of game thrones post grrm has been announced as faithless195"
Bad Banks,Yeah
Bad Banks,Popular on Reddit doesn't mean popular worldwide. It probably wasn't bringing in the views necessary to make it a worthwhile investment.
Bad Banks,[deleted]
Bad Banks,Will he put bill through a fucking wall?
Bad Banks,"I like it as an occasional background noise type show, but I can’t watch it back to back like some other shows"
Bad Banks,"Don't post your opinion if you don't want it criticized.

I wasn't really criticizing your opinion, by the way. Just saying."
Bad Banks,"Not gonna lie, I feel like I could do a much better job ending that show than D&D....because at least I understand the concept of continuity, and know a character isn't required to see another character burn 80% of a city before going ""I know a killer when I see one.""

....I will never not be salty about that ending..."
Bad Banks,oh i know totally. its just a surprise. i wouldnt see a clamoring for a new season anywhere like there was for clarita on various networks
Bad Banks,It also had a giant octopus
Bad Banks,"Almost definitely, and shortly after bill will put Kevin through a fucking wall"
Bad Banks,"You're right, I'm sorry didn't mean to come off as rude"
Bad Banks,You're good! No worries.
Bad Banks,"Cool, hope you're staying safe and healthy 😊"
Bad Banks,"You too, man."
Bad Banks,"This is the single greatest thing they could have done for this show, Next would be making sure Huell and Kuby star regularly in it."
Bad Banks,[deleted]
Bad Banks,FUCK. YES. Maybe we will get some information back to his Philly days as a cop?
Bad Banks,Even more of a reason to watch. Mike was a top 4 favorite for me.
Bad Banks,"""Keys. This is the universal symbol for keys."""
Bad Banks,Hope this doesn't ruin his chances on coming back to Community next year.
Bad Banks,[deleted]
Bad Banks,Is the show gonna go back in time before Saul met Walt and Jesse?
Bad Banks,"Honestly, I was expecting it. In BB, Mike states that Saul has been his lawyer for five years. It would have been weird if Mike didn't return for Better Call Saul. "
Bad Banks,"didn't even read the article, even more excited now, he was quietly brilliant in my uneducated acting opinion, he just seemed to own every scene he was in"
Bad Banks,"Bad writing I know, but I want Mike's falling out with law enforcement to be somehow tied to Saul getting him off the hook."
Bad Banks,I hope Davis Cross will be a character on this show. I'd love to see Bob and David together again. 
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,Guys Ni'jah won 26 grammys.
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,"Damn, not that much a fan of her a music but Billie killed it as this weird cult leader figure in episode 4. I would totally watch an entire movie about her in that role"
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,"I've only watched the first two episodes so far but I'm enjoying it.  It definitely has a gritty, dark feel to it while balancing against the humor.  Some great up and coming stars in it too (it took me a minute to realize that Khalid was Franklin from Snowfall).    
  
I was curious, is the title cards in the beginning of each episode, 'This is a true story, any similarities to persons, living or dead is intentional'.  Is this more a tongue in cheek commentary about social media stalkers/stans or was there an actual case this is based on?"
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,"So dark! This show is wild AF but it's an entertaining take on stan culture. I definitely can't use stan anymore cause it's not that serious 😩😂

Can we talk about the dog being name Otis and the actor who played Marissa's dad in epi 5 who was in The Temptations movie 😂

'Aint nobody thinking bout you Otis!'"
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,Well this is bonkers. Obviously if you like Atlanta it's for you. I like it but can't binge it because I need to like...digest it and watch some light stuff to break it up.
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,The Show is twisted AF & I'm here for it. I've watched the first 4 episodes so far & really dig it.
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,Is Dre special needs? Flat out serious. I’m watching the first episode and I’m just trying to understand some of her actions/behavior.
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,Stan culture getting dragged and I love it.
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,Really enjoyed it but I'm not sure how I feel about that ending. Kept thinking >!it was a delusion Dre was having!< so that ending left me a bit puzzled. Wild show though. Nice to see Dominique Fishback again after The Deuce.
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,"If Donald Glover is attached in any capacity I’m here for it, but the plot sounds good too. I’ll definitely give it a watch."
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,"Can anyone help with some observations/questions?? SPOILERS AHEAD

Did the parents ""really"" think Dre killed Marissa or were they just twisted? Did they think she actually murdered her or do they know she didn't return her calls for help? 

Do you think there's a possibility Dre did actually kill Marissa? She goes into fugue states and we've seen her send messages from Marissa's phone to herself. 

When Dre goes to Marissa's parents' house it's extremely grand and the parents are quite young. When we see it again in the crime documentary it's more humble (still nice though) and the mom is played by a different, older actor and the dad in the photos is a different, older actor too. Did she even go to the house? 

The singer is played by a different actor at the end, is she played by Chloe Bailey?"
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,"Even though it's about a serial killer, because this is a Glover show, there are small instances of humor peppered in each episode. It's kind of like Barry, where you will be laughing at something absurd, and then someone gets gruesomely murdered right after it. The real life Beyonce references are all great, especially with the elevator fight, and the who but Beyonce mystery from years ago. The special guest actors have been good too."
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,The episode descriptions makes this come across as something that'd take place in the same universe as his Atlanta series and I'm all here for it.  Thanks for bringing this to my attention.  I'll likely order in a pizza and a bottle of Mariah Carey's Black Irish on drizly so I can sit down and watch this whole thing.
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,[deleted]
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,This show was such a great and gritty commentary on stans and fandoms-I think the murders really shed light on these tried stans. Gripping AF and I finished it in one sitting
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,Episodes 6 and 7 confused me
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,Is this a miniseries or S1 of a longer story?
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,"Gotta say it, Dre is pure Cringe."
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,Can anyone share the real stories that were utilized in the show? Like any useful links?
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,Jfc just watched the first episode. I’m speechless. Wow.
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,[deleted]
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,"I just finished the fifth episode. This shit is wild. I find myself yelling at the screen at times, especially at the supporting characters. Someone should've since put Dre on the fucking floor. Loony psycho bitch."
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,Thank you Donald for getting Chloe Bailey to take buckshots in this show.
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,Can someone explain why they family didn’t want Dre at Marissas funeral in the first episode?
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,I'm confused by the headline... Is his name in the show Stan? Or who is Stan?
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,I'm really confused about episodes 5 and 6. In 5 we see at presumably her former foster parents home and her foster dad chases her away with a gun. In episode 6 we get the police detective interviewing her former foster mother and it's a different actress and her husband is dead. Did I...miss something?
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,Passably entertaining but ultimately disappointing
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,"Three different people are ""here for it""."
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,Isn't it a little controversial they had Dre become transgender? We didn't get any hints she felt like a man and randomly in the finale they had her living as Tony.
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,What did you all think about Paris Jackson? I personally loved her as Halsey!
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,"I wish Dre had bangs the entire series, I know it messes with her character because she’s meant to have changed identities a bunch of times but it would funny if she had bangs with each new persona. It would also solidify her image as a serial killer, like with how so many killers in pop culture have iconic styles."
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,I hate Dre so much.
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,I'd it seems cool but also just so all over. 3 episodes in and probably just finish since the episodes are 30min
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,Does anyone else seriously dislike Dre?
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,I really didn’t realize that “you know who” had won so many. And now I’m afraid to say anything publicly about “you know who.”
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,I'm just now realizing that was Billie Eilish 😳 . When I was watching the episode I kept thinking she looked familiar but I couldn't place her 😂
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,Billie Eilish really impressed me with her first acting debut.
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,That was my favorite episode. They were all strangely likable and then the ending had me rolling.
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,Not the same but there have been two documentaries about the NXIVM cult this strongly resembles with the branding but I haven’t watched either. There was also a male leader who had sex with everyone and blackmail via revealing photos and recordings and Hollywood d list stars and rich heiresses that make real life cult more fantastical than depicted here.
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,I thought it had more to do with Ni’Jah clearly being a stand in for Beyoncé.
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,In the 6th episode there is a true crime documentary type episode where it makes it seem like the show is based on a true story. It'll make sense when u get to that episode
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,"Janine Nabers answers this in an interview here 

https://www.shondaland.com/inspire/a43275160/swarm-janine-nabers/

“The pilot episode is based on a true event that existed on the internet. We started the story from there and kind of built off it with real events that happened in America between about 2016 and 2018. Obviously, because it’s TV, we’ve taken a little liberty. When I pitched the pilot story to [Glover], we knew that Dre, our lead character, was going to connect the dots to the rest of the story that we’re telling within this two-and-a-half-year time period.”"
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,"Can you (or anyone else) help me understand if this show is “scary”?  Like is it just creepy in a “Stranger Things” or “True Detective S1” way, or does it have legitimate horror elements?

Just trying to determine if I can watch this with my partner or not. Thanks!"
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,"> it took me a minute to realize that Khalid was Franklin from Snowfall

Yeah, I got a good chuckle out of seeing him, of all people, crying about how he's never seen a dead body before"
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,This show blurs the line between what’s real and fake nowadays. The disclaimer sets that tone.
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,Probably a Fargo reference too maybe?
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,OMG I forgot about this. This is the best comment right here.
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,I recognized him from real housewives of Atlanta lol he's the father of Cynthia Bailey's daughter
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,"""I'm David Ruffin"""
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,That's my guy Leon. He's played everyone from David Ruffin to MC Hammer. 5 Heartbeats is also a classic.
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,last episode is sad
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,It really keeps throwing curveballs at you in terms of how fucked up it can get. And I’m only on episode 2.
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,"I've only seen ep 1, but I noticed some autistic traits in her character."
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,She seems autistic for sure in the series
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,episode 6 heavily implies that >!she went through some traumatic episode when she was a kid.!<
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,Special needs? Idk but she's definitely not stable
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,"My interpretation of the ending is that >!Dre was hallucinating that happy ending and that she actually was removed from the venue, arrested, and taken away in a police car. A similar hallucination to the biting scene, where she's biting into a plum (which to me looked like a piece of chocolate, but I'm pretty sure it was a plum).!<"
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,"Agreed. It doesn't seem like something that would really happen. It was like one of Dre's fantasies. I fully expected Ni'Ja to say ""Hey! That's the bitch who bit me!"""
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,"its good, i watched it today b4& after work. im a glover fan"
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,"Regarding the house and the parent actors: 

At the end of episode 6, >!the documentary, we see footage of Donald Glover on a red carpet talking about making the show Swarm. So the documentary that is episode 6 is from the ""real world,"" and the show Swarm we're watching is an adaptation of that ""true crime"" story. That's why the details/actors aren't exactly the same.!<"
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,">!I think the parents definitely think she had something to do with her death. Whether directly or indirectly. They didn't like her or care for her as a child and then they got rid of her. Then their blood daughter continues a relationship with her and ends up dead. They are definitely blaming Dre as either projection or they really think she killed her. And there is a definite possibility Dre did kill her, with all of Dre's hallucinations.!<"
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,"I think Dre was disappointed that Marissa put Khalid before Nijah, killed her and then went out clubbing. I also don’t think she could handle Marissa moving in with Khalid"
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,"The singer has Marissa's face on hers at the end to show that's not what happened in reality, only in Dre's imagination/hallucination. I think anyway. I'm not deep enough to fully get this show haha."
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,I also got the idea that she blacked out and killed Marissa when she tried to leave!
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,Donald Glover said in an interview that they do in fact take place in the same universe
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,Ricky Thompson
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,It's meta AF. True crime inception
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,"If you watched the series Atlanta, they often injected clips or full episodes of info that was meta. Like, it would step further into the world where what we are watching is actually true, but not true, but still make you think could it be true? It’s often documentary style and tongue-in-cheek. One example of this in the Atlanta series is season 4 ep 8 “The Goof who sat by the door” 

In Swarm, I think ep 6 foreshadows who Dre becomes in ep 7.  Ep 6 is self referential to the series we are actually watching.

I feel u tho, it does get a bit loopy in terms of the character switch and Dre’s shift in ep7."
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,Miniseries
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,ever seen The King Of Comedy?
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,Well the real Beyoncé is known for making people sign NDAs so most would just be hearsay. Like I believe Tiffany Haddish first spoke about someone biting Beyoncé at a party.
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,"@ggarol wrote this a bit higher in the thread…. I hope this helps. Also I found this article on [Vulture](https://www.vulture.com/article/swarm-recap-episode-1-and-2-stung-and-honey-explained.html) and it was helpful.

Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,What? None of it is actually real it's mostly based on loosely true stories.
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,I’m assuming that’s a typo
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,"It's a set up for a plot point that's hinted/explained later--and strongly hinted at when Khalid says that they don't look like sisters. It's more fully explained in Episode 6 and although I haven't gotten there yet, from what I read ep 7 and 8 will spell it all out."
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,They probably always saw her as a bad influence considering she was adopted and the sent her away to get rid of her. They may have that she had some kind of negative influence that caused her to end up dead.
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,"Stan is a term for a psychotic fan. Derived from one of Eminem's biggest hits, ""Stan,"" which is a narrative tune told from the perspective of an unhinged fan of Eminem's. This show is about a woman obsessed with a pop star."
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,Ever heard Eminem's song Stan?
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,Eminem created the word. It’s a mix between Stalker & Fan
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,"Portait of an Artist as a Young Man is a James Joyce novel, so they're taking that and adding some pop culture references"
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,"The episode with the detective is the ""real world"", and it's mentioned in that episode that Glover is making a series based on her story. So everything we saw in episode 1-5, & 7 is that dramatization."
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,"No, they’re different people for a reason. The detective is in the real world, and the world Dre lives in is a fictionalized version of the real world. The timeline that Dre is in is also a few years in the past.

Edit: who downvoted this? Lol"
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,Must be the Glover stans
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,"Dre wasn’t “transgender” she cut her hair and changed her style to hide from police and to sneak her way into either Rashida’s or her roommate’s life. It wasn’t a coincidence that Dre was out side of the club when the girls came out and she offered them a ride. It was all an act she played into what ever situation she needed to do to. 

Also just because someone dresses as the opposite gender doesn’t mean that they are “transgender”"
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,"She obviously is, what I'm asking is if there was a story of one of her fans going full killer like this.  I'd never heard of that so I assumed it was more comedic than serious but dunno, maybe I missed it or it wasn't a big story."
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,Has some quite gruesome scenes
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,Not scary but there’s gore from killings
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,"It's not jump scare scary. It gave me Get Out vibes, but more bloody. I just binged the entire thing, and I thought it was phenomenal."
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,Not scary just bloody
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,"Haha that was the exact scene when I recognized him.  The way he said, 'I ain't never seen a dead body befo'' I was like, shit I recognize that accent!"
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,not really. some things depicted in the show happened irl unrelated but >!in the show they make it like it all was one person!<
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,That thought occurred to me as well.
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,"The whole series is depressing, I really enjoyed it but I definitely need to watch something lighter now to balance it out"
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,The last episode was the only one I didn't like.
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,Damn I haven't gotten there I started watching Class '07 which is delightful.
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,"I’m on episode 2, too lol. I think it represents how Bey is portrayed and dragging stan culture. I like it so far."
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,Episode four when she >!is in therapy talking about spilling milk but the counselor gets her to admit it was red so pretty sure she was the  violent one in her childhood!<
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,Yes like a intellectual or developmental disability. She seems as though she is possibly on the spectrum.
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,"This is exactly what happened. In the end of Episode 6 the detective is going to Atlanta because “Tony” was arrested after storming the stage at the Nijah concert. Episode 7 was Dre’s story leading up to the concert, then the moment when Nijah says Stop, let her go - that starts her delusion. In reality she is sitting in a cell and the detective is on her way to talk to her."
Serial Killer with Piers Morgan,Also the title of episode 7 gives it away
Bad Blood,Go look up why Isaac hayes left South Park.  That last Chef episode was their response to it.  It's in Wiki
Bad Blood,[deleted]
Bad Blood,In days of our lives when Dr Drake Remore falls down an elevator shaft.
Bad Blood,"Bellamy in the seventh season of The 100 is a great example of this.
The actor Bob Morley had some fight with the showrunner so he ended up destroying his character in the last season.
Not sure who is more guilty tho.."
Bad Blood,Ed Helms was always a douchebag on The Office.
Bad Blood,I know with M\*A\*S\*H they wanted to have Hawkeye receive a letter that would have said that Trapper John was killed in a vehicle accident in Boston as a giant F-U to the Trapper John series that came later. I think writers can do a number of things to punish/penalize people.
Bad Blood,"**7th Heaven:** **Jessica Biel's Mary** was originally a role model type of character (mostly did the right thing, but still cool). Also both smart AND a basketball star). 

Biel I think wanted to move on from the role and image and did a provocative men's mag shoot at 17. The producers freaked. They turned Mary into a lazy jerk who spiraled out of control. Debts, stealing, trouble with the law, alcohol problem, bad boys, attitude problem. The parents kicked her out of the house, and Biel was able to work on movies."
Bad Blood,"I assume if an actor wants to leave you mainly have 2 choices in their final sendoff. Let them go out in a blaze of glory or make them an asshole so nobody will miss them. I'd guess many producers pick the latter, especially if there was bad blood.

A notable nice ending was when Billy left Battlestar Galactica kinda at odds with producers, but Ron Moore still gave him a good final episode faithful to the character. (Although it was basically Moore's fault for not telling him about future plots in the first place, as per Paul Campbell on an episode of BattlestarGalacticast)"
Bad Blood,"On Stargate Atlantis, one of the cast (Rainbow Sun Francks) wanted off complaining about his character's lack of character development. So they replaced him with Aquaman/Khal Drogo and turned his character into an alien drug addict who goes crazy and abandons his friends.

After a new showrunner took over Sliders, the original female lead (Sabrina Lloyd) did not get along at all with the new actress (Kari Wuhrer) he added to the cast... between their animosity and Lloyd asking for a raise, he then wrote her off by having her character imprisoned in a neanderthal rape camp."
Bad Blood,"George and Izzy in Grey's Anatomy

Amy in Superstore"
Bad Blood,[deleted]
Bad Blood,"I have no idea if there was any behind-the-scenes controversy, but Keith Hamilton Cobb left Andromeda after the third season and I remember his exit being pretty shitty and basically destroying all the development his character spent 3 years building... 

I don't remember the details but I have some memory of him betraying everyone for selfish reasons and literally being shot in the back and killed by all his friends as he ran away. I have to imagine that there was some bad blood there."
Bad Blood,"I really feel like Unforgotten *just did this*.  The main character of the show's entire four year run was an arsehole to everyone for the latest season, pissed off and pushed away her family then suddenly died in a *completely random, out of nowhere* car accident that had nothing whatsoever to do with the story, before even solving the last case she was committed to seeing through.  I don't know what the fuck went on behind the scenes but I find it really hard to believe they had envisioned ending her story like that."
Bad Blood,"It's not very common, no.

Ed Helms also never really left The Office in the first place, so he wouldn't count. I think the bigger issue there is that after Steve Carrell left, they tried to make him the new Michael, and it just didn't work, so they reversed course pretty drastically in the last season. He is still given a 'happy' ending."
Bad Blood,"Jim Gaffigan was on a show called My Boys. I don't know what happened, but they wrote him off and started trashing his character. I thought it was pretty low of the writers/his former cast members, even if he was terrible to work with."
Bad Blood,That ended up being false anyway iirc but they didn't know that then
Bad Blood,"Turns out an old white man screaming the nword at a poc makes people react negatively towards said person. But Pierce was from day 1 a character that has racist and sexist behaviour, with tones of sexual abuse. It didn't change in any season, I'd say it got less regular in later seasons when he started to behave more dumb and being involved in weird cults."
Bad Blood,"he's not the only one from that show either. Lincoln fom s1/2 was also supposed to have a much larger role in the show originally but due to personal reasons that nobody really knows the showrunner/director refused to talk to the actor or respond to their emails whenever he tried to get in contact to talk about what was going on. basically just blew off the actor so he went to the network and said hey my parts being written out, nobody will tell me why or take my calls let me go do auditions if you won't use me. and then he got his part on american gods lol. 

the showrunner on the 100 was a total jackoff.  this has been confirmed by other writers who were in the room when he targeted ricky whittle (lincoln)"
Bad Blood,"He underwent a lot of character development. He was pretty well meaning if misguided for a lot of the run, then he became the antagonist of the show at the end."
Bad Blood,He really wasnt they gave him a great story with Erin and then they torpedo’d him it ruined any desire for rewatches for me
Bad Blood,"The writers totally character assassinated Andy, but was it because he went off to make a movie, or because they couldn't think anything else and thought it'd be funny? 

The Office gang seemed super supportive of each other's careers outside of the show."
Bad Blood,The writers killed off Henry Blake because the actor pushed for better working conditions.  It turned out to be one of the most memorable moments in the show.
Bad Blood,"They never knew what they wanted to do with Ford so they wrote him out. I don't think there was bad blood between them as he came back for a 5-second cameo in a later season.

It's a different case with Weir and Tori Higginson where she refused to come back on the show, and they recasted her."
Bad Blood,Also wasn't the Black doctor Preston Burke written off because of some homophobic comments he made about the George actor?
Bad Blood,"America Ferrera was producer from day 1 on Superstore (and co-executive producer on her final season), so it's unlikely."
Bad Blood,She didn’t get eaten. She got thrown 20ft by a flash of energy from the creatures outstretched hand.
Bad Blood,I thought they handled Tasha's death well.  She wanted out and they obliged. Held a nice memorial and everything for her. Didn't write her poorly prior to death.
Bad Blood,I'm pretty sure though that his selfishly abandoning Erin to go on the sailboat ride around the world with his brother coincided with his filming the HangOver sequel.
Bad Blood,Yeah things came out later that indicated scientology wrote the public statements for him etc.  it was messy
Bad Blood,Andy's character arc is more of a wavy line: tolerable douchebag --> intolerable douchebag --> kind of tolerable douchebag --> intolerable douchebag
Bad Blood,And that’s why the BBC version will always be better. David Brent is irredeemable.
Bad Blood,[deleted]
Bad Blood,"Considering what they did with Weir, I would have found it a betrayal too."
Bad Blood,"That sounds familiar, but it was so long ago, I'm not sure anymore."
Bad Blood,"Yeah, I know. I actually think she made herself more annoying in the end so people wouldn't bail on the show when she left."
Bad Blood,Also brought her back temporarily for some good episodes where she played an alternate timeline version of herself and she played her own  half-romulan daughter.
Bad Blood,Her death episode was not the last episode they filmed with her.  She actually filmed Symbiosis afterwards.  And in her last scene she waves goodby in the background as the elevator door closes.
Bad Blood,After he had a stroke too.
Bad Blood,It's almost like that's what he signed up for when he joined a crazy cult
Bad Blood,I prefer the UK edition myself but Brent was redeemable. He basically had his redemption in the Christmas special with his 'fuck off Finchie' moment.
Bad Blood,"It's not.  He didn't want better conditions, he wanted to be the star of his own show -- he didn't like being in an ensemble.  A network gave him something called The McLean Stevenson Show, which lasted just a few episodes."
Bad Blood,"[on leaving M*A*S*H (1972)] I probably got too big for my britches. The biggest mistake I made was I thought everybody loved McLean Stevenson. It was Henry Blake that people loved. So when I went out and did The McLean Stevenson Show (1976), nobody gave a damn."
Bad Blood,"'The only time he reacted was when he saw the dead body."" [YAAA!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwjZ2_87y1k)  X-Files had some great gags,"
Bad Blood,"Such a great episode, with Luke Wilson as the sheriff and Mulder and Scully's hilariously differing accounts of how everything went down."
Bad Blood,"Did he just murder ""The Great Hambino"" from the Sandlot?"
Bad Blood,">One of my personal favorite gags for one me

Mine will always be the one set up when Scully complains Mulder never lets her drive and he says, ""I was just never sure your little feet could reach the pedals.""

The episode ends with her getting in the driver's seat and the sound effect of her having to slide the seat all the way forward."
Bad Blood,"I love the comedy episodes. Just about every one makes my top 20 list, even the season ten weremonster episode.

I have to give it to Jose Chung's from Outer Space as my favorite though, followed very closely by Humbug and X-Cops."
Bad Blood,"What do you mean you want me to do another autopsy?! And why do I have to do it right now?! I just spent hours on my feet doing an autopsy, all for you. I do it all for you, Mulder. You know, I haven't eaten since 6:00 this morning, and all that was, was a half a cream cheese bagel, and it wasn't even real cream cheese, it was light cream cheese. And now you want me to run off and do another autopsy? What the hell happened to you?

Scully: Any sign of-

Mulder: Two small puncture wounds on the neck?

Scully: ...That's not what I was going to s-

Mulder: Too bad! We got 'em!

I may or may not be a giant X-Files geek. Who can quote this and many other episodes verbatim. Who once-upon-a-time belonged to the official X-Files fan club. Who might have the special edition Ken as Mulder and Barbie as Scully dolls made for the release of Fight the Future. Yes, I have a problem which I have been working on since roughly 1993 and I'm sure it's going to clear up any day now."
Bad Blood,"""I was drugged!"""
Bad Blood,[Fringe did it better.](https://youtu.be/zsVjTyR5enM?t=4) Ack Ack!
Bad Blood,"That one is great as well, catches you off guard haha."
Bad Blood,And Mulder singing shaft while drugged https://youtu.be/gWcfgRtD2Dw
Bad Blood,It's always good to see s'more of him in TV and movies.
Bad Blood,"there should be blood and guts all over peter , right?"
Bad Blood,"Who's a bad motha-Shut yo' mouth! Talkin' 'bout Shaft. 

I DID NOT!"
Bad Blood,The first season was based on a book and certain real events/people. S2 is all fiction.
Bad Blood,"I am on episode 3 and personally don't think it has been all that bad... so far. But the first season was already better imo. The SoA comparison is pretty spot on lol, shit is already way more over the top compared to the last season. Next season will probably be even MORE over the top, if there is one. It is definitely a ""turn off your mind"" kind of show. But I am still liking it enough haha. Imagine how incompetent their local law enforcement would be if this stuff actually happened...

Yeah the characters are all pretty stereotypical, and it's like they did a casting call at a local fashion show in Milan or something... those two siblings are especially hard to watch (the sister is a hotter version of Lady Gaga, and I can appreciate that, but it is really hard to take either of them seriously)... I do sorta like Nats, the father of that baby...

Also Kim Coates is fucking badass, as usual. I am enjoying him in this ""Lone Wolf"" type of role. But this whole plot with his nephew is random af and seems like a waste of time so far. And the whole ""wife ratting on her husband because they did some dumb shit"" thing is so over done, it is just annoying to watch at this point.

The indian reservation side plot is giving me some heavy Banshee vibes too."
Bad Blood,"Wow I’m really confused, I wouldn’t say I have a bad taste in movies and series and usually have a critical view on what I have watched. And now after watching all through I wanted to check online if there is discussion about it and most people say it is shit but I really loved it. I really liked season 2 (besides some few minor parts) and remember season 1 being decent as well."
Bad Blood,Kim Coates - “paper!”
Bad Blood,"Without spoiling, I felt it could have been better.  I liked the twins, the RMCP detectives, and the lady who played the private investigator / tail.  Luca grew on me as the season went on but he flipped a switch part way through that didn't make sense.

&#x200B;

I liked a lot of the red-herring  scenes.  You thought things were going one way and they ended up going another.

&#x200B;

Did not like the casting for the elder mob capos.  The older brother tried his best tho."
Bad Blood,It's all shit haha I wish it was more popular so I could talk about how bad it is!
Bad Blood,I don't want to take away from it if you enjoyed but my god did I think it was awful. Soooo bad. Season 1 was a little campy and on the nose but season 2 was just trash.
Bad Blood,i enjoyed the second season really surprised no reddit for this show i might create one
Bad Blood,"just created a reddit for the show

[https://www.reddit.com/r/BadBloodtv/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadBloodtv/)"
Bad Blood,"I mean, how about telling us what was so awful about it."
Bad Blood,"I marathoned the first season and loved it.  I'm on the second season, but I'm not really into it as much.  I'm still enjoying it, but I'm not as enthusiastic as I was for the first season."
Bad Blood,[deleted]
Bad Blood,Bitches be trippin' ... down the stairs.
Bad Blood,"Something something equality?

Are they arguing that more men should be killed than women?"
Bad Blood,"This research sounds really, really sketchy.

The ""lesbians always die"" bit is almost certainly related to the fact that lesbians are rarely the *lead* in mainstream shows and minor characters die a lot more than the main characters in series.

As for *women* dying, that just sounds flat-out wrong.  None of the shows mentioned in the article comes remotely close to the male death count in shows like Breaking Bad or the Wire.

What's probably going on is that the article's author is displaying a common prejudice: that women's deaths are *individually* more important than men's deaths."
Bad Blood,"Not the best article but there certainly is a lot of violence against women in film and TV.

Imo, the problem arises when it becomes less a plot point with significance and more to show how edgy or tough a bad guy is.

From the professional level to amateur scripts, almost every d-bag who writes a screenplay seems to feature senseless violence against women (on top of some cool hitman or other cliche BS lol).

Also, I'm sure most writers are dudes and by having a woman get killed or hurt, the characters (male or female) can enact their roles as protectors and save what masculine society values."
Bad Blood,But then they wouldn't have as much to bitch about and their point would suck even more 
Bad Blood,"Also a show that stars more female characters than most other shows. surprise, surprise when it's time to kill people off, (which happens pretty regularly) women are in the mix of those killed off."
Bad Blood,"If we're applying reality to fantasy... probably yes.  

In the USA, men are responsible for 1.8x more homicides than women, and are homicide victims 2.5x more often than women.  

But if they want artificial equality, then we need to see more female killers and a *lot* more female victims than male than we should based on real world statistics.

It's also interesting to note that women usually kill in private whereas men kill you wherever they happen to be when they decide you need killing.  I would apply some armchair psychology there and suggest it's because women are physically weaker on average so they rely more on catching their victims off guard.  It would also seem to imply a woman is more likely to kill in cold blood, because they need to be ready for an appropriate moment."
Bad Blood,">But then they wouldn't have as much to bitch about

What, you mean as opposed to getting off their asses, organizing, and scripting and producing something that meets with their approval - risking their own money on the project?

I mean, church groups have given Kirk Cameron a second career from that method, so we know it's possible to actually *do* something instead of just bitching.  It just requires effort and an ability to accept you might be pandering to a smaller audience."
Bad Blood,"That's actually perhaps a better point than you intended - the males tend to be secondary characters which means you keep them around to watch them get affected by major deaths (and you ignore them when they die because they're not that important to the story).

It's really the Clarke/Raven/Octavia/Abigail show, and even Thelonius and Marcus are there more to make things happen for those women rather than to be individual characters with their own seperate stories."
Bad Blood,"Oh no, we are entering the waters of reason and logic here, this won't bode well for us."
Bad Blood,"Yes that's something I've noticed from the show early on.

Plenty of men die. In fact there have been several in the last few episodes, but they're more minor characters than the women so it doesn't matter as much to the audience.

I mean it's pretty easy to tell the writers are focusing on the women.  The main tribal society they've been following has had 3 female leaders in a row, and that's not a cultural thing. They've established it's possible for the leader to be male by showing male potentials but it always ends up being a woman.  That's not a coincidence.

The cult is lead by men but the AI is female and well the group of women you mentions are always the center of attention in any scene they're in."
Bad Blood,"These people are fucking retarded and really skew statistics. The reason it seems so many lesbians die is because if 1 dies thats like 10% of lesbians currently on tv. If a straight white man dies thats like 0.01%.  
 
  
""Oh well why are there so many more white men represented in TV than black gay women?"". Have you idiots ever gone outside? Id say its pretty proportionate to the actual population here in the real world"
Bad Blood,"interesting this came out after the season premiere of game of thrones which killed off 3 strong male characters, a slew of other men, and no female characters at all... i bet if even a single female was killed it would have been cited as part of the problem"
Bad Blood,Obviously it's because of tHE PATRIARKY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SMUSH IT. SMUTHS IT NOWWAAWW!!!!!! \#KiLLAllMEN!!!#
Bad Blood,"Because TV content creators like to write about killing women, actors like to play women-killing mortally dangerous murderers, actress like to play women being whacked and I like to watch women killed on TV.

What did you think?"
Bad Blood,"So the only group that it's acceptable to kill off on TV is white men. Yep, that's not prejudicial at all."
Bad Blood,"Sexism, it has to be. Please can we start the straight white male holocaust?????????"
Bad Blood,Not this shit again....
Bad Blood,"There is also a tendency in TV, especially ten to twenty years ago, to have a lesbian kiss during sweeps to get ratings. When you write in a character just for that lesbian kiss, you have to get rid of her somehow. "
Bad Blood,"Again we're looking at pretty minimal statistics here. 

The only pseudo-example I can think of is Buffy."
Bad Blood,"She just hosted SNL this past season, so there isn't any real bad blood. She was probably in a bad mood since her father died on Friday."
Bad Blood,McKinnon had a big bit in her speech about thanking her dad whilst JLD's dad died on Friday.
Bad Blood,"She was there during the non-Lorne years, those cast members tend to have a weird relationship with SNL. She didn't really like her experience there (boys club atmosphere, uncomfortable with the politicking and the drug use, regrets about dropping out of college to join the cast) but hearing her in interviews I don't get the sense that she holds onto any resentment about it. "
Bad Blood,"She was on the show in the 80s and absolutely hated it (she talks about it on her WTF episode.) But she has no bad blood since then, partly because pretty much nobody who was there when she in the cast is still on the show."
Bad Blood,"Like others have said, she was there despite her father just passing away, and her co-star was in the same category, so there are reasons she might have been slightly bothered.

More than that though, we're talking about this because she ... wasn't aggressively clapping and smiling enough? Wondering if she's referencing some decades-old SNL conflict? JLD is 55. She's been to a hundred different award shows over the last 25 years, with 20 different awards handed out at each. Can we really blame her for being unenthusiastic about another random award he's not nominated for?"
Bad Blood,"I can’t pick one:

The Constant - Lost

Through the looking glass - Lost

International Assassin- The Leftovers

I live here now - The Leftovers

The X-Files-Bad Blood (I know it’s a comedic episode and there are more profound ones that I love, but it’s just so well done and it never fails to make me laugh)

Doctor Who-The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances (cheated a little but it’s basically one ep)

Game of Thrones-The Winds of Winter (I know season 6 is rocky and not super popular but I’ll rewatch this one just for the end alone)

Succession-All the Bells Say (this may be premature as I just finished it an hour ago but holy shit what an episode)

The Newsroom-5/1"
Bad Blood,"Gonna throw lost's The Constant into the conversation (though I may like Through the Looking Glass more, The Constant stands on its own better)"

HONORABLE MENTIONS- Cut Man(DAREDEVIL), Sugarwood(OZARK), Wahrheiten(DARK), Go(PRISON BREAK)


I included only 1 episode from a show so that the list wouldn't be flushed with the same brilliant shows."
Bad Blood,"I’ll throw one out that’s not necessarily the best, but for sake of conversation I say The Mountain and the Viper. 

Season four of Game of Thrones was the peak of the show. The whole season had everybody on board from the start and it delivered. Do spoilers matter for this show? The whole season is built around the fate of a character facing almost certain death that climaxes on this episode. It gives you hope, but not at first. As someone who didn’t read the books prior to the show I kept thinking “no way he wins”, followed by “holy shit he won” followed by…anyway. Good episode of TV."
Pine Gap,I can't help but to feel like Parker Sawyers is going to have a very fascinating career – even if he never becomes a household name.
Pine Gap,lol I thought that was Jennifer Carpenter 
Pine Gap,i'm intrigued - definitely going to check this out
Pine Gap,"Hmm, I'll wait for some reviews. "
Pine Gap,This looks absolutely atrocious 
Pine Gap,"I don't quite understand the premise. This US-AU coalition bunker experiences a cuban missle crisis sort of thing, and the show is about them trying to make sense of it while avoiding international nuclear war? "
Pine Gap,This looks like typical ABC trash to me. 
Pine Gap,That's my impression. Not sure how I feel about it.
Pine Gap,Liz and Jack on 30 Rock
Pine Gap,Leslie & Ron from Parks & Recreation
Pine Gap,"Sherlock and Joan on Elementary! Their friendship is beautiful, tender, and 100% platonic."
Pine Gap,Naomi and Amos in The Expanse
Pine Gap,Veronica and Wallace
Pine Gap,"Frasier and Daphne. Also, Martin and Daphne. 

Frasier and Roz almost counted, except for that one incident.



I just watched Frasier, so that's fresh in my mind.

Now, on Cheers, Carla and Sam would probably count.

Oh, and the biggest one I can recall... Ron Swanson and Leslie Knope on Parks and Rec. Nothing romantic there, ever."
Pine Gap,Abed and Annie on Community.
Pine Gap,Don and Peggy on Mad Men
Pine Gap,Jess and Winston.
Pine Gap,I feel like maybe Eleanor and Jason might work?
Pine Gap,"Liz and Jack on 30 Rock. Other people might accuse them of being in a romantic relationship, but they are 100% platonic friends"
Pine Gap,"I feel like Juliet O'Hara and Carlton Lassiter on Psych fit the spirit of your question if not all the specifics. Lassiter isn't really a touchy feely guy, so he doesn't really fit the first criteria well."
Pine Gap,"Mal and Zoe, “Firefly”. Even though Wash was jealous of their relationship, I’m pretty sure it was confirmed to always be platonic."
Pine Gap,Monica and Richard in Silicon Valley. They hinted at romance between the two at the end of S1 and I'm very glad they didn't shoehorn it in because it would've diluted both of their characters and the overall show.
Pine Gap,Joey and Phoebe on Friends.
Pine Gap,Uhtred and the former nun character on The Last Kingdom lmao
Pine Gap,Meredith Grey and Alex Karev.
Pine Gap,Jack and Chloe in 24.
Pine Gap,[deleted]
Pine Gap,Reese and Shaw on Person of Interest.
Pine Gap,"Dwight and Pam on the Office. Despite conflicts between the two early on, as time went on Dwight became closer with both Jim and Pam, although I'm only focusing on Pam because it fits the question. They consoled each other, would occasionally team up for some shenanigans, and in the final episode of the show, Dwight even says Pam is his best friend. An example I recall is when Jim and Pam have their baby, they send Dwight to go get their birthing mix. When he gets there he can't find it, but decides to instead give them a free remodel of their home (albeit in a very...Dwight way)."
Pine Gap,"Ron/Leslie from Parks and Recreation

Liz/Jack from 30 Rock"
Pine Gap,Chris and snoop
Pine Gap,Phyllis and Stanley on The Office. Though actually it wouldn't surprise if they got drunk and fukked once. That would be a volumetrically large amount of fukk.
Pine Gap,"Astrid and Walter from Fringe

Rereading your post, it doesn't fully apply because of the age gap. But they are still a great pair and it's never romantic."
Pine Gap,Lucas and Haley from One Tree Hill.
Pine Gap,"If you're willing to put an asterisk next to ""similarly aged"", many of the companions on Doctor Who represented this sort of friendship. The modern series isn't devoid of romance for the Doctor, but the older one completely avoided it even when the Doctor in question was younger and more attractive (such as Peter Davison), and surrounded by attractive women (Nyssa, Tegan, Peri).

Even the new series has some of this. Donna had no romance with Ten, and so far Thirteen has shown no romantic inclinations at all."
Pine Gap,"Lots of people have said Ron and Leslie but I wanna say Ron and April. Maybe it's more of a father/daughter type relationship because of the age gap, but it kind of works the same way the Leslie/Ron friendship does (both of them know their way to his perfectly wood-crafted heart). Besides the moment with the scavenger hunt leading up to the tree, where iirc he says he felt a kinship with her, they both hate their job and show affection through being cold to friends/coworkers."
Pine Gap,Darryl and Carol from the walking dead
Pine Gap,"Jake and Gina B99    
also Jake and Rosa(she even came out to him first iirc) B99   
 Winston and CiCi New Girl   
There's more but a lot of the ones I think of are either siblings or one of the characters is gay so they wouldn't be interested in each other anyway(which seems like cheating)."
Pine Gap,"Midge and Lenny Bruce in *The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel*

Wild Bill and Calamity Jane in *Deadwood*

Jake and Gina in *Brooklyn Nine-Nine*

In the MCU:

Peggy Carter and both Howard Stark and Jarvis in *Agent Carter*.

In the films (which I consider a “season” of two-hour episodes spread over 10 years), Black Widow and Hawkeye, and Drax and Mantis."
Pine Gap,ITT: Work colleagues = platonic friendship
Pine Gap,"This is the whole reason they made Watson a woman in “Elementary”, because they wanted to show that a man and a woman could work together without becoming romantically entangled."
Pine Gap,Any heterosexual coupling on Person of Interest.

Pine Gap,"Majority of the B99 cast — Jake and Rosa/Gina, Charles and Amy, Terry/Holt and the women"
Pine Gap,Picard and Troi
Pine Gap,"I know you mention pairs, but how about Three's Company? They had a pretty solid deal, roommates and friends. Not really so much romantic interest between them. Maybe some tension at times."
Pine Gap,"You mentioned Boyle and Rosa dont work on B99.  But I think Jake and Rosa work.  And Jake and Rosa are closer friends than Boyle and Rosa.  Rosa even came out to Jake first.  And neither were romantically involved when they became friends.

Also Gina and Jake.  They were friends from grade school so I guess we dont know they're long history but they were definitely platonic when we were introduced to them (And the actors were friends from middle school too!)

\+1 for Liz and Jack and Lesie and Ron.

But I haven't seen Andy and Maggie on Extras.

&#x200B;

Also, OP, I dont know if Alex and Meredith meet your criteria #4 because they weren't single when they became closer friends.  Yes they met when they were single but they didn't get to #2 levels of intimacy while they were single."
Pine Gap,Maniac
Pine Gap,Penelope and Schneider from One Day at a Time (2017)
Pine Gap,This was Pete and myka on warehouse 13 til the very end.  There may have been some light flirting some episodes but relationship definitely wasn’t pushed.  I didn’t hate them getting together since their chemistry was great but most of the fanbase definitely did.
Pine Gap,"Alec Hardy and Ellie Miller - Broadchurch

Jack Bauer and Chloe O'Brian  - 24 (my personal favorite)

Mikasa Ackerman and Eren Yaegar (So far, there are some hints at something more) - Attack on Titan"
Pine Gap,Clive and Liv from iZombie
Pine Gap,Carla and J.D. from scrubs. Although I bet that his extreme friendship with her husband is a big factor in them remaining close even after J.D. left.
Pine Gap,"Olivia Benson and Elliot Stabler in Law and Order SVU. Such a relief when shows or movies write strong, committed friendships with no unnecessary hint of romance."
Pine Gap,"To my memory Starbuck and Helo are a pretty good example I think.

From what I remember they always confided in each other but never even went close to being with each other (although maybe my memory is failing me?)"

Pine Gap,"Johnny and Dutch from Killjoys. They have a truly special and platonic friendship. You'd have to ignore a brief plot line where they believe they are married (it's a sci fi show and they were being mind- controlled) because once they snap out of it, their friendship returns to being solid."
Pine Gap,Can't believe nobody has mentioned Lily and Ted or Lily and Barney or Marshall and Robin
Pine Gap,Sarah Walker and John Casey (Chuck)
Pine Gap,Clarke and Bellamy - The 100
Pine Gap,Marshall and Robin from how I met your mother.
Pine Gap,Robin and Raven from Teen Titans
Pine Gap,"I am kind of disappointed that a lot of the people in this thread are either someone and their boss (Leslie and Ron, Liz and Jack) which I don't think should count because of power dynamic, similar to age gaps, or people who share a friend group in which they are both closer to someone else in the group and I would argue they don't meet qualification 2.

Cara Dune and the Mandalorian is the only one I could think of, recent controversy notwithstanding, although Cara Dune is not in every episode. Every other example I can think of is either siblings or one of them is gay. There are some that seem like good examples before the writers couldn't resist completely changing the relationship (Arya and Gendry in GoT, for example.) Beyond that you kind of have to go to to children's shows to find male-female friendship."
Pine Gap,JD and Turk

Pine Gap,Stanley and Phyllis on The Office

[The Secret World of Alex Mack Opening/Trailer @ YouTube ](https://youtu.be/9DAORNCSkGc)"
Pine Gap,"Carrie and Saul from Homeland. I think there is one scene where Carrie tries to seduce him because of spycraft stuff not because she actually wants to sleep with him and Saul is just like ""wtf are you doing?"" 

Also she seemed to have a pretty platonic relationship with Peter Quinn too."
Pine Gap,Wendy Watson and The Middleman
Pine Gap,"Gunn and Cordelia Chase on Angel. Also Spike and Fred (I don’t think the age difference counts since he’s a vampire anyway. ) also Angel and Fred. She did start out with a crush on him but that’s probably because he rescued her from slavery in a hell dimension not because she actually wanted to date him.  

Mac and Dee have absolutely no history or sexual tension. Though I suppose they are barely even friends. 

Alex and Elaine on Taxi are a great example. 

Merlin and Gwendolyn on BBCs Merlin. 

Dean and Jo on Supernatural? He did make a pass at her once but it was a “this is our last night on earth” scenario. 

Captain Kirk and Lieutenant Uhura in TOS. They only kissed due to mind control. 

Raylan and Rachel on Justified."
Pine Gap,Alone Together is a really good show. You can watch it on Hulu
Pine Gap,Michael and Pam
Pine Gap,Ron and Leslie
Pine Gap,"I think most male-female pairings from the central cast of Person of Interest fit the bill. Reese and Carter are the only fuzzy one, cause they did share that one kiss, but that was improvised and their relationship was seemingly written as platonic to begin with.

It should be said though that the main characters tend to be pretty taciturn individuals, so their bond shines through their actions and their overall willingness to put their lives on the line for one another, rather through their words."
Pine Gap,Morgan and Mindy in the Mindy Project!
Pine Gap,Lorelai and Michel on Gilmore Girls
Pine Gap,"Albeit the with the becoming-friends-when-single pre-series, I think Lola Carmichael and Mark Callan from All Rise. fit your criteria (though I'm surprised someone hasn't criticized the show for it only seeming like they are such good purely-platonic friends because Lola is married and it seeming like archetype-wise if she were single they would have been another ""crime-show slowburn couple"", heck, Amy even fits a lot of the characteristics of the sort of female characters who come between those couples)"
Pine Gap,"I think Rick and maggie, Daryl and maggie, Carol and Morgan,  from the walking dead.  From the fear of the walking dead,

From Z nation, 10K and Addison. Murphy and warren. 

There was a British show called survivors, it had plenty."
Pine Gap,"They were blatantly [self aware](https://youtu.be/U3P_P1Yi3Tk) about it and joked about it perpetually

But I feel Jack and Liz’s [farewell](https://youtu.be/PjzVtgAGs3Y) sums up a truly platonic relationship. Them hooking up would’ve actually diminished how much they care about each other"
Pine Gap,Yes! I'm ***so*** glad the writers didn't ruin it. One of my favorite shows
Pine Gap,At least at this point in the show it seems like Amos and Peaches might be a good example too.
Pine Gap,"Dont get him wrong, he'd do her if she let him"
Pine Gap,Carla and everyone on cheers.
Pine Gap,"Carla and Sam was the one I was gonna post. I recently watched the whole series, and their relationship is one of the best things in the show."
Pine Gap,Martin and Daphne don’t fit because of the age gap.
Pine Gap,Jeff and Shirley too.
Pine Gap,So you're familiar with two sins. How about a third?

Pine Gap,"Also Don and Joan. And Don and Anna, of course."
The Hook Up Plan,"I found this season delightful and the last episode wraps up the show beautifully. I'm sad that it's over, but as they said in the show: ""happiness is more of a path than it is a destination""."
The Hook Up Plan,"I didn’t like this season unfortunately. It’s not awful but it was way too serious for me. What started as a kinda feel good serie ended up way differently. The characters are almost unbearable, the couples too. I will always ship Elsa and Julio, and their story is worth the pain lol. Season 1 will stay the best."
The Hook Up Plan,"Season 1 was the best, after that I felt like the writing wasn’t as strong and the plots were weird. S3 the characters were all over the place, I’m sad I really liked this show :("
The Hook Up Plan,"I think the last episode was too rushed and just like a speedy wrap on the season. Still not clear where did Elsa and Jules adopt the baby from, did Charlotte and Max plan to actually have a baby? What happens the other characters? I was just getting warmed up, when they put an end to it  :/"
The Hook Up Plan,"I feel like they forced some weird personality traits on the characters for the sake of the story which was a bit distracting, but overall, I enjoyed it! The heart was still there and I’m definitely sad that it’s over now!"
The Hook Up Plan,"I’m unsure if it’s particular to French shows, but I disliked how the series was neatly wrapped up with little to no room for interpretation or imagination. We find out exactly what happens to each character. Last episode was just a montage."
The Hook Up Plan,"Me too, it was weird"
The Hook Up Plan,Same...thought it was just me. Just not feeling the dialog and not liking the characters as much as I did the 1st and 2nd.
The Hook Up Plan,"I’m glad others feel the same. I just thought it was too out there for me, weird parts like emasculating a guy."
The Hook Up Plan,"I really dig all the French content on Netflix so I'll check it out. I binged all current seasons of Call My Agent in about 2 weeks, definitely one of my top finds of the the last year."
The Hook Up Plan,Anyone else disappointed in season 2?
The Hook Up Plan,I thought this show was called Plan Cœur?
The Hook Up Plan,Nice! I liked the first season
The Hook Up Plan,Does anyone know the name of the song on the show’s opening title?
The Hook Up Plan,Call My Agent is really great TV! Too bad we're not getting season 4 until next year.
The Hook Up Plan,Yes. The Hook Up Plan is the english title.
The Hook Up Plan,"thanks to you I just watched the show. Great recommendation. I personally think elsa over reacted a little bit.What her friends did wasn't that bad and she was spiraling. Also i loved the friendship between the boss and jules's best friend.

I visited paris a couple of times and didn't like it, but this show makes me want to give it another try. "
The Hook Up Plan,Just watched this show and loved it! I was so sad when there wasn't another episode after episode 8.
The Hook Up Plan,"The whole thing? It’s a great show, I loved everything but the last episode. But a very high quality show, very fun characters and I care about what happens to them. "
The Hook Up Plan,"yeah I binged it straight through haha. I hadn't finished the last episode when I posted, so I am less critical of elsa "

The Hook Up Plan,Sometimes the value of a shitty option is making the other options more attractive.
The Hook Up Plan,"Can anyone who has the ad tier confirm how it works? Just curious how and when they cut to ads, how often and what kind of ads they are"
The Hook Up Plan,"Pretty useless metric in isolation.  I don't think anyone expected it to outperform Netflix's flagship offerings.


I think the real question for Netflix is whether that 9% is sign ups they wouldn't have gotten otherwise, or if they're cannibalizing."
The Hook Up Plan,My mother tried it out for two whole days. She went from Ultra HD to 720p and couldn't get over how bad the quality was on her tv lol.
The Hook Up Plan,"There is no amount of money you can knock off the subscription price to make me put up with ads. If ad-supported were the only option, I would literally just stop watching Netflix and stick with other services, or go back to piracy."
The Hook Up Plan,"How are adblockers handling Netflix ads? Mine block ads on Hulu but not always on other sites (Comedy Central, a few other smaller ones)."
The Hook Up Plan,The ads are one thing. Dropping resolution to 720p feels like a punishment for picking the ad tier.
The Hook Up Plan,I would rather watch my neighbor now his lawn than pay money to watch ads on Netflix. What a joke.
The Hook Up Plan,Who would have guessed that people on streaming services don't want to see advertisements?
The Hook Up Plan,The ad supported plan wasn't intended to sell well on its own. It's designed to push people to accept the higher prices.
The Hook Up Plan,"That’s because nobody likes to be peppered with ads, especially when their previous experience with the platform was ad-free."
The Hook Up Plan,"What matters is if the ad supported plan did not exist, would those 9% have subscribed at all? If the answer is no, then the ad supported plan worked. Another question is for the users that went from the normal plan to the ad supported, did the ad supported plan at a lower cost prevent them from cancelling altogether?"
The Hook Up Plan,The problem that I saw with ad supported Netflix still remains. If the new stream of revenue is successful the type of shows Netflix orders will change. It will go for more popcorn network oriented shows rather than the content we know and love. This is the beginning of the end for what Netflix once championed
The Hook Up Plan,"I’m still confused what the goal of this ad tier plan is. Is it 

* providing another option to prevent churn
* testing how well an ad tier would perform

In general, most people who use Netflix did it to get away from ads. That was the entire appeal. It isn’t surprising at all to me it wouldn’t perform well."
The Hook Up Plan,I’d consider if it were in at least 1080p.  The fact Netflix upcharges for 1080p and 4k is ridiculous at its cost.
The Hook Up Plan,Fuck ads.
The Hook Up Plan,"This was just created so they can do deals like, sign up at Verizon and get free Netflix (in the fine print as supported only)"
The Hook Up Plan,Gee who could've guessed people don't want to watch ads after cable tv shoved them into them for 50 years.
The Hook Up Plan,Idk why people are freaking out about this. It’s literally just another option for people to pay less while ensuring Netflix still makes money.
The Hook Up Plan,Yea no shit nobody wants to pay for a service AND watch ads. People either want it free and will accept ads or they will pay but then dont want ads. No in between.
The Hook Up Plan,I can’t stand ads when streaming. Couldn’t do it with Hulu or peacock either
The Hook Up Plan,"It’s a nice option, so long as the other tiers remain unaffected"
The Hook Up Plan,It's brand new and people that don't *have* Netflix are probably the least likely to be paying attention to Netflix to rolling out a new plan.
The Hook Up Plan,"I don't like ads shouting at me when i'm trying to enjoy movies or TV shows that were filmed to not have ads in them. If it was like old Law & Order episodes, maybe."
The Hook Up Plan,How do you spell duh?
The Hook Up Plan,"It’s weird how people act like offering an ad supported tier stops you from buying the tier without ads. It’s just a way to get more people in the door. 

Some people prioritize money and others prioritize experience. More options isn’t a bad thing."
The Hook Up Plan,"> **Netflix’s new ad-supported plan was the least popular tier of its service in November**, the first month in which the streaming giant offered it, according to subscription analytics firm Antenna.


> **The plan accounted for 9% of new Netflix sign-ups in the U.S. during the month. Some 57% of subscribers to the ad-supported tier in the first month were people re-joining the service or signing up for the first time, while 43% downgraded from pricier plans**, according to Antenna.


> The goal for streaming services that launch lower-cost, ad-supported plans typically is to recruit as many new users as possible, while minimizing those who trade down from more expensive plans.

More details from [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/netflixs-ad-supported-tier-was-its-least-popular-plan-in-launch-month-analytics-firm-estimates-11671539939):

> “Advertising for us is crawl, walk, run. We’re definitely ‘crawl’ right now,” said co-Chief Executive Ted Sarandos earlier this month at an investor conference. Netflix hasn’t publicly forecast how many new customers it expects the new plan to draw.


> **By the end of November, 0.2% of Netflix subscribers in the U.S. were on the ad-supported plan**, Antenna estimated.**The streaming giant’s overall customer additions in the U.S. in November were lower than they were in October,** Antenna found."
The Hook Up Plan,"Doesn’t really matter if its the least popular. If those people are signing up because the no ad plan was too expensive and they wouldn’t have signed up without the ad plan, it’s a huge net plus. 

Y’all can continue to be butthurt about this, it will very easily work out for Netflix."
The Hook Up Plan,Worse than the standard DVD rental plan? I think that may be bad; real bad.
The Hook Up Plan,"I tried it, not only do they limit the shows you can watch but it didn’t work on my Apple TV, chrome cast, Hisense, laptop or phone it only worked on my Samsung tv, what a waste. I’ll go back to paying month by month when a new series I want to watch comes out 😅"
The Hook Up Plan,the point isn't to be popular.  The point is to have a cheap tier they can advertise while raising the price of the other tiers.
The Hook Up Plan,"People don't like adds and the plan is limited to 720p, which might don't sound that horrible until you remember how even 1080p looks pretty crunchy on Netflix due to super low bitrates (4K is ok though)."
The Hook Up Plan,It’s worth the subscription fee not to look at ads.
The Hook Up Plan,"I would MAYBE subscribe if:             
1. It was 1080p.       
2. If it had all content"
The Hook Up Plan,People don't want to pay to watch ads?!  shocking.
The Hook Up Plan,"Bro it cost money AND has ads who the fuck would do that with all free ad supported TV nowadays anyway. If you still  subscribe to Netflix for more than a month a year your doing it wrong anyway. They have 0 rewatchable shows or background TV, we switched from Netflix to Hulu couple years ago because of this."
The Hook Up Plan,"Ahh yes. Ad supported pricing. Which ended up being the original pricing of Netflix when Netflix first came out, had all those HBO shows and was a good service. Now there's nothing good. Everything is shit, it's the old price. But now there's ads. Oh... I love how things are clearly getting better"
The Hook Up Plan,No shit. The whole point of streaming is to escape commercials.
The Hook Up Plan,Canceled and never going back. Fuck greedflix and their shit movies
The Hook Up Plan,The problem is they don't offer enough good shows. I don't care if I safe $5 by watching ads. Sounds like a bad deal.
The Hook Up Plan,I could have told them that
The Hook Up Plan,What’s the over/under on subscription cancellations in the first week?
The Hook Up Plan,"Clearly a bunch of Americans commenting here. If you’re as confused as the author of this article is than you don’t know that much about global streaming trends. The ad tier was never to drive growth in the US. It was created to drive international growth that had slowed. Most people in APAC/India use ad supported streaming apps on their mobile devices, making 720p just fine for resolution, and easier to stream on wireless connections. The new ad tier was created for international growth markets. That’s where people evaluating it’s success should be looking, not in the US."
The Hook Up Plan,"I pay you for NO ads.

If you want ads, _you're_ getting paid still.  Don't expect me to pay you again.

No double-dip."
The Hook Up Plan,[deleted]
The Hook Up Plan,"I hate ads. Like I hate them so much. It’s such an interruption in whatever else you’re doing. Audio ads, video ads, photo ads, banner ads, search engine ads, ads on television, application ads, physical billboards, bus stops, benches, desk wraps, halftime shows, play of the games, lil tiny square shaped skip button. I have heard the name Coca Cola probably 10 million times. 

If HBO wants to *occasionally* show me something else they offer on the app I’m currently using, that’s cool. Anything else? Get fucked."
The Hook Up Plan,Nobody. Wants. Commercials. It’s why we started streaming in the first place. If you ad commercials we will leave.
The Hook Up Plan,People turned to streaming to get away from commercials. Who would've thought adding commercials to your streaming platform wouldn't be popular lmao
The Hook Up Plan,"ads during movies when you sign up to get rid of the annoyance of ads on normal tv is not a smart move, you can do it differently and have more success imo."
The Hook Up Plan,"Look, once I put that remote down, I don’t want to pick it up again to skip ads or adjust the volume because the ad is playing at 10,000 decibels.  Figure out a new way to annoy me, leave TV alone"
The Hook Up Plan,"720p with Ads. What a joke. Hulu and Disney+ with ads is 1080p. Much better value. My mom keeps saying she wants to get rid of HBOMax and get Netflix w/ Ads...on a 1080p TV. I don't care if it's $6.99, if it's a bad value, it's a bad value."
The Hook Up Plan,Maybe when they actually add some content worth watching I'll resub
The Hook Up Plan,"This just in - people hate ads!

We have more on this groundbreaking discovery tonight at 11."
The Hook Up Plan,"I'm just curious, who is still signing up for Netflix these days? Literally everyone I know either has it already or uses someone else's account."
The Hook Up Plan,The ad tier for D+ is still 4k. The ad tier for Netlfix is 720p. It's garbage. Make it 4k like Disney Plus then we're talkin'
The Hook Up Plan,I know most people jump to the conclusion that this is all about the ads. There are many streaming services that are having success with ad-tier services. Those that are successful do not limit the library and resolution in most cases. This isn't as much about the ads. It is about Netflix offering a subpar service.
The Hook Up Plan,"No matter how much Netflix, Disney and HBO/WB try to shovel this AD shit as a good option, which isn't anything more than a cynical cash grab imo. Hopefully we don't fall for it or we might as well head back to standard TV, look at YouTube these days it's Unwatchable with Ads"
The Hook Up Plan,"No shit Sherlock. 
Here's the message loud and clear. 
I don't want to watch ads. Any of them. Ever. 

We're tired of being sold to. I damn sure am not going to PAY for someone to show me ads still. It's that simple."
The Hook Up Plan,"Dear Developers  
Have a paid plan or have ads, these are your choices."
The Hook Up Plan,720p? Just make it free u penny-pinching assholes
The Hook Up Plan,Ads on Netflix defeats the **entire purpose** of Netflix.
The Hook Up Plan,Ill watch youtube before I pay to watch ads like cable TV...
The Hook Up Plan,"In a down economy, people are tired of advertising. Shocking."
The Hook Up Plan,I bet if they paid us to sit through ads it would be the most popular option
The Hook Up Plan,"Listen,  we make the stand now and thier profits be damned. WE DO NOT WANT ADS. If we do have them, its because the service is free. Pay a fee, no ads, have ads , its free. No exceptions, we will mot be tricked like our parents were."
The Hook Up Plan,Almost as if paying a subscription to then *still* have to watch ads is a bad deal D:
The Hook Up Plan,"Holy shit! Who would have thought, a platform that touted no ads and basically forged modern streaming would fall flat with an ad-based tier. 

News flash assholes, no one wants to watch your shitty ads. No one. Make money by making great content, then sell it off after its traffic and popularity stagnates. 

It’s not hard. 

Netflix, purge your board of numb-skull directors. Maybe, just maybe make your content your priority and not advertising."
The Hook Up Plan,"No one likes ads, plus they limit you to one screen and not at 1040/1080, only 720. No  thanks."
The Hook Up Plan,The rial test will be when they put in motion the IP restriction.
The Hook Up Plan,I’d get it if it didn’t cut resolution.
The Hook Up Plan,"I will never pay to watch ads on a streaming service. Ever. If it has ads, it should be a free tier."
The Hook Up Plan,Nothing on Netflix is worth a single ad.
The Hook Up Plan,"I think this shows a lot about the current state of humanity in a way.

Netflix: ""We already make them pay a monthly subscription...but what if we shove ads down their throat until they give us more money?""

Vanguard Shareholders: *Resounding Applause*

Every Netflix user: ""I'd rather fucking kill myself and there's literally nothing you could do to change my mind."""
The Hook Up Plan,"Why the fuck would anyone pay for ads when every single show and movie is available in HD on the internet for free? I’ll pay for quality content that’s conveniently accessible, but the moment you make the service worse than the free alternative, I’m out."
The Hook Up Plan,So 9% of subscribers are people they otherwise wouldn’t have.  How is this a bad thing?
The Hook Up Plan,The sad part about this is they lost out on a big portion of anime because of the ads options. The company that hosts a lot of anime on Netflix decided to pull out because of their decision.
The Hook Up Plan,Thats good for them! They get more money from non-ad plans. So what is everyone upset about?
The Hook Up Plan,If only everyone had predicted this.
The Hook Up Plan,"Let me guess, it’s Henry Cavill’s fault?"
Dogs of Berlin,a poor man's 4 Blocks
Dogs of Berlin,"I love gangster shows/movies I'll watch it any language possible. 

I've heard a lot about the seedy night life of Berlin. This will be fun. 

If you haven't please check out sacred games (make sure it's the original dub with English subtitles)."
Dogs of Berlin,I'm getting a Rob Schneider vibe off the dude on the right
Dogs of Berlin,Fucking Sinan G
Dogs of Berlin,i cant take that actor serious anymore after watching jerks 
Dogs of Berlin,"Exactly what I thought. Dogs of Berlin does seem to have a much higher budget, though. Can't wait to see, which will turn out to be better."
Dogs of Berlin,I've watched the trailer and added Sacred Games to my list. Thanks for the recommendation. 
Dogs of Berlin,Ha!
Dogs of Berlin,I’m getting a Harmony Korine vibe personally
Dogs of Berlin,"I mean the writing and acting is where it is at, so we will see. So far Dogs of Berlin looks worse."
Dogs of Berlin,"As a German I can only say: Stay away from it. Watch Dark or Babylon Berlin if you haven't. Even the ""Das Boot""-series is disappointing."
Dogs of Berlin,"Sounds good I'll give it a go, have a wee upvote."
Dogs of Berlin,"Some opinions from Berlin:  
https://www.reddit.com/r/berlin/comments/a6gqnr/how_accurate_is_the_netflix_show_dogs_of_berlin/"
Dogs of Berlin,I know Berlin isn’t the Mos Eisley hive of scum and villainy depicted in the show but the series was really interesting and consuming for me. What disappoints you about the show?
Dogs of Berlin,"Yeah, production quality is really bad. Story is shit. Just 50min of stereotypes."
Dogs of Berlin,dude it's a fucking show not some history channel stuff
Dogs of Berlin,Germans dont like to be reminded Neo-Nazis and racism are alive and well in Berlin. 
Dogs of Berlin,"I don't like german shows but I really liked a show called ""Deutschland83"" it had everything: good music,good story ,etc.
Hope this series will be good couse I really want to learn german"
Dogs of Berlin,I hope there will be dogs in it
Dogs of Berlin,"seriously thought that said ""Gaiman"" shit! "
Dogs of Berlin,"Most German TV shows are either cheap knock offs of more succesfull and better American or Scandinavian shows or just bad original concepts. I understand there a few exceptions but the overall quality is VERY lackluster. I would also like to differentiate between German TV series and TV movies as those can be quite good at times.

"
Dogs of Berlin,Which German shows do you not like?
Dogs of Berlin,Ideally Rex.
Dogs of Berlin,"German TV is trash. Seriously. The best of german movies and tv shows would be considered mediocre by American standards.

Except of some very, _very_ rare exceptions like Deutschland83."
Dogs of Berlin,When you don't understand a language it's not really fun to watch shows in that specific langauge but D83 (for me) was interesting
Dogs of Berlin,[deleted]
Dogs of Berlin,"All I remember of german shows are Rex, Cobra somethin (hightway cops). I really liked medicopter. But it was Austrian I believe. "
Dogs of Berlin,"I agree with you about german TV series (except Tatortreiniger and some rare others like Deutschland83), but there are a lot of very good german cinema and (fewer) tv movies."
Dogs of Berlin,Found the German. 
Dogs of Berlin,"I love watching subtitled foreign shows, but the show itself needs to be good. Gomorrah is a good example, also really enjoyed D83 :)"
Dogs of Berlin,Have you watched Tatortreiniger? Because that show is great!
Dogs of Berlin,"> Cobra somethin

Alarm für Cobra 11 – Die Autobahnpolizei (Alarm for Cobra 11 – The Highway Police). Has been on air for over 20 years here. [This](http://images.kino.de/flbilder/max09/auto09/auto35/09350052/w964.jpg) is pretty much all you need to know about the series. In case you have forgotten. :D  "
Dogs of Berlin,"You have, indeed, found the german."
Dogs of Berlin,"Ahah, yes, "
Dogs of Berlin,"There was a reasonably popular german show called 4 Blocks (which run on TNT of all places, most people in german don't even know what that is) which was surprisingly good. Dogs of Berlin seems to try cashing in on that but is so cliché ridden that it can't be taken for serious. Not sure how popular it is but here in germany you can see a lot of advertisement for it.

Most critics that reviewed it found it mediocre at best."
Dogs of Berlin,"It is net meant to be, but might appear so. it is just the usual shit that happens when we try to make movies or Television. Sure, Therme are dome. masterpieces here and there, but Overall they are few and far between. Most of the stuff is just shit like dogs of Berlin "
Dogs of Berlin,[deleted]
Dogs of Berlin,[deleted]
Dogs of Berlin,I had was hoping OA would get a season 3
Dogs of Berlin,Glow for sure bothers me. Daybreak was fun and definitely santa Clarita diet
Dogs of Berlin,"I'm not sure what you expect. From shows i've personally watched on this list, Altered Carbon, Luke Cage, Age of Resistance - they finished their current arcs. They might not have Big Finale, but they don't leave some main plots unresolved. Cage and Iron Fists were also cancelled due to Disney pulling their license. Glow got  kinda fucked and got cancelled due to increasing costs of production under COVID regulations. Mindhunter (i assume you mean Netflix production without  *s*) stalled production due to Fincher overthinking everything and moving to other projects.

A lot of best shows in history doesn't have Big Finale. They just... End, and the life continues after cameras are shut down. It doesn't make them in any way bad. Just not every story need Endgame as a finale to tie everything up in neat package. 

For clarity  i would recommend moving all non-originals on the bottom of the list."
Dogs of Berlin,"Deadly Class isn't a Netflix show.

October Faction got cancelled though."
Dogs of Berlin,"My take: very few shows stick the landing. Most shows have to stop, because the audience lost interest, usually because the quality dropped far enough. Why should their finale be anything memorable/mind blowing now? If nothing sticks with me after a series ends, it might as well end on a cliffhanger. Of course I'm sad about premature cancellations of shows I'm currently watching, but it isn't the first and won't be the last time. And when I'm sad about it, then it means it at least entertained me enough to care."
Dogs of Berlin,"Kim's Convenience The last episode they put the lights out, that is not a ending?"
Dogs of Berlin,"I can't do a list, but I know for a fact that I Am Not Okay With This was cut off at a clifflhanger, but to me it still felt quite satisfying. I hope I helped a bit ^^"
Dogs of Berlin,"If it’s not a Netflix Original, it’s not a Netflix show. Take them off the list lol. This thread…"
Dogs of Berlin,"I love this subreddits Netflix hate boner… how is this a “problem” for the service?  Networks have canceled shows forever, good and bad, the only difference here is that those mainly disappear from a catalog and Netflix has them there still.

This isn’t a new practice.  Maybe the idea of this thread isn’t a bad one, but it’s phrased in the same overly dramatic way anything about Netflix is posted here."
Dogs of Berlin,"If you're going to put Iron Fist and Luke Cage on here, you could put all of the other Marvel shows (Daredevil, Punisher, Jessica Jones) on here too. Although I'm not sure they fit as neatly because generally all of the Marvel shows did have resolution to their season plots, just left some foreshadowing for the next seasons open."
Dogs of Berlin,Insatiable
Dogs of Berlin,"Daredevil

The Get Down - it had an ending, but it was clearly very rushed and the fates of certain characters were never revealed

Dogs of Berlin - Netflix never announced a cancellation, but it’s been 2.5 years since it was released and the final episode was inconclusive"
Dogs of Berlin,Crazyhead
Dogs of Berlin,Friends From College.
Dogs of Berlin,Iron Fist and Luke Cage.
Dogs of Berlin,Hemlock Grove had an ending.
Dogs of Berlin,Is altered carbon worth watching without a true ending? I was *just* about to start binging it.
Dogs of Berlin,"I'd love someone else's take, but I wouldn't say Designated Survivor fully had an ending. Netflix took over in Season 3, and then cancelled it."
Dogs of Berlin,"Thanks for adding Messiah, that show was shockingly smart"
Dogs of Berlin,Everything ends brother
Dogs of Berlin,"Probably Glitch Techs, but it still hasn't been officially announced as cancelled."
Dogs of Berlin,It's Bruno does not fit on this list. The first season was very self contained.
Dogs of Berlin,I think you'd be better off with a list of finished shows. That would be very short list.
Dogs of Berlin,The Mist?
Dogs of Berlin,"You have to define what you mean by *ending*. I would not consider many shows on your list, e.g Mind Hunter, need an ending."
Dogs of Berlin,Omg guys calm the fuck down. Its just words its not gonna hurt you. go out and touch some grass or some shit
Dogs of Berlin,[deleted]
Dogs of Berlin,V wars is apparently cancelled
Dogs of Berlin,Sense8 ever get a real ending?
Dogs of Berlin,Tidelands and Altered Carbon.
Dogs of Berlin,Cursed and Jupiters Legacy
Dogs of Berlin,Gypsy
Dogs of Berlin,"4400. Not a Netflix show but being streamed there. Got cancelled just as it was getting good.

Also The Beauty and The Baker. Again, not a Netflix show but streaming."
Dogs of Berlin,"Sword of trust. Actually a great movie, until suddenly it ends very annoyingly & with no real resolution.

I heard that a woman who directed & wrote it died, & that's very sad but releasing it without a real ending was a total bummer."
Dogs of Berlin,"La Revolution and Black Spot

Still salty about those two."
Dogs of Berlin,You could be meta with The OA and say that they're in our world lol
Dogs of Berlin,"Santa Clarita Diet doesn't have a conclusive ending with all questions answered, per se, but the end of it is an ending. If they had placed ""and they lived happily ever after"" on the screen after the last scene it would function perfectly fine as an ending."
Dogs of Berlin,"Defenders was a one off season if memory serves?

ASOUE followed the books so proper ending/planned."
Dogs of Berlin,"So mad about Dark Crystal, Glow and Mindhunter."
Dogs of Berlin,Sense8
Dogs of Berlin,Happy... great show
Dogs of Berlin,"I think insatiable has an ending, a comic ending for a comic series, it leaves open for more, but isint the same as the OA or Santa Clarita that really needed another season."
Dogs of Berlin,Insatiable got canceled after season 2
Dogs of Berlin,The Never Ending Stories TV version
Dogs of Berlin,"""Everything Sucks"" is the one that hurts the most for me because I think it was a pretty great first season and wanted to see more...but I can understand that it probably ended at a decent enough spot...until the guy's dad shows up!"
Dogs of Berlin,Mindhunter is just on hiatus.
Dogs of Berlin,the stranded was officially cancelled. i think its bruno had a nice ending and maybe we will even get new episodes since the show hasnt been cancelled.
Dogs of Berlin,I think I’d rather see a list of shows that have an ending so I k ow which ones to look through.
Dogs of Berlin,Everything sucks. It didn’t end on a cliffhanger but I know it only got one season
Dogs of Berlin,/r/doesitresolve
Dogs of Berlin,"It's been almost a year since it came out, and there's still no news on renewal/cancellation (which makes me think things don't look good for renewal), so I'm not sure if you'd count it, but I would say Julie and the Phantoms."
Dogs of Berlin,"Its ridiculous how much cancelled unfinished shit they have.  Like I've been saying ever since they cancelled Teenage Bounty Hunters, before long, people will need a ""does the dog die dot com,"" except it will be ""does the netflix show get cancelled without a finale dot com.""  Which is exactly what this thread is about in a way.     
         
Ten years from now their back catalog is going to just be a complete minefield of unfished shit that you are afraid to even bother starting.  Not to mention, who wants to start a new netflix show in its first season when the odds are that it gets cancelled are so high?"
Dogs of Berlin,If you're ana Amazon prime member Bosch is a fantastic series!
Dogs of Berlin,"I think only Bojack Horseman, OITNB and House of Cards have endings with only Bojack having a great final season.

I think the original shows that Netflix launched got their time and closure but none of the new stuff really has."
Dogs of Berlin,This should be stickied.
Dogs of Berlin,The show Colony. Notorious example cause they dragged us through a couple seasons
Dogs of Berlin,"Does it count if it's a foreign show Netflix just distributes? If so there's The Stranded. Ended on a cliffhanger, and I have no idea if it ever get a second season."
Dogs of Berlin,"One Day at a Time, though that's also Pop TV's fault and it's a sitcom so not the end of the world"
Dogs of Berlin,Dear White People
Dogs of Berlin,The last man on earth
Dogs of Berlin,I'd also add House of Cards. I know it has ending but definitely not the original one. They must have had to change lot of things.
Dogs of Berlin,Manifest. Started watching then found out it was canceled
Nailed It! Holiday!,I wish this show had more episodes a season. It seems like it would be a cheap and quick show to make.
Nailed It! Holiday!,I stopped watching when I saw jason mantzoukas show up. I don't need to know anything else. I'll be there day one.
Nailed It! Holiday!,"Watched the whole trailer just to see an air date. 11/22, saved you a click."
Nailed It! Holiday!,I love this show so much. It never fails to put a smile on my face.
Nailed It! Holiday!,This show makes me so happy
Nailed It! Holiday!,This show is so daft. But just watching this trailer made me giggle.
Nailed It! Holiday!,"Nicole is so amazing and there is no show without her. She deserves the world, a producer credit, and more."
Nailed It! Holiday!,Scheer and Zouks are great but where the hell are the doughboys?
Nailed It! Holiday!,I agree. I'm surprised they don't pump dozens out at a time.
Nailed It! Holiday!,"Nicole Byer has talked on her podcast about how grueling and long episodes take to film. I think I remember her saying 13+ hour work days, since each episode is filmed in one day, and they film like a bunch in a row. Then a lot of ADR, etc."
Nailed It! Holiday!,You stopped?
Nailed It! Holiday!,"Here's a tip, scroll to the end"
Nailed It! Holiday!,Maybe that's their trick? They're smart to know people want more so they intentionally stifle supply so we don't over-indulge and get bored with the formula.
Nailed It! Holiday!,"They have nailed it Spain, Mexico, France, and probably a few more I've forgotten.  Spain you can talk everyone is just going through the motions but Mexico had been pretty good so far."
Nailed It! Holiday!,"Nicole Byer is really blowing up and pretty busy. They might not have expected the show to be this popular, and the 3 of them probably all have varying schedules

I'm here for more of it though!"
Nailed It! Holiday!,"Jacques is I think the only person that is on a baking show that loses weight each season. 

Probably helps that it's all terrible, but still... he looks like he lost some more weight."
Nailed It! Holiday!,"Two things that I really love, Nailed It and Jason Mantzoukas. KUMATE KUMATE.  "
Nailed It! Holiday!,OMG The Guest Judge is going to be Jason Mantzoukas?! Yes. This will make an already-great show even greater. 
Nailed It! Holiday!,I’m glad it’s not just 1 Christmas episode but a whole short season. Also OH SHIT JASON MANTZOUKAS? IM SO HYPED! 
Nailed It! Holiday!,OMG this is super exciting. I love this show so much. The judges are so funny and wholesome. 
Nailed It! Holiday!, Awesome! I love the show. I found the host really annoying at first but she grew on me quickly. 
Nailed It! Holiday!,Hated the last episode - DIY! They changed baking to crafting. Not as fun as watching people bake and Nicole's energy was obviously not the same. Even the set looks...plain
Nailed It! Holiday!,"> Jacques is I think the only person that is on a baking show that loses weight each season.

This is too funny. Also, that old lady that was hitting on him from season 2 looks to be back."
Nailed It! Holiday!,"First few seconds of the video 'Oh, huh, looks like they've brought in a new co-host for this Holiday one.'

New co-host speaks.

'Holy shit, that Jacques! But that person doesn't look like Jacques...'"
Nailed It! Holiday!,Omg.have been meaning to watch this.  Now there’s more of a reason! “What’s up jerks?”
Nailed It! Holiday!,"WHAT'S UP, JERKS?!"
Nailed It! Holiday!,“Nailed it” is a Jacobs Ladder situation confirmed
Nailed It! Holiday!,Heynong man
Nailed It! Holiday!,GIVE ME THAT BABY
Nailed It! Holiday!,This show is a guilty pleasure of mine. Nice to watch a competition show that doesn’t take itself too seriously 
Nailed It! Holiday!,7 new episodes on December 7th.
Nailed It! Holiday!,"Season 1 was great. 

Season 2... meh. 

Season one the show had no fucking clue what it was. You could tell everyone was like, I have no clue what is happening but this works... i think? 

Season 2 they knew and it felt forced. 

Still watching the holiday season though. "
Nailed It! Holiday!,Sweet thanks! Wife and I love this!

Nailed It! Holiday!,I really enjoyed reading about this man's childhood trauma. Glad he shared it with the world.
Nailed It! Holiday!,I can’t believe that Festivus is this big cultural phenomenon when in reality there’s only like 3 minutes of festivus related plot in the Seinfeld episode

Nailed It! Holiday!,">O’Keefe’s father also coined the term, “A Festivus for the rest of us,” which ended up in the show. But it had nothing to do with class consciousness or the fight against Christmas commercialism — it was about the sudden death of O’Keefe’s grandmother in 1976.

Nailed It! Holiday!,Festivus is your heritage George. It's part of who you are...
Nailed It! Holiday!,One if my favorite things in life are when people place Festivus Poles in holiday displays
Nailed It! Holiday!,"“Cougar, my son tells me your company stinks!”

*”…Oh God.”*

“Quiet, you’ll get yours in a minute!”"
Nailed It! Holiday!,"So, similar to fetivus my grandfather (also a new york jew) had made up the ""scumbag of the year awards) aka the STY awards, where you would state your case why this person or that person who did you wrong diserived the ultimate award, on occasion, my father would write songs about them, being the musician that he was. I still remeber some lines to ""crazy Steve's lament"" and ""All Frank's Suck"". The award ceremony would take place on New Years eye (or some point between Christmas and NYE) when we would all get together...when I first saw the festival episode I was a child still and I was like oh. They do their version of the STY awards....."
Nailed It! Holiday!,"The local bar used to let us bring an aluminum pole in every 23rd haha

So obviously I watched the episode and something struck me, if frank says he hasn’t celebrated festivus in years, why did he send George the card?"
Nailed It! Holiday!,this needs to get to the top of everything
Nailed It! Holiday!,"Hello, woman."
Nailed It! Holiday!,I would like to have been in the writers room when he told that story.
Nailed It! Holiday!,"Spike Feresten (writer on Seinfeld. Wrote the soup nazi episode) just had Dan O’keefe on the latest episode of his podcast (Spike’s Car Radio). He revealed that his father had created other fake holidays, besides Festivus."
Nailed It! Holiday!,But did he air his grievances?
Nailed It! Holiday!,This is amazing. 25 years later and the show still continues to surprise and amuse us. Legendary!
Nailed It! Holiday!,"After that Jets game last night, Festivus couldn’t have come at a better time"
Nailed It! Holiday!,That was a fun read. Thanks for sharing it!
Nailed It! Holiday!,"I assure you, Festivus is a tradition that is *all too real*. I could prove it, if you like."
Nailed It! Holiday!,We will be watching tonight in homage to Mr Daniel O’Keefe.
Nailed It! Holiday!,"“Oh I got denim vest checking me out.”



“No, please! Denim vest! He’s smoothing it!”"
Nailed It! Holiday!,"Dammit! Even Festivus was spawned from a bed of lies!! 
Is there nothing honest and sacred in this world?!?"
Nailed It! Holiday!,"I loved Seinfeld, I’ve watched it start to finish about 10 times, but I really can’t stand George and Jerry’s parents"
Nailed It! Holiday!,"If he didn’t want it on the show and kept secret, he shouldn’t have told them all about it! But thank you for doing so!"
Nailed It! Holiday!,Get this racist out of here
Nailed It! Holiday!,Yea right
Nailed It! Holiday!,Probably my favorite episode.
Nailed It! Holiday!,"This is funnier to me because a U.S. Army Colonel who was also an optometrist examining my eyes told me the same thing. She scolded me for being lazy and not trying hard enough. “You’re not even squinting, you already gave up.”"
Nailed It! Holiday!,It’s till a holiday.
Nailed It! Holiday!,A festivus for the rest of us!
Nailed It! Holiday!,"I remember reading an article about a defense attorney who was registering his client for incarceration… Forgive me of the details because I’m not an attorney and I don’t recall the specifics or how the court system works or whatever but… where the form asked for the defendants religion, the attorney, obviously a smart ass, wrote down “Festivus”. And the clerk registered it. And on that day, Festivus became an actual legally recognized religion.

Note: i’m lazy so if there are any other Redditor’s that want to do the research or have specific knowledge of this, please chime in and comment!"
Nailed It! Holiday!,He sounded pretty gruff about it in the interview on Spike’s Car Radio podcast.
Nailed It! Holiday!,Nah he just wrote a book about festivus and how to celebrate it.
Nailed It! Holiday!,I got a lot of problems with you people and now you're gonna hear about it!
Nailed It! Holiday!,And feats of strengths!
Nailed It! Holiday!,"""Until you pin me, George, Festivus isn't over"""
Nailed It! Holiday!,"i always thought he said ""you just read! you read!"" TIL"
Nailed It! Holiday!,This is how to start a Sprint Retrospective at work.
Nailed It! Holiday!,"Did a Halloween bar crawl with friends this year and my fiancé and I went as George’s parents and this is how I started most conversations at each bar we went to

Nailed It! Holiday!,"Have you seen the pole, Krueger?"
Nailed It! Holiday!,Best line on the show even better with the full context of him leading up to that line.
Nailed It! Holiday!,Early Seinfeld episodes are a bit more grounded than later ones; the early episodes mainly rely on poking fun at real social situations while they go a bit zany in Season 8-9 after Larry David left the show. But both are great and hilarious
Nailed It! Holiday!,My all time favorite Seinfeld line came from this episode. “Hey how did my horse do?” “He had to be shot”
Nailed It! Holiday!,"I think the show sort of made a deliberate effort later on to create these sort of iconic, “viral” moments that it had become known for. The show always seemed to have a lot of catch phrases or outrageous moments that just stuck in popular culture, but I feel like in those last couple of seasons they just reeeally leaned into the quotable nature of the show.

The Elaine Dance, Yada Yada Yada, Man Hands, Festivus, etc. are all from those last couple of seasons and are some of the most repeated/iconic parts of the show. The last couple of seasons might feel slightly different, but like you said, it’s crazy how successful they were even at the end of the show’s run!"
Nailed It! Holiday!,"I noticed this too when I was perusing the Netflix catalog.

Season 9 absolutely fucking *slapped*.  So many iconic episodes right at the end. They went out on a high note for sure."
Nailed It! Holiday!,wasn't a big part of the show ending because Jerry and others wanted to end it while it was still great? i mean how often does that happen.
Nailed It! Holiday!,"After David left they went balls to the wall and after finding their feet it's pretty much hit after hit. I personally think Seinfeld is the greatest comedy through it's entire runtime, but those last two seasons hit such a perfectly absurd vibe that I don't think any show has replicated"
Nailed It! Holiday!,"The soup nazi, the bottle deposits, the rye, the chicken roster, the summer of George, the yada yada, the sponge, the bizarro jerry, the little kicks, the serenity now, the merv griffin show.

Some fans didn’t like the late seasons but  they were good in my opinion."
Nailed It! Holiday!,"I can’t believe the writer didn’t want Festivus for the rest of us, though."
Nailed It! Holiday!,"Also amazes me how the festivus scene is just a couple minutes long at the very end. And the episode isn’t called festivus it’s The Strike

Heyyyyyy no bagel no bagel no bagel no bagel"
Nailed It! Holiday!,Yeah people rag on season 9 but it has some of my favorites
Nailed It! Holiday!,Really good point!
Nailed It! Holiday!,The last season still had so many gems! Obviously the finale was lackluster but overall it definitely ended before it declined
Nailed It! Holiday!,It didn't really get popular until 3rd or 4th season. So prob most people who remember the peak didn't even watch a good chunk of the episodes that exist.
The Inmate,"Half way through the fourth season now, Loving it.. but I heard to goes downhill from here"
The Inmate,"I love seeing O'Reily in the All State commercials, definitely my favorite character in OZ"
The Inmate,"Peter.

Peter Marie."
The Inmate,"I'm literally sitting in history of television watching the pilot right now.
update: That was fucking ace, about to watch the first season."
The Inmate,"Aww, I thought this was going to be about an urban *Wizard of Oz* remake."
The Inmate,"I'm sorry, but Jaz was a biker. The bikers may be associated with the Aryan Brotherhood, they are not the same thing. Also, if the Others is counted as a gang, which is was in the committee in the show, then you can't just lump in Shirley Bellinger, she was never affiliated with any of them. 

Furthermore, if I were doing this type of thing, I would include the officers and management and such into it, but that's just me."
The Inmate,They're a few years late on this aren't they?
The Inmate,I haven't watched it forever. Time to get the torrents going.
The Inmate,The never got a proper ending which always pisses me off.
The Inmate,"Honestly, the only reason I would call bad is the 6th one. Whenever I rewatch it, it's the only season I can't wait to be over."
The Inmate,"Doesn't go downhill at all. The final season is a bit weak, in most part because of the ending.



Still loved every episode."
The Inmate,Sick Amore.
The Inmate,I actually watch it about this time every year.
The Inmate,cant wait for that
The Inmate,I feel that. I do the same thing with The Wire.
The Inmate,"I too love The Wire, and just did a re-watch of that about a month ago! I squealed with joy when I heard Carcetti was going to be Littlefinger."
The Inmate,It’s Taylor Sheridan Ray Donovan
The Inmate,I'm really enjoying this sequel to Mare of Easttown
The Inmate,"i'm halfway through episode 1 after being really excited for this show for months and [spoiler](#s ""i'm beyond sad to see Chandler killed off so early. i should've seen the signs up until now"")."
The Inmate,"Damn, reviews aren't looking too good. Shame, i like Taylor Sheridan's frontier trilogy but his other stuff doesn't seem to match that kind of quality."
The Inmate,the mom literally makes every bad decision and is annoying the hell out of me
The Inmate,"2nd episode is already out and clears up basically every question you asked.

but if you’re lazy, they are fixers who took on a client who told them where cash was hidden for when he got out, they get a cut for keeping it. the tertiary characters you see are the other brother and the mom which will be explained later. they hint at the father establishing the business years earlier so they have influence based on family and their own ties with each gang

a gang member got wind of the money and made some bad choices and stole the money. mafia wants the money back, but them being “fixers” means they have to be fair and play both sides; this dilemma now means they cannot be impartial and need to pick a side shortly."
The Inmate,"Taylor Sheridan should have done a show about tribal police in the 80s/90s in the same vein as True Detective. Damn, now I really want this show."
The Inmate,"Not that many characters. That being said, tuned in for Kyle Chandler. I should have known with all the promos saying Mayor of Kingstown, & showing a whole lotta of Renner-yet on the show Chandler is the mayor....."
The Inmate,"I can't decide if I like it very much, either. Jeremy Renner's character is gruff and a force to be reckoned with, while the cop brother seems to be weak and afraid of his own shadow."
The Inmate,[deleted]
The Inmate,"This show gets stupider every week with each episode. Now the main character is surprised at racism even though he's been to prison 😆 This is like a live action cartoon of a bad ass wannabe's wet dream!

Is Yellowstone this f-ing stupid?"
The Inmate,clear eyes full hearts cant lose
The Inmate,"Yeah, it's looking more and more like that first trilogy was a flash in the pan.  He might be stretching himself too thin.  Looking at his IMDb, those three movies were the only projects he did from 2015-2017.  Now he has multiple shows and movies coming out each year and isn't getting the same amount of time to hone the scripts like he originally was."
The Inmate,"Seems like it got decent reviews on IMDB (7.2 overall, and 9.1 on episode 1). 

Not sure why it differs so much. The show does have a higher than average number of both 10-star and 1-star votes, so maybe it's just polarizing for some reason. But this wouldn't be the first time a show gets panned by critics but decent ratings by the audience."
The Inmate,Watch the show.  Its entertaining.  Most of the reviews are negative because the show isn't bending over backwards to make a political statement about prisons and gangs and race.
The Inmate,"Yeah, I watched the first two episodes and was left disappointed by it."
The Inmate,Don't be a nit picky bitch. Learn to enjoy things.
The Inmate,I'm stunned they killed a certain character but im liking it so far.
The Inmate,"I understood that much. However, it's sloppily done, which makes it difficult to follow. It's also woefully unrealistic. I'm not buying the basic concept. And some of the stuff seems laughable. I mean, it's just a damn good thing that the guy in prison had the good sense to bury his money in the same city where he's serving his sentence."
The Inmate,"So do you take any of this back… or?

Show is garbage. Sorry. 🙃"
The Inmate,"So, IMDB shows Chandler in all episodes. I wonder if we will get a lot of backstory. I could see that being used to explain how this strange dynamic of power developed."
The Inmate,"No, you might've watched the wrong episode.

the first episode start with a kid hitting a tennis ball."
The Inmate,"I kept watching, but I can barely follow what's happening in the show. I watch Succession with no confusion every week. I'd say Succession is much more cerebral. There are a few nice moments to this show. I like them sitting on the street looking at the stars and shooting the breeze. But this dude showing up to every crime scene and being treated like he's someone special is silly. It's a preposterous concept."
The Inmate,This show is one of the best shows on tv. You dont watch much tv do you.
The Inmate,https://i.imgur.com/KcVydhF.png
The Inmate,I should not have revealed that spoiler.
The Inmate,can't stay?
The Inmate,"I’ve been saying he is spreading himself too thin for a while now. Doing rewrites on scripts, making movies, show running multiple series, the guy’s trying to make the most of being hot right now, but I think it is cooling his career overall (at least in terms of quality; Yellowstone’s ridiculous ratings assure him getting whatever he wants for a show for the next several years). I think he’s become a bit arrogant, too; he’s bragged in interviews about Hell or High Water (originally titled Comancheria) being a first draft that was made without rewrites. I feel like that’s made him be less critical of his work overall, which has led to a drop in quality."
The Inmate,"That's funny because the show's official synopsis couldn't be more political.

>The McLusky family are power brokers tackling themes of systemic racism, corruption and inequality in Kingstown, Michigan--where the business of incarceration is the only thriving industry."
The Inmate,yeah i didn't want to spoil it but tim riggins would be real upset right now
The Inmate,"still watching the show but i'm supremely disappointed. this is a PERFECT ROLE for said person and I'm pissed they wasted the person's talent for such a short time....that being said, the rest of the cast seems to be giving it their A-game so i'm still invested."
The Inmate,"It totally caught me off guard. I kept saying how excited I was to see [redacted] in this show, but… well ya know."
The Inmate,you’ve barely watched an hour of a 10 hour show - chill
The Inmate,"about as garbage as your life, not my fault you struggle to follow basic concepts. 

your opinions are trash. sorry."
The Inmate,Shows do that to throw off any potential spoilers.
The Inmate,One can only hope. BUt IMDB has had it's issues with not listing actors/characters....or listing a character past their expiration.
The Inmate,He is an ex cop you idiot
The Inmate,"Succession is frigging AWESOME! This new thing on Showtime called Yellowjackets is cool twisted fun too.

This is just outright stupid shit being written by people who think they know something and depending on the clueless minds of the MTV crowd to make it successful.

It kind of reminds me of Sons Of Anarchy where Jax was supposed to be next in line to lead the gang but he was so stupid it took him the entire series to read his father's book 😆"
The Inmate,I try to stick to quality writing that makes sense along with being entertaining and maybe makes you think. I don't like stuff fake tough guys jerk off too.
The Inmate,pain
The Inmate,those kind of themes aren't going to be fully fleshed out in just two episodes anyway.
The Inmate,We need to win these games for...
The Inmate,"I personally look forward to Hawkeye going medieval on some folks for revenge.

Edit...whoah. ok."
The Inmate,"You may enjoy it. But it doesn't take much to know that it's not something I like. Yellowstone is much better. Yellowstone has great characters and good dialogue. This show seems more plot-driven. And, really, the plot of Yellowstone is kind of absurd, too, right? I mean, how many wars can one ranch family face? It's like they took Sons of Anarchy and just switched out the hogs for horses. Even the tough old broad character and the conflicted son and the loyal enforcer were stolen from SOA. But I'm wandering off topic."
The Inmate,"Of course he is. An ex-cop who went to prison but is somehow still allowed to hang around crime scenes and dictate instructions to federal, state and local law enforcement. I know some ex-cops who went to prison. They don't get to hang around with the real cops. Apparently, there's not a newspaper or TV station in that area. By the way, do you really think it's necessary to call people names? Are you in middle school?"
The Inmate,"I think Yellowstone and SOA was overrated and very uninteresting. This has lots of action, lots of character developments. I mean they are all shit, but thats just the nature of the show. Its not for everyone but its pretty good and Jeremy is a good actor."
The Inmate,"ahahhah hows that for a surprise 

was really hoping for a ""you ever used one of these before?"" 

""....once or twice"""
The Inmate,Watch Mr. Inbetween on Hulu. You’ll like that much better.
The Inmate,"yellowstone and SOA are both unrealistic soap operas, same as this. if you dont like these kinds of shows i suggest you try a different genre"
The Inmate,Its a fictitious city with prison's surrounding it. It is what it is. If its not your cup of tea so be it.
The Inmate,Hawkeye is actually more realistic than this horseshit and makes more sense as well. There is also less heavy handed in your face drama like cutting off a dog's balls instead of putting it to sleep - how f-ing stupid was that scene?!
The Inmate,"I see it's not getting great reviews but....I really like it. Halfway through ep 2 and I'm going to keep it going.

But..as a Michigan attorney I'm bothered by them having a death row case since we don't have that here except for the 1 Federal prison, but I'll let it slide."
The Inmate,Yo that didn't even occur to me but that's so funny. Damn I'm high af if seeing Renner himself shooting a bow and arrow and not a single Hawkeye reference popped in my head
The Inmate,"I've always wondered what the body count was on SOA. Hell, in the final season Jax probably racks up 30 bodies solo"
The Inmate,"Lol, for someone who grew up on all....all the soaps-I just don't get some saying Yellowstone is a soap. It's a serial drama."
The Inmate,Its a metaphor and theme of the specific episode. The dog was neutered just like the head of each gang was neutered. How hard is that to understand. And dog was not put down which is a good thing. You want the dog to die? WTF?
The Inmate,"oh yeah it gets out of hand real quick on SOA, and you can tell he gets a lot of his influence for the serialized tv shows there. Yellowstone is just SOA on horses and this show so far just seems fairly similar but from a prison perspective vs the outlaw/cowboy look he usually does"
The Inmate,"Wow, almost as much as the real biker wars of the 90s in Quebec"
The Inmate,"It's not hard to understand. Thanks for explaining a heavy handed cartoon metaphor that is completely ridiculous and unnecessary.

The show is an unintended comedy written for simpletons using over acting, drama queen situations. There is absolutely zero subtleties. Everything is in your face garbage and every situation is a big deal. It's stupid, silly and has no basis in reality at all. Half the time I can't help laughing at scenes that are supposed to be serious.

I don’t care how many articles you show me saying it's based on reality or how many creative writing 101 techniques you try and tv-splain to me. This show is total bullsh#t."
The Inmate,So far I think the show is cool. I like Renner in this idgaf role. But hey he's no Jax Teller yet
The Inmate,My wife and I call it Cowboys of Anarchy. Also interesting is that Taylor Sheridan played Hale on SoA
The Inmate,Did you watch the Miniseries? Definitely go back and watch that first if you haven't seen it. It sets up the show on Earth. It's like 2-3 episodes long.
The Inmate,"1. Series Viewing order is: 
 * BSG Mini-Series (2003) -> this shows the destruction of the colonies 
 * Season 1 - 3
 * Battlestar Galactica: Razor (2007)-> plays at the same time as Season 1 and 2 but has spoilers for Season 3
 * Season 4
 * Battlestar Galactica: The Plan (2009) -> whole show from the Cylons perspective
2. Keep Watching -> this was one the watercooler talking points when the show aired
3.  Some of the ships in the civilian fleet have hydroponic gardens. IIRC the Galactica also has military rations.
4. Yes"
The Inmate,Did you watch the miniseries/movie pilot thing before beginning the show proper?
The Inmate,Sounds like you haven't watched the pilot miniseries. Definitely start with that before you go any further.
The Inmate,"1 - Yes, sort of. There was second series called Galactica 80, where the Galactica arrived at Earth in 1980. It featured some of the original cast and some other characters were replaced by their characters children.

2 - Keep watching

3 - There are a couple of hydroponic ships in the fleet. One in the fleet shots has 3 domes attached to it. They were going to do a scene in a meat locker at one point, with a line about it being the ""most secure room in the fleet"" but it was too cold and impractical to do.

4 - Yes."
The Inmate,[deleted]
The Inmate,"Can't speak to the original series, never watched it.

2: Keep watching.

3: Keep watching.

4: Keep watching (I think).

That's the best information I can give.  I guess that kinda sucks. Sorry.

This show will give you lots of questions, the answers to which can often be found just by continuing to watch."
The Inmate,Can someone give me the name of those episodes/the miniseries we should watch before continuing with the 2004 series?
The Inmate,"No but will do, thanks!"
The Inmate,The first scene of the pilot is one of the best scenes in sci fi TV ever. Sets the tone brilliantly.
The Inmate,I remember there being webisodes in between seasons 3 and 4 too. Provides some fairly important character building.
The Inmate,Didn't know there was one but will do.
The Inmate,">There was second series called Galactica 80, where the Galactica arrived at Earth in 1980. 

Hm I thought this 2004 one was the second series."
The Inmate,Ah good to know. Had only found the other subreddit that's been dormant for 7 years.
The Inmate,I don't mind a bit of mystery but I'm losing patience lol.
The Inmate,"Good point. 

The webisodes are reintegrated into Razor in the DVD/Bluray cut except for one or two of them.  So it might be worthwhile to check out the ones missing."
The Inmate,"There were 3 sets of webisodes

Resistance - between season 2 & 3

Razor - end of the first Cylon war

Face of the Enemy - between 4a & 4b"
The Inmate,Yeah its pretty confusing as it's never included as the start of season 1 but it's technically the first ep and is pretty important so I would watch that asap.
The Inmate,"The original got cancelled after one season but they gave it another go but on an even lower budget. So some ways it's original flavour BSG season 2 but it is a separate show. 

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080221/"
The Inmate,I probably wouldn't visit any BSG related anythings until you've finished.
The Inmate,"This may not be the show for you, then.  This show will drive you crazy if you don't like to discover through watching.  There will be more questions than answers for a huge portion of the show.  If that's the case you might want to consider cutting your losses and finding something more to your liking.

It's one of my favorite shows of all time but I know it isn't everyone's cup of tea."
The Inmate,[Wikipedia says that the pilot for the OG BSG cost $8m in 1978](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_%281978_TV_series). Running that through an inflation calculator gives a figure of over $30m dollars in 2020. OG BSG was many things but cheap wasn't one of them...
The Inmate,"No no, I'm enjoying it."
Ronny Chieng International Student,Watched the series on CC app and loved it.
Ronny Chieng International Student,Is comedy central going to be putting more shows on youtube? So much better than going through the app.
Ronny Chieng International Student,"I'm sad he's basically too big now to make a season 2.  This show is great if anyone hasn't seen it yet.  Also, you should trust my recommendation because I have very very basic bitch taste."
Ronny Chieng International Student,I watched and loved it when it first aired in Australia. The co-op yoghurt is one of the grossest things I've ever seen. 
Ronny Chieng International Student,It's one of the most accurate depictions of law schools I've seen. I enjoyed it a lot.
Ronny Chieng International Student,can it be streamed in america?  do we need Acorn subscription or something?
Ronny Chieng International Student,The first episode was lame so did it get way better?
Ronny Chieng International Student,"I'm watching it now. Its pretty good so far. 

I do think he missed an opportunity - instead of making the love interest a white woman, he should have had an asian woman. "
Ronny Chieng International Student,"It's one of the most memorable concepts I've seen on TV in years.  It would be a great gimmick for Uber drivers who want to make an impression, adding large garbage bags of warm yogurt, hanging on the backs of the seats for their passengers to dip into for a snack. Bring your own spoon or just use your hand"
Ronny Chieng International Student,It was streaming free in the comedy Central app last week but requires a log in now 🙁
Ronny Chieng International Student,Hmm kind of but not really.  I like the co-op episode  and the extension quest the best.  But if you didn't like the pilot it's probably not your kind of humor. 
Ronny Chieng International Student,extension quest was so awesome. My favorite episode of the season!!
Ronny Chieng International Student,Yeah except these days China runs the universities behind the scenes.
Ronny Chieng International Student,"As a Southeast Asian kid who went to university as an international student in Australia, this is the first time I've ever been represented in mainstream western media"
Ronny Chieng International Student,I saw the pilot that was made for a competition (that it won) last year.   It was definitely lots of fun.
Ronny Chieng International Student,I'm loving this show so far. The video game episode with the sperm virus was so fucking funny. 
Ronny Chieng International Student,Is this a movie or tv show?
Ronny Chieng International Student,What channel is this on? 
Ronny Chieng International Student,"I am really happy to see another Asian TV show. Hopefully it doesn't rely to heavily of stereotypes. This looks similar to 21. 

RIP Dr. Ken"
Ronny Chieng International Student,"Ronny has a habit of winning competitions - he got his break in stand-up by winning Raw Comedy, the nationwide open mic competition set up by the Melbourne Comedy Festival"
Ronny Chieng International Student,"its a tv series hes showing, there are a couple mini yt clips on the trailer page"
Ronny Chieng International Student,abc you can watch all episodes online via abciview for free 
Ronny Chieng International Student,just an FYI its not stereotypical watch some of the teasers on the page
Ronny Chieng International Student,"To clarify, that's the Australian ABC, I think it's on Comedy Central in the US

"
Ronny Chieng International Student,I'm only seeing the pilot episode. Any help?
Ronny Chieng International Student,The first 5 episodes are already aired in Australia. The US (comedy central) gets it after
Ronny Chieng International Student,The first 4-5 episodes are online. Try using your favorite *illegal* streaming website
Ronny Chieng International Student,"Na pls dont , this is the first time ive seen accurate australian unilife watch it on their official page to support his work"
Ronny Chieng International Student,"yeah, unfortunately, we americans can't. unless until a few months later"
Ronny Chieng International Student,you can watch the miniclips like this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1TRIe2Q1kA
Ronny Chieng International Student,This is from 20th Television which means international audiences will see this on Disney+ as well.
Ronny Chieng International Student,Great! But I want Daisy Johnson back in the MCU
Ronny Chieng International Student,This sounds fun! I love the premise.
Ronny Chieng International Student,"Ronny is great. He has a few comedy specials on Netflix. Went in never having heard of him and loved them. Anyone needs a laugh, check them out."
Ronny Chieng International Student,Great. She hasn't been working for quite a while now.
Ronny Chieng International Student,"""Forget it, Jake. It's Interior Chinatown."""
Ronny Chieng International Student,"Ronny and Chloe?! Love them both, sign me up"
Ronny Chieng International Student,This sounds awesome. Love everyone already associated with this show
Ronny Chieng International Student,I'm interested but also have no idea what I just read.
Ronny Chieng International Student,her face is crooked
Ronny Chieng International Student,Premise sounds uninteresting; why should viewers care?
Ronny Chieng International Student,the book was quite unique and the cast and behind-the-scenes pedigree so far are making this very interesting!
Ronny Chieng International Student,In China as well? How many Asians outside of China?
Ronny Chieng International Student,"She was never in the MCU

🍿"
Ronny Chieng International Student,Really good book! Very meta.
Ronny Chieng International Student,I’d rather that than see her trapped in a CW’d out live action Powerpuff Girls series. No one deserves that
Ronny Chieng International Student,Your comment is uninteresting. Why should anyone care?
Ronny Chieng International Student,Definitely!  She deserves higher quality work than CW hell.
Ronny Chieng International Student,"He's the best guy on The Daily Show by far, really puts off a ""I don't give a shit"" attitude and it makes him that much more funny."
Ronny Chieng International Student,"I had never heard of this guy, stopped watching the Daily Show years before he was there, but his standup popped up while I was scrolling Netflix and I gave it a shot. This dude is really funny. He's also going to be in Shang Chi, one of Marvel's next movies. Hope his career takes off."
Ronny Chieng International Student,The segment: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbsoUh2oktE
Ronny Chieng International Student,"Ronny started doing stand-up about four years before me in Melbourne, Australia. By all accounts, he was insanely good at it from day one. He was already a very well known comic here by the time I started, which was impressive given he'd been at it for such a short time. To put it in context, most comics need about a decade just to get name recognition and a solid fanbase in their home country. He did it in four years, and within the next five years, he landed a role in Crazy Rich Asians, got a gig on the Daily Show, and released his first Netflix special. Really formidable talent.

He's also a really nice guy, based on  the two times I've met him in person. I was impressed that he remembered my name, since the first encounter was only about 8 seconds."
Ronny Chieng International Student,"I don't think I've ever seen Ronny Chieng miss. He has always been great on TDS, his standup special on Netflix was great, and his tv show Ronny Chieng International Student is hilarious."
Ronny Chieng International Student,"I...don't get it. The headline in the article is the same as OPs title, yet the content of the article is all about Trump getting covid and nothing about Ronny Chieng..."
Ronny Chieng International Student,"Seriously underrated comedian...

Check out his special on Netflix. It’s one of the few ones that can actually make you laugh out loud."
Ronny Chieng International Student,Doom Guy?
Ronny Chieng International Student,"He's really underrated.

Love his standup."
Ronny Chieng International Student, Honey? Where's my super suit?
Ronny Chieng International Student,Like Jude Law in Contagion.
Ronny Chieng International Student,Is it just me or is everyone who works for Trevor Noah much funnier than Trevor Noah?
Ronny Chieng International Student,"You can vape in the hood! Lol just watched that bit last night, pretty good stuff. I'm happy the daily show has been continuing to make some quality political commentary after Trevor took over. I still miss Jon all the time though..."
Ronny Chieng International Student,I don’t know if I would call a bag over his head a super suit.
Ronny Chieng International Student,He's with Trevor Noah. I wish comedy central was with Hulu!!! Come on Viacom.
Ronny Chieng International Student,"Honey, where is my super suit?"
Ronny Chieng International Student,What suit is that?
Ronny Chieng International Student,His show International Student is also excellent if anyone hasn't seen it
Ronny Chieng International Student,I'm Canadian - where can I watch this?
Ronny Chieng International Student,"Y'know what didn't win Late Night this week?

The Daily Show ripping off Michael Spicer."
Ronny Chieng International Student,I have seen exactly 3 episodes of Daily Show in the last couple years and Ronnie Chieng absolutely killed it every time. One of the funniest additions the show has ever made
Ronny Chieng International Student,This is the worst headline I’ve ever seen.  This wins the award for probably multiple sentence-structure violations.  I’m impressed.  👍🏻
Ronny Chieng International Student,It blows my mind that people still watch late night shows.
Ronny Chieng International Student,I knew that voice was familiar. He voices the main character on scissor seven!
Ronny Chieng International Student,"This is the guy that should star in a new The Office!

Do it now! Make it happen!"
Ronny Chieng International Student,Phoebe Bridgers 💜
Ronny Chieng International Student,I had a stroke reading this
Ronny Chieng International Student,Looks like Hitler helping Dustan Hoffman fight Ebola
Ronny Chieng International Student,"I’m having breakfast in the background of this cover photo.  And when I saw this I legit though “oh a crazy person with a space suit and someone filming him bothering people, typically NYC day”"
Ronny Chieng International Student,I would totally wear a hood like that at work
Ronny Chieng International Student,I need a head condom filled with laughing gas
Ronny Chieng International Student,The Asian Stephen Colbert
Ronny Chieng International Student,is there a reupload for people outside the US?
Ronny Chieng International Student,"Me: Mom I need a new supersuit 

Mom: We have supersuits at home

The supersuits at home:"
Ronny Chieng International Student,Yes- hadn’t seen much of Ronny since Covid and this bit was excellent. He should be in every episode.
Ronny Chieng International Student,His Netflix special was hilarious.
Ronny Chieng International Student,Where do I buy it.
Ronny Chieng International Student,"Fucking lunatic. A year ago we would’ve laughed at them and called them crazy, but now everyone’s gone crazy."
Ronny Chieng International Student,Is Late Night a game show? What did he win?
Ronny Chieng International Student,I caught his show in Montreal last year and happily bought the merch he was selling afterward which was a pair of nice wool socks with his face patterned all over them.
Ronny Chieng International Student,He played seven in scissor seven
Ronny Chieng International Student,That’s what you’re literally supposed to be wearing in a “pandemic”.
Ronny Chieng International Student,This guys going places
Ronny Chieng International Student,Am I the only one who legit wants to know where I can buy this supersuit? I would actually like to wear it.
Ronny Chieng International Student,"Hold up,somebody gets paid to watch these talk shows and rank em?"
Ronny Chieng International Student,The mask is funny
Ronny Chieng International Student,First paragraph of this article is very distasteful.
Ronny Chieng International Student,Late night is trash so not saying much.
Ronny Chieng International Student,"This is lame as fuck, the Samse is og and way funnier."
Ronny Chieng International Student,Who and why?
Ronny Chieng International Student,Can someone Tweet Chris Murphy and let him know that Stephen Colbert did a special Friday night edition of *The Late Show* just to address Trump and the other idiot Republicans all getting COVID?
Ronny Chieng International Student,Ronny chieng is a hack
The Last O.G.,"I want Tracy to actually produce and star in all of the fake Tracy Jordan movies from *30 Rock*, starting with ""Sherlock Homie""."
The Last O.G.,Man comments on this are all over the place. I’m not sure if I should give this a go or just rewatch 30 Rock for the 100th time…
The Last O.G.,"I gave this one a shot based on some positive reviews and TBS doing some surprisingly good stuff around the same time (Final Space, People of Earth, Angie Tribeca).

At first, it seemed like it was going to lean too hard on the ""Brooklyn is different now!"" theme, but after a few episodes and the introduction/involvement of all the players, I thought it found a good mix of character gags (guys in his halfway home, neighborhood people) and some surprisingly well-executed social commentary (like a young Black man being taught about adulthood by dads of two different races) for the first two seasons. There were also instances of true menace/danger to remind you of the stakes.

But season three quickly devolved into a paint-by-the-numbers sitcom, both in content and format. Instead of the A stories in each episode moving the overall plot forward or giving us real character development, most felt like one-offs or filler. The semi-frequent cleverness of the first couple seasons was replaced with very predictable sitcom gags. Even Tray's recovery (which seems like a great topic for Tracy to cover) was so surface-level that it never rang true to me.

S04E03 was the breaking point for me: Tray immediately and completely winning over the supposedly-stubborn barista/chef was so lazy. I rarely stop watching a show mid-season, but I realized I was forcing myself to click it. Based on a quick look at the episode ratings, I made the right decision."
The Last O.G.,The fact that it made it this long is wild
The Last O.G.,Read this as “Tracy Jordan’s The Last O.G. Not Returning for Season 5 at TGS”
The Last O.G.,"I saw Tracy Morgan live about 6 years ago and his standup was awful. Just vulgar one liners, maybe the worst standup I’ve seen."
The Last O.G.,"Tracy was so funny on this show, but Tiffany Haddish is really hard to watch. I had to stop after the second season"
The Last O.G.,That sucks. I really liked it.
The Last O.G.,Maybe it’ll go to one of the lesser streaming services like Quibi or Netflix.
The Last O.G.,"With the news that TNT and TBS are out of scripted I do not expect any of their ongoing shows will be renewed. They will play out the stuff already ordered or in production and that will be it. 

The Zaslav strikes! Out with scripted in with reality. It is the Zaslav way."
The Last O.G.,I enjoyed the show but it had run it's course.  It certainly gave me a new perspective on the comedy of Tracy Morgan.
The Last O.G.,"""Hey Yo I'm Tracy Morgan -- ya'll got any walnuts!?"""
The Last O.G.,"Tracy Morgan's at his best when he's guesting on Talk Shows, all his bits crack me up"
The Last O.G.,I actually was pretty invested in the show and I wish they had wrapped it all up I knew the fourth season was likely gonna be his last season I’m surprised it kept going for as long as it did
The Last O.G.,So its cancelled? You can say “cancelled” its nbd
The Last O.G.,"The death of TBS has been tought to watch, it used to be *the* place for the best sitcom syndication lineup and home to some under the radar gems. Now it's Friends, Big Bang Theory, and wrestling"
The Last O.G.,I saw him two days ago. Dude walked right by me twice and I didn’t realize at first. He’s very lowkey in person.
The Last O.G.,My brain auto read all your posts and quotes in entire thread in his voice
The Last O.G.,"Loved season one, but the first two episodes of season two were so bad, I stopped watching, did I miss anything, should I watch til the end?"
The Last O.G.,Tiffany haddish is annoying
The Last O.G.,Probably because WarnerDiscovery is ending all scripted shows on TNT and TBS.
The Last O.G.,I didn't even know this existed. Is it worth watching?
The Last O.G.,WHHAAATTT??
The Last O.G.,I feel so out of the loop. There are so many shows with 4+ seasons that I’ve literally never heard of.
The Last O.G.,Not very funny anyways.
The Last O.G.,Oh no! Anyway…
The Last O.G.,Good he's not funny and is a bad actor
The Last O.G.,That's okay...Tracy's got Walmart money
The Last O.G.,Bring back scare tactics
The Last O.G.,[deleted]
The Last O.G.,I didn’t even know this was a thing.
The Last O.G.,lol never heard this shows name once
The Last O.G.,"TBS, huh?"
The Last O.G.,How that show got 5 seasons is beyond me. A good run nonetheless and arguably a successful show.
The Last O.G.,Is this due to Warner Bros. Discovery canceling all scripted content on TBS and TNT?
The Last O.G.,One of my early covid binges

The Last O.G.,He can't do rapping grandma with Betty white anymore tho
The Last O.G.,I wish they made a second Chunks movie. Heard they had trouble with the movie rights.
The Last O.G.,Honestly. That is a great idea that and the rural juror.
The Last O.G.,Nah I’m hanging out for ‘Who Dat Ninja’
The Last O.G.,"“I’m black NBC! Very proud! Like peacock! RIGHT JANET?!”

“I think we got it!”"
The Last O.G.,"If you like Tracy on 30 Rock, it's a good watch. I feel like the funniest part of the show is Tracy's line delivery. It's like a high wire act and at any second he might completely fall to his death but he pulls through somehow. Also he pronounces heroin like ""heron"" like that's how it's supposed to be pronounced, and you're the idiot for pronouncing it right. All in all, it's like a boring B-class TV show that's trying to be overly dramatic but it stars a buffoonish Tracy. And I don't mean that like the 15th century term for black pirate."
The Last O.G.,I was expecting more outraged comments like every time Netflix cancels a show. But I guess you get more fake internet points when you complain about Netflix
The Last O.G.,I will always be angry about People of Earth getting cancelled without any form of closure.
The Last O.G.,Ugh. People of Earth and Final Space were soooooo good!
The Last O.G.,"Seriously. It is one of the most inconsistent sitcoms I've ever watched in terms of quality, but I still generally liked it. I think I liked it more for its potential than its actual worth though."
The Last O.G.,I enjoyed the show. It had something different and a relatively good cast/acting.
The Last O.G.,"I suspect that the suits at Discovery are going to find a way to reboot this series, except it'll star Joanne Gaines."
The Last O.G.,Me too my bologna
The Last O.G.,"The 30 Rock writing room made this man's career by taking his brand of ridiculousness and pairing it with jokes that don't suck.

The Last O.G.,You should see Donald gloves joke about his advice from Tracy. It lines up
The Last O.G.,Idk his song joke from the comeback special after his accident is pretty fucking funny
The Last O.G.,He was in Conan’s pod recently and he was funny as shit.
The Last O.G.,"Yep. Saw him once with Howie Mandel. Howie killed it, of course. Then Tracy came out and was so bad pretty much the entire audience left. He got so mad that everyone was leaving, that was the most funny part of his act."
The Last O.G.,"That sounds like it was right after his bad accident, not sure that’s the best time to be judging him on."
The Last O.G.,She wasn't in the 4th season
The Last O.G.,She was good in the After Party where she played the straight cop character that all the wacky house guests played off of.

Cleo and Cuquin,I like A Pup Named Scooby Doo
Cleo and Cuquin,"I watched it, it’s pretty bad tbh"
Cleo and Cuquin,Calling people racist for disliking a horrible TV show is just as cringe as the meta jokes that were written for Velma. Everything is subjective when it comes to TV/film but there’s a reason it’s sitting at a 2/10.
Cleo and Cuquin,"This review is hilarious. OP says ""Comedy is subjective"" multiple times then proceeds to tell people they're ""this or that"" for not finding it funny. Lmao. Wow."
Cleo and Cuquin,"I just watched it. They utterly trashed the entire history of the characters. First of all, every single character has been given a total makeover that barely resembles anything that came before it. They did Fred completely dirty and turned him into a narcissistic psychopath a small wang. They made Shaggy not even Shaggy. I can get Velma is gay but DAPHNE? Where the hell did that come from?  I have never watched a show that totally crapped upon all the characters and actually feels like it HATES its target audience.  This wasn't made for Scooby Doo fans. It was made for self insertion and pandering. It's horrible."
Cleo and Cuquin,"You put it on the same level as two shows with wildly different scores (8.5 is good/great, 5.8 is mediocre/bad).  Maybe it's just subjective and bad.  I haven't watched it yet because I don't currently have HBO Max, but your 6/10 is the most ringing endorsement I've seen for it.  It's not just racists who don't like it."
Cleo and Cuquin,Scooby-doo is not even in this show lmao
Cleo and Cuquin,"It's important to remember that two ideas that aren't in conflict with each other can be true at the same time. People can be negatively reviewing Velma sight unseen because they don't like the politics, AND Velma can also be a bad TV show."
Cleo and Cuquin,"Or maybe, and hear me out here, people don't like the Scooby-Doo show without Scooby-Doo that turned Fred into a Trump parable and thinks complaining about society is the same thing as jokes"
Cleo and Cuquin,Or it’s just bad and a bad idea
Cleo and Cuquin,"I got 7 minutes into the first episode and couldn’t take anymore. The show is hot trash. You can’t even make the argument that humour is subjective, because the show just doesn’t even feel like it’s making an attempt at it, it feels like it’s just trying to edgy and controversial for views, and it is getting rightly destroyed for it."
Cleo and Cuquin,So basically according to you there's no way for this show to be bad. What a take.
Cleo and Cuquin,"This feels like a really long, “if you don’t like this then you’re racist” post. I haven’t watched it and probably won’t because currently watching Be Cool Scooby Doo has really soured me on Velma. Is it fair? No. Is it racist or misogynistic? Nope."
Cleo and Cuquin,"I’m tired of people getting mad at bad shows getting bad reviews and blaming it on review bombing. It stinks, get over it."
Cleo and Cuquin,"""If you don't like it you're a racist turd""

And that's where your opinion became irrelevant."
Cleo and Cuquin,"The only people that have the right to be bothered by review bombing are the creators. If you follow audience scores, that’s on you. They’ve always been terrible and will continue to be. By making this post, you are the one giving the “review bombers” power. I have no stakes in this show whatsoever but this applies to everything, and it also goes for things that are rated highly because of fanboys. User scores can’t be trusted. The average user of any service is an idiot.

EDIT: I turned the first episode on after posting this and what the fuck. The first joke is cockroach sex?"
Cleo and Cuquin,"Just addressing your edits in relation to the comments I've been reading in this thread: You are adding your own interpretation and meaning into comments that I just don't think are there. I'm mostly seeing responses that respectfully disagree with your post. 

I'm certainly not seeing many people that are so ""fragile that an animated minority teenager sends them into a frantic rage."" You seem more upset than the comments section."
Cleo and Cuquin,The show is absolute garbage they need to be shown that making shows like this is 100% a money losing situation so they stop making them.
Cleo and Cuquin,Could it entirely be possible that a scooby doo show that does not include scooby doo would be a terrible idea?
Cleo and Cuquin,"It's the show that was already arguing like a drunk in a bar before it even launched right?

I can believe its terrible, its always been SCOOBY and the gang, without the dog the others are just some dudes and dudettes who ride around in a creepy van and trespass."
Cleo and Cuquin,"Ugh I’m beyond tired of this “if you don’t like this thing then you’re a questionable person” narrative. It’s lazy, reductive, and reeks of brittle egos that can’t handle that someone doesn’t like a thing they like. 

Secondly, when you’re summarily proven wrong that, no, it’s not just racists or whatever who don’t like the show, you fall back to “this isn’t supposed to be the peak of art, wHy iS eVeRyOnE bEiNG so SeRiOuS?”

Why can’t we just accept that some shows are just bad?"
Cleo and Cuquin,"I think shows like this are toxic. They try to promote themselves off outrage culture and thus throw insults out before the show is even made. They use minorities as a gimmick. They purposely create a heated online community in an attempt to get clicks, with no respect for the audience or if they are hurt by it

I fit the minority groups they are trying to appeal to, and I thought it looked bad from the trailer as well as the actual show.

In this case, they wrote, filmed, an animated a response to toxic racist man babies before the show was even announced. Clearly the intention is to stop you from judging the show based off very revealing trailers.

It's not review bombing to dislike a show. Reviewing bombing would be if one person gave it a thousand bad reviews, not if a thousand people dislike it. I find it a poor Imitation of what Harley Quinn does better and the showrunner hasn't been putting effort into her writing in a long time.

Plenty of reasons to dislike this show that uses a corporate brand name to boost an already dated satire. It's fine if you like it, but it's also fine for people to dislike it.

Edit: the ""review bombing"" is literally what they wanted. If you're a fan of the show, be happy it happened. I for one am bored of outrage culture shows"
Cleo and Cuquin,"OP, get your schizo meds"
Cleo and Cuquin,Reddit posts should have a rule similar to YouTube where they have to disclose whenever they're a paid opinion.
Cleo and Cuquin,"What horseshit.  Even the delusional, woke critics hate this absolute garbage.  And they'll shill for any pathetic dogshit that comes out like that ridiculous fanfic rings of power ""show"""
Cleo and Cuquin,"Or it could be the show is actual trash, not the fan base? Don’t try to defend this piece of shit."
Cleo and Cuquin,"I couldn't even get through the opening scene but it clearly isn't close to Harley Quinn in quality. 

All it had was one stupid meta joke after another and a complete butchering of the Scooby-Doo franchise. 

Legitimately looks like it could be one of the worst shows ever made but I'm not gonna watch enough of it to find out"
Cleo and Cuquin,"I'm sure there's some unethical negative reviews but I'm a little curious about your point of humor being subjective and maybe the show isn't for you? 

At face value that's fair, but are people not supposed to write a review if they didn't enjoy the show? That would remove all negative reviews and give a false impression of what the show is. Personally if I'm reading reviews to see if I want to watch something or not I'll read a few positive and a few negative to get both views."
Cleo and Cuquin,"Maybe it just sucks. I mean Norville and no Scooby-Doo, sounds like trash"
Cleo and Cuquin,I just some how hate how Shaggy became an actual contemporary black sterotype
Cleo and Cuquin,"I haven't read a positive review of this yet, and that's from professional reviewers, not the online chatterbox. Many reviewers explicitly state that it tries to be Harley Quinn but is *NOT* on that same level.

Review bombing it sight-unseen isn't cool, but neither is OP's post, with also doesn't seem to have anything to do with the actual show (urr, urr, it's subjective). 

Let's stop bashing AND caping for shows for reasons other than its quality."
Cleo and Cuquin,"I tried to watch the show, it was incredibly bad. Stopped at first episode, never gonna touch it again. I don't care about race swap as I'm a brown south asian myself. If the show is bad it gets bad audience review. Look at House of dragon and it's audience review for example."
Cleo and Cuquin,"So... your point is that people aren't allowed to dislike something if you can find some arbitrary similarities between it and another show? I mean if people really could just copy some show that did well and be guaranteed it would do exactly as well, don't you think every show that comes out would all just be exactly that?

From the trailer it sounded like it was going to be lazy. Like you're pointing out, it sounds like they picked four or five specific points like ""this particular animation style"" and then just phoned in all the rest.

I don't think that you get to tell people ""you are forced to like this show by a brown person or you're just racist"". I think it's possible for someone to just make a bad show even if that person is subjected to prejudice.

And from your various edits... yeah... I don't respond well to anyone saying ""if you disagree with one of my opinions then you're just racist."" Racism is a real, actual problem in the world, and people like you cheapen it when you think you get to use it to justify how everyone always has to tell you that any random idea you have is genius. You are unhinged and need to calm down and take a step back from the internet, and come back when you're able to listen to people disagreeing with you, without assuming you're perfect and the only reason someone might think other than you do is that they are prejudiced."
Cleo and Cuquin,"God bless the paint chip eating morons that *immediately* try to cry racism/bigotry/etc. should some poorly (and unnecessarily) “reimagined” take on an **already established** IP be a steaming pile of dogshit. Certainly it can’t be because production opted to try to check too many demographical “wokeness” boxes! It has to be because the viewers are close-minded idiots that don’t know what they’re talking about!

Edited to add: and to be clear, by no means is this take limited in any way to ‘Velma’— it applies to far too many tv/movie/game releases as of late."
Cleo and Cuquin,"Enough of defending  bad ratings for bad shows as “hatred”, “trolls”.

Had enough during She Hulk and now this"
Cleo and Cuquin,"I can't stand the argument of ""the characters are FICTIONAL so its ok to change their race, gender, height, sexuality, etc"". Its so disrespectful to the character.

If you want a Scooby Doo type show with an Indian woman lead then that's great I'm 100% on board with that.

You know what though? VELMA isn't indian. We know that because we've seen her in a million other shows and movies.

Instead of race swapping an existing character just create a new character and make them part of the Scooby gang. Problem solved, everyones happy.

Same thing with the Little Mermaid. I'm perfectly ok with a dark skinned/black mermaid. In fact didn't we see that in the original movie? Ariel is a red haired white girl. Just make the new Little Mermaid Its own character. Why is that such a problem?"
Cleo and Cuquin,Not gonna lie watched the first episode and it's bad ill try to keep watching but it is no way on the same level as harley quinn (which is a good example of taking something well known and creating something that is both good and original)
Cleo and Cuquin,"They completely changed the characters. Shaggy doesn't look like shaggy and where tf is Scoob? This post is just writing off criticism of the show by misidentifying it as racism. Hope the downvotes wake you up, people don't like classic characters being changed and fucked with."
Cleo and Cuquin,"Sure sounds like you are the only one butthurt, it's a terrible show."
Cleo and Cuquin,"every time a series comes out, and people instead of talking about captivating history or interesting characters, discuss about : racism, sexism, homophony... I know it's not worth watching"
Cleo and Cuquin,Why can't you just accept a show people hate getting bad reviews? How much are they paying you?
Cleo and Cuquin,"The show is bad, tries way too hard to be hip, cool, and modern. This approach ruins some of the original magic, I mean Scooby-Doo isnt even in the damn show."
Cleo and Cuquin,"The IMDB and RT score isn’t a little surprising, it’s expected when the show is absolute ass. Just because it’s receiving horrendous reviews isn’t a reflection of toxic fans, it’s a reflection of poor writing and woke politics being thrown in our faces. I have no issue with female leads and a diverse cast, what I do have an issue with is dreadful writing and treating your viewers like morons. This show is reaping what is deserves and the audience is becoming sick and tired of fictional media playing the political game. We want to be entertained not lectured about how racist and non-inclusive we apparently are. Enough is enough"
Cleo and Cuquin,2.6? Talk about review inflation should be a 1/10.
Cleo and Cuquin,I highly doubt a contingent of Scooby-Doo fans are review bombing anything. This is just an expected negative reaction to a terriblele show.
Cleo and Cuquin,It’s just bad. They should focus more on actual show and make it interesting and funny instead of lame jokes and make this show as inclusive as possible.. ratings are deserved. Don’t waste your time.
Cleo and Cuquin,"You can't just say 'these adult cartoons have a high rating so my show is entitled to one as well"""
Cleo and Cuquin,"It may objectively not be a TERRIBLE show but when you take a beloved nostalgia property and add more than a heaping of self indulgence and vanity project-ness to it, it's never going to be received well by audiences. Rightly or wrongly, it's seen as Mindy Kaling getting her Velma cosplay on.

I also think we've reached a saturation point when it comes to reboots/remakes/reinventions. People want to see new and original properties made for today, not reinvent or ""hippify"" old properties or characters."
Cleo and Cuquin,"I hate race swap regardless of the show, the character and the franchise and I'm a black person. But I've learned to live with that and I don't consider it a deal breaker so I still gave this show a chance. I don't usually laugh with comedies but I still enjoy watching them since they're perfect to kill time. But despite don't usually laugh I've never, never, when I say never I mean not once in my entire life I have been bored with one, this is the first time I had to push myself to watch the entire episode.

Velma and Shaggy being black is just a minor issue when it is compared to the show itself being bad, so I might have a problem with them swapping their race but the truth is that they could have been white, black, Asian or fucking horses and the show would still be a huge pile of garbage."
Cleo and Cuquin,"I liked the artistic design and the animation, but the show itself relies way too heavily on gross-out/cringe humor and every character is massively unlikable, even Velma who we're supposed to sympathize with despite her casual cruelty to Norville and flash backs that show here causing her mother's eye to dislodge from its socket. It feels like one of those mid 2000s animated sitcoms like Drawn Together or Brickleberry and I didn't care for those either. It's not the worst incarnation of the series as I had a harder time sitting through Shaggy and Scooby-Doo: Get a Clue and certain episodes of The New Scooby-Doo Movies, but it's not good."
Cleo and Cuquin,"Here's my question: 

How do you know when it's ""review bombing"" or when something is just actually very bad and people are just loudly expressing that fact?"
Cleo and Cuquin,Is this a joke?
Cleo and Cuquin,"So you had 3 points, but for 2 of them you say you can’t comment for differing reasons? So why even post? You contributed nothing and just end up looking like a WB bot. Yeah they’ve rebooted this show too many times, but does doing it again without the titular character actually help? Obviously not, that’s why no one likes this."
Cleo and Cuquin,"Idk it just doesn't look very good to me, but I also don't really care."
Cleo and Cuquin,"That show backfired just like this post did 🤣🤣 I don't know if OP is being satirical or truthful but God I hope OP is not really that dumb 🤣🤣 the show is literally nothing but racist backlash on a society that is tired of these elitist anti white racist attacks. I mean let's be real you're an idiot if you don't see the Democrats are trying to start a race war by sowing animosity through these attacks knowing that black people will lose..  Democrats have always fought to keep black people in chains from the civil war all the way up until the civil Rights movement. Wake up people, racism in any form is unacceptable, and we are going backwards.. Stop being puppets and attacking each other.. Fight the real enemy causing this woke retardation: Politicians."
Cleo and Cuquin,"I watched about 5 minutes and couldn't watch anymore. It's not just bad, it's offensively bad. Judging by the sheer amount of negative responses, also saying it's bad, you've received, the ""review bombing"" seems to accurately reflect how people feel about the show."
Cleo and Cuquin,Hey man it’s okay to enjoy shit shows. You like Velma that’s cool but it doesn’t change the fact that it is a complete and total dumpster. I feel insulted you compared it to the Harley Quinn cartoon show but that’s okay too. Opinions are like assholes everyone has one.
Cleo and Cuquin,"Wait what? it's absolute checkbox trash. it's GORY it's full of nudity, yet the jokes are written for toddlers. what kind of medication is required to enjoy this I can't imagine. When the synopsis makes fun of Fred for having a tiny pecker and assures you that will be a constant topic of conversation... I assume zero dollars were required to make this show? maybe that's the joke.

And you KNOW the critics bend over backwards to upvote every show they can that is politically where they want it, and only a 50% from critics lol. That is horrendously bad. Next you'll be telling us Blood Origins is a decent show? Misunderstood by the entire population of Earth?"
Cleo and Cuquin,False advertising. No dog.
Cleo and Cuquin,Because it’s dogshit lmao. It’s a pathetic attempt at being “meta” and falls flat on its face into a sea of cringe.
Cleo and Cuquin,I watched the first two episodes and was really looking forward to it. It's FUCKING. TERRIBLE.
Cleo and Cuquin,"OP gets told they’re wrong and then attacks commenters lol 

“Am I out of touch? No it’s the children who are wrong!”"
Cleo and Cuquin,"It is a really bad show. I watched the entire first episode and no more, even though I spent the next 15 minutes browsing the titles on different streaming services for something to watch. This despite watching all seasons of Never have I Ever which is another of Mindy’s shows and liking it"
Cleo and Cuquin,Sometimes a bad show is just a bad show
Cleo and Cuquin,I think this show is subjectively awful
Cleo and Cuquin,"Dude really? The show itself is overtly racist in horrible ways to most characters. The ""humor"" is actually just repulsive, the show was written with no love for the series it comes from, and it's just really off putting to most people.

Perhaps there are some bad actors review bombing just because of race swaps, but I'd argue anyone trying to excuse this trash fire is also a bad actor unwilling to understand why this show is so awful and off putting *to most people* probably because the characters were race swapped and some how something this terrible is supposed to be a win for poc.

This could of been literally anything else and it would have been received better and supported more by more people."
Cleo and Cuquin,"I watched Birdgirl and while it has a bit of cringe to it I thought it was several orders of magnitude funnier than this show. At the very least you can tell there is comedy competency behind the writing in Birdgirl, and any ""wokeness"" is at least self aware. There was an episode where a woman was erasing a guy's memories after sleeping with him and it was acknowledged in the show that that's still immoral AF even if it's a woman doing it. I don't think a ""hyper-woke"" show would have acknowledged that, they would've spun it as a victory against men or something. Velma is just a bad show with bad writing."
Cleo and Cuquin,I’m still trying to figure out how the Reddit hive mind thinks it’s ok to race swap white characters but if don’t want them to do that we’re racist. but it’s racist to race swap out non white characters. They should have just created a new ip if they were going to alter all the characters.
Cleo and Cuquin,The show is shit and I am allowed this opinion.
Cleo and Cuquin,"I don't care about the race of the characters or the switch to a more adult tone. Hell I don't even care that they call Shaggy Norville. Scooby Doo was always one of the worst cartoons on the air so I really couldn't give two shits about ""preserving the canon"" or whatever. 

So when I say I could barely sit through the first episode it's because of precisely one reason: It's the writing. The writing is bad. 

Saying the jokes are hit or miss is incredibly generous. It's a brand new show that feels dated. It has all of Kaling's worst writing habits put front and center with little to no self-awareness. 

If you're going to go meta and/or address social issues you need to avoid coming off as smug and /r/FellowKids material, and the show does both. I mean fuck, it takes a lot of bullshit to make me actively dislike something *I agree with.* But here we are. 

Having seen much of her work and read one of her books, I think it's fair to say that Kaling is best when she has other voices in the room to moderate some of her...less than stellar ideas. 

Tl;Dr: I don't give a shit about anything but the writing, and the writing is bad."
Cleo and Cuquin,"You're about correct, it's ridiculous it's at 2.6/10. No person with half a brain cell would give it more that 1 at best lmao. And if you disagree with that you're a brainless turd!"
Cleo and Cuquin,Aw shit here we go again
Cleo and Cuquin,Why is it so hard for people to believe that the show actually sucks? So what if you like it… Most of us don’t. And it’s not because we’re racist or homophobe the writing was seriously lame. I can tell a lot of work and thought was put into the show and it still sucked it just shows what a lack of creativity and imagination the Showrunners have
Cleo and Cuquin,"Its a bad show that no fan of scooby doo would ask for, its fine if you like it but that just means you have bad taste"
Cleo and Cuquin,"Sure, just call everyone who dislikes the show racist."
Cleo and Cuquin,">currently sitting at a 2.6/10 on IMDB

There are only 270 votes on imdb, if it doesn't bounce back from that then it's not a good show

After more people watch it then it will easily go back to where it deserves, unless very few people watch it"
Cleo and Cuquin,"This is person is like the guy that made Bro. Its racist or homophobic to not like something.

its a cartoon show. Why does everything have to broken down to this level. 

You enjoyed it. great! If more people like it will get renewed.

To you the only reason for a low score is because of  ""race swapping"" or ""edgy humor not being funny"" 

how much you want to bet that its the latter. you only give it a 6/10 and you don't find it funny. Do you think you are doing what you claim others are doing but in reverse? Blasting people for not like something you only speak up about because of the same reason."
Cleo and Cuquin,I wish they would get my name off of this disaster. I am a serious documentary film maker like the other guy on Bill and Ted's. I am a serious artist that would never touch this. Unless it's for a Scooby Snack. I'll suck \*\*\*\* for a Scooby Snack.
Cleo and Cuquin,If the trailer was any indication I’m not surprised in the slightest. It looks absolutely horrible.
Cleo and Cuquin,Haven’t seen this yet but Harley Quinn is one of my favorite shows on tv. Are you saying this is on the same level?
Cleo and Cuquin,Do you suppose this has anything to do with the low ratings? https://www.reddit.com/r/4chan/comments/10ad13e/anon_asks_about_velma/
Cleo and Cuquin,"It may not be good television, but the rule 34 continent is going to be fire"
Cleo and Cuquin,"I've only seen the trailers & few clips and I don't get the hate. Not that I think it looks good, just so lack luster it doesn't seem worth getting upset over it."
Cleo and Cuquin,"The show is racist af, they portray Hispanics in the most stereotypical ways possible yet black and Asian characters are “smart/nerdy” or cool"
Cleo and Cuquin,"6/10 for this is too funny, might be funnier than any joke on the show"
Cleo and Cuquin,"Damn son, how many edits/updates to your post are you gonna make?  You’re more invested in this show than HBO is at this point"
Cleo and Cuquin,Even the deaf and blind would (and do) realize this show sucks. What does that mean for you? This show has near zero redeemable qualities and SCREAMS ‘older millennials making anti woke jokes’ and its so telling because Mindy was a lead on this. Shes peak annoying old millennial with a chip on her shoulder. And im a millennial. This show is embarrassing and terrible.
Cleo and Cuquin,I’m watching the first episode right now and it is absurdly ass.
Cleo and Cuquin,"It's not review bombing. Captain marvel was review bombing, this is just a horrible, HORRIBLE show.
The race swapping isn't even an issue, it's the introduction of character flaws that were never there to begin with."
Cleo and Cuquin,"Changing race isnt an issue, but when you change every single discernible detail about those characters, why are we even relating the two? Brand recognition. Thats why. They wanted to make a show like this first, but had no real faith in the final product, so they attached it to an existing property.

Its all about money and nothing else, hit all the keywords the kids like, cause some controversy for headlines, cash out, bail. 

If they had not called it scooby doo, i dont think people would even given a shit. It would have been on noones radar."
Cleo and Cuquin,"I mean, there's no objective reason to have whatever the fuck a Norville is over Shaggy and Scooby, you know, the two most iconic characters from Scooby-Doo.

>Man some of you guys really are triggered by edgy comedy and multi racial casts. I apologise for triggering your impotent rage with a 6/10 rating.

Alright, OP is definitely trolling."
Cleo and Cuquin,"The show sucks, end of story."
Cleo and Cuquin,"your opinion is trash and so is the show, may god bless your two remainining brain cells."
Cleo and Cuquin,"I'd agree if it was a good show, but nah it's just bad. Lazy writing, mean spirited, and unclever. It's not funny. It'll flop and die.

I'm speaking as someone who loves edgy shit. Love Rick and Morty, love Boondocks, South Park love It's Always Sunny. Was excited to see Dennis' actor was attached to this, but it just kinda sucks. I'm busy, and don't have time to watch things that don't bring me joy. But this is just soulless."
Cleo and Cuquin,Mindy Kailing has never been funny. Every scene with her from The Office is completely skippable without any loss of jokes per minute.
Cleo and Cuquin,"Maybe people are plain sick of the pseudo-religious woke crap and how almost every issue is being turned into some life or death emotional blowout. Also, nice strawman argument/red herring, OP. Perfect example of what I mean. How you've managed to turn disliking or liking a TV show into an issue of morality is beyond me. Maybe lay off the emotions."
Cleo and Cuquin,I bet you're that one person in your group friend who everyone secretly hate cause you whine about everything pc. Fucking joke of an OP
Cleo and Cuquin,0 upvotes 💀
Cleo and Cuquin,You're almost more insufferable than the show itself.
HERO MASK,"First ep was filled with cliches. LIke seriously, it was one cliche after another. Pretty sure the dialogue was created via a computer program that spits out cliche dialogue at the click of a mouse. 

Second ep at least introduced the bad guy and I must say its a bit intrguing, I like him/her. Not sure if I will stick around. Sooooooo many cliches. "
HERO MASK,"> not based on an anime

Do you mean manga or something? Because Hero Mask itself is an anime."
HERO MASK,Def meant to be a Hollywood spy thriller. They still do the Pierrot thing of not even bothering to animate their lips properly.  But the action is fun. I think I’ll keep watching. 
HERO MASK,"So far it feels like a very western styled Ghost in A Shell. I saw two episodes and there is potential there. They are obviously trying to tap into a global audience. The biggest thing that I noticed was how everything was in english. Usually I prefer watching Anime in Japanese, but the whole thing seemed so western to me (the character names, the writing, everything) that I switched to the english track. Just seemed more authentic, and the dialogue seemed to flow better. In Japanese, from the subtitles, the dialogue just seemed so robotic as you said, but I think the dialogue in english track is pretty good. I think I may watch more."
HERO MASK,"Trust me, It get's a lot better!"
HERO MASK,"God, I'm just watching it now and the second episode is a mess. One dude and a knife vs 15+ armed police officers. Guess who wins. "
HERO MASK,"yeah sorry, messed up that title 

""manga"" "
HERO MASK,yeah its def totally western for sure 
HERO MASK,"They wanted to convince us the character would throw away a sweetheart deal, and thus his entire life, to win back the admiration of Kim.  I don't think they made a persuasive case for that at all.  And with the prisoners chanting ""Better Call Saul"" in unison, they gave us the single cringiest scene of the entire series."
HERO MASK,"dude Ozark had one of the most disappointing finales in recent memory. you're nuts for thinking that was in line with the show but BCS's finale wasn't. 

But it seems you're funneling the ending of jimmy, saul, and gene into one ending as if a single moment was supposed to end all of those story lines -- which is not possible. The cartels etc wasn't ""written into a corner"" for a finale, you must remember that Saul's story ends like 3 episodes before the finale. Everything after is solely Gene's story, which ends in its own manner, with the remembrance of Jimmy, and a near courtroom eulogy for Saul. They are different stages of the same person, yes, but you are still only considering Saul as if he's the ""true"" Jimmy McGill. Likewise I saw no ""fairy tale redemption"" for him, his redemption if ever comes after the last scene."
HERO MASK,I can't recall a better series finale.
HERO MASK,"I also have this unpopular opinion. The last episode felt rushed, it should have been split into two so all the scenes could develop further, but the actual story points I have no problem with, it's just the pacing and directing that felt off.

I also didn't like the ending to Breaking Bad.

But I also have the unpopular opinion where endings don't ruin a show for me, so even through I didn't like the ending of BCS it's still one of my favorite shows I've seen."
HERO MASK,I liked it
HERO MASK,I thought it was a satisfying ending. My only gripe is the 86 year sentence. It seems a bit excessive. I think Saul will eventually find a way to get out. He'll start a new life in Hollywood. He'll produce the story of Walter White on the big screen.
HERO MASK,"I loved the ending of Ozark. I love that they could not get away clean. Masterfully done.

Better Call Saul’s ending HIGHLY disappointed me. The last minute courtroom switch made no sense with his character. I cannot believe any reasonable person would trade a 7 year sentence in a nice jail for 86 (EIGHTY-SIX) years in a terrible prison.

Especially not Jimmy McGill. The crisis of conscience felt a little too Hollywood. (Also I don’t see how they were laying all those charges on him.)"
HERO MASK,"Not just the finale but the entire final season was bad. Everything hinged around how they treated Howard and that felt incredibly out of character for the both of them. Howard didn’t deserve any of that, he wasn’t Chuck."
HERO MASK,"I agree with many of your points. While not all bad, it felt rushed and I expected better and it was a letdown, based on the quality of the show up to that point. The noble prison thing was lame, and out of character for Saul or Jimmy."
HERO MASK,"I enjoyed reading this, I found myself let down that in the space of the last so many episodes, we don’t get even one ‘last’ scene of Jimmy and Kim and the final straw for their breakup. I guess I was thinking they would show something more dramatic and his transition to the full-on Saul persona once and for all. A little disappointed we didn’t get a final scene with Fring / Mike either but I suppose we did, in reality, with the Lalo finale ep.  This probably represents a lame take but I was expecting more dialogue, more depth, more scenes with interactions in the present to wrap it up instead of a long running commentary on Jimmy continuing scam-life, as entertaining as a few of those were."
HERO MASK,"I hated the Gene storyline, all the way to it's culmination and yes, the finale. In my eyes, he'll always be slipping Jimmy"
HERO MASK,"It was a completely disingenuous ending to a great character. In a world where there really is no justice, what a cop-out, cheap ending. For shame Gilligan and Gould"
HERO MASK,"Yeah I found it to be a pretty weak ending. Just felt forced and cheesy. Not only that, but the climax of the main timeline a few episodes earlier was quite disappointing as well. The character of Lalo deserved a lot better."
HERO MASK,"I found S6 to be a major disappointment but found the finale satisfactory but forgettable. The more I think about the ending it seems to get worse. Originally I thought it was a masterpiece then it slowly began to age worse in my mind.

I still think it is a great ending when compared to other shows. Like a 8-8.5/10. But the final season as a whole disappointed me."
HERO MASK,I licked it.
HERO MASK,"No I loved it. The point was that Jimmy wanted to redeem himself in his and Kim’s eyes. Everyone else didn’t matter. Kim know Jimmy would be inclined to bs his way out of everything. So offering up his soul in the court room meant something to her. 

They both had to take accountability to put the past behind them and be at peace. It wasn’t terribly rushed or anything."
HERO MASK,"The counter-circle-jerk has begun. As things were, so they are, and ever shall be."
HERO MASK,No.
HERO MASK,Yes.
HERO MASK,"Yes I'm disappointed at the ending too.
He basically volunteered to not live his life. Wich really doesn't fit I think. Even a remorseful saul Goodman/jimmy mcgill wouldn't loose the wish to live life to it's fullest. All the time he did what he did because he could. Because he wanted to live life with everything it could offer him. This spirit wouldn't vanish, just because he decides to be a honest man from now on.
Yes, he did tell people what he did and why. But what for? He could have been remorseful 7 years in prison. There is no sense in having to be in there for 86 years except that kim now thinks better of him. But he can't even see her (regularly)."
HERO MASK,"It was clear Vince Gillian was not as present for the last few episodes.   Although he was entirely on board for the crap ending.  Their reasoning was Jesse went free, Walter died, so in this series, someone had to go to jail.  Okay, but for 86 years?  I liked the extreme pushing Saul to prove he could get less time. And get Ice-cream) In reality, no person would be on board for a literal life (death sentence imprisoned).  If you actually love someone, you are not pleased with this sentence.  It was disgusting to see Kim's disapproval continue on until Saul/Jimmy life was Sunk.  And then to end on them sharing a moment, a smoke and joke about "" You had 7.5 years, you got 86 but with good behavior, who knows!"".  What were they thinking?  Clearly, they were not.
A redemptive arc for Jimmy/Saul would have been he does some time in prison. 10-15  years.  He redeems himself by devoting his time to volunteer educating inmates. There were a dozen of alternatives. 
Kim has less accountability and was entirely responsible for going after Howard.
Kim's reasoning was, together her and Jimmy were not good together.  Because they enabled each other.  People got hurt, Howard got killed.   So they were no longer together.  
Kim Wexler character has zero character. I am sure Saul, Jimmy, Gene was content and happy being left to rot in a super maximum, but he ""won"" ""Kim's "" approval.  Meanwhile, Kim returns to Florida."
HERO MASK,"It felt lazy and too storybook for the rest of the series. You spend the first few seasons hoping something good will happen to Jimmy because he seems to be on an endless losing streak, honestly he should have got away with it in the end, I think it would have been better. 

Gets the girl, gets away with the crime, somehow ruins Skyler Whites life a little bit more because fuck her….."
HERO MASK,The Gene episodes were so incredibly drawn out and boring to me. There was a lot of unnecessary storytelling that made me totally antsy and uncomfortable.  They should have separated it like they did with El Camino. It was like a completely different show. To go from the edge of my seat cartel drama to boring b&w storytelling. I still loved the series and am considering watching again.
HERO MASK,"Yeah, I agree with you. Was surprised by how easy the ending went on Jimmy. It was a swerve at the very last moment. Couldn't believe they showed him in prison with not a care in the world, and in fact getting constant props from other inmates.

I know a lot of people loved it, but I was just surprised that was the way the showrunners decided to depict prison and Jimmy within it.

I honestly think the camaraderie and good vibes between the cast and crew bled over into the writing so that the characters were handled with kid gloves at the end. Possibly to keep various options open for further spin offs."
HERO MASK,Nope
HERO MASK,I liked it
HERO MASK,I liked it
HERO MASK,you wrote all that for your opinion. It was one of the best in modern history
HERO MASK,I liked it
HERO MASK,No
HERO MASK,"I heavily disagree, I can agree that the finale felt rushed and ended somewhat abruptly but the finale was perfect in my eyes, the Time Machine scenes with Mike. Walt and Chuck were the perfect send off scenes for those characters. It depicted them so well while showing us in the last one with Chuck that Jimmy's regret is not having that heart to heart with Chuck that night hence Chucks book ""The Time Machine"".  The episode did an awesome job of making us believe Saul was going to become pure evil by lieing and dragging Kim down with him to get an absurd 7 year sentence, everything about the court scene was absolutely perfect, the suit, the music, having that douchbag Bill as his advisory council, the way Saul just cleansed his soul of all his sins and became Jimmy again was beautiful, he showed that his love for Kim and the guilt of breaking the Law outweighed having a 7 year sentence and living with himself for the rest of his life as a lie and a cheat. Kim and Jimmy having one last smoke with the same cinematography and music as the first time they met was the icing on the cake, people need to get over the ""Better Call Saul"" scene on the bus, I didn't really find it cringy It just showed us that Jimmy is going to be fine in prison, hell might even run it because of everyone remembering what he did for them over the years.  The end ended somewhat abruptly but looking at it now I'm OK with Kim's last glimpse of him being the last scene of the show.

This is my opinion and how I precieved it, everyone has a different way of how they pictured the finale to go down but I believe the majority of true Breaking Bad/BCS fans found this finale to be near perfect, the only things I would have wished for was Skyler and maybe Huell and Kuby to be there at court but that's more fan service than being a necessity, I was glad to see Marie and Agent Gomez's wife"
HERO MASK,"Hi.
I have not talked about it with anyone.

I ""wanted"" Kim to either be killed or be in jail.    

I don't understand why Kim was not working as a lawyer?    I don't understand why she was namby pamby or whatever you want to call her ""personality"" eating lunch with those coworkers.

Had she been disappeared by the vaccum store guy?    Was that implied?   Or maybe I missed it?   If so, why?   

I also thought it was kinda dumb that Saul basically volunteered to go to jail for a long time."
HERO MASK,"Well you basically just defined moral ambiguity in TV. Is it more interesting to study the morally conflicted than it is to study the morally decided. Duh. That's why the show follows ""evil"" people. Also, you're pretty quick to condemn people as evil. Maybe adopting a less simple, less dichotomous definition would be good. Then you'd believe that the show follows the razor's edge of good and evil and that that's what makes it great. Is it ok to do bad things for decent reasons? I guess that question and its like are looked at in the show. 

More importantly, after talking about how sociopaths are oh-so incorrigible, you talk about how McGill's final decision is meaningless, making him no better a person. Well the whole point of his last decision is to show that McGill, an evil guy in your own words (as far as I could tell), could change. Maybe it doesn't heal any damage (plus I'm not convinced that anyone thinks that sentences heal damage), but it does show that he can change if he wants. He's not seeking the sentence because he wants to deflect blame (or whatever); he's seeking the sentence because he doesn't want to be slippin' Jimmy anymore and this is his last shot at being someone else."
HERO MASK,Kim just wouldn't be practising law anymore.
HERO MASK,"Bit late to the party but couldn't agree more. The guy who could lie in his sleep decides to become Mahatma Gandhi & speak the truth at the most critical time of his life!? Cmon!

A clear conscience could have been achieved even with spending 7 years in jail. He could have opened a pro bono practice or something after those 7 years to get the ""approval"" of the person he hadn't seen for 6 or so years.

Not just the finale, but the last two seasons seemed inconsistent. Kim & Saul's reasons for going after Howard also seemed rushed. Like Kim had one not-so-great encounter with Howard at the court (season 5) and then decides to ruin his life!? Umm okay..

Lastly, this black & white thing seemed fine when it was just a few scenes, but having whole episodes with it..Na, definitely not a fan.

&#x200B;

PS: Does anyone know if Peaky Blinders had a decent/consistent ending or not? I'm thinking of watching that next."
HERO MASK,"I know ppl liked this ending but for me also this was prolly the worst ending writers could come up with. The last season went against everything I liked about this show from humorous witty moments as opposed to more serious narration of breaking bad, to forcing a demise for characters viewers cared about, like how Kim Wexler, pullin off a sudden break up or rushed ending of Lalo and whatever they wanted to do with Nacho. From my perspectiv the previous seasons showed the good nature of Jimmy despite being hated by almost everyone not a vile criminal who MUST face his inevitable punishment. Another point of attraction of those seasons were Mike being an interesting character who we cared about but now in the final season he became trivial and almost forgotten in the final ride. They also did dirty to Kim. Especially this character was interesting because unlike Skyler, she actually supported and helped the protagonist/anithero, but I guess the writers at some point decided to punish her for that and for me that build up didn't make any sense whatsoever. The awkward sex scene of Kim with that random dude felt like so forced and out of place I think writers wanted to defile her one way or another. Either way it was obvious the writers had some urge to force their moral compass (again). All in all I find it weird how the light hearted spin off of Breaking Bad had more of a tragic ending than it's more serious predecessor."
HERO MASK,"I was really interested in seeing what happened to Kim in season 6. Their relationship and mainly Kim’s loyalty to Jimmy was what really made the show great along with all their shananagans. I was disappointed that how the show ended simply because I was hoping they had a happy ending. Sort of rooting for the bad guys. 

But Jimmy getting 87 years instead of 7 was real because of how many times Kim bailed him out. And how many times Jimmy pulled off a scheme for Kim’s benefit. They loved each other and even though she couldn’t live with what they did and left for Florida, she was in love with him and wanted him to be ok. When Jimmy found out she confessed about Howard, his only choice was to sacrifice himself to save her and by doing so, prevent her from being sued or charged. He did it for her like he did so many times during the show. 

It may seem corny, but one of the shows main themes was their love story and that is what they ended it on. Her being his lawyer and seeing him on prison. Great acting and they really connected well. I think this show was better than breaking bad"
HERO MASK,"> They wanted to convince us the character would throw away a sweetheart deal, and thus his entire life, to win back the admiration of Kim.

No, it was about redemption period, not just Kim. That's why he also mentioned what he did to his brother in court, despite it not even being a crime.

>And with the prisoners chanting ""Better Call Saul"" in unison, they gave us the single cringiest scene of the entire series.

The writers just needed a quick way to show Jimmy would be okay in prison, and wasn't going to suffer daily in a high security penitentiary. It also calls back to when Saul was suggesting Walter White turn himself in and face the music:

>Saul to Walter White: ""You walk in with your head held high, you'll be the John Dillinger of the Metropolitan Detention Center. How bad is that?"""
HERO MASK,"Yes! This was my issue with it. He would do all that for  woman he had not seen in years? Willing take on 79 more years just so she would admire him again?

It really is not reality."
HERO MASK,"I agree about Ozark.  It didn't feel like an ""ending"" at all, more like they just arbitrarily decided to stop making more episodes.

People argue that the end fits because the Byrds will just fuck over everyone and anyone to get what they want, which I guess is in line with the whole rest of the show, but that is exactly my problem with it.  They could have made that ending at literally any other point in the show."
HERO MASK,"> dude Ozark had one of the most disappointing finales in recent memory

Dexter: New Blood has entered the chat."
HERO MASK,Breaking Bad!
HERO MASK,"I know this is an old thread, but finally watched it last night. I enjoyed the ending a lot"
HERO MASK,I was good at it.
HERO MASK,Probably he'll try to short his sentence or getting transferred to a better jail instead of remaining into an (unrealistic) ADX.
HERO MASK,"Agreed. Jimmy was way beyond the point of caring. He was hardened. His character change was out of nowhere and there was no reason for him to give up his scheming to suddenly come to terms with all the biggest moments in the whole series that he could never accept

A much more fitting ending would be for him to get away with a 7 year sentence and pull off one last scheme to save Kim by weaseling past the system, and then going to jail with a smile on his face knowing he got away with it. Because that's who he became after chuck died.  Or, to fail in his scheme and go away kicking and screaming. 

Instead the writers redeemed him in a very unauthentic, cornball way that left me knowing without a doubt breaking bad is a superior TV show"
HERO MASK,I loved the gene mall montages with the Cinnabon but gene was overall depressing
HERO MASK,"Agreed! As wicked, evil, and as smart as Lalo was, he went out way too easy. The show was a bit anticlimactic after that…"
HERO MASK,WHAT!? Season 6 was amazing what did you not like about it? May have went in a different direction than I thought it would but the way it all went made perfect sense to me
HERO MASK,How'd it taste?
HERO MASK,">The point was that Jimmy wanted to redeem himself in his and Kim’s eyes.

Sometimes you can understand the point and still dislike how it was executed.

Kim didn't really take accountability, all of the problems that occurred for her were because she chose that for herself. There was no real judgement. She had the freedom still to choose what life she wanted. Just because the story depicts her current life as a bleak one doesn't change that. In contrast Saul's freedom to choose is now completely gone and he was judged by an authority figure."
HERO MASK,"> Yeah, I agree with you. Was surprised by how easy the ending went on Jimmy. 

He's going to die in prison. How is that going easy?"
HERO MASK,"Jimmy was broken up with Kim for years why would anyone throw there life away for a ex girlfriend. 
You obviously never seen a prison documentary lol
Prison is tough especially doing life with psychos
You're probably a kid that has never really seen jail"
HERO MASK,"Basically all of this is answered in the show:

She did not use the vacuum guy to disappear. She clearly has a nameplate on her desk in Florida with the name Kim Wexler, her coworkers call her Kim. Remember, Walt, Saul and Jesse all got new names and identities when they disappeared. She goes back to ABQ to meet with Howard's widow and submit her affidavit to the court, etc. She is plainly not hiding.

It's super clear Kim feels very guilty about how her scheming with Jimmy leads to Howard's death. She doesn't trust herself to not do anyone harm, so she cuts ties with Jimmy and the law. Her life in Florida is so opposite from her life in ABQ on purpose. She's put herself in a place where she can't harm anyone. 

That extends to her new personality. Florida Kim doesn't trust herself to make basic decisions (the ice cream flavor at the office party, the mayo substitute, etc)."
HERO MASK,"> I don't understand why Kim was not working as a lawyer?

She resigned.

> I don't understand why she was namby pamby or whatever you want to call her ""personality"" eating lunch with those coworkers.

Uhhh, she gave up her life's passion and left the man she had passion and love for? Now she's living a dull life that doesn't excite her.

>
Had she been disappeared by the vaccum store guy? Was that implied? Or maybe I missed it? If so, why?

Uh, no.

>
I also thought it was kinda dumb that Saul basically volunteered to go to jail for a long time.

He wanted redemption."
HERO MASK,"I kind of agree. Her name pamby character was too abrupt. It didn't feel very genuine. 

I imagined Kim and Jimmy being Bonnie and Clyde and going down together. That would have been more suitable for how the show set itself up for the first 5 seasons"
HERO MASK,"He didn't give a shit about redemption until the prospect of Kim being in trouble arose.  And I understand the purpose of the bus scene, that doesn't make it work any better though.  They could easily have found a non cringeworthy way."
HERO MASK,"How does dying in jail redeem anyone? Redemption is about the truth setting you free, dying in prison aint that. I'm not getting the whole ""I loved it"" crew. The ending made the the series pointless."
HERO MASK,Agreed
HERO MASK,"This is a good point. Maybe the show should have ended with Lalo's death.

Jimmy deciding he needs more prison time still seems like a nonsense illogical ending for an otherwise cunning and shrewd character."
HERO MASK,It made perfect sense for a person who is able to talk their way out of anything to talk themselves into dying in prison? That an old woman who could barely turn on a computer could suddenly plug it in and use Google? That she would find Saul as a conman when he was actually a lawyer with a good track record? That he'd confess to impress a woman who left him years ago and how he'll never be with? Literally nothing about any of it made sense. Nothing.
HERO MASK,Tastes like a bunch of convicts chanting my name on a prison bus.
HERO MASK,She literally confesses and leaves it up to everyone else to punish her as they see fit.
HERO MASK,"Right, I didn't memorize every detail, but I do remember now that her coworkers knew her as Kim wexler.

I didn't feel like the show explained why she wasn't working as a lawyer in her new location.    She didn't go tell Howard's widow until later, but, OK, I can see the explanation that she didn't trust herself anymore."
HERO MASK,"Not Kim being in trouble, she's still in trouble. His actions did not protect her from civil litigiation. He lied to the prosecutors (off camera) and claimed he had information to incriminate her criminally, but he only said that to make sure she appeared in the courtroom so he could give his true confession, on record (just as Kim confessed on record to Howard's widow).

Plus from a writer's perspective, Jimmy either had to die or get locked up for the rest of his days. Otherwise there'd be more story to tell where he's free and willing to continue doing crime. If Saul won, it'd basically be a repeat of the Breaking Bad ending, bad to the very end. Instead he chose redemption, inspired by Kim, his brother, and just a slow culmination of events in his life."
HERO MASK,"I think he clearly still cared about redemption throughout his whole time as Gene. The man was just a hollow shell, only by admitting his actions and facing justice can he move on mentally. 

That's the first time in the whole show where he admits to anyone that he was the one who got Chuck killed. The guilt over that is so clear throughout s4-6"
HERO MASK,"> The ending made the the series pointless.

He stopped repeating the same mistakes he kept making his whole life. He could have conned his way out of a long prison sentence. Instead he came clean, he was just honest for once, completely open and honest, regardless of the consequences. He chose another path. That path has serious consequences, but it redeemed him.

If he had gotten out of prison after 7 years or less, he would have just gone back to fraud and crime. The show couldn't end unless Saul's gone. So, Saul ""died"", and Jimmy McGill was born again. It was about Jimmy's redemption, not Saul's. If he got away with it, it'd be the same Breaking Bad ending, bad to the end, embracing the criminal alter ego completely (Heisenberg). Jimmy broke bad for a long time, but chose another path, and became Jimmy again, not Saul."
HERO MASK,110% on Jimmy take
HERO MASK,"Agreed, thank you."
HERO MASK,Yeah you’re dead right.
HERO MASK,"He knew he could get away with it, but he chose not to. He'd rather live his life in prison as Jimmy McGill and be able to look Kim in the eye, than live free as Saul Goodman, alone. Saul Goodman was the last thing he wanted to be. I'm surprised this went over your head, they alluded to it from season 1. His divorce scene with Kim (""have a nice life Kim"", obvious denial), the ending to S6E9 where he has no one but a hooker in his house (loneliness), heck his entire relationship with Chuck (""he'll never change"", discouragement). He WANTED to be the honest guy people loved, except the people he sought that love from didn't precipitate, EXCEPT for KIM. She was the only one. So once she left, he did what he did best, at the cost of his morals, honesty, and true love.

In other words, he never wanted to be ""the person guilty people hire"". So yeah, he did it for Kim, but he mostly did it for himself.

Also, I hope you realize Saul Goodman was one of the most wanted men in America at that point who was known for illegal activities and scam cover-ups. I wouldn't say an old lady typing in google, ""conman from Albuquerque"" is far-fetched."
HERO MASK,I'd rather have a Cinnabon tbh
HERO MASK,"Yes but she doesn't really face any consequences for her actions. If she really wanted right now she has the freedom to go back to the type of life she wants. However, Saul does not. He actually faces real punishment"
HERO MASK,"That is the equivalent of being grounded. Kim, a former attorney knows that involves zero jail time.  A civil suit ""could"" ruin her financial.   Kim deserves more than that."
HERO MASK,There was the whole scene in the breakup episode where Kim tells the judge that as of that morning she wasn't a lawyer. And then later Jimmy is desperately trying to get her to reverse her decision to give up the law .You can't practice law if you're not a lawyer.
HERO MASK,"Actually I respect that take. I think they could have made a better redeeming arc though. Okay he came clean but nothing good came out of it. I see nothing redemptive about dying in prison.
As a lawyer he should have asked to see the evidence against him (it was probably scant anyway) and let justice take its course. He'd have probably got off and then he could have seen that as being given a second chance and then being shown determined to make the most of it. This really did nothing for anyone. Him getting justice by being let off due to a lack of evidence would have actually spoken more about the American legal system and the fact that its existence is a lot of the reason Jimmy was able to become Saul in the first place."
HERO MASK,"I don't think he redeemed him, he just finally accepted his decisions have consequences.

My interpretation is this:

Saul Goodman won. He had a 7y sentence.

Jimmy McGill finally made a good decision.

And he chose to be McGill to himself and Kim. Even though the world will always see him as Saul Goodman."
HERO MASK,"An old lady who could only load up cat videos suddenly being able to use ask Jeeves is a stretch. There were better ways for that to work.

It's not that things went over my head (albeit thanks for believing I'm intelligent enough that it would surprise you) and it's not that he chose to spend his life in prison, it's that there was a better way to come to that conclusion. He confessed. Big whoop. Why didn't he just do that in ep 1 season 1 and we could have just bypassed about 10 episodes and a truck load of unnecessary black and white? Just made the whole thing a massive waste of time. Look Kim in the face? A face he'll hardly see in the coming years, hardly a motive. Also he was already going to prison so it's not like he was getting away with anything. Definitely a disappointing end in that regard."
HERO MASK,They literally say she’s at risk of losing everything she has in a civil suit
HERO MASK,Lol after that affidavit no state bar will allow Kim to get her legal license back
HERO MASK,"This old lady could only watch cat videos when she first got the laptop. I don't think it's a stretch to say she's learned what ""ask Jeeves"" is over a month of time. 

You don't have to like the way the show went, but to say it doesn't make sense is wrong, which is what you said in the first comment. But now, in this comment, you are saying you don't have a problem with the fact he chose to spend his life in prison. But later on, you then say Jimmy choosing to go to prison because he wants to make things right with Kim isn't a motive?

If I'm honest, it's hard to know what you're saying. I'll assume the last thing you said is what you mean. In that case, I've explained these motives in the last comment. If you don't buy it and still think it doesn't make sense, fair enough, but the entire show from 'episode 1' has been alluding to it. If you don't buy that Kim is a part of a reason, that leaves everything else I wrote about morals and consciousness, basically the essence of Jimmy's character (aside from Kim). And if you don't buy that, then there's not much point in discussing this anymore. 

My thoughts are that I thought the ending was perfect, to every minor detail and flashback (except for the ""better call saul"" chant on the bus). Same as the parallels in the episode before. As much as I wanted him to get away with it, it made the most sense to his character that he didn't, given the context of the ENTIRE show."
HERO MASK,But she chose not to be a lawyer anymore anyway.
HERO MASK,"No it's not wrong, just because you've made sense of it and it makes sense to you doesn't mean it has to for everyone else and just because I said it didn't make sense that doesn't mean I disagreed with the ending. What didn't make sense to me was that after everything he just confessed. The allusions aren't really anything they're just plot armour, conveniently placed for us to feel there's context to the ending. Just like the cringey bus chanting. What I'm saying here is that if this was about Jimmy righting wrongs that's fine but the avenue they chose to bring it about was lazy and hasty. I'm also not convinced the state had that great a case against him or they wouldn't have offered him only 7 years and the way this show has dragged I can barely remember what he did to be wanted in the first place. It's not that BCS wasn't a good show, it was especially the back story, it's that it has been plagued with scheduling issues and AMC's stupid mid season breaks meaning it's been hard to piece together the story for those of us who have watched since the beginning because the story is rich and complex and considering the back story is rich and complex, it's a shame that ending want given that same build up and attention. Three tacked on episodes. We deserved better. We were meant to get 13 EPs a season,  think had we had that there have been more time to build up to the ending the way it needed to. I envy the people who are watching now, I think they'll have a better experience as they won't have to wait two years between certain seasons and months halfway between others."
HERO MASK,"You said ""if she really wanted right now she has the freedom to go back to the type of life she wants"". The life she had before was that of a high power lawyer which she cannot attain. No company car, no fancy apartment, etc. She can't go back to the life she had, even if she wanted to"
HERO MASK,"This is the most braindead game I’ve seen about the show. Why would he confess in s1 ep 1? That episode was him being a lawyer and the black and white scenes had to do with gene trying to hide from “Saul” while still keeping that attitude. Walter had a drastic impact on almost everyone he met. The black and white scenes were to show how gene got affected and him getting back to his roots. The ending is a masterclass in storytelling and the perfect end to the show. I’m not even sure how you got through 60+ episodes of this show and completely misunderstanding a character this bad. The 6 seasons were to show how jimmy got up to this point. The flashforward/flashback scenes represented jimmy and sauls morals conflicting with each other. Everything, from chucks betrayal, chucks death, Kim dragging jimmy (and joining) into becoming a scammer, was never his fault. He was the product of what happened around him. This is show in season 1, when he genuinely listens to chuck about waiting and trying to become a good lawyer. He then gets backstabbed by chuck and hears the line “I’ve never really cared much about you” from his own brother. This single handedly kills most of the “jimmy” morals left. Most but not all. We see this within the Saul flashbacks in season 6, where he hesitates and never looks into the eye, while talking to kim. She takes notice of this and leaves without saying anything. He also hesitated before talking to walt in the school, and hearing that he has cancer. His character arc is about learning to accept who he truly is, and how changing names or running away from that, won’t change anything. He’s lost everything and everyone from trying to continue as “Saul”. He made the choice to give up everything in the end because he found no  reason to continue as a conman. Lalo is the perfect antagonist for jimmy. Both Saul and lalo are sociopaths, with one being far more violent than the other. Those seasons 5/6 were to show how both these characters are similair, and how lalo was one of the characters and reasons as to why jimmy ended up to where he is at the end of the season. Those 3 characters, chuck, Kim, and lalo were all part of jimmy, and ones who caused him to go from “jimmy McGill” to Saul goodman. Chuck forced a wrong view of himself on his brother, Kim forced jimmy into scams towards the end, and thus led to lalo becoming involved and the eventual demise of Kim and sauls relationship. The ending of the show was to represent how all these 3 characters affected him, and caused him to make the decision to give into prison. Also you saying how jimmy not ever being able to see kim again contradicts your point about how he did it just because kim was there, but jimmy won’t ever be able to see her again so that point is worthless. Kim was PART of the reason as to why jimmy gave in, but not the entirety. Seasons 1-3 was to show sauls moral and external demise as jimmy, while 4-6 was to show his internal collapse. In the end, there’s still a flicker of jimmy left in his soul, and he felt guilty of everything he had done, which was shown by hints within the Saul flashbacks and Walter and the person he drugged, both having cancer, representing how he’s not entirely sociopathic. His arc was t a redemption arc, but rather a twisted one. In the end, he truly understood that no matter what he did, or how much he ran, jimmy McGill was still him, and yet he deserved his punishment in prison for all his crimes. A poetic and perfect ending to the story, which you clearly misunderstand, along with the whole point in the show."
HERO MASK,"Yes Kim has her black and white life in Florida,  potatoes salad and the yup man.  She was relentlessly, ridiculously after Howard.   Jimmy was accountable but not as much."
HERO MASK,">No company car, no fancy apartment,

Does she even care about this? I mean she came to the realisation in previous seasons a high paying job wasn't enough for her and she would rather defend people in the cases she actually cared about rather than selling out.

But yes okay fair she can't be a lawyer anymore. But she had already chosen that to be the case years ago."
HERO MASK,"Having a different perspective is allowed. It's not that I didn't get it, it's that I didn't enjoy it. I didn't think the end was very good. It was rushed and we deserved better. Brain-dead? Meh takes over to know one buddy."
HERO MASK,I enjoyed reading this and fully agree
HERO MASK,"So what exactly do you mean by ""the life she wants""? 

I'm guessing you mean a lawyer taking care of the little guy, right? Well first off, she can't do that as we've discussed. Also, her plan to fund that venture was the Sandpiper money, which she gave entirely to Jimmy as she didn't want blood money.

So either I don't understand what you think Kim wants right now, or what you think Kim wants is not attainable."
HERO MASK,"Saying you think the ending was bad is one thing. But saying “WE deserved better” is objectively incorrect. The show ending within one episode with no prior build up makes sense, because all that build up was the 6 seasons before it. This is proven by the black and white scenes appearing at the start of every season. Having a dramatic finale with many episodes of buildup to the finale isn’t true to what the show is about. This is essentially asking for plan and execution 2.0 which had a lot of buildup. The end was gene realizing that he’s still jimmy deep inside, and there’s no reason to continue, which doesn’t need any dramatic buildup since all it takes for everything to end was one sentence admitting to all his crimes. The episode gave glimpses of chuck, his past, etc. and it was the perfect episode to end the series off.

Breaking bad did the same and everything practically ended within one episode with no buildup. The reason why that was also perfect was due to the ending tying up all the loose ends and feeling like seasons 1-2. The ending stayed true to what the show is actually about, and walters character finale, without dragging it on for no reason."
HERO MASK,">So what exactly do you mean by ""the life she wants

What I mean is she is still out in the real world and has freedom to choose whereas Saul is in prison and has no freedom."
Memories of the Alhambra,"I'd actually argue it's closer to an alternate version of Sword Art Online. Just with augmented reality stuff rather than virtual reality. I've been reviewing it every week on my site and the blend of comedy and drama is absolutely on point.

I love Eastern dramas, they're usually so imaginative and have some very interesting concepts and this one is definitely one of the better ones out there."
Memories of the Alhambra,"I haven't seen Sword Art Online so thank you because now I know I need to. :)

This is my first foray into eastern dramas and I'm loving it. Going to have to seek out more. "
Memories of the Alhambra,"Ones I've watched this year and highly recommend:

Mr sunshine

Girl from nowhere

On Children

These are the best I've seen this year. Sword art online is decent but it does tend to do a lot of time jumps forward that cut out some of the better parts of the game. It's worth checking out though."
Memories of the Alhambra,Thank you so much! I see that they're all on Netflix so that's convenient. Something to watch while I wait for the rest of MotAH. :)
Memories of the Alhambra,"the korean drama, W - Two Worlds, may also be up your alley. try checking it out! "
Memories of the Alhambra,"The premise sounds so cool for that one, thanks for the rec! I can't seem to find it on either netflix or amazon though and I don't have hulu or any other streaming services. Would you happen to know where I could watch it? "
Memories of the Alhambra,yep sadly its not on netflix. you could try viki or viu. they’re streaming sites for korean dramas and variety shows. i’ve also pm-ed u a few other links :) 
Memories of the Alhambra,"Pushing Dasies, Dead Like Me, and Wonderfalls are all Brian Fuller shows that I think might fit into what you're looking for.

Maybe Eureka too."
Memories of the Alhambra,"I loved season 1 of Dirk Gently and its basically perfect tv imo. I can't think of a fault in it. Season 2 goes a little too far to the point I still haven't finished the last episode (I watched it many years ago).

Saying all that, the showrunner Max Landis was cancelled for being a creep to many women, so that was probably the final nail in the coffin. 

But yeah, season 1 is just soooo good. I wish BBC would make a modern *Hitchhiker's* series."
Memories of the Alhambra,"The word on the street (and heavily hinted at by members of the production) is it got shit canned because of Max Landis and his unbelievably shit extracurricular activities.

Netflix cancelled it to get ahead of the inevitable."
Memories of the Alhambra,"Legion.

It's crazy and surreal and worth a watch."
Memories of the Alhambra,"Magicians was great. Even though season 5 was ok, I think it should have ended with season 4. What an epic finale and musical number."
Memories of the Alhambra,"Warehouse  13, maybe?

I smell fudge...."
Memories of the Alhambra,I think Doctor Who with the attitude of Dirk Gently would be great.
Memories of the Alhambra,"I’m not entirely sure what you categorize as fantasy but I’ll go ahead and recommend lodge 49. 
It’s a hard show to summarize. Let’s call it a modern day arthurian legend set in Long Beach, CA. 
Imagine some sort of hybrid between the fisher king and big lebowski. It has some light drama moments sprinkled throughout. but, overall it’s a very lighthearted comedy about genuinely deep subjects. There’s nothing quite like it on TV."
Memories of the Alhambra,"The good place is a good followup to dirk gently. It's funny, but without flanderizing the characters. Characters grow and evolve over the course of the show. It handles adult themes very well, and has a well written story arc that only slightly feels drawn out for more episodes than it needs to be."
Memories of the Alhambra,"I was pleasantly surprised by Miracle Workers season 2.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asystahz9G0

It shares a lot of the absurdity and style of Dirk Gently and it even has Elijah Wood's doppelganger.

It's basically got a bunch of good actors in a completely different context from the first season poking fun at medieval life with modern perspectives, context, and soundtrack/style."
Memories of the Alhambra,"I think you'd like Doom Patrol, it's the one of the weirdest comic book shows I've seen and it's all the better for it.

One of the characters is a sentient, teleporting living street."
Memories of the Alhambra,"There is a british version. I actually prefer it although I enjoyed both.  


Lodge 49 is great as someone else noted and has a lot of similarities."
Memories of the Alhambra,"Few recommendations:

Wilfred - starring frodo as well

Futureman

Happy!

Santa Clarita Diet

Ash vs Evil Dead"
Memories of the Alhambra,"The Magicians is awesome, its one of my favorite shows. ""Peaches and plums, mf'er!"""
Memories of the Alhambra,"They fucked the second season, it really lost all the magic from the first."
Memories of the Alhambra,"Galavant might not be as mature as Dirk Gently but it's a musical comedy so it can't be too serious.

Supernatural might be up your alley if you're into horror. While they might take the lore seriously, they don't take themselves seriously. Season 6 Episode 15 is the best example of that."
Memories of the Alhambra,Try [Buffy the Vampire Slayer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4E6mUT-kLc).
Memories of the Alhambra,"It's not TV, but if you're looking for more Dirk, the original 2 novels and then the comics from IDW might fill that niche."
Memories of the Alhambra,"I’ll defend the magicians at least the first 2-3 seasons at least because the books they where based on where amazing and the show was solid for a bit

Lucifer is a cop drama which everyone loves and was light fantasy"
Memories of the Alhambra,"My kids and I binged the two seasons over a weekend, it was so entertaining and compelling! It was getting late and I said OK just one more episode for now.  I went looking for season 3 and when I found there wasn’t one, I just thought WHY? How could they have stopped making these?"
Memories of the Alhambra,"Wynonna Earp is your new favorite show, go watch it right now, you're welcome.

Also out of interest how much of The Magicians have you seen? It surprises me that you didn't like it as tonally it's probably the most similar show to Dirk Gently I can think of."
Memories of the Alhambra,"Does Locke and Key revolve around kids? My roommate says it's good, but he likes a lot of bad things, or at least things that are more geared towards teens and not a 30 year old."
Memories of the Alhambra,"Memories of the Alhambra is not that good, esp for korean fantasy dramas"
Memories of the Alhambra,"Seems like you have quite a broad definition of ""fantasy"".

So go and watch ""The Middleman""."
Memories of the Alhambra,Agreed. I love Pushing Daisies as much as I love Dirk Gently!
Memories of the Alhambra,I wouldn't recommend Dead Like Me... Why? Because then you'll be just as sad as me when you realize they only gave it 2 seasons before cancelling it and then hastily put together a movie to wrap things up... Man I love that show but it shouldn't have ended after just 2 seasons.
Memories of the Alhambra,I’ll add forever to this list because it had promise to really go somewhere
Memories of the Alhambra,Hulu is making a modern *Hitchhiker's* series
Memories of the Alhambra,Plus if you read up on the plans for S3 of Dirk Gently it was just going to be bad.
Memories of the Alhambra,Hulu/BbcAmerica
Memories of the Alhambra,Can't they make it with another show runner?
Memories of the Alhambra,"And this irrational contempt for the Magicians from op is particularly weird to me because tonally that show is probably the closest to Dirk Gently. I put shows like the Magicians, Dirk Gently, Legends of tomorrow in the same category: Batshit crazy shows that somehow work and it's obvious the cast and writers are having the time of their lives making the show and the end product is just a good time for the audience"
Memories of the Alhambra,"I found it okay. I wrote a review of it in brakebills sub, but in summary.. it was very cyclical in plot, constantly broke its own rules and filled with plotholes. I think the keys season was really good and memorable for me but other than that it was eh."
Memories of the Alhambra,"Maybe the first couples seasons, but even they went grimdark towards the end."
Memories of the Alhambra,Oh Matt Smith version is pretty spot on.
Memories of the Alhambra,I feel like series 5 came closest to this but didn’t quite hit the mark.
Memories of the Alhambra,Couldn't make it through even the first episode of DG because the guy was basically doing the most cringeworthy doctor who impression I've ever seen.
Memories of the Alhambra,"Lodge 49 is a deeply weird ass show.

I love it. I call it ""The Adventures of Young Big Lebowski"""
Memories of the Alhambra,"Another recommendation for lodge 49.  If you loved dirk gently, you will also really enjoy this one.

It was so understated, yet brilliant.  The whole time I was watching it, I just had this really deep appreciation for it, and really wished there were more shows more like lodge 49, there's a real sweetness, that's just handled superbly well.  Please check it out"
Memories of the Alhambra,Awesome.. will check it out!
Memories of the Alhambra,"The Good Place is amazing. And not only that, I feel like the ending was actually really good as well. 4 seasons of greatness, I hope more and more people find it."
Memories of the Alhambra,Stephen Mangan is probably the best Dirk.
Memories of the Alhambra,"> Futureman

I love this show but season 1 is the strongest in my option and that’s only because you can only ramp up the absurdity so high before it becomes the norm"
Memories of the Alhambra,Watch the original Aussie Wilfred first.
Memories of the Alhambra,"I liked the peaches and plums and part.. I liked the season where they are collecting keys.. but outside that show had  massive plotholes, constantly broke its own rules and was very cyclical."
Memories of the Alhambra,Right. And good omens was not that good. The angels and demons stuff was amazing but that was only a third of it and the witches / kid stuff was terrible with even worse cgi.
Memories of the Alhambra,"I still have ""Off With His Shirt"" on my playlist."
Memories of the Alhambra,I know right! I got my entire family hooked on to it. They absolutely hate fantasy stuff and they couldn't stop watching it. Insane that this show got cancelled.
Memories of the Alhambra,"I found it okay. I wrote a review of it in brakebills sub, but in summary.. it was very cyclical in plot, constantly broke its own rules and filled with plotholes. I think the keys season was really good and memorable for me but other than that it was eh."
Memories of the Alhambra,"Yes it does.. and some of the dumbest annoying kids at that.
Visually it's very good but you will roll up your fist many times by the idiotic decisions the characters make."
Memories of the Alhambra,Me too. Gutted it was cancelled after 2 seasons.
Memories of the Alhambra,"Ugh, the movie was *bad* too."
Memories of the Alhambra,Oh yea.. Forever is pretty good.
Memories of the Alhambra,How did I miss this news??? Good to know.
Memories of the Alhambra,What plans?
Memories of the Alhambra,Where you getting Hulu from? Netflix produced it as a co production with BBC America.
Memories of the Alhambra,"They could have but that would require acknowledging that fucked up stuff as the reason for the change instead of quietly cancelling it and diving for cover.

Netflix never admitted this was the reason in an official capacity."
Memories of the Alhambra,It depends on their contract with Landis.
Memories of the Alhambra,"So what about The Librarians (did go grimdark a couple of times but apart from the series finale (because it had to have the biggest stakes) it was never more than one episode a season (but it wasn't like a ""thing"") that got super dark and sometimes it's only dark-by-fridge-horror and never actually touches on the dark elements in the episode)"
Memories of the Alhambra,"Apparently season 2 didn't do as well as S1 so that's the official reason why people say the network pulled the plug. 

However, I'm certain it's no coincidence that shortly after season 2 premiered in Oct'17, the #metoo movement was ramping up and Max Landis (creator/writer/producer) was accused by numerous women of many horrible things, including sexual assault and abuse and he's been blacklisted in Hollywood ever since. 

His only credits after these allegations were all from projects already underway and iirc, all tried to have his name removed but the rules regarding such things make that difficult to impossible."
Memories of the Alhambra,Thank you
Memories of the Alhambra,It was rushed and the actor changes too... Blergh. Didn't deserve that with the two seasons it had.
Memories of the Alhambra,"I stole this from an earlier reddit thread, because I can't find the article anymore, but it all seems about right to my memory.

Dirk and Assistent would have become a couple, and it would have been canonised that Dirk is queer, Todd would have reformed The Mexican Funeral, Ken and Bart would team up and be the villains of the season, Friedkin would have became an omnipotent figure, Farah would have joined Blackwing.

Basically characters would just be forced into whatever role Landis wanted them in.  After season 1 I wasn't too confident in the show anyway.  It was a really good retelling in the Adams style.  Darker than I generally appreciate, but Adams, especially in his later novels, got pretty dark in terms of tone due to his depression.  But season 2 just quadrupled down on the weird, which wasn't really Dirk Gently's original style in the books.  They were never weird for the sake of weird."
Memories of the Alhambra,Oh weird. Here in America it's only been available on Hulu and BBC America
Memories of the Alhambra,The viewership wasn't that different between S1 and S2. I honestly think it has a lot more to do with Max Landis :(
Memories of the Alhambra,this seems like some fan theory bullshit.
Memories of the Alhambra,"Wait, you're saying that Tod and Dirk would have gotten together?"
Memories of the Alhambra,I see you're familiar with the writing styles of Max Landis
Memories of the Alhambra,"Nah, the guy posted it on his Insta."
Memories of the Alhambra,"No, not Todd, but the guy actually named Assistant."
Memories of the Alhambra,"Murray Bartlett is quickly turning in to one of my favourite tv actors. What a huge transformation from his white lotus role. Amazing work. Nick Offerman, as usual, is an absolute god damn treasure."
Memories of the Alhambra,"Phenomenal. The reveal of Bill as a prepper with a Fleetwood Mac blues song is one of my favorite character reveals of all time. The whole episode is much different from the game obviously but this is how you tell a story. It’s so fucking beautiful. I’m almost mad I ruined it for myself because when Frank was talking about his plans for his last day, I said if I were Bill I’d just kill myself too. So it softened the blow but doesn’t take away from how incredible that whole hour was"
Memories of the Alhambra,🍓
Memories of the Alhambra,"Although I really missed the banter between Bill and Ellie from the game, I was amazed at how they created that entire backstory for Frank and Bill just from the letter they found with his body in the game. I watched this episode twice and then followed it up listening to the HBO podcast.   
The writing on this show is amazing and I hope other video game adaptions follow suit."
Memories of the Alhambra,"For those interested in how Frank and Bill's story played out in the game:  
  
>!Bill's alive when Joel and Ellie arrive, but Frank has left. Bill tells Joel that he used to take care of someone, but not anymore, says it only would have gotten him killed. You pick up hints throughout the level that Frank got tired of surviving without actually living and left. Bill never softened up like he did in the show, and he and Ellie but heads a lot. Bill warns Joel that Ellie will probably get him killed, but eventually acknowledges she can handle herself.!<  
  
>!After escaping some infected, they find Frank's body hanging by a noose in a building with a suicide note. Frank got bit soon after leaving Bill. He says in the note that Bill was right that he couldn't take care of himself, but he was still glad to be gone because he always hated Bill's guts. Bill is obviously saddened by this but doesn't want to admit it. As Joel and Ellie leave, Bill asks Joel if they're square, and when he says yes, Bill says ""Now get the fuck out of my town.!<  
  
[Frank's note.](https://i.imgur.com/W5b39xF.png)"
Memories of the Alhambra,Ron Swanson gets to be Ron Swanson in a completely unrelated show. You couldn’t ask for a better casting role. “You new world order bastards.”
Memories of the Alhambra,"It was definitely a divergence from the source material but this was SO much better. That part of the game works fine in the game, but this was an really excellent way to adapt the source material. Though I kept being worried Bill was gonna not grant Frank his wish and he was gonna take off and do it himself (somehow). It wasn't until he downed that glass of wine that I was able to relax a bit.

Also, as a gay man, though it's becoming more common, it's still rare to see great gay love in media that isn't just trauma porn. This could easily have become trauma porn... but it wasn't? Tragic, but also very sweet. And seeing two men grow old together is even MORE rare. It was all just really nice to see and I like how they tied it into Joel's feelings for Tess.

EDIT: Just editing my comment about trauma porn to make it clear I'm saying this episode was not that, since I can see how it might've been vague."
Memories of the Alhambra,"Without any spoilers.

I am assuming the episode is lower rated because of review bombing due to certain relationships being presented with Bill? And not that the episode itself is actually bad?

If I go now on Imdb it has a 8.4 out of 10. There are 5,642.. 1 STAR reviews. The 1 star reviews make up 20% of the overall reviews. There were 1 star reviews for the first 2 eps, but they made up less than 1% of the overall reviews.

Which, leads me to believe that this is just a bunch of homopbhobic people lashing out about the episode."
Memories of the Alhambra,"This is why all that talk of adaptations needing to stick to the source is not entirely correct.

You just need good writers that respect the source, don't have to follow it 100%.

Also very good to know that Craig Maizin can write some good old ""classic"" drama. He's not just an ""end of the world"" expert."
Memories of the Alhambra,It’s refreshing for apocalypse show to talk about how important love is to survival. Usually they go into just kill and betrayal so much but never much into why it’s worth to fight to survive
Memories of the Alhambra,"Finally a network not afraid to give us the hot, gay Nick Offerman sex scenes we all have always wanted."
Memories of the Alhambra,"My daughter played the game. I knew nothing about it, but watched with her because she seemed very excited and I was curious. I’m glad I did. Same as the game or not, that episode was incredible."
Memories of the Alhambra,"I woke up this morning and decided to rewatch it while I did my morning jog on the treadmill. Went ""It won't be as sad the 2nd time, I got this.""

Did you guys know jogging is extra difficult when you're crying?"
Memories of the Alhambra,Two amazing performances in this episode. Wow. I was mesmerized the entire 80 minutes.
Memories of the Alhambra,"You NEVER see movies or TV shows where gay men grow old together. Let alone in a big budget entry in a massive genre IP.

It's usually two hot bisexual women played by two straight actresses one of whom dies two episodes in to make the other one sad."
Memories of the Alhambra,"This has to be one of the best cases of how deviating from the source material can make the new medium better. I played the game, I knew Bill, but I did **not** expect this whatsoever. But it's so good, it makes perfect sense for television.

Also, Andor has now gotten mentioned numerous times in this thread, it's on my list but it seems like I need to watch it ASAP!"
Memories of the Alhambra,"""I like you old. Getting older means we're still here.""

Hits a lot harder when you realize that these two men lived through the AIDS epidemic, too."
Memories of the Alhambra,"It felt to me like a strong episode of The Leftovers, and I can't give a show a higher compliment than that"
Memories of the Alhambra,"What's hilarious to me are the people who dislike it saying ""it didn't move the story forward!"" as if the Bill's Town section of the game wasn't just mostly a character development filler arc to get a car, all of which was accomplished in the first and last 20 minutes"
Memories of the Alhambra,"I think this is going to be the episode people mention when talking about the show. LOST had ""The Constant,"" The Leftovers had ""International Assassin,"" and TLOU is going to have ""Long, Long Time."""
Memories of the Alhambra,"Oh my God, I started crying as soon as Frank stated what he wanted for his last day!"
Memories of the Alhambra,Anybody who liked this episode would probably get a lot out of watching the series Station Eleven.
Memories of the Alhambra,Cried my damned eyes out. Beautiful episode
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,"No, why?"
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,Just wanted to discuss it and share my opinion on it since I hardly see anyone talking about it. Is there something wrong with that?
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,"I didn't say that it's wrong, i just ask why since you didn't say anything else beside just asking for anyone who already watched it"
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,"> The TV series will take place before the giant food rained down on the blue-collar town of Shallow Falls.    
    
First of all, *Swallow* Falls.    
Secondly, Sam Sparks and Manny clearly won't be in this series since they came to Swallow Falls right before that event happened.    
    
> The films' main characters Flint Lockwood and Sam Sparks will return as the focus of the series... Manny is the head of the school's audiovisual...    
    
What the...    
Also, I'm pretty sure they meant ""audiovisual *department*"".    
Sloppy article."
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,Great movie. Too bad the TV show will probably suck.
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,The vast majority of CN audiences are kids after school who don't follow TV seasons or episodes in the way you do. It's kinda a question without an answer because they will just repeat them all again without any change in viewing habits. 
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,"I don't know the gneral opinion here, so I am expecting a bad response, but I don't think the way CN premiers shows will matter at all as long as they continue having shit taste. "
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,"Nope. Ratings are lower than ever and all they do is pump out shit, with the exception of Adventure Time. Airing TTGO! all fucking day isn't helping either."
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,"> shit taste

Let me guess, are you one of the people who thinks everything they have on is shit but everything from the 90s was flawless?

That aside, I think their current practices of marathoning Teen Titans Go is stupid and annoying but their other cartoons are good, and deserve to be aired more often. Adventure Time is a show that should have some sort of rerun slot, for example. Steven Universe and We Bare Bears should be shown more often in a day's time. In fact they should expand their schedule to squeeze in Justice League Action and add some more variety. I dislike My Knight and Me but at least it was different and new. "
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,"Hell no, there is plenty of 90's shit that is well, shit. Teen Titans GO! is a perfect example of a show that should never have gotten made, the writers weren't even familiar with the Teen Titans, they just wanted a premade setting for wacky randumb bullshit. We bear bears is another shit show, almost as bad as Clarence or Uncle Grandpa. Gumball, while not my favorite, has an interesting astethic and a thoughtfully constructed world. Adventure Time, *was* good, no hell, great, but the keyword is *was*, it like many CN has over stayed. Regular Show was good, and I am glad it got a proper send off. I have nothing bad really, to say about Steven Universe, it has some excellent writing, and good songs, entirely watchable if you ignore the preachy bits. Power Puff girls could have been a nostalgia power house, but to me it feels lackluster. Samurai Jack though, supreme. "
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,"Half of cartoon network's schedule is filled with Teen Titans Go, that's all that needs to be said."
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,Pedro is BOOKED AND BUSY lately. All his roles have been iconic too. A truly stellar career.
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,If they start this year we might get season two by the end of next year. I hope we don’t have another two year wait for a show.
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,[deleted]
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,The rumor is they're moving production to Vancouver. Has anyone in the industry heard something similar?
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,"a lot of talk from fellow co-workers in the industry that it's coming here in Vancouver, can't wait"
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,"The Last of Us, and the Mandolorian basically have the same plot. “Pedro Pascal protects a really weird kid while everyone tries to kill them.”"
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,"the last of us 2 video game is very violent...full of hate, they better not hold back."
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,"#WARNING SPOILERS IN COMMENTS

I've played the game so im fine, scrolling through reading the comment there are several spoiler stuff, read at your own risk if you don't know the story."

(I haven’t played the games and have been avoiding spoilers)"
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,"Potential S1 spoiler:

Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,"Nothing against you OP, but can we stop sharing and upvoting Collider articles? Their SEO optimisation has made google a chore to use and their articles are all garbage.

Like this headline, star of show says that hit show may start filming next season this year.  I like TLOU but why is this an article?"
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,"*HBO starts filming December 31st*  
“We did it, guys!”"
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,"I dont know how I will be able to watch the 2nd season. Only played part 2 once and Jesus it was a crazy, good ride but I can't force myself to step in that Rollercoaster again."
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,The less time I wait between seasons is good for me.
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,Cross promotion with PGA or LIV?
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,"Given how Pedro & Bella have nailed Joel & Ellie’s dynamic, it’s going to be so heartbreaking going through that experience from Part 2 adapted on screen"
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,I just hope season 2 is longer. Season 1 feels so rushed. An entire chapter covered in 45 minutes to an hour just doesn't feel like certain parts of the story are getting the attention they deserve.
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,Fucking spoiler wow
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,Spoiler Alert! Guess he didn’t die ?
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,I bet it starts in the fall in Alberta and then moves to BC for the Seattle parts. Just a hunch…
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,I haven’t watched this show yet but it feels like more and more shows will take very long breaks between seasons but I find it very frustrating as a viewer
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,Anybody think the first few episodes were awesome but the last few have not been great? The first 2 episodes I thought this would go down as maybe the best show ever…. I feel like the only episode after the first 2 that was good was when they escaped the city and all the zombies came out of that whole and killed everyone.
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,Does anyone wanna tell him?.......
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,"any chance there's a cure and it works???

had to stop watching the Walking Dead once i realize it was like Gillian's Island.  they were gonna milk it till forever with no happy ending ever."
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,"I'd prefer if season 2 covered the period in between The Last of Us 1 and 2, rather than being a straight adaptation. It would give them a chance to add some original stories and build more lore rather than regurgitating what we already know will happen."
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,[removed]
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,"Man. There is gonna be some much drama over that season cause conservatives are pathetic. This season got nothing on how ""woke"" s2/3 will be."
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,[removed]
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,"Well, I guess I know he doesn't die now."
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,Please don’t follow the sequels story. It’s just too unbelievable and sad.
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,"I just can't picture Ramsey as Ellie in part 2, the energy just isn't there."
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,"It’s fine. I know we all wish we could just watch a new episode every week for the end of time, but you can tell the quality of this show takes time. Just the recreating of sets, my god.

Quality over quantity. They could probably bust out a season a year, but it would not be as good."
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,"I'm curious to see if the 2nd season will deviate much from the video game, or if it'll stay true to it.

The Last of Us 2 was divisive, to say the very least. I actually want the show to continue to be close to the source material, because I want to see how non-gamers react to the story. If it's anything similar to how the game fans reacted, the resulting salt is going to be something else."
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,Honestly I can see how this show ends with Ellie being the last human on earth.
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,[removed]
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,This series is not that good
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,The last episode was very boring
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,Between this and mando dude is working non stop. Take a break dude.
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,[removed]
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,[removed]
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,Last of us is fucking boring tbh.
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,"Whose gonna break the news to him?

Anyhow.... Bella Ramsey looks too short to play older Ellie no? Am I the only the dude on the planet who foresees any problems in the future here? 

How will she aggressively be taking down giant men towering her & dwarfing her relentlessly like in the game? There's so so much violence in The Last of Us Part II and they will need AT LEAST, 2 seasons minimum to cover it all do it justice.

I really hope they don't try to adapt one of my favorite games just to do it for money but none of the people involved in creating it have interest in doing it justice.

I feel like a reoccurring theme is happening in television, every game adaptation I have absolutely no expectations for *(Arcane)* I end up falling in love with, but the ones I have massive expectations for *(Netflix Resident Evil)* I end up disliking more than any other television."
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,So are they recasting Bella Ramsey ?
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,That’s a Joel in one
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,[removed]
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,Golf plot let’s go!!!!
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,Thanks for the spoil article.
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,I thought he died last episode
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,Nice!
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,"People who haven’t played the game: omg I can’t wait for season two

People who have played the game: god I hope they wait a few years to age up the actors for season two."
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,“They” like the studio or “they” as in Pedro written by a fisherthem?
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,">!Come one, can't be that hard for him to schedule like one episode.!< (Game Part Two, potential second season spoiler)"
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,Won't they need him for the first episode only?
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,Hopefully they get some decent writers for season 2.
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,Was there only 5 episodes? ?? Short first season
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,racism is bad
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,I would assume Sony would like to time it so Lou Part 2 comes out on pc around season 2. Could take awhile for the game if they aren't already working on it
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,"No, dammit. 

There’s a six year time jump between the two games. 

They need to slow down and actually let that actors age up and transform a little more. Especially Bella Ramsey. 

Makeup and hair dye can only go so far. 

Unless they’re doing what I really hope and making season two of the show a bridge between the events of the two games, but largely original/expanded in terms of storylines. 

I’d be fine with season 3 actually being the events of the second game."
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,Well given the fact mando also wants to shoot this year Pedro may have a issue
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,[removed]
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,"No they are not, the show is painfully slow and boring, it’s getting canceled."
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,[removed]
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,"I wonder if they are going recast Bella Ramsey the moment they choose to adapt the second season. Bella was chosen to play a 14 year old and she definitely looks the part, in last episode with Storm she definitely looked like an 18 year old with a 14 year old. So in the second game Ellie is older and its going to look weird if she doesn't age"
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,Too much woke agendas
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,[deleted]
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,Uhhhhhhhhh.......
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,Just please dear god don't make it into 8 seasons or some shit like that. I hope they've learned from their mistakes.
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,How has this man not collapsed from exhaustion! He is absolutely killing it and is in everything. He must be the hardest working actor right now.
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,it'll be really awkward if they run out of things to film before the next game comes out.
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,"Yes, I'd love that. Yes"
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,If season 2 is the four year gap with Joel and Ellie with some stories pulled from Fractions that maybe leads into winter. Season 3 can be the rest or just all of part 2.
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,What season does game two take place in? Summer?
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,Please!!!
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,"Absolutely love TLOU, but am not looking forward to going through the whole TLOU 2 debate again, and now with a whole new audience"
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,They have already setup a bunch of stuff from the 2nd game.

Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,now we need him in a Coen bros movie
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,"Yeah. He's the star of two of the biggest TV shows right now, and as of this week those shows are airing concurrently. He has the marketing machines of both Warner Bros. and Disney putting his face and/or voice all over the place.

The Ryuos Work is Never Done!,"He’s my favorite in it, it’s a great performance"
The Ryuos Work is Never Done!,"Barry reminds me of Bojack Horseman. Make the package as absurd as possible to lull the brain into a false sense of security. Then hit the audience with the most real emotions and amazing underlying story possible. 

It’s the difference between eating a vitamin and getting medicine intravenously. It’s so much more effective. 

Everyone on the show is entirely brilliant."

The Ryuos Work is Never Done!,"he was fooled at first, but her dad had him wrong. he wasn't protecting barry he was just simply no match for him. taking on barry was too much to ask."
The Ryuos Work is Never Done!,"Spoiler alert plz, Jesus fucking Christ"
The Ryuos Work is Never Done!,"Wait a minute. Wait.

Someone called me a *fuck fuck*?"
The Ryuos Work is Never Done!,a stone cold buster
The Ryuos Work is Never Done!,Haha I just watched that episode! What a twist
The Ryuos Work is Never Done!,Henry Winkler is a stone cold killer (Of gloom)
The Ryuos Work is Never Done!,Him and Daniel Radcliffe are my favorite guest stars on Bojack
The Ryuos Work is Never Done!,Got any clips/spoilers?
The Ryuos Work is Never Done!,Don't forget to remove the foil
The Ryuos Work is Never Done!,"Same. That, and at their cores, they are both essentially about a bad person trying their best to improve themselves, and both shows seem to do a good job of showing the ways that can work, the ways it can fail, and the ways it can be inadequate. I hope Barry gets a semi-redemption much like Bojack did."
The Ryuos Work is Never Done!,Or water skiing over a live shark?p
The Ryuos Work is Never Done!,"His quiet, resigned desperation with his children in Parks & Rec planted the seed."
The Ryuos Work is Never Done!,"It was more serious. It was still really good, but it wasn't as fun as in other seasons. I definitely didn't laugh as much."
The Ryuos Work is Never Done!,Because it was intense work for the actor you stopped watching it? Interesting
The Ryuos Work is Never Done!,Too good?

The Ryuos Work is Never Done!,That's where the expression comes from lol
The Ryuos Work is Never Done!,The true master
The Ryuos Work is Never Done!,probably his marine buddy turned detective will probably help him
The Ryuos Work is Never Done!,">!I'm guessing Barry and Fuches will sort of repair their relationship in prison together, and then as a season ender (or midseason point) Barry sells out Fuches to somehow get released or escape. Sally's season story will be about exploiting Barry's imprisonment for a chance at reclaiming the spotlight.!<"
The Ryuos Work is Never Done!,I think a good portion could be Barry being forced to use the skills he gained during the show to improv/act out an excuse to get the jury to go easy on him/not convict.
The Ryuos Work is Never Done!,"With the follow through the show has had I’m half expecting the next season,or the one after, to become a >!prison drama!<"
The Ryuos Work is Never Done!,"Someone that works at the prison they're shooting the season in leaked that there would be a riot. My guess is that Fuches is going to incite a riot after getting into people's heads and asking them to kill Barry. Either that, or Noho is going to pay an inmate to incite a riot so he can go into the prison in riot gear to extract Barry."
The Ryuos Work is Never Done!,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but Barry has escaped every situation by the antagonist's or police authority's outlandish incompetence or general ridiculousness. I'd expect the same to continue. They could just as easily open the next season with Barry's FBI buddy leading a press conference that ridiculously explains how Barry was caught between rival police and drug gangs led somehow by Noho Hank and, I don't know, that main detective who was also the now discredited police chief's daughter... Cut to Barry reluctantly trying to gently murder a guy as politely as possible... before driving to Joplin with Fuches."
The Ryuos Work is Never Done!,Dude the finale was 3 months ago…
The Ryuos Work is Never Done!,Or hanging out with the STREET SHARKS!
The Ryuos Work is Never Done!,"Yeah, definitely still good and enjoyed it.  Just lesser than the first 2 seasons."
The Ryuos Work is Never Done!,It was supposed to be a comedy.  It stopped being a comedy and became a heavy drama.

The Ryuos Work is Never Done!,"Right as he says ""I'm going to Burger King"" in the episode filled with Burger King ads.  Beautiful."
The Ryuos Work is Never Done!,Can’t hate that either. AD is so good for little things like this.  In fact it’s just entirely made up of moments like this.  Henry Winkler just dives into it and just seemed to be loving every minute of it
The Ryuos Work is Never Done!,"My opinion, but I think Fuches character should have been done after S2.  His arc in S3 was just goofy and implausible, even for a show that stretches reality."
The Ryuos Work is Never Done!,"Barry's writers still haven't used their ""one free Deus Ex Machnia"" yet. 

It's reasonable that Barry's done some wetwork on behalf of some of the intelligence agencies.  Or maybe they're interested in recruiting him to do some. 

He could use that to cut a deal and get himself back on the street."
The Ryuos Work is Never Done!,"That's kind of a good idea, actually. I'm not sure whether to believe Hader (who has vaguely implied Barry could go on indefinitely, maybe intentionally cuz Hader is more aware of fan speculation than most,) think 4 might be the 'epilogue', kind of. 

I know around Season 2 people were saying ""look at Dexter, you can't do season after season of the-walls-are-closing-in or it sucks,"" so maybe he planned the ending then."
The Ryuos Work is Never Done!,"As an audience member that will eventually lead to diminishing returns with the emotional payoff.  We'll come to expect he gets put in even tougher ""how is he going to get out of this one!"" moments to have the solution be even more convoluted than the predicament."
The Ryuos Work is Never Done!,How can you not laugh at that dirt bike chase scene?
The Ryuos Work is Never Done!,"It was supposed to be what according to who lol? It is a dark dramedy, has been a dark dramedy, and I’m pretty sure it will continue as such. The genre of the show has not changed one bit and this is the third season of a progressive story with super high stakes. The underlying tension of the true stakes at hand have always been there and at some point, some things are going to come to a head. There’s not always going to be a laugh but they are absolutely continuing to throw in some of the most creatively hilarious moments on tv right now."
The Ryuos Work is Never Done!,"Its supposed to be a dramedy it always was 

Also season three was still very funny despite being intense"
The Ryuos Work is Never Done!,This is my favorite scene of his in AD.
The Ryuos Work is Never Done!,"“It’s a wonderful restaurant!”

“It sure is.”"
The Ryuos Work is Never Done!,"Barry can somehow stomach killing innocent people for money, but a total sociopath hellbent on destroying him? 

Better verbally warn him, forever, until he succeeds."
The Ryuos Work is Never Done!,Was that scene at Barry’s hilltop body disposal site not a Deus Ex Machina?
The Ryuos Work is Never Done!,"🎵You're my buddy, you're my friend🎵"
The Ryuos Work is Never Done!,"I kinda filed that under ""Barry being Barry"".  

Guess I'll have to go rewatch the series to do a proper analysis."

The Ryuos Work is Never Done!,I love the Futurama intro.  It's akin to the Simpsons.

The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"Just make cookies, we're all fine with it."
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"Kind of a weird episode, but has GBBO been in a ""fall from grace?"" First I've heard of it."
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,The Swedish fish cakes were way worse
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,">Making a chocolate and chilli concha seems like a good idea, but using birdseye chilli instead of the myriad indigenous Mexican chiles seems like a bad one.

Birdseye chillies are native to Mexico. Also the article misspells the plural of chilli."
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"It was a bad episode, but I hate all this talk about Bake Off being on some sort of downturn. I watch the show for the good vibes, charming bakers, and cool bakes. Why do people insist on stoking a bunch of drama around it?"
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,Can you imagine if they told them to make dulce de Leche with a can in the technical? That would have been great fucking TV lol.
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,The old lady peeling the avocado IS Iconic!!!!!
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"I thought for a second it was the Mexican version of the  show but still called ""Great British Bake Off""."
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"If anyone has ever tried Mexican food in Europe, this should be no surprise. It is absolutely insane how Mexico has one of the best cuisines ON THE PLANET and it gets botched so thoroughly anywhere outside of the Western Hemisphere. 

Mexico has such fantastic food, PLEASE try it Europe."
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"It was dumb to have a technical that doesn't involve any baking, but other than that, I thought it was a good episode."
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"I’m half Mexican and I didn’t find the show particularly racist or offensive, except to good taste. Matt Lucas’ bad, hacky jokes and the taco challenge were pretty cringe. It’s like they didn’t do any research at all because there are plenty of other Mexican baked goods they could have done for the technical. Heck, even if not baked, I find tamales to be a huge PITA to get the texture right and they take hours to make so perhaps that wouldn’t have been fitting with the show’s limits. Sweet tamales are a big thing in Mexico too. 
My Central American roots think empanadas would have been a pretty good challenge too. Heck, they could have made the episode “Latin American” themed to cover more options. 

I still like the show and will continue watching it but this seems like it was a missed opportunity to highlight some amazing cuisine from Mexico to Argentina."
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"There are literally dozens of other baked goods they could have made instead of fucking tacos, that part was delusional. I liked the idea of a Tres Leches Cake but again they were nothing like what you would get at a mexican bakery here in the states.  


It was a decent episode, but they could have at least had a mexican baker as a consult to help them make it reasonably good."
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,I will never accept jokes about American cultural ignorance from a Brit ever again.
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,This reeks of the same shit that happened after the Japanese episode
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"The dragging on Twitter has been delightful. The perfect thing to fall on Hispanic Heritage month as it gives us all something to laugh at. Episode was mostly harmless, but good god England"
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"I just took it as a Mexican-themed episode, not a tribute to authentic Mexican cuisine. How could it ever be that with a room full of amateur British pastry chefs? What a bizarre controversy."
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,">Beyond being grievously offensive to Mexico, its people, and its culture

Good lord. This English fancy lad should talk to some actual Mexicans or Tejanos. ""Grievously offensive"". A shame he doesn't live in the US, because then he wouldn't have to put out this shlock to pay off the loans for his apparently useless journalism degree!

Part of the fun of watching this show is watching the parochial people on that side of the pond flail comically at some of our food in other places. But young people, often hopelessly rootless and alienated ones, tend to cling desperately to the only cultural signifiers they have, like culinary culture, as fetishes to be jealously possessed rather than a source of joy to be shared and enjoyed. And yes that includes watching hapless brits screw it up!"
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"As a Mexican, I could not stop cringing from how corny and fucking stupid the humor was."
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"Eh. I thought there was a fair amount of ignorance when it comes to Mexican food (not quite sure if Paul is clear of the difference between a taco and a tortilla but whatever). It was a little aggravating to see some of my favorite things get trampled on by people who don’t know what they are doing but that’s just part of these shows. I don’t know how to prepare a lot of dishes from far off countries and I’m in the kitchen cooking 5-6 days a week. My only experience on the UK was a rainy bus ride from Gatwick to Heathrow so I’m not qualified to speak to the number of Mexican restaurants or even Tex-mex, cali-mex or any other local American version of the food available in the country to use for comparison. 

Also amusing, fajitas are technically a Tex-mex dish made by Mexican ranch workers who got paid in meat (usually less desirable parts like the skirt). Not a Mexican one. Similar but not the same."
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,Where did I put the glocky-molo?
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"This article is ridiculous. It takes small random things and tries to make it out to have had more screen time than a second. These are not professional bakers,  the REASON we watch them is that they are imperfect, they don't know everything.  There are shows with all pro's competing against each other.  People watch this show because the mistakes can be entertaining as well as making the accomplishments delightful. They were NOT disrespectful at all in the show. Geez, everyone has to go after everything these days. It was a show of inexperienced bakers, who were NOT racist in any way, doing the thing we watch the show in the first place for."
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,People acting like Mexican week was the worst are ignoring the blatant hate crime that was the pizza signature bake.
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"When Carole said ""guacimolo"" I almost lost my shit lol"
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"""Tack-ohs""  My ears were bleeding."
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"If anyone went into that episode expecting anything more than fumbling attempts at Mexican cuisine, well, that’s on you. I grew up in the Southwest steeped in Mexican and native culture which I doubt the average Brit gets to experience short of extensive travel, and still couldn’t make a proper taco or pastry. It just made me want to go to that Mexican bakery the next town over and pick up some Marranitos."
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"On a side note - I thought the weirdest thing was the older pink-haired chick staying and Rebs getting the boot instead.

Rebs' cake must have been just terrible, like beyond inedible.  The other lady was was dead last in each of the other challenges."
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,Who uses the word nadir?
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"I think the show has lost it. 

Mel and Sue, and Mary, have been replaced by people really charmless. A guy who dates teenagers, a guy mostly famous for doing blackface and making fun of the poor and disabled. Which would matter less if they managed to be funny but they aren’t- it’s just intensely self satisfied mugging. 

And Prue - who is a massive tory (and her son is literally one of the worst MPs in the Commons). Have disliked her intensely since Great British Menu. Probably the least likeable mainstream TV personality out there. 

The fun of the show should be in seeing amateurs and hobbyists make high-end, complex or classic baked goods, the stuff you might come across but have no idea what would actually go into making it. I have zero interest in ‘make a replica of your nan’s garden out of a [insert cake]’. I think the curveball stuff they’d have saved for the finale in previous years is just every week now. 

I think some shows just end up feeling out of step with the times, Bake off is one."
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"For one, why were they making tacos on a baking show…? Two, I’ve never been to a Mexican food place that puts refried beans on a taco. Not even that, refried beans are typically made with pinto beans, but they gave them black beans…???"
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"Wut. The episode might not have been the best ever, but it was still a decent episode.

The only episode of this show that sucked imo was when that young female finalist a couple seasons ago (sry can't remember her name) had a breakdown over her bakes going badly. That was pretty gloomy to watch."
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"I mean if it was the 1950s I could see this as them saying ""yep, nothing at all wrong here. "". But one thing I noted in the UK, there aren't Latinos, no Mexican food. But Indian food and Jamaican was readily available. Halal. Just a different part of the world. Contrast that with our ignorance of Indians."
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"From the article:

>Why does this show not want to teach people anything?

I would posit that a big part of the appeal of the show is I *don't have to learn anything*. I can put it on, stare at pleasant people making food, and comment that ""that probably tastes amazing"" to my roommate. When I want to learn stuff in my programming, I watch different shows."
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,This smacks of an offended person looking for things to get offended about.
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"This person obviously hates the show and took this bad episode to try and take them down I guess? There are plenty of shows that can teach you things, this is just a light hearted competition show that has amateurs trying to make things. There is zero nefarious action here."
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"Being a in a blended family of Mexican Americans, was super damn disappointed. Like seriously, a big mustache on a cake is NOT racist? Uh, not cool, and from a POC too. And then, don't get me talking about the tacos. Tacos are NOT baked, nor do they belong on a baking contest. It shows a sincere lack of engagement with the Mexican culture."
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,Was the worst 🤣
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,The only thing that really got me was the Taco competition. There was barely any baking. It was all stovetop.
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,I remember the “Japan” week lmao
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"""One does not bake a taco."" Yes!!! I kept screaming at my TV during this segment."
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"Clearly, they need to stick to bakes from cultures Britain has occupied in one point in history. Mexican bakeries have some AMAZING foods in very vibrant colors and flavors this was an awesome opportunity squandered."
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"You guys remember the American episode? Where Paul Hollywood spent the entire time bashing pies, they all of them made a tart, not a pie, in the most disgusting flavor combinations you've ever heard of, and then agreed it's because American pies are inherently terrible?"
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,Swear to god it’s always just the same group of white people getting upset on behalf of another culture and writing articles about it.
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"Do people really think the show is not good any more?  I mostly watch it because my wife likes it, but honestly it's the only baking show I can stomach, but I haven't noticed a significant difference in the show now compared to the early days.  I think Noel and Sandi were the best hosts, but I'm not sure the appeal of the show is necessarily the hosts."
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"This is all overblown just like the asian week a few seasons ago. Yes it’s cringey british interpretation of mexican cuisine, what do you expect? They’re nowhere near mexico. The show is still all charm, so what if they’re silly and have extremely british takes on food from other places."
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"It wasn't a great episode, but this article is ridiculous"
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"There was nothing offensive about this episode, stop the bullshit."
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,I think you need to be the race or identity that is supposedly offended before you can write about the supposed offense. This being offended on behalf of others is actually offense appropriation. And is NOT ok. *literally shaking intensifies*
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,Nadir? So it’s getting better again?
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"All in all it wasn’t as bad as social media made it out to be, there were definitely some terrible stereotypes there’s no getting around that but I wouldn’t call it the downfall of the show. That woman peeling an avocado though…. I wanted to climb through my TV and smack her."
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"Not seen the episode so only a limited understanding of what went on in the show.

But is this really that offensive? It feels in this overly sensitive age we are giving ammunition to the right. This makes them feel justified in calling us snowflakes and saying the left is ridiculous. 

And that means there is room for genuine racism and other bigotry to slip in which is unacceptable.

Sterotypes can be in poor taste, or sometimes something fun. There are many about the English, bad food, poor food etc yet those who make those are not said to be racist and I am not sure the Mexican stereotypes are either."
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"It's pretty gross, though, the number of people who reacted to this trainwreck by saying stuff along the lines of ""white people shouldn't cook Mexican food."" Food is food (and Mexicans be white anyway). Let's stop with food-related racism.

The episode itself may have gone poorly but I like the idea of them branching out. Like, okay, Victorian sponge, jaffa cakes, hobnobs, fraisier cakes, over and over again. It's good to have a little variety. The main problem was there wasn't much *baking* happening. Why did they have to make guacamole?? 

Also the people throwing fucking hissyfits about them not saying stuff like taco correctly?? It's called a regional accent. And there's one person who was like ""They're practically next door to Spain and they can't pronounce these things correctly"" like??? They're pretty far apart from each and also, again, accents. 

If I were in charge I think I would've done an international bread week instead of this. Like for the first round they have to make traditional Irish soda bread, the technical is challah, and the showstopper is Norwegian Skolebrød. All of it involves baking, nobody has to figure out how to open an avocado (but why wouldn't you look up how to do that beforehand? They're told what the challenges for the episode except for the technical are a week ahead of time, wouldn't you figure ""gee it's Mexico week, maybe I should look up how to open an avocado *just in case*""??)"
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,Huh what a weird article to make
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,They have the fucking worst jokes. Why the hell would you put a little Britain star as a main stake of this show.!??? They have no jokes that are family friendly and sound like a dummy when they deliver
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,So far!
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"So is it an inaccurate stereotype or cultural appropriation? It can't be both.

(edit: I'm well aware that at the very least it's blinkered, ignorant bullshit)"
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,People are so sensitive
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"The way people lose their minds over a show about baking cakes astounds me. I've seen about ten threads on Reddit about Mexican week. People need to accept the show for what it is, and get out more."
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"Honestly enjoying the show as much today as the first season, idk what the hubbub is about. One meh episode a “nadir of downturn” does not make, and there have been PLENTY of less exciting episodes. It’s a feel good, fun show that just doesn’t require this sort of critical eye to me. Honestly, who cares?"
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"This whole article is terribly cringe and dramatic. GBBO is far from a “fall from grace”.

Its still charming, creative and wholesome."
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"terrible job 
by far the worst GBBS 
I feel bad for people that watched this and “learned” about Mexican cooking/baking unacceptable I lost respect for British folks on this"
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"Bake Off sucks now which sucks because it was one of my fav shows going back to Mel and Sue, no surprise America and Netflix got a hold of it and it’s declined ever since"
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,White people get offended by the weirdest things.
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,[deleted]
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"It was a poor choice. The contestants had no idea what tacos should taste like. Mexican food is the opposite of English food. Mexican food is spicy, flavorful, and a smorgasbord of flavors and textures. Tacos (when done right) come topped with fresh lettuce and fresh diced tomatoes. English food is… not."
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,it's fine. Relax
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,Matt Lucas and Noel Fielding getting their comeuppance would bring me joy
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,Is that buttery biscuit base bloke still on it?
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"In the UK’s defense, Mexican cuisine is really only known in the New World in any reasonable manner. While Asian and Africans from the Old World have brought their food traditions to the New World as well as Europe, Mexican—and Latin American cuisine overall has not made it out, likely due to migration patterns. 

Ingredients have, but not techniques or recipes."
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,Prue kill another kitten?
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"Japan week was pretty bad: pandas and kowai cake. 

Pandas have never lived in Japan, and ""kowai cake"" is ""scary cake"". (They meant ""kawaii cake"", or ""cute cake"".) Great Canadian Baking Show made the same blunder with ""kowai cake""."
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,TL;DR: ***Stop liking what I don't like!!!***
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"I just couldn’t get over the fact that their “refried beans” were just beans and onions cooked in a pot and then put on the taco. The refried part was non-existent. I was expecting them to get judged on the fact that no one actually did the refried part, but then it wasn’t even mentioned. Churros would have been a way better technical."
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"The only thing that was a ""disappointment"" was Rebs not getting voted off earlier, and I didn't have the actual tacos in front of me. It was a weird episode for sure, but I've watched far worse things than an usually charming one show doing something slightly different."
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"I feel like the hate for this episode was wildly overblown? I watched the episode expecting absolute disaster from what I had heard all week, and it was just fine? Some of the jokes were naïve/ignorant, but I didn't feel like there was anything mean-spirited about anything they did."
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,As an American I absolutely loved watching British folk try and mostly fail to cook Mexican food. The show is still great. The contestants last season were better (THE JURGENATOR!!) but the show is fine.
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,I mean besides the single joke at the beginning and the fact they made tacos which didn't require baking at all was weird but this is just a silly article
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"Nadir is weirdly the word of the week. Covid, GBBO, etc."
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,The real hate crime was what they did to my cultures food. They could have made them make so many different things but it got left on the sidelines
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,They were fine
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"I stopped watching last series , is it still good… my interest waned, can’t put my finger on it , maybe it’s just run it’s course ? Or are people still loving it ?"
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,so far.
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"I think this is a bit of an exaggeration. Fall from grace? Hardly. Lazy writing and poorly thought out challenges? Absolutely. 

Aside from the horrible pronunciation of some of the bakes and a misunderstanding of the concept of a taco, it feels like the production team didn’t know quite what to do with Mexican week but went on with it anyway. That’s a shame because these assignments were stupid and didn’t send the right people home. Carole should have left weeks ago.

But yes, the stereotyping wasn’t funny and the assignments bad. Just a bad episode and hope they will do better. Dessert week was already lots better so it goes to show: stick with what you know."
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"I’m Mexican and this was hilarious, I was literally cracking up with my friends. Thank you for making this entertaining shows! ❤️ Made my night 🤣

And of course we Mexicans don’t take offense! Mexican cuisine is designated by UNESCO as a cultural treasure 😋 you’re missing out on all the flavorful dishes that we offer to the world 🌎"
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"S'mores technical challenge says ""hold my beer"""
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"I was most offended by the lack of hygiene. One lady tastes her product with her finger and goes back to cooking, then right after another one sneezes into the open. There's no way I'd have tried any of it without ample hand washing"
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"As a baker, Texan, and Spanish speaker (with a British husband), I was offended on many levels by their lack of understanding of a tres leches cake. And the fact that everyone in the episode kept calling the “tortilla” the “taco”."
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"Or bread!  Actual loaves of bread.  Pizza, a pastry, and a cake made of sandwiches is not necessary!"
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,So many pastries they could have done!
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,Oh the days where contestants were asked to make Farthing Biscuits...
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"I'll be honest, this series hasn't grabbed me like previous years have"
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"The sketches are annoying, the show works better when it's just the stuff in the tent"
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,There was a noticeable dip in quality once Mary Berry left. Also Noel and Matt arent really suited to hosting a baking show.
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"It's been on a downturn ever since they got rid of the cool ~~lesbian~~ extremely funny comedienne hosts and brought on the Mall Goth and Mr Dumbshirt. They're not funny; most of their 'jokes' are making things more difficult for the contestants and then laughing at it. They resort to gimmicks over actual humor.

EDIT because I apparently misremembered how one of them were described."
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"I've always preferred the Australian, Canadian, & Kiwi versions myself."
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"I gagged for that entire segment, and I love fish OR cakes."
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"I’m a Swede and I had to google to find out what a ""Swedish fish cake"" even is. If it is what is essentially a patty but made with fish instead of ground meat I can’t see how that was part of a baking show. The heck."
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"Also they still had to use items they had readily available to them in the UK. So even if they wanted to use other ingredients, they likely had to use what they could."
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"I was gonna say, I’m no pepper expert but my fancy recipe magazines associate it with Mexico, it’s just often subbed for Thai chilles if you can’t find them"
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"> the article misspells the plural of chilli

""Chiles"" is listed in dictionaries as a legit variant. There are lots of spellings for chillies."
The Great British Baking Show: Holidays,"All of the contestants collectively disrespected pizza in the previous bread week episode, which was so much more offensive. =p"
Baby,I will always remember cocaine trenchcoat John Mulaney
Baby,"His first standup special since his relapse, breakdown, divorce and birth of his child. This will be interesting, that's for sure."
Baby,Good to see more Asian representation on Netflix.
Baby,So there I was cheating on my wife who was half my standup content...
Baby,"I’d be so much more excited if his series of terrible life choices hadn’t changed my outlook on him. Like, it’s not like he did anything illegal, (apart from copious amounts of cocaine, anyway) but the way he just left his wife out to dry like that after she saw him through rehab is just such a dick move."
Baby,"I say this as someone whose been a Mulaney fan since I saw him open for Mike Birbiglia in 2006…

IMO His new stuff, while funny, can be boiled down to; “man who has lived life without consequences continues to do so”"
Baby,"My wife and I were legitimately obsessed with Mulaney for the longest time. We’ve seen all of his specials about five times and we saw him live when he was touring Kid Gorgeous. We used to quote him constantly (and we still do occasionally) and he was one of those celebs whose involvement in something made it instantly appealing to us.

But then the stuff with his divorce left such a sour taste in our mouths that we lost all interest in him. It sounds absurd because, obviously, we don’t know him at all, but the whole thing was just so scummy. He had this wife who he talked about all the time in his routine, who clearly loved him and who stuck by him as he relapsed and had to go to rehab, and then he divorced her. Then, like a week later, he’s with Olivia Munn. Either he immediately moved on, or he was cheating; either one is shitty. Now he has a baby with Munn, which has to make the whole situation sting extra badly for his ex-wife."
Baby,I imagine this is what he was touring with and it’s well worth the watch
Baby,Please tell me he isn’t going from child free standup jokes to getting up there and talking about his kid constantly. Please. It’s such a fucking trope when comedians do that.
Baby,"Was gonna say essentially the same thing as the current top comment; my wife and I loved Mulaney and now feel incredibly, incredibly weird with him. The entire thing with his ex wife and Olivia Munn and the baby, it was just a lot."
Baby,"I don’t know… after he knocked up that other woman while still married to his wife, I just don’t find him charming at all and think he’s more annoying than funny. He gives me the ick now and I don’t care about his new special because I’m not going to watch it."
Baby,Dude went from likably quirky to fuck this asshole real fast.
Baby,Trash
Baby,"god i used to love mulaney but after what he did to his loving wife who he made the center of a lot of his stand up, i don’t know how to move past it and enjoy his work again. gonna give it a shot but i can’t help but feel anger towards him over a situation i had absolutely nothing to do with"
Baby,Used to enjoy him… used to.
Baby,Pass. He’s a dick.
Baby,Saw his standup at the Bourbon Room in LA back in Jan. Pretty much all rehab jokes. Still high-larious though!
Baby,Aaahhhh I just don’t like him anymore. Anna was one of us (artists) and he was using so much stories of her being cool and shit and he treated her like that? Fuck him
Baby,"Not really interested in this guy any more.  I used to be attracted to his wholesome brand, but he treated Annamarie Tendler like complete dogshit (and if you think that's an understatement you probably have not read into it very much) and ruined that.  I'm sure he's got some new image that's working for some people, but I'm not trying to elevate yet another dirtbag."
Baby,"I was at the taping for this special and my favorite parts were the lighting shifts and watching him redo a joke if something went wrong. For instance he did a joke where he was walking, but his tie was moving too much so he walked backwards and redid it."
Baby, He’s funny but not funny enough to make up for being a douche
Baby,I’ve matched with his ex-wife on two separate dating apps. We talked about Kusama and public perception but never ended up going out.
Baby,"John Mulaney's entire schtick is, ""Woe is me. I've had absolutely no adversity in life and couldn't stop doing cocaine."""
Baby,I can't wait to not watch it
Baby,"I saw From Scratch earlier in the tour and unfortunately didn’t really enjoy it. I’m a huge fan of all his previous work. I’m looking forward to checking this one out though, hopefully he polished up a lot of the routine and it’s significantly improved."
Baby,Meh. He’s shown his scummy side. I’m good.
Baby,I hope he and Pete Davidson make it through.
Baby,Probably gunnu pass on this one. Given .. ya know.
Baby,Boo hiss
Baby,This guy is such a shitbag.
Baby,Saw him live and he's still got it
Baby,Meh
Baby,Parasocial relationships are weird.
Baby,I saw him on this tour. It’s about 80% drugs/rehab related material. But he’s still fuckin’ got it.
Baby,am i the only person who doesn't really find him very funny or appealing?
Baby,I’m looking forward to this. It’s been a while and he has had a lot of changes in life so I am sure he had a lot of new material
Baby,"So excited to see this, I saw him early on during his From Scratch tour when he was still working on material and LOVED the set."
Baby,I saw this live. It's incredible.
Baby,"Oh boy it's gonna be so fun to hear jokes about how emotionally abusing his wife was funny, actually"
Baby,He sucks
Baby,The bit he does about his college asking for money is still one of the best stand up bits I have ever heard.
Baby,"To quote John Mulaney and his mother, “oh this oughta be good”"
Baby,Is Baby J the name of one of the many young women he slept with while cheating on his wife or is it his newborn daughter that’s also a result of cheating. Just trying to follow along.
Baby,From “not wanting children” with his wife to having a baby with Olivia Munn. Sounds like he fixed two things with the divorce
Baby,I saw him do From Scratch live and I remember it being really good but forget individual jokes I'm excited to watch it again
Baby,“I WAS ON THE BENCH!”
Baby,Ooohhmm. 😩 I’m sorrrrry.~
Baby, My favorite comedian for the last seven years (though I haven't actually counted the years)!
Baby,I have a feeing this is going to be watched as much if not more than the Chris Rock stand-up.
Baby,i love when there is stuff to look forward to (that is like just for fun). Last season of Barry is out in April too
Baby,I caught this show in Memphis last fall and it might be his best. Definitely worth watching when it drops on Netflix.
Baby,Gonna see him live in Vegas about a week before this airs.  Curious as to how much overlap there'll be.
Baby,I got to go to one of the tapings last month.  Looking forward to watching it on Netflix!
Baby,Because we're Delta airlines and life is a fucking nightmare 😂
Baby,"Mmmmmm pass. 

His wife seems like a really nice person and didn’t deserve what he and Olivia Munn did to her."
Baby,90 minutes of his Muppet voice? No thank you.
Baby,Hell yeah. I saw him on his tour right after cleaning himself up and he’s still got it. Best stand up show I’ve seen. Really looking forward to this.
Baby,"My fiancé hates him! Which is fair. Douchebags can still be funny, but should I support him by watching though… it’s not quite a Louie C.K. situation - I won’t touch that guy’s material anymore"
Baby,Is he still sober?
Baby,So many people are mad that a famous person got divorced. Lol. What year is this?
Baby,"If this mirrors his recent standup shows he has been doing around the country, this is gonna be a great special. His post rehab humor is great!!"
Baby,"God i hate reddit sometimes 

Everyone judging this guy on personal life shit when nobody knows a damn thing about it other than vague news headlines.

I will judge the only aspect i do know from this man, his publicly available comedy, and enjoy it if it is good. Dont care how many divorces he had, or if he was cheating according to reddit math."
Baby,"Some people are understandably miffed at him for cheating on his ex, I'm miffed that he let Chappelle open for him and hugged him despite it being in the wake of him being a transphobic piece of trash."
Baby,Yay!!!
Baby,Imma watch the shit out of that.
Baby,"Very excited for this, I saw this show live and Baby J still got it.

Less excited for internet people being weird about him again, I'm sensing a disturbance in the force."
Baby,"Please please please don’t be another “old comedian airs out their grievances” special, and extra please if he can not talk about cancel culture lol"
Baby,Am I the only one who likes this guy more now
Baby,wow lots of moralizing weirdos ITT
Baby,"So is he finally done with his ""Days of Girlhood"" Tik Tok series?"
Baby,Finally. The man is hilarious.
Baby,"Why are a lot of the comments in here obsessed with his personal life? If he makes you laugh, enjoy it. If he doesn’t, don’t watch. 

No need to get caught up in his personal life drama that has nothing to do with you."
Baby,HE BACK BABY
Baby,I’ve never been more excited for a special.
Baby,This was the funniest standup I’ve ever seen - I’m pretty excited to watch it when it comes out on Netflix
Baby,[deleted]
Baby,I hope it doesn't have that p.o.s. Dave Chappelle in it.
Baby,"So it appears that John’s younger brother died when John was 4, and they visited his grave every year. He also has ADHD, which has a history of stimulant abuse, sex and uppers. The pandemic happens, he ends up back on drugs for whatever reasons, perhaps due to lack of stimulation. This causes tensions with his wife, which leads to John finding escapism in other women on social media allegedly. John goes into rehab, relapses, gets an intervention, and then goes into rehab again. After that he cheats on his wife with Olivia Munn, getting her pregnant, though it’s possible John and Anna were separated by beginning of 2021, not announcing it until May, meaning it’s only kinda cheating? John’s child with Olivia is born in November, and John and Anna divorce January 2022.

I suspect that John going into rehab gave him some sort epiphany leading to everything happening with Olivia Munn. This is common for people who get off drugs, they make large life decisions pretty impulsively. Why John got into drugs in the first place confuses me. Perhaps he wasn’t being stimulated per his ADHD, or perhaps things with his wife were never as good as they appeared.

All in all, I feel sympathy for John. Addiction is hard, ADHD is hard, and COVID was hard. All that at once led to him making a lot of big bad decisions. I feel especially sorry towards Anna."
Baby,"🙇🏼‍♂️ Well, I’ll still watch it to see if his material is good or not. I don’t give a fuck about his marriage issues drama like the rest of you.  
  
I WILL SAY HOWEVER, the other night I watched the Chris Rock standup special on Netflix and it fucking sucked. Bro was talking about how he identifies as poor, but then goes on to specifically talk about how ridiculously rich he is and how ridiculously spoiled his children are. I never felt so disconnected with a comedian. I doubt I’ll ever go out of my way to watch a Chris Rock standup ever again."
Baby,Is it just me or does he really really not look or sound like the kind of guy who would be an alcoholic and drug addict?
Baby,People still use netflix?
Baby,"Man- some people here are clearly perfect people with no blemishes in their past huh? 

It’s fair to have a bad taste because of his “scandal” but to me that’s pretty shallow and quite naive to think stand up content is an accurate account of their marriage. Again I get it. But if you actually listen to his jokes he was very open about his drinking and drug use and always was pretty open about not being this perfect person. It’s just because he presents dorky that everyone imagines him as a choir boy and we’re shocked when an addict relapses and perhaps makes questionable decisions. 

I always said I never wanted kids - after my divorce I realized that I do. I just didn’t want to with them. People change. Things change.  

Shame on his ex-wife for compromising her values and desires (wanting children) if that’s true because I don’t know but have seen it written many times. Don’t marry someone thinking they will change their mind on massive things like kids. 

Don’t assume you know someone because of their stand up set. And it’s okay to enjoy someone’s comedy who is less than perfect."
Baby,"Anytime he's brought up all his old parasocial fans, who have now transferred those feelings to his ex-wife come and tell us all about how they don't like him anymore. So predictable."
Baby,I didn’t even know anything went on with this guy until I read this thread. Even before this I never understood why anyone thought he was funny. An easy way to know that someone has no sense of humor is if they tell you this dude makes them laugh.
Baby,[deleted]
Baby,"I'm glad Mulvaney got work. Hope it pays decent - he must have some alimony to pay & he needs dollars to raise the baby. I hope we ALL learn from our past mistakes and make better choices. I'll watch his special, he makes me laugh most of the time. But I'd never want to know him personally - he seems untrustworthy. Sorry, Dude."
Baby,No one cares.
Baby,"This turd isn't funny, I don't care how many famous funny people claim otherwise."
Baby,"Apparently Reddit believes cheating on your wife is akin to being a sex criminal. For god’s sake, stop acting like fundamental Christians."
Baby,"A comedy special not named after cancel culture, I thought that was illegal in the comedy business these days"
Baby,...What my mother always called my Dad in arguments...
Baby,"Well you know what they say, can’t bake a pie without losing a dozen men hehe"
Baby,Wow glad to see 2023 is the year of sleazy comic comebacks. He should do a tour with Louis ck they probably have the same fan base
Baby,"This is a garbage human. What he did to his wife was truly horrifying, I won’t give him any more of my pennies. #TeamAnnaMarie 4eva"
Baby,Seeing his content constantly on the tic tac has turned me off. His voice is so fucking annoying.
Baby,Yeah. No thanks. I hate comedians
Baby,K
Baby,Is this a different set than From scratch?
Baby,BabyJ the valorant player is finally getting some exposure
Baby,I'll be awaiting his next music number from a subway car
1983,"If you saw this back in the day, you knew a good movie was coming on"
1983,I can hear this thumbnail.
1983,There’s an interesting making of clip on YouTube on how they made this intro. They put a lot of effort into this back then.
1983,Back when a movie was an event
1983,This was the alert to get to the basement it was starting. Before the movie could be paused and wait for you. So many Doritos were lost in the rush to the tv that day.
1983,Dude this is so nostalgic. That sound lets you know you’re about to watch something good. Such a classic 80s sound too
1983,"When I was a kid, I was terrified of this intro for some time. It's more because of the music really. I saw a movie called Dreamscape, and being pretty young it scared the hell out of me. In my mind when I head the music, that meant the movie was about to start playing, and I got scared. This went on for awhile until I started watching Fraggle Rock. 

Now I want to see Dreamscape and see if I had any reason to be scared of anything."
1983,You were living the high life if you had HBO in 1983. You had to live in an urban area to even have access to cable. We lived out in the sticks and did the rabbit ear dance depending on which of the four networks we could watch.
1983,"This is such a nostalgia kick for me.  This intro is so much better than the current, bland one.

When I finally get my home theater setup, I'm ripping this and playing it before every movie.  So naturally the first movie I'll watch after this intro is Flash Gordon."
1983,My brother and I used to watch Fraggle Rock every Sunday night when we were little. This was the unofficial start of the show and we both knew to get our asses to the family room.
1983,My grandpa used to record movies for me off of HBO when I was a kid. God do I miss him. A lot of our movie collection had a worn-down version of this intro on it.
1983,"A homage to it was put in Justice's amazing [""DVNO"" music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiDsLRQg_g4) at the 0:41 mark."
1983,My mom told me that as a baby I would stop whatever I was doing and crawl to the TV whenever I heard this.
1983,"HBO - Hey, Beastmaster’s On!"
1983,"Ayup.

As always, watch for the dent in the B at ~~1:07~~ :50 (per u/SweetNeo85's callout), bottom of screen. This is all physical/practical stuff, layered up.

""Making of"" video here:  https://youtu.be/agS6ZXBrcng"
1983,Man this is major nostalgia vibes
1983,I still think that model city is really cool!
1983,This brings back memories...
1983,They should remake this for HBO's 50th Anniversary this year in November.
1983,Twenty Thousand Hertz made a great episode about the music in this https://www.20k.org/episodes/itsnottvitshbo
1983,I remember waking up at 5 am on a school day to watch Star Wars and getting so excited when this opening started.  Thanks for bringing back that memory.
1983,"While I do enjoy the HBO intro, I'm more partial to the [ABC movie intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-gZ1Il-hbc).

Esp with [Ernie Anderson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xp0gGWRHIqQ) (Paul Thomas Anderson's dad) narrating."
1983,Is it weird that this gave me goose bumps?
1983,"I am grateful to my father; he absolutely adored television programming, and we always had HBO when I was growing up.

I was exposed to so many interesting and fun films from the '80s and '90s that I otherwise would've never seen until later in life, when they probably would have been less impactful. Lots of smaller films that never got aired on broadcast and basic cable channels.

Along similar lines, I was the only kid I was aware of in elementary school that was allowed to watch the Fox network, beginning ~1990… my father [and mom] felt that, some objectionable content could be overlooked if the writing was genuinely smart and funny. I watched In Living Color and The Simpsons pretty much from their inception."
1983,"Holy crap, that brought back so many memories!!"
1983,Man I remember this!  This was a big clue to young me that something special was about to come on.
1983,That trumpet player is going the fuck off.
1983,I love this intro. Dan Soder had them use it for his HBO special in 2019.
1983,"If you had a friend who had HBO and a VCR, you got some nice commercial-free movies on tape. I used to go to a friend's house and he had a drawer of taped movies. It was awesome."
1983,"I was a baby when this intro would come on. Dad told me that I would come rushing into the living room in my walker, park in front of the TV, be mesmerized by the intro, then leave as soon as it was over."
1983,"Damn, that brings back memories."
1983,"This has been my ring tone for the last 6 years (from where HBO appears in the sky ~0:32s)! People who recognize it love it but they can't immediately place where it's from, most think it's an old school football intro."
1983,This intro used to give me such joy. Sometimes the music still pops into my head at random times too.
1983,'Winning Time' should have started each episode with this.
1983,The Avengers theme absolutely rips this sound off lmao
1983,Much nicer and easier to see remaster: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7bqL0R3kGE
1983,"HBO has always had iconic intros, this one and the static noise one, although I grew up watching the latter."
1983,"I can’t tell you how many times as a kid I would see this and say, “oh is this Beetlejuice, on no, it’s another movie”."
1983,Never seen this before but the part near the end with the hovering logo is so ominous and scary. Reminds me of how frightening the THX intro is
1983,r/VaporwaveAesthetics
1983,All before CGI.
1983,"Used to get so excited. Now it's like, what garbage are they streaming now?"
1983,New to me since my parents were too poor for any paid channel
1983,Feature presentation intros really shouldn't go THIS hard lol.
1983,Directed by Tim Burton?
1983,Shout out to Dan Soder who used this as the intro to his stand up last year (this year?).
1983, Now in the streaming era this has been replaced with the WORST bumper possible for streaming.
1983,That’s f*king lit
1983,"This takes me back, and the song seems even better today."
1983,Holy cow. It's been decades since I've seen this and I could still hum every note of that song. So classic!
1983,Looks and sounds like they’re about to drop a kick ass prog rock album
1983,"J Ferdinand Smith composed that track. Only know this cause he’s from my hometown and owns a pretty big ad agency. Popular DJ back in the day, voice of Wegmans, also did 80 and 88 Olympic theme songs I believe among other things."
1983,Saturday night movies at home when I was growing up. Nothing else like it!
1983,"Ahh yes, Saturday nights at 8pm"
1983,Good ol' Space Station HBO.
1983,"Wow i love this 
Did not need replacing maybe just updating with newer graphics and bam amazing"
1983,"I grew up in the southern Ozark mountains. We didn’t have cable. Couldn’t get it. What we could get was one of those big, honkin’ satellite dishes. 

Back then, if you had a satellite dish, you could literally get ALL the channels. This was way before subscription models. We had HBO, Cinemax, The Movie Channel, Showtime, and maybe some others I can’t remember. 

When the HBO intro started, we knew something good was about to happen."
1983,"Wow, I did not expect to love this so much—super cool!!! Take an award 🥇"
1983,"""Home Box Office will show this feature only at night."""
1983,They really need to make a modern CGI version of this. I think it'd be sick.
1983,When i was growing up and would visit my moms house (who had HBO) i used to get sooooo hype when this would start!
1983,That's hot.
1983,"I remember this only playing before the Saturday night movie of the week, which was almost always the first cable run of a theatrical release.  To this day, it's amazing.  They should still be using it, who cares if it's forty years old?  It was such an epic intro to a new movie that you were likely seeing for the first time."
1983,The sound of my childhood right there.
1983,Man they ran this for a long ass time huh? ‘83? I remember this *vividly* from the 90s.
1983,Very strong Thor Ragnarock vibes at the end.
1983,What memories that brought back.  At that time there were so few ways to watch movies at all.  I remember watching the original Alien movie on HBO at about that time.
1983,This was HYPE back in the day.
1983,Superman the movie that them got you so excited
1983,That music!
1983,"Fraggle Rock, dun,dun, Fraggle Rock


Always came on just before Fraggle rock and now you can’t unhear it!"
1983,"There any memories, but right now I remember the excitement of Conan the Barbarian starting."
1983,"Back when this was their logo, we used to call the network Hey, Beastmaster’s On!, since that was the movie they showed about five times a day."
1983,This intro leading into Beetlejuice.  Good times when I was a kid.
1983,This is part of my childhood. I was 7 when this came out and I can't even remember how many times I watched this intro before a movie on HBO. My dad was hard of hearing & loved loud music & would turn it way up when this started. It was magical then & it's still magical for me now. They should keep using this!
1983,Makes me sad to see what they are doing to HBO now.
1983,This got me super hype. Just knowing it was a movie I’ve been waiting forever to see and this kicks in. Nothing like it.
1983,And you knew when to press record on your vcr.
1983,Seeing this makes me feel like I'm about to watch Rocky III. This could be a top post over at r/GenX
1983,"Real curse words, topless women, and no commercials."
1983,"...and if they aired the short version, you were about to watch garbage."
1983,Superman (79’)
1983,"I think they should go back to these once in a while, and play the period-correct intros according to when the movie was released.

They could also make period-correct intros a user-selectable option on their streaming services."
1983,"That intro is a core memory for me, for sure."
1983,Like i was up saturday at 3am to watch hbo for a movie.. ;)
1983,I hum this to myself all the time.
1983,You would be referring to this excellent BTS feature [HBO Intro - Behind the Scenes](https://youtu.be/agS6ZXBrcng)
1983,[One artist/editor recreated the second half with modern tools and it’s pretty spot on and looks beautiful in 4K.](https://youtu.be/d4wiVedizlA)
1983,I remember seeing it back in the 80s. I think I remember that the metal “HBO” letters had a dent that you can see at one point.
1983,Not the 4th installment of the prequel of a movie that was once innovative.
1983,"I can hear my grandma yell ""IT'S STARTING"" over the music; that was the cue to grab our blankets and pillows and head for the den. She'd already made the popcorn (in her electric popcorn popper - didn't have a microwave at that point). My brother and I got to split one can of Coke and one box of M&Ms between us."
1983,And sodas shaken
1983,Probably still under the couch cushion
1983,That movie scared me too.
1983,The denis quaid movie? It’s a pretty good 80s action sci fi flick.
1983,"My brother and I still talk about that movie.  It had an odd side effect on my young psyche. There's a scene where the villain is eating in the cafeteria of the dream research center.  It's before you know he's really the villain, maybe.  He's eating a burger and soda, and while he's still chewing on a bite he takes a sip of the soda, which is in a typical to go cup, with a straw.  It never occurred to me up to that point in my life (I was 8 or 9) to drink while I was still chewing on food.  I became obsessed with the idea of it for a while.  I would do it every time I could remember to.  Then I guess I just forgot about it at some point. But every now and again I still catch myself doing it, getting pleasure from it.  35 years later.  Inscrutable.  The whole thing, to me at least."
1983,"We had a ""magic"" little black box with a dial that somehow got HBO, Showtime and Cinemax until it didn't. It had a good run through."
1983,"My parents couldn't afford cable so we only watched HBO at my grandparents' house, which made it even more of an event."
1983,"We also lived in the sticks when I was a kid. No cable, and the roof antenna only got CBC in English and French, and two other local channels that depended on the weather.

It was mid-80s I think when my dad bought a satellite dish, one of those giant 10ft diameter things that had to be manually cranked to point at satellites in the sky. G3, S1, etc. My god I'm old."
1983,"Interestingly enough, cable television first came about specifically to serve more remote rural areas that didn’t have reception to OTA broadcasts…though obviously once it started becoming popular it was much easier to get cable run in urban areas quickly, still leaving a lot of rural folks without service."
Death by Magic,"Neeson:

>”No, I’m not,” Neeson said when asked if he’s interested in returning. “There’s so many spinoffs of ‘Star Wars.’ It’s diluting it to me, and it’s taken away the mystery and the magic in a weird way.”

>""It was nice to do that little bit with Ewan, after 25 years, 24 years. I appeared in the last episode. I had 2 lines to say, and it was cool and I loved it. But that's it."""
Death by Magic,Star Wars is being hurt by lack of direction and mediocrity.
Death by Magic,"The only Star Wars spinoff I've liked is Rogue One and Andor. 

Andor was one of those where I couldn't *believe* anyone was able to get the script approved."
Death by Magic,"I just don't understand why they insist only doing stuff from the start of the clone wars to just after the fall of the empire. Give me some Old Republic stuff like Mandalorian wars, the ancient sith lords, or the creation of the jedi order."
Death by Magic,Or maybe it's that the ratio of good to shitty movies/shows is like 1 out of 5 being generous.
Death by Magic,Number of spin-offs isn't the problem. Terrible scripts are.
Death by Magic,Liam Neesons though….
Death by Magic,"Honestly, the last movies were hideous in comparison with the spin offs."
Death by Magic,There's different camps of Star Wars fans. Original trilogy vs original 6 vs disney Star Wars
Death by Magic,"ITT: Lots of misdirected anger.

The guy is right, and there's nothing wrong with him saying so.

Edit: FYI, if you're writing me a five paragraph essay of fan drivel, I'm not going to read it."
Death by Magic,"I can see where he's coming from, but when your spinoffs (Mando, Andor) are considered better than the trilogy that recently came out, you gotta get behind what's still making you bank."
Death by Magic,They are being hurt from shit stories and terrible writers
Death by Magic,"He then closed out the interview by promoting his next film.

#Tooken 8: The Tookening"
Death by Magic,"He's not wrong.

It's why DC Comics tried to streamline things for new readers with The New 52, and then Marvel later tried the same thing with Marvel NOW!; when there's too much of something, people get fatigued trying to keep up with everything.

You could always say ""don't watch everything"" but that's not how the brain works."
Death by Magic,The “mystery” was taken away with “midiclorians “
Death by Magic,"Agreed. And he isn't saying all ""spinoffs"" are bad, which would be unsupportable (see: Andor). An overabundance of varying quality, definitely."
Death by Magic,"I mean I kinda agree 

Mainly if your content isn’t AAA maybe it shouldn’t be made 

Like bad batch is great but some episodes are kinda filler and think obi wan and boba Fett shows don’t need to exist"
Death by Magic,He should know. He was a part of the beginning of the end.
Death by Magic,He's right.
Death by Magic,Andor
Death by Magic,"Andor was ten times better than the last 6 movies.

I think it's the opposite.  The terrible movies are ruining the franchise.

Even bobba fett was better than the last few movies."
Death by Magic,"Wasn't he in the midichlorians Star Wars episode that literally removed the mystery of the force?

And didn't he have that bullshit story line about Anakin?  Ok, just checking."
Death by Magic,I agree with him for the most part. Andor was out of this world.
Death by Magic,"Hes right, but also....

Do another movie where your a grizzled old veteran that has to begrudgingly do one last job or save someone that's in trouble, and in the process you redeem yourself."
Death by Magic,Says the guy who did “Taken” and dozen other  of the same formulaic films of a guy seeking revenge.
Death by Magic,"I hate to break it to him, but the prequels diminished the value of the franchise."
Death by Magic,"Says the guy from: Men in Black International, Daddy’s Home 2, The Huntsman, Ted 2, Taken 1-2-3, Anchorman 2, Wrath of the Titans, The Chronicles of Narnia, The A-Team, Les Mis, Arthur the King, Excalibur, and I’m sure I’m missing a few spinoffs, remakes and sequels. He is well versed in running stories into the ground."
Death by Magic,Says the man in the first spinoff.
Death by Magic,Bro there’s too many Liam Neeson movies if anything. Three of them came out last year alone and I bet they were all basically the same
Death by Magic,"He's right. I used to really enjoy the movies occasionally. Even saw the prequels in theaters. Then they kept coming, one after the other and every dumb mother fucker in the world is out here trying to act like they are the biggest fan in the world. It got so annoying that I can't enjoy any of that shit anymore"
Death by Magic,It’s become the Empire
Death by Magic,I don’t mind the expanded universe of movies so long as they are not shit and lately the complaint is that the movies and spinoffs have been nothing but social justice shit.
Death by Magic,Totally agree
Death by Magic,"Yeah, sorry Liam, but nah. Projects like Rogue One, Mandalorian, Bad Batch, and Andor show that there is plenty of time for great stories in this universe. It's not an issue of to much content, but an issue of flying space Mary Poppins cameos of Princess Leia's reanimated corpse and Jar Jar Bigalow ""Mee-sa Senator now"" being regurgitated into the screen. The issue isn't volume, it's quality."
Death by Magic,"""Being hurt""?  


No, the damage was done a very long time ago. Now its more like kicking the pulverized remains of a long dead horse"
Death by Magic,"people here complaining about diluting star wars, sayin disney is at fault.

meanwhile i was reading these same stories in the 90s, in comic and/or novel form, because the star wars EU existed.

the only difference is now they are turning the stories into live action. hell episode 9, which i greatly dislike, is still very much Dark Empire from the 90s.

Fuck if they dont need to go ahead and make Shadows of the Empire into a live action series.

crime lords vs sith lords. lets go!"
Death by Magic,I happen to agree with Mr Neeson on this...
Death by Magic,Whatever made Andor happen - keep doing that.  Best Star Wars material out there.
Death by Magic,"Stars Wars succumbed to the Marvel-ization effect a while ago. I feel the same way about a new star wars IP as I do a new superhero movie: oh, ok."
Death by Magic,"“Star Wars” always struck me as a story about Anakin Skywalker and how he turned away from good and then was redeemed by the love of his son. 

That story has been told."
Death by Magic,"Well Star Wars fans have proven that they'll watch and like any old crap, so it doesn't really matter."
Death by Magic,I agree and also like the some of the spin offs.
Death by Magic,Space Jesus isn't wrong
Death by Magic,"Think the sequel trilogy did that, mate."
Death by Magic,When does Taken 6 come out?
Death by Magic,I think it’s diluting for me that Neeson has made multiple films with the same plot for the last 15 years.
Death by Magic,Clearly not a fan of Andor being better than his entire role.
Death by Magic,"No, it's been hurt by Disney having ZERO outline for the Sequel Trilogy.  Rian Johnson's Episode 8 was a mess, then Episode 9 was an abomination.  ""Somehow, Palpatine returned.""  

Say what you will about Geroge Lucas' writing skills, but ""Somehow, Palpatine returned.""  Is just about the most idiotic sentence in any Star Wars movie... scratch that, ANY movie where a villain came back for unexplained reasons."
Death by Magic,"I disagree, I think fleshing out the galaxy beyond the skywalker saga is a good thing.

I think people are conflating some of the quality issues of some of the content with the need for said content. I would prefer Disney spend more time curating quality Star Wars spin-offs rather than green lighting every half assed project, but I don’t think spin-offs themselves are the issue."
Death by Magic,Isn’t this the guy that shared screen time with JarJar Binks?
Death by Magic,"Respectfully, I disagree."
Death by Magic,Boooo … explore the Galaxy.
Death by Magic,"Yeah, well, you know, that's just, like, your opinion, man.

I think its fine, its more the varying quality that is the problem, not the quantity."
Death by Magic,"I have to disagree with him - especially when it comes to the shows.  For this IP or any other, it really comes down to the quality of what is being produced, not the number.  If it is good, then people will watch it.  For ***Star Wars*** specifically, the ""universe"" is so large I am enjoying the more micro looks into it."
Death by Magic,"Ehh sounds like an old man complaining bout kids on the lawn, I wanna see every story of that universe and now I can. Sure some are misses but at least they tried."
Death by Magic,Jar Jar.
Death by Magic,"I don't know, many people are actually liking some of the things they have done. Many spinoffs in the movie department were really good, like rogue one and solo, many were great successes like the mandalorian and andor. Fans love those (maybe some not so much at the start like it happened with the episodes one though three) but the misses on Disney plus have been much less, the bigger ones were in the last trilogy.

The only thing that really was going to hurt the brand was focusing entirely on the Skywalkers. Fans loved and live through the extended universe for years until they had some live action stuff again. And that was the beauty of Starwars how they could make different stories in the same universe not make everything about the same people all the time."
Death by Magic,It is funny because the spinoffs are the only thing that I enjoy.
Death by Magic,Yeah it started around 2001...
Death by Magic,"You were in one of those spinoffs, Liam! XD"
Death by Magic,"Yep star wars stopped being special a long time ago but there was money to be made so can't really blame disney for squeezing every penny out of it. If you could of told 12 year old me there would be multiple star wars tv shows and movies I would never be even quasi interested in, I don't think I would of believed you, but here we are."
Death by Magic,I mean...the movie he was in started that.
Death by Magic,"Hard to agree when Andor is hands down the best piece of starwars content out there.

I know people who don't watch any starwars content that loved Andor."
Death by Magic,"Yes, but I knew Disney was going to get that 4 billion they paid George Lucas for the franchise back and then some.

There was a video of a guy or someone freaking out when Star Wars Episode 49 or some such came out. I figured that was where it was going to go."
Death by Magic,Pretty sure midiclorines s/p are the ones that took the mystery away.
Death by Magic,I love Qui-Gon!
Death by Magic,"Lol. jar jar binks. There are only 3 star wars films, anything else ruins it."
Death by Magic,Wrong
Death by Magic,Wrong.
Death by Magic,"After reading the comments, I just wanted to say I enjoy the prequels; especially ROTS!"
Death by Magic,Honestly… Rogue One is the only Star Wars movie I like and would watch again.
Death by Magic,Oh please bring back the midiclorian bs…
Death by Magic,Humbly disagree.
Death by Magic,"I love Liam, but Star Wars shat that bed the first movie he was in. At first i was annoyed at them ruining my childhood. Then I realized I'm a grown ass man. Maybe it's ok that Star Wars don't cater to me as a grown ass man the way they did when I was a kid."
Death by Magic,Yep.  This cow has been milked dry
Death by Magic,"From the man, in the movie that gave us a boring genetic reason for jedi to exist."
Death by Magic,"No, because there was no more story to tell after the first trilogy."
Death by Magic,The damage was done with the prequels.
Death by Magic,"Yeah, fuck that. Andor was great. Rogue One was great. Keep them coming."
Death by Magic,No one tell him about where midichlorians came from
Death by Magic,"I feel like the original appeal was a rag tag group of filmmakers and actors got together to tell a story about a rag tag group of underdogs adventuring around space, with lots of space battles and laser swords. But it's grown so beyond that now that it's so exceptionally mainstream. That's probably why The Mandalorian and The Clone Wars are so popular among fans because they are the closest to capturing that spirit."
Death by Magic,"I love The Mandalorian and the original trilogy. I haven't seen Clone Wars or Andor yet. Otherwise, I think the franchise has been more misses than hits."
Death by Magic,"I think he has a point. Lot of garbage in the star wars universe. But there's some true gems. Andor is truly remarkable and if you love star wars, then this series acts as a love letter without unnecessary fan service. It's fantastic story telling within the star wars universe with compelling and interesting characters."
Death by Magic,That’s because he didn’t get a part in a good show. Like Andor…
Death by Magic,I swear I read this as Leslie Nielsen.
Death by Magic,“We have to explain the reason behind Han Solo’s last name.”
Death by Magic,"…He says from the set of Taken 13. /s 

But for real, they should’ve stopped after the prequels, at least there was a point to those ones."
Death by Magic,Isn't this one of the main criticisms leveled against the prequels when they came out? George Lucas has the same problem I do where he has too much anxiety when it comes to explaining things and so he over explains instead of letting the audience infer things. A big reason the first 3 movies were good was because of his ex-wife who edited them.
Death by Magic,-said a person who's never read a star wars book
Death by Magic,No its being hurt by idiots making the decisions and poor writing
Death by Magic,"If only Qui Gon had a young daughter that had been kidnapped whilst on holiday in Coruscant with her best friend, and then he had to use his talents to track her and bring justice to the evil ringleader of the trafficking gang. That would have worked as a spinoff series!!!"
Death by Magic,You mean bad star wars. Andor is a masterclass in how NOT to fuck up the universe. I say more spinoffs
Death by Magic,"True, I literally did not even care about the spin-offs only the main trilogy movies."
Death by Magic,"I totally disagree with Neeson here. If they made fewer Star Wars spinoffs they wouldn't suddenly be more magical. Instead of regular soulless cash crabs it would just be somewhat rare soulless cash crabs.

Hack writers and creatively bankrupt people don't magically become more talented by doing less work."
Death by Magic,"That's a very reductive take on what is a grand fictional universe ripe to tell many different kinds of stories in.

Lack of mystery and magic doesn't happen because of spin-offs, it happens because of unimaginative writers.

But there is a bit of truth to it, of course. You can't keep telling stories without chipping away at the mysteries of the IP. That's just how it goes.

However, I have never believed that to mean that more stories shouldn't be told."
Death by Magic,I've got the perfect solution: don't watch the spinoffs.
Death by Magic,He’s right and he should say it.
Death by Magic,"Well, I don't know. Maybe he has a point, but for me the reason it has been hurt has more to do with the lack of talent and vision, particularly in the sequel trilogy."
Death by Magic,10000% agreed
Death by Magic,Solo is the best Star Wars movie and I'll die on that hill.
Love and Fortune,"I loved how they didn't take themselves too seriously in the final season as well.

Singing ""U + Ur hand"" to a group a Nazis and ""I had the time of my life"" for the final showdown."
Love and Fortune,"Emily Hampshire is really good in this, she plays Brad Pitt's character from the movies."
Love and Fortune,"Deacon is in this season of Picard. 

I am just now finding out that Picard has a lot of 12 Monkeys references because they share some of the same writers or something?"
Love and Fortune,"Love this show, causality and fixed time loops scratch that itch in my brain so good."
Love and Fortune,A show with a perfect ending. It's rare you get a show that wraps everything up so nicely.
Love and Fortune,"Some of my favorite shows of all time are Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, Mr. Robot, The Leftovers, Dark, and Bojack Horseman.

I put 12 Monkeys in the same category. It is that good.

It is overlooked and dismissed for some unfair reasons: (1) It is based on the movie. But the show goes WAY BEYOND the source material and becomes it's own story. The show is levels better than the movie. (2) It was on SyFy which has a somewhat deserved reputation of airing crap. 12 Monkeys should have been on AMC (when AMC meant something)."
Love and Fortune,Really liked the ending.Fun ride for sure.
Love and Fortune,For those who haven't watched - it's a really fun and satisfying show. The cast is great and every single mystery set up during the show is answered by the end of the excellent series finale.
Love and Fortune,[deleted]
Love and Fortune,"Show runner and writer Terry Matalas is currently killing it on season 3 of Picard, which is poetic seeing how dude made his bones on DS9 and has now come full circle."
Love and Fortune,Probably my favorite show of all time. Definitely the best time travel show of all time. Watch it.
Love and Fortune,"My film professor in college absolutely hated this series and I never understood why. It's a bit campy and doesn't take itself too seriously but for what it is, it's a great show."
Love and Fortune,It's not prestigious TV or anything but it's damn good scifi and just fun! Definitely got one of the best endings of a show.
Love and Fortune,"One of my all-time favorite shows! We were just talking about it the other day. I'm so glad we got to see it all the way to the end and that it didn't get cancelled halfway through like so many others. 

99 Luftballoons was just a bonus none of us knew we needed."
Love and Fortune,Travelers is a good time travel show
Love and Fortune,"I thought it was pretty entertaining and certainly doesn't get the respect it deserves compared to other recent sci-fi programming. The woman basically playing the Brad Pitt character had a great run - she went from being a bit annoying to the show stealer.

Still had some issues though. The baddies were like comic book baddies, it might have been more interesting if they were more nuanced. Sometimes character motivations felt forced to make the time loops still work. And the usual stuff where it falls apart if you think about it too hard (They will reject an obvious solution because it might ""affect the timeline"", then the next episode they do something way more drastic in the past and it's seemingly not a problem.)"
Love and Fortune,This show was great. Might be time for a rewatch
Love and Fortune,"Well based on the comments here, I'll have to give it a go!"
Love and Fortune,"I'm struggling a bit with Season 1. I know the show is supposed to get better, but the editing/writing/music feel very 2015 SyFy (which is hardly surprising I guess). 

Does it shake some of this off in the later seasons?"
Love and Fortune,One of the few shows I'll watch at least yearly all the way through. Amazing television.
Love and Fortune,Love this show so much.
Love and Fortune,This show is one of my favourite shows of all time. It’s entertaining and time travel actually makes sense. Very well written and underrated for sure.
Love and Fortune,"This show was a ""secret tip"" over 5 years ago... But there are still people who had never heard of it. 

This show is one of my all-time favorite shows."
Love and Fortune,This is probably the best time travel show I have ever seen and probably the best sci-fi show show after Fringe for me.
Love and Fortune,"I've definitely watched this show. But honestly I cant remember really anything from it. 
A showdown in a warehouse? 

Was it really that good? How comes I don't remember what happens in it. Hmm."
Love and Fortune,"It's a shame that many, many people quit this show during the first season altough the story hasn't begun yet. It takes time to unfold. This is one of the best written shows and it has the BEST FINALE ever. Better than Six Feet Under. Better than Breaking Bad. It has no plotholes (which is insane because it's time travel) and you can even watch it backwards and it still makes sense.

Don't even get me started on one of the best characters ever developed: Jennifer. What a delight. THIS is how you write strong women, dear Hollywood!

What a masterpiece!
10/10"
Love and Fortune,I stopped somewhere S02. Dont know why
Love and Fortune,"Fantastic show, where does it stream?"
Love and Fortune,"Absolutely loved this show. Been trying to chase a similar show to scratch the itch for time travel and/or epic scifi ever since, and just can't find one. Closest thing was probably Continuum. But Battlestar and 12 Monkeys are probably my two favorite epic sagas."
Love and Fortune,"I stopped watching, because while it had good scifi and concepts, it felt like the same antagonist/situation season after season."
Love and Fortune,"great show
always recommend it"
Love and Fortune,"I loved Nikita, and since this show had a bunch of that cast and I always enjoyed the movie I checked it out. I remember enjoying the first season but just kinda stopped watching after a while, I need to get back into it one day, always heard good things."
Love and Fortune,Same show runner for the new season of Picard which is night and day different quality from the first awful 2 seasons of Picard.
Love and Fortune,"I never knew there was a show, will check it out."
Love and Fortune,I've seen the movie.  Didn't know there was a show.
Love and Fortune,"This show, Black Sails, and The Leftovers have been among the most satisfying series for me in recent years. They are exceptional, and worth investing the time into.

12 Monkeys is a carefully planned and well executed time travel story that will have you on your toes for the duration of your first viewing, and if you rewatch you will get the pay off of seeing how lovingly the puzzle got masterfully shifted into place. 

Genuinely one of my all-time favourite TV shows."
Love and Fortune,"The movie was brilliant, if depressing. I never even heard of this show till now."
Love and Fortune,I still watch full series every few years. A good example of how a reimagining / reboot can work.
Love and Fortune,You really can see the actors and writers having fun.
Love and Fortune,"wasn't a huge fan of the movie, hows the show in comparison?

edit: alright i'm convinced. going to potentially binge it this weekend!"
Love and Fortune,"Loved this show. So we’ll done. As much as I would have liked more seasons, it ended well and feels complete."
Love and Fortune,I loved this show. Definitely worth a watch.
Love and Fortune,Aaron Stanford should be a bigger star than he is
Love and Fortune,"I haven't seen it in a while but I remember thinking it went on for too long. They had a great reveal of who the villain was but then it felt like thet got renewed for more episodes and had to add a 'actually, this was the real villain all along'."
Love and Fortune,"If you get past the fact that the show is a reboot/reimagining of the original movie premise, then it is a really fun watch. They really fleshed out the characters and just took it in a whole new direction. The movie is definitely in my top 10 list. I love Terry Gilliam movies and the heartbreakingly beautiful closed loop time travel paradox ending will always be a cinema high to me."
Love and Fortune,"i liked it, i watched it until the thing with the baby and it was too much."
Love and Fortune,"My favorite TV show of all time. Great story, time travel is very thrilling and keeps you invested, but even the best of stories is nothing without great characters and this series has amazing characters. By the end of it I was very invested emotionally in the characters. Also, the best finale I've ever watched, which is very hard to get right."
Love and Fortune,In this thumbnail that guy could’ve already shot her. Shows use guns so stupidly and it doesn’t add to the excitement at all. Basically TV writers have no respect for or connection to other people and are all Michael Scott.
Love and Fortune,Couldn’t the guy in the picture quickly scoot slightly to his left and take the shot with her head turned?
Love and Fortune,Someone must have never seen futurama
Love and Fortune,"Man that show was an insult to the source material. 

Y'all like that show but hated Cowboy Bebop is sure a indictment to objectivity."
Love and Fortune,"I wish the true ending was the bleaker one, but still enjoyed the show."
Love and Fortune,I think Dark has something to say about this
Love and Fortune,"I'm on like the third season. It was pretty stupid. Time travel has no rules.

Alisen Down is great. She's been great for over 20 years though."
Love and Fortune,I gave up on this in the first episode where the watch got a scratch carved into it.
Love and Fortune,Good summer binge show
Love and Fortune,"The first season was great. 

They really put a lot of great seeds into the fact that climate change was going to destroy the world, so by saving everyone you'd be dooming the planet, etc. 

Then I guess there was a showrunner change or SOMETHING because season 2 went completely off the rails. I stopped watching but I don't think it got more on-track ever."
Love and Fortune,[deleted]
Love and Fortune,"Been thinking alot about this show lately, especially when ""red flowers"" became a device on ""LA Brea""."
Love and Fortune,Where can 12 monkeys be streamed in the US?
Love and Fortune,"I think I forgot about it. The movie was a real trip - if the show is that good, I need to watch it."
Love and Fortune,"Where can we watch this? Indian here. HBO content is on Hotstar for your reference. 

Lionsgate, Hulu are shared between Prime and Hotstar."
Love and Fortune,Started drinking whiskey sours because of this show.
Love and Fortune,There is a show? Is it based on the movie?
Love and Fortune,"This is the show I truly want to ""make"" people watch, and just don't know how."
Love and Fortune,Does any of it take place (or was filmed in) Philly?
Love and Fortune,They made a TV show??? Now I need to check it out.
Love and Fortune,Wait does the series have anything to do with the movie?
Love and Fortune,"Just kickstarted my weekend binge. Loved this show, haven’t watched a 2nd time yet."
Love and Fortune,"Forced myself to watch all of it after seeing it hyped to high heavens online. It was.... okay? I most definitely prefer the original Terry Gilliam film to it. After seeing articles like this one and seeing gushing praise on the internet I expected something much, much better."
Love and Fortune,Is this related to the bruce willis movie? Should I watch this instead of the movie?
Love and Fortune,Very nice
Love and Fortune,An actress that has shown great depth is Emily Hampshire and the comparison between her 12 Monkeys and Schitt’s Creek’s roles is pretty amazing.
Love and Fortune,"""U + Ur hand"" really works because of how they work the shows theme tune into it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDEgASduaR8"
Love and Fortune,>!Did we just save hitler?!< is one of my all time favourite lines from a show.
Love and Fortune,"I watched few seasons until the baby, can you quickly recap how the story ended?"
Love and Fortune,Dude spoiler!
Love and Fortune,"Emily Hampshire and Kirk Acevedo absolutely carried this show. Everyone on it was good, but those two stole every scene either of them were in."
Love and Fortune,Upgrade!
Love and Fortune,Movies plural? Was there a sequel to 12 monkeys that I didn’t know about
Love and Fortune,Shame about *The Rig*.
Love and Fortune,Terry Matalas created 12 Monkeys. He's in charge of Season 3 of Picard (finally this show is good. It's the Terry Matalas Effect). He leaves Easter eggs legt and right in this show.
Love and Fortune,"'James Cole' was listed as one of Jack's aliases, and Cole himself played the Ferengi gangster who named a drug 'splinter'.

Also Athan Cole and Robert Gale were in season 2."
Love and Fortune,"Yeah, Todd Stashwick is the most interesting part of Picard S3 so far, so I'm definitely curious about 12 Monkeys now"
Love and Fortune,Seasons 2 & 3 of Picard have the same show runner (Terry Matalas).
Love and Fortune,I agree! I've been wanting to go back and rewatch this after recently watching Dark.
Love and Fortune,So glad I saw this. Never heard of the show before but I’m 4 episodes in now and I’m loving it.
Love and Fortune,Crazy that SyFy just dumped the final season like they did but am so glad it got wrapped up.
Love and Fortune,"I feel the exact opposite.  I thought the finale destroyed the show with fan service.  Definitely a bad landing, almost as bad as GoT."
Love and Fortune,"All shows that absolutely nailed the ending. Though I would have been fine if Bojack went a little more dark >!to really drive home that you dont have unlimited chances to fuck up.!< 

I agree that it being on syfy kept eyes off it which was a shame cause that was a short window where syfy was firing on all cylinders. 12 Monkeys, The Magicians, The Expanse were all in that era and are all amazing shows."
Love and Fortune,"I just finished Dark last night. Still not sure what to think. I loved the first two seasons, but then found season 3 to be an absolute slog."
Love and Fortune,I still consider it one of the best shows ever. It really should be studied in film schools because of how tight it's constructed and written. Also one of the most satisfying endings.
Love and Fortune,[deleted]
Love and Fortune,"ok, this convinced me to watch it. The movie was ok, not bad but not great as well. Probably the reason why I didn't want to watch the show. I will give it a shot."
Love and Fortune,Is there a place to watch it streaming right now?
Love and Fortune,I think I’ll watch it based on this comment thank you. Same level as dark and mr robot? Sign me up!
Love and Fortune,"Do I need to have seen the movie to enjoy the tv show?

Edit: having discovered the magicians a year or so ago I have changed my tune on syfy shows and am willing to give them a couple episodes of viewing and judge them on their merits. I was definitely one of those “2s” not too long ago"
Love and Fortune,So I read this comment a few days ago and decided to give it a shot because I love breaking bad and better call saul. The plot seems very cool and I love some good time travels stories but the writing is lazy. How many times are they going to have a bad guy at gun point only to hesitate shooting so an explosion can go off and they can escape. It's happened so much that I had to find this comment and say thank you for the recommendation because I am enjoying the show but I can't even begin to put it on the same level as BCS or breaking bad.
Love and Fortune,Legion comes to mind.
Love and Fortune,Interesting to me that you felt they added filler in those seasons. Season 3 and 4 were mapped out from start to finish after season 2 so everything was planned out. I guess I can understand some instances but at that point the show was just having so much fun I didn't care in the slightest.

Clemmon (""Officer Clemmons"" in the show) for being gay but accepted him for who he was.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqSBqfDgOsQ) Keep in mind, this was back when homosexuals (especially towards men) was treated badly by the general public and depicted in a very unflattering manner in media.

Not to mention [Sheep](https://w0.peakpx.com/wallpaper/802/894/HD-wallpaper-for-my-friend-luciah-cute-angel-ruth-morehead-lamb-kiss.jpg) [(especially Lambs)](https://i.imgur.com/T4aw434.png) [actually symbolize innocence and purity](https://i.imgur.com/xtmIKom.png) with Rogers using the term ""Sheep"" in a positive and flattering manner. Not in a negative fashion which become more common in recent years (especially when it comes to politics) instead of it's positive use."
Hymn of Death,Aww thank you so much! Your kind words mean a lot to me
Hymn of Death,If more people of the belief acted like him I’d probably still have faith.

Hymn of Death,"To make you feel even better, I stumbled upon these two adorable Holy Cards/Prayer Cards of a boy surrounded by [adorable lambs with a cross](https://i.imgur.com/T4aw434.png), while the other has [them all cuddling him in front of the cross.](https://i.imgur.com/xtmIKom.png) It's by a Spanish artist that went by the name ""Constanza"" which I found from Todocoleccion.net. I've also feel in love with the artworks by similar Spanish artist Juan Ferrandiz."
Hymn of Death,"As a Christian, I actually agree with you. Fred Rogers was one of the very few Christians who actually followed Jesus' lessons and didn't just take scriptures or passages from The Bible out of context or used it as a weapon. Unlike a majority of Televangelists and a vocal minority of Christians. There is a saying in Christianity that went by ""You call yourself a ""Christian,"" but Jesus wasn't a snob who judged people for their imperfections."" referring to Christians who do the exact opposite of his teachings among other issues. Rogers on the other hand, was one of the very few who actually remembered Jesus' teachings his entire life.

Didn't intend this comment to go on a short religious ramble (since I rarely discuss religion to avoid ending up in hot water), but I wanted to discuss why Rogers was truly a one of a kind person both on and off-screen."
Hymn of Death,[removed]
Hymn of Death,Mr Rogers had a great song that might help you sort through your feelings. It was called “What Do You Do With The Mad That You Feel”.
Hymn of Death,What? There was absolutely no uppitiness in the comment you responded to... lol
Hymn of Death,"As a “Christian” I don’t regularly attend services anymore but do try to live by the Golden Rule, I’d love to see the hateful Christian’s expelled. They give GOOD Christians (of which there are many) a really bad rap."
Hymn of Death,Thanks for sharing. Good to know he was true to himself both on and off the screen. 🙌

Hymn of Death,[Here's the link to the song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJBPTROt7G8) for those those unfamiliar with Mister Rogers outside the States (and Canada to a smaller degree).

Hymn of Death,"When I say streaming has taken the soul out of TV, these are the little things I'm talking about."
Hymn of Death,Oh boy...
Hymn of Death,"The whole Friday Night Death Slot always seemed so unnecessarily cruel to me. 

I get that if a show isn’t getting the ratings the network will take it out of its timeslot for something that can pull in those numbers, but, like, instead of outright cancelling it they put it on a time they know it’ll fail? Seems like a foregone conclusion that if you move a show to such a time no one will watch it, so it’s more like rubbing salt in the wound than anything"
Hymn of Death,"I like a self-referential ad. I've never seen it but apparently ABC made a promo for Moonlighting, a show notorious for missing air dates because of production running long, that showed network executives impatiently waiting for new episodes to arrive."
Hymn of Death,i miss not being able to sleep and kind of watching late night TV only to be startled awake by the end of programing test screen with the tone comming on
Hymn of Death,[deleted]
Hymn of Death,The lower expectations on Fridays weren't always bad. I think The X-Files changed the game when I was a kid and Friday tv changed from the death slot to the nerd slot. You got more niche shows that wouldn't have a chance at other times.
Hymn of Death,"I kind of miss the art of the late night infomercial, like the ones that tried to trick you into thinking they were real talk shows but they all looked exactly the same and sometimes even had the same audience members."
Hymn of Death,"Honestly, I miss that. It was the “no more TV, go to bed or do something else” thing.

Kind of like last call at a bar. You don’t have to go home, but you can’t stay here."
Hymn of Death,Waking up a 3am to wonder why Aaron Brown is on channel 4 rather than channel 7 and why he was sitting next to a cardboard cutout talking about a National Temperature Index.
Hymn of Death,"Well, FOX fixed it by putting wrestling in there."
Hymn of Death,"But also shows were historically often moved there to be gotten rid of. The OG Star Trek had its budget slashed and was moved into a timeslot no one saw for Season 3, so surprise surprise the quality went down and it was swiftly cancelled. 

It’s almost like the execs are trying to make a show bad on purpose (by diverting the funds elsewhere) to set it up for failure and turn fans against the show. which is how so many great series were sabotaged by their channel. You can see that, right?

Hence why ‘creativity’ and ‘US Network TV’ are often sadly a contradiction in terms; everything has to cater to the lowest common denominator, which is the reason why everyone has become so dumb and we have all these problems now. Oh well"
Hymn of Death,"I guess haha, but it seems like a lot of time it’s just working on confirmation bias. Like the top execs go “hey, this show isn’t doing well, let’s put it on literally the worst slot of the week when no one’s in. Wait…it’s lost all its viewers? How could this have happened?” I guess it’s all just business though, when something doesn’t get the ad revenue it gets the chop"
Hymn of Death,"TXF is the only example I can think of a show that started in the worst possible death slot (9pm was worse than 8pm), and then got moved into a better timeslot because it still found an audience."
Hymn of Death,"Man, exaxtly...lights off, watching X-Files on Friday nights was a family event in my house when I was kid!"
Hymn of Death,"X-files was on at the 9pm slot though. 8pm slot was constantly getting cancelled, even when critics thought the show was better than X-files (Brisco County)"
Hymn of Death,The carrot juicer guy!!!!
Hymn of Death,"""Hi Dr. Nick!"""
Hymn of Death,"CBS got around this by putting procedurals there, usually with built in audiences, and survived largely cause they realized that changing demographics regarding live broadcast viewing made the usual effects of friday null"

Hymn of Death,"My neighbor who is in advertising always described it as

Hymn of Death,My dad almost died of one of these. He was complaining of stomach aches and just happened to have his annual check-up scheduled for the next day. She told him to go to the ER and get checked out. X-Ray (or maybe CT scan?) showed a ready-to-burst aortic aneurysm -- they admitted him right away and operated. Saved his life. Moral of the story: Don't dismiss stomach aches as nothing.
Hymn of Death,"My doctor ordered a chest xray for me when I was 57. no reason other that I had never had one. She said it was best to take a look and make sure all is well. I found out I have an aortic aneurysm. The limit is below what it has to be to have surgery, but I see a heart Doctor every 6 months and have CT scans once a year to keep track of it to make sure its not getting larger. I'm glad my doctor advise to ""take a look""."
Hymn of Death,My brother died from an Aortic Aneurysm.  He was standing singing at church and collapsed.  Doctors said he was dead before he even hit the ground.
Hymn of Death,"My highschool anthropology teacher had an aortic aneurysm in the middle of teaching our class my senior year. He leaned against the chalkboard, clutched his chest and abdomen, and slid down to the floor looking terrified. For a solid 20 seconds everyone thought he was just being his usual prankster self and joking around. It wasn't until his face turned absolutely white did we realize something was up and several of the students ran down to the nurses office. Luckily my teacher survived the medevac to the hospital, where he made a full recovery. That shit is no joke. He spoke to the class at the end of the year and told us that his surgeons told him if the class had acted any slower (and if the nurses station was farther than it was in the school) he would have died."
Hymn of Death,"> **American soccer journalist Grant Wahl died of an aortic aneurysm that ruptured while in Qatar covering the World Cup.**


> **Wahl’s wife Dr. Celine Gounder told CBS Mornings** co-host Gayle King during her first TV interview since Wahl’s sudden death. **“He (Wahl) had an autopsy done here in New York by the New York City medical examiner’s office, and it showed that he had an aortic aneurysm that ruptured,” Gounder, an infectious disease specialist and a CBS News contributor,** told the morning program.


> **“It’s just one of these things that had been likely brewing for years, and for whatever reason it happened at this point in time,” she added about the slow-growing, undetected condition that caused Wahl’s death**. In a separate post on Wahl’s Substack page, Gounder sought to put to rest speculation around her husband’s death following events in Qatar. 

> **“His death was unrelated to COVID. His death was unrelated to vaccination status. There was nothing nefarious about his death,” she wrote.** Wahl, who had garnered a reputation as one of the country’s most established soccer journalists, was reporting on the World Cup for his Substack and serving as an analyst for CBS Sports.


> **On his Substack, Wahl earlier reported that he went to a local medical center after feeling unwell. Last Friday, Wahl collapsed in the stadium press room** while covering the quarterfinal match between Argentina and the Netherlands, and paramedics were unable to revive him.

Edit:

His brother tweeted yesterday morning that he no longer suspects foul play in Grant Wahl's death. 



[Eric Wahl](https://twitter.com/ziplamak/status/1602657364250861568): 

> The family will release a statement as to cause of death soon. I no longer suspect foul play. It was not PE.


PE stands for pulmonary embolism"
Hymn of Death,Where are all the conspiracy theorists ( including his brother) that claimed his death was of nefarious causes ?
Hymn of Death,"My mom died of a pulmonary embolism at 44. That was almost 50 years ago, long before the vaccines. Not everything is related to covid or the shots."
Hymn of Death,"My friends husband finally went to a cardiologist because several men in his family have died from heart attacks when they were 57. He is 56. The doctor ordered a CT scan to measure calcium for risk factor. Normal range low to high is 100-300. His number was 5000. Crazy high. Doctor never saw anything that high before yet told him to take one aspirin a day! Family members convinced him to go to the ER and complain of symptoms he didn’t have so they would check him out. 75% blockage in one artery, 94% blockage in another. Hospital told him that he was three weeks from a widow maker!!"
Hymn of Death,Hey wait a minute! This doesn’t support my previous outrage over the subject!
Hymn of Death,"So I guess the people who were absolutely certain that Qatar killed him feel very silly no, right? Probably not."
Hymn of Death,Really sad that she had to say this
Hymn of Death,"[Looks like the top comments on this post didn't age well](https://old.reddit.com/r/television/comments/zhgrcr/world_cup_reporter_grant_wahl_dead_at_48_days/)

This sub can go step on a lego. You all upvoted an accusation with zero proof whatsoever"
Hymn of Death,"Wait, so you mean he wasn’t killed because of a T-shirt? You don’t say…"
Hymn of Death,What a shame he passed so young. RIP
Hymn of Death,"And conspiracy theorists will STILL claim both.

Though, shit, another taken by such a silent killer"
Hymn of Death,"It’s just a sad freak medical episode, and now people will use his death to fuel conspiracy crap."
Hymn of Death,"I want to die like he did: doing what I love best, at its highest setting, and without a long illness."
Hymn of Death,So he didn’t get poisoned? Well that’s a relief.
Hymn of Death,"Not sure if it's the same thing but a coworker of mine died almost exactly a year ago from a aortic dissection. It happened in an instant infront nearly the entire company. He needed to move his car from one side of a parking lot to the other. Maybe 50ft. And it happened behind the whee while doing that. Whatever happened, happened, and he went right into a tree at like 10mph.

myself and our owner were the only people in our entire company who *didnt* witness it"
Hymn of Death,"So I wonder what all those people who were saying ""The Qatari's killed him!"" are saying now."
Hymn of Death,Antivax mf’ers: “They’re even mind controlling the wife! How deep does this go?!”
Hymn of Death,Woah reddit was wrong about the Qatar government somehow poisoning him during his detainment two weeks earlier? Reddit would never spread disinformation like that though
Hymn of Death,Why is this on /r television tho?
Hymn of Death,you mean he wasn't karate chopped in the neck by a qatari super assassin in the middle of a crowded stadium?
Hymn of Death,I thought the biggest conspiracy was that it was related to Qatar?
Hymn of Death,It’s so weird that it even needs to be mentioned that it wasn’t covid or the vaccine. Jfc too many people have gone insane.
Hymn of Death,Like this is going to stop any of these anti vax freaks from speculating
Hymn of Death,[removed]
Hymn of Death,Three journalists dying at the World Cup is still so strange.
Hymn of Death,"I assume reddit Will ban everyone that Said"" Qatar murdered him"" for spreading disinformation"
Hymn of Death,"As a long haul covid sufferer, his aortic aneurysm was probably related to covid. My heart is destroyed, I wear a monitor and a life alert and before I got covid I was a competitive trail runner. Can’t run, can’t exercise, can’t lift heavy weights. Could die at any time and there’s not much they can do."
Hymn of Death,that's what the deep state wanted her to say /s
Hymn of Death,But I thought Qatar assassinated him with Goku's Heart Virus.
Hymn of Death,Hi wife is not a medical examiner
Hymn of Death,His bald head made me think he had cancer
Hymn of Death,Why bring up covid and vaccination status anyways?
Hymn of Death,"It’s impossible to know with certainty if either prior covid infection or vaccine/boosters were the trigger(s) for aortic aneurysm or any other health related event.  At the same time you can’t definitively say the jabs or the virus caused it either. You can find patterns and probabilities, but her declaration that “it wasn’t” covid or vax+boosters is effectively her defending her husband choice to get the shots.  Entirely possible it had NOTHING to do with his death, entirely possible it is what triggered his death.  
Statements like hers and those with a like mind is where science dies.  Hell Dr’s approved of smoking and claimed it HELPED keep you healthy at one point. How many drugs have been pulled down years later after they discovered horrific side effect? How many building and others products had lead paint or asbestos? To make ANY claim that any new medication which has not gone thru long term testing trials is 100% safe and could not be tje cause of unexpected side effects is far more religion and not science."
Hymn of Death,What an odd thing to say.
Hymn of Death,Free healthcare is human right
Hymn of Death,This is not an encouraging headline when you want us to think it’s nothing to do with COVID or the vaccine.
Hymn of Death,It was definitley because the vaccine
Hymn of Death,[interesting read](https://www.ehealthme.com/vs/pfizer-biontech-covid-vaccine/aortic-aneurysm-rupture/)
Hymn of Death,"Unrelated, the wife just got 100.000 dollars deposited into her account labeled ""not hush money""."
Hymn of Death,"https://www.ehealthme.com/vs/pfizer-biontech-covid-vaccine/aortic-aneurysm/ 

I’ll just leave that there. 🙂"
Hymn of Death,That entire sentence gives me “No I don’t have a gun 0.3 inches from my head with the man behind the trigger threatening me to tell you I don’t!” Vibes
Hymn of Death,Bit odd that's your take away and the message you want to leave after your husband's death.
Hymn of Death,I miss when every death was politized by one side or the other.

Aside from his part in Trainwreck, I haven't seen anything from him in a while. "
Bumping Mics with Jeff Ross and Dave Attell,"I used to watch Insomniac all the time. Dave's one of the best comedians alive and working, it's a shame he's never gotten his due (in money, that is) and has such a low self-esteem that he rejects all the praise he gets from other comedians. :("

Bumping Mics with Jeff Ross and Dave Attell,"#AWWWW...  
Drunks and losers,  
Dwarves with limps,  
Flos and ho's and one-eyed pimps -  
Down the alleyway they creep.  
They're all your friends when you can't sleep.  

Come with me and you will see.  
A late-night-freak-show-Jubilee!  
Kick the Sandman in his sack;   
Stay up late - Insomniac!  "
Bumping Mics with Jeff Ross and Dave Attell,"That was the golden age of Comedy Central imo. Insomniac, Tough Crowd, Man Show, Ben Stein's Money, South Park, etc. Now it's just shitty reruns of Scrubs, The Office, and Drunk History. :/"
Bumping Mics with Jeff Ross and Dave Attell,Dave Attell's *Skanks for the Memories...* is still one of the funniest comedy albums I've ever heard.
Bumping Mics with Jeff Ross and Dave Attell,I'm a little surprised they haven't tried to reboot in some way with a different comedian.  It's interesting enough with the right host and I imagine pretty cheap compared to a scripted show.  
Bumping Mics with Jeff Ross and Dave Attell,"It started getting so popular especially among the college crowd they would photobomb the camera and shout things. It got to the point, if they knew where he was going the place would be crowded"
Bumping Mics with Jeff Ross and Dave Attell,"I still watch some of the old episodes on YouTube. Was such a great, interesting show. Like An alcoholic's weird version of Parts Unknown minus any semblance of classiness"
Bumping Mics with Jeff Ross and Dave Attell,"My favorite episode was New Orleans, the one where he goes out with animal control to hunt nutria"
Bumping Mics with Jeff Ross and Dave Attell,"Dave got sober and opted not to do the shoe anymore.

I miss it too."
Bumping Mics with Jeff Ross and Dave Attell,"Oh man, I used to love that show! Completely forgot about it."
Bumping Mics with Jeff Ross and Dave Attell,That and Wanderlust with Gerhard Reinke.
Bumping Mics with Jeff Ross and Dave Attell,"When I was much younger, I used to watch that show and feel like I was getting away with something.  I was so impressionable.  Horny little me used to love the parts where porn and sexy ladies were even mentioned.  I was curious, and still not confident enough to seek that stuff out on the computer.  I never really understood the humor.  Looking back, that show was amazing."
Bumping Mics with Jeff Ross and Dave Attell,"Attell needs to put out another special, he hasn't released anything since 2014. That motherfucker is one of the greatest comedians of all time."
Bumping Mics with Jeff Ross and Dave Attell,I loved the one in Houston where he went to Astroworld.  
Clean with Passion for Now,"James Hong still acting at 93, amazing."
Clean with Passion for Now,"> Hong is not the only new addition to the Disney+ miniseries adaptation of Gene Luen Yang’s graphic novel. Ronny Chieng (The Daily Show), Jimmy O. Yang (80 For Brady), Leonard Wu (Alita: Battle Angel), Lisa Lu (Crazy Rich Asians), and Rosalie Chiang (Turning Red) have also been announced as additional guest stars, joining Poppy Liu (Hacks).

Wow, this is stacked."
Clean with Passion for Now,Somebody get this man a Lifetime Achievement Award!
Clean with Passion for Now,"""Cartright?   Cartright?!!""

Legend"
Clean with Passion for Now,"James Hong is just the best.


No one else could ever even think about playing Lo ~~0am~~Pan."
Clean with Passion for Now,"Oh god that cast!!!! Everything I could ever dream of, fuuuuck"
Clean with Passion for Now,"Amazing! James has been old my entire life, and is still acting."
Clean with Passion for Now,"I looked up James Hong career on IMDB and was in awe of his history. Could he be the longest-working actor? I had thought he was someone who started acting later in life and that was not the case at all!

Edit: adding a link incase anyone else wants to check it out! https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0393222/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1"
Clean with Passion for Now,So thrilled for the author/illustrator Gene Luen Yang. What a dream to see this cast come together for this project. He also wrote the fabulous Dragon Hoops as well as several Marvel comics.
Clean with Passion for Now,"He’s one of those actors that I get excited about when he unexpectedly pops up in something im watching. Might not sound like much but those are my favorite actors, much more than any leading people.

Those “holy shit they’re in this too?” moments are always so good."
Clean with Passion for Now,"James Hong is a national treasure! Talented, humble, sincere and kind."
Clean with Passion for Now,I want James Hong to live forever and be in every movie and tv show!
Clean with Passion for Now,"“Cartwright?

Cartwright?”"
Clean with Passion for Now,What is this casual gigantic hand in front of him??
Clean with Passion for Now,The comic? That is going to be a hard adaptation
Clean with Passion for Now,"My life can always use more Stephanie Hsu.  She was so good in EEAAO  

Bonus: Monkey King is always chaotic fun"
Clean with Passion for Now,They did so well together that the whole cast got hired for another film lol
Clean with Passion for Now,I want to know who is playing the racist kid with the Justin Timberlake hair
Clean with Passion for Now,"just to clear up a small doubt. 

has everything everywhere all at once been out for enough time to justify the use of the term ""reunion"" ?

the movie has only been out for a few months."
Clean with Passion for Now,Shit movie
Clean with Passion for Now,Doesn’t that title need a hyphen?
Clean with Passion for Now,"Can we get Robert Downey Jr. to play Chin-Kee please?

Tropic Thunder was not enough"
Clean with Passion for Now,James deserves it. The man has given DECADES of his life to this job.
Clean with Passion for Now,"Goodbye, Mr. Burton."
Clean with Passion for Now,And he's till good is the crazy part.
Clean with Passion for Now,the fuck else is he supposed to do? hahahaha. he and chriis walken are gonna be rockin til they dead
Clean with Passion for Now,Holy shit. Daniel Wu is also in the main cast.
Clean with Passion for Now,Can’t believe they didn’t cast MrZeral. Smh what is even the point of watching then
Clean with Passion for Now,Damn they did Jimmy dirty by calling him out for 80 for Brady
Clean with Passion for Now,"Everyone else is great, but not a fan of Ronny after his set on Indian people no being Asian."
Clean with Passion for Now,"I dont know a single of those names -,-'"
Clean with Passion for Now,Seinfeld. Four!
Clean with Passion for Now,She called. He yelled “Cartwright”.
Clean with Passion for Now,"Oh it’ll be five, ten minutes."
Clean with Passion for Now,Lo 0am? Which Lo 0am?!?
Clean with Passion for Now,[deleted]
Clean with Passion for Now,"I think he has to be the most prolific actor that is both alive and active in the industry, he's an absolute legend"
Clean with Passion for Now,"I started watching watching White Lotus this week, and had this reaction to Steve Zahn.

Tons of people who I like in movies even if/especially if, they aren't the main character."
Clean with Passion for Now,Go watch Everything Everywhere All At Once.
Clean with Passion for Now,"Saw an interview of him recently, and he literally got up and started jovially dancing. And he's still very sharp mentally. Like he's at least as sharp as the average person half his age."
Clean with Passion for Now,It’s shocking he’s coherent enough and capable enough to keep doing it.  I’m impressed!
Clean with Passion for Now,"I've never heard of him, is there something I should check him out in?"
Clean with Passion for Now,"I remember when he first started working in China and had terrible Chinese. Proper ABC and proper hot. Stuck in traffic? At least there's an ad with Daniel Wu on a building to look at!

[Unfortunately like many shit celebrities who participate in Chinese entertainment he's also anti-HK/pro-Beijing.](https://www.thestandard.com.hk/breaking-news/section/3/133368/Actor-Daniel-Wu-denies-rumors-of-supporting-independence)"
Clean with Passion for Now,Asia is the biggest most populous continent yet so many similar last names wtf
Clean with Passion for Now,"I'm Indian and it was funny. It was mostly humour about East Asians, it wasn't negative against Indians."
Clean with Passion for Now,"This opinion isn't uncommon in Chinese and Chinese diaspora communities throughout East/Southeast Asia. In Malaysia, where Chiang is from, Indians are the next largest ethnic minority group after Chinese, but don't hold nearly the economic power that the Chinese community does, though there's definitely an Indian elite/professional class. Usually this comes with a dollop of Han-centricism (the only cultures which matter are touched culturally or politically by the various dynasties of the Middle Kingdom [minus the non-Han ones, save when they Hanified]). 

Not excusing it, just saying that it's consistent with where he's from, as well as really disappointing if that's an indication of his beliefs rather than something put on for a joke."
Clean with Passion for Now,"You don't know Hong?

Bullshit. Check IMDb."
Clean with Passion for Now,Nobody gives a shit
Clean with Passion for Now,Who’s Cartwright?
Clean with Passion for Now,The little old basket case on wheels or the ten foot tall roadblock?
Clean with Passion for Now,Call the President.
Clean with Passion for Now,Crazier: He has acting credits for every year since he began working.
Clean with Passion for Now,And he’s absolutely beloved.
Clean with Passion for Now,"Right, but, let’s say I haven’t seen it. What is it?"
Clean with Passion for Now,Badlands but I think the series got worse after season 1 or 2
Clean with Passion for Now,[deleted]
Clean with Passion for Now,He had some small parts recently in the last season of Westworld..not saying to watch it all but just pointing out where I  saw him
Clean with Passion for Now,"The general populace in China is called [""100 family names"" for a reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baixing)."
Clean with Passion for Now,"Even if it's consistent with where he's from, that doesn't mean it's not closed to being criticized. People can have a lot of closeminded views back where they're from, but that doesn't mean it should be acceptable here.

You brought more context to the issue so thank you for that."
Clean with Passion for Now,Every time we hear his voice or see him in something my gf and I do the DiCaprio pointing meme lol it’s crazy how prolific of an actor he is
Clean with Passion for Now,The man only has 451 acting credits on IMDb. /s
Clean with Passion for Now,not familiar
Clean with Passion for Now,"Somebody had too salty soup today, sad, sad, brain dead idiot boy"
Clean with Passion for Now,I’m Cartwright!!!
Clean with Passion for Now,"Side note: try this fun drinking game- every time Jack Burton asks a question, take a swig of your drink."
Clean with Passion for Now,"One in the same, Jack"
Clean with Passion for Now,"I watched Turning Red last week and was reminded how great of a voice actor he is as well. He's great in Kung Fu Panda and Mulan of course, but apparently he has uncredited voice work in the first american dub of the original Godzilla! What a career!"
Clean with Passion for Now,"The movie will answer your question, I’m not going to spoil it. Just go watch it, it amazing"
Clean with Passion for Now,"Obviously spoilers for EEAAO:

They travel the multiverse into many ""wacky"" and ""zany"" universes and get to a *hilarious* universe where, get this, people have HOT DOGS for FINGERS 🤪"
Clean with Passion for Now,"There's only 3 seasons. I really liked it despite its faults. The first main bad's storyline finished at the end of s2 instead of dragging on, the most annoying character in the show got offed at the end of s3, Nick Frost joined the cast and did a lot of big guy Sammo Hung esque Kung Fu and they were gearing up to introduce gun fu it seemed in S4 before it got cancelled.

I'm also really into that ruins of the old world vibe like in Fallout, and Horizon."
Clean with Passion for Now,"I don't think Badlands was ever good, the first episode was just almost good to me. I think it was just slightly too far past the silly line."
Clean with Passion for Now,Incorrect that's Donny yen
Clean with Passion for Now,">About 87% of the population shares 100 surnames.

Fascinating!"
Clean with Passion for Now,"I'll plug __Totally Awesome__ here again.

80s movies spoof movie... made in early 00's with SNL people. Day, Katan, and more.

I believe Hong plays the spoof of Mr. Miyagi."
Clean with Passion for Now,big nobody…
Clean with Passion for Now,You’re not Cartwright
Clean with Passion for Now,My favorite supercut of [Jack Burton asking questions ](https://youtu.be/98ioAA8yNyY) for those playing hard mode.
Clean with Passion for Now,Challenge accepted! I’ll have to plan my 537th viewing next weekend
Clean with Passion for Now,Thank you!!
Clean with Passion for Now,[deleted]
Clean with Passion for Now,worth watching just for the fight choreography. Absolutely incredible
Clean with Passion for Now,"It was a fun but dumb show. Cheesy over the top wire-fu action, like Xena Warrior Princess or Hercules. Maybe it wasn't ""good"" but I still enjoyed it for what it was."
Clean with Passion for Now,I KNOW I’M NOT CARTWRIGHT!!!
Clean with Passion for Now,"Good luck. It’s no walk in the park. As you well know, Jack Burton spends the majority of the movie a few steps behind whatever is happening."
Clean with Passion for Now,"They seemed fine with it, I think not answering their question and saying ""it amazing"" is a worse answer"
Clean with Passion for Now,"The over the top wuxia style fight scenes were so fun to watch. The costume design also stood out to me, everyone is just so snappily dressed (shout out to whoever did Emily Beecham's wardrobe).

Unfortunately the story's pace wasn't great and the acting ranged from just okay (where the actors own the cheesiness and just chew scenery) to kind of bad (looking at you MK)."
Clean with Passion for Now,What!? Huh??? What’ll come out no more?!?
Clean with Passion for Now,It’s fucking impossible to read articles any longer. I’m on the page for a full two minutes and I’m STILL losing my place trying to read it as new ads load in and reshuffle the geography of the page.
Clean with Passion for Now,Does this mean anything for folks with 5.1+ systems?
Clean with Passion for Now,How about they make english subtitles that don't include closed captions first.
Clean with Passion for Now,"A few months ago I did a survey that demonstrated it and asked if I would pay more for it… the answer was no every time. They are out of their minds if they think people will pay more for upgraded audio. 

If someone cares about audio/video that much, they would have the 4K plan."
Clean with Passion for Now,I can’t believe Netflix still charges more for 4K. No other streamer has ever done this. They keep increasing their prices but refuse to get with the times and stop screwing people over with 4K content.
Clean with Passion for Now,I see another reddit thread announcing the death of netflix
Clean with Passion for Now,"If its anything like how they implement Dolby Vision it's only going to make their content worse unless you listen to it in an anechoic chamber on $200,000 worth of equipment... and you cannot turn it off."
Clean with Passion for Now,"We Mean It This Time, This Is The Final Straw For Netflix

--/r/television, again"
Clean with Passion for Now," This is why Netflix deserves to die. They don’t want me to share my four screens but require me to have them for the best features, including 4k and this. Literally as soon as they end account sharing it’s over. If you won’t sell me a single screen with 4k then I refuse to be a customer. 

I don’t need something for free, but I also refuse to pay for screens I can’t use. Make it make sense Netflix."
Clean with Passion for Now,"For a streaming company not making anything worth watching or cancelling the good stuff, they sure have confidence in their viewership paying these prices and dealing with the hassle."
Clean with Passion for Now,Capitalism baby!
Clean with Passion for Now,What’s spatial about it?
Clean with Passion for Now,You'd be better off just buying a 5.1 sound system with the money.
Judge vs. Judge,rip Luanne ☹️
Judge vs. Judge,When my dad was in a nursing home there was another old man who sounded just like Boomhauer.
Judge vs. Judge,I need more Rusty shackelford in my life.
Judge vs. Judge,Was there some sort of unofficial announcement months ago?  Why have I been thinking new eps would be out in 2023 for a while now?
Judge vs. Judge,"King of the Hill never leaves my Watchlist on Hulu. When I finish it, I immediately start it over. I'm in double digits for rewatches for sure. And it's not like I'm watching it every day, but that show is timeless for me."
Judge vs. Judge,Yep. This is great news I'll tell you hwhat.
Judge vs. Judge,Resplendent
Judge vs. Judge,"“Yeah, man I tell you whot man, that dang Ol’ Greg, talking about O.G. and then that Mike Judge … Inspirations, man … the original show, dang ol’ classic … Got my kids, man, walking around talking about ‘That’s my purse! I don’t know you!’ Feeling blessed, man, I tell you whot ‘Feel so Good’ is a great song, I don’t care what no-dang-body says …” added Patterson in an appropriate statement."
Judge vs. Judge,"I swear the older I get the funnier this show gets. It felt so vanilla when I was a teenager, but now it’s relatable, and brilliantly observant as anything else done by Mike Judge."
Judge vs. Judge,"I first read this as "" 'King of the Hill' Revival Ordered by Judge"""
Judge vs. Judge,bAAUhhh
Judge vs. Judge,"I notice there's no mention of Toby Huss in the returning cast. There's zero chance he's going to voice Kahn this time, I wonder if they're going to kill him off or recast him.

Also wonder if they give Huss another role. Obviously can't be Cotton unless they do flashbacks or he's a ghost lol. Maybe he voices Good Hank?"
Judge vs. Judge,"if this somehow revives interest in King of the Hill Youtube Poops, I'll definitely watch it."
Judge vs. Judge,Judge killed it with Silicon Valley. I'm expecting this will be great.
Judge vs. Judge,"Yay but sad that there’s not gonna be any Luanne, Lucky or even Ladybird."
Judge vs. Judge,[where boomhauer came from interview](https://youtu.be/rd_rty0ovgQ)
Judge vs. Judge,They saw the numbers. r/kingofthehill are the real heroes for this.
Judge vs. Judge,"I'm a MASSIVE fan of this series, so this news could not be more welcomed!  

Interesting that as they're talking about the original cast returning, there's no mention of Kahn.  Toby Huss is incredible in the role, but I wouldn't be shocked with today's climate if they decide to recast Kahn with an Asian voice actor."
Judge vs. Judge,"I hope that they give Lucky and Luanne a ""happily ever after"" sorta ending. Please for the love of god just have them mention how they just moved away to a nice big house and are just raising their baby."
Judge vs. Judge,"Details:

>Hulu is laying out the welcome Matt for the Hill Family: the streamer is reviving King of the Hill from 20th Television Animation, with co-creators Mike Judge and Greg Daniels set to return, as well as the beloved former cast.

>Judge will reprise his role as Hank Hill, while Kathy Najimy will be back as his wife Peggy, Stephen Root as Bill, Pamela Adlon as Bobby Hill, Johnny Hardwick as Dale and Lauren Tom as Minh. The reboot has been in the works since the 2017 San Francisco Sketchfest, where Judge and Daniels reconnected with the cast and celebrated the 20th anniversary of the old Fox animated show."
Judge vs. Judge,"You don't know who I am, but I know where you live!"
Judge vs. Judge,It’s over for Rick and Morty
Judge vs. Judge,"Dad, can I have permission to say ""hell yeah""?"

Judge vs. Judge,"""THERE'S A HOLE IN MY POCKET WHERE MY MONEY USED TO GO!"""
Judge vs. Judge,Omg yes!   I’ve been binge watching this on Hulu over and over again
Judge vs. Judge,"When my dad died KOtH played every night from 11:30-3am. I watched it over and over. 16 years later and I still go to sleep with those banjos playing in the background - it’s my comfort zone

I can’t imagine watching an episode that I don’t know verbatim but I’m here for it"
Judge vs. Judge,Hulu's just leaning all the way into the revival game...
Judge vs. Judge,No mention of Toby Huss probably answers that uncomfortable question.
Judge vs. Judge,"I’m so excited, the new Beavis and Butthead movie and show both slap, he’s still got it"
Judge vs. Judge,"Isn't this, like, the second or third time they've announced this in the last few years?"
Judge vs. Judge,Imagine Dale who's the most paranoid about the government being the one that uses Facebook and tiktok the most.
Judge vs. Judge,"Just have Luanne and Lucky be living somewhere far away or traveling the world on some money from another of Lucky’s scams and send a postcard every now and then. 

There. Casting solved and happy ending for the characters."
Judge vs. Judge,"Forget DC, this is the biggest news of the day"
Judge vs. Judge,"as someone from around the parts of texas this show is hypothetically taking place, i really hope i can see the modernisms in what i see going on"
Judge vs. Judge,His will be done.
Judge vs. Judge,This has to be the best news of the day for me!
Judge vs. Judge,This news made my day. Really hope the rumored time jump is true. Bobby in his twenties would be something else.
Judge vs. Judge,"Oof I don't know how to handle Luanne and Lucky. Saying ""they moved"" is a little tacky but saying they passed is pretty morose for a show like this"
Judge vs. Judge,"Darnit Bobby put down that blocks and mow the lawn!

Its roblox Dad."
Judge vs. Judge,That’s my purse! I don’t know you!!!!
Judge vs. Judge,Who is going to voice Luanne?
Judge vs. Judge,"I really the animation will be hand drawn, not all digital. Looks far superior."
Judge vs. Judge,""" Bobby, if you weren't my son, I'd hug you"""
Judge vs. Judge,"Love the show, but just wish they would make new stuff instead of trying to go back to nostalgia. ( goes for movies and tv shows)"
Judge vs. Judge,"Mike Judge is great. He always holds on to his vision, he doesn’t approve shitty knock offs or let studios pressure him into watering things down. And his influence on 90s music culture is still very overlooked IMO. There are so many bands I learned of through Beavis and Butthead that I otherwise probably never would have."
Judge vs. Judge,[deleted]
Judge vs. Judge,The world needs this.
Judge vs. Judge,It would be cool if it was Bobby hill as an adult with his own family and hank as a grandfather
Judge vs. Judge,Get Roger Clyne on the phone ASAP
Judge vs. Judge,So who is going to voice Luanne?
Judge vs. Judge,No Luanne and Lucky though. RIP.
Judge vs. Judge,When damnit when!?
Judge vs. Judge,It's about god dang time
Judge vs. Judge,King Of The Hill and Futurama both coming back. I like it
Judge vs. Judge,This is great news.
Judge vs. Judge,Rip Luanne and Lucky 😞
Judge vs. Judge,Wow. The Mike Judge timeline really has reached its Renaissance...
Judge vs. Judge,no way... I just started watching it few days ago... love the simplicity of the show and the characters.
Judge vs. Judge,"The great news is that Johnny Hardwick has been taking videos shooting cowboy guns and singing about pocket sand as Dale on Youtube for years, so his voice is primed and ready to go."
Judge vs. Judge,Are they going to replace the voice of Khan with an Asian actor ?
Judge vs. Judge,"As someone who adores this show, had birthday parties revolving around this show, has seen it through over a dozen times…. 


This news is both exciting and worries the shit out of me."
Judge vs. Judge,"You know you're tired when you read this as ""New episodes of KOTH ordered by Judge..."""
Judge vs. Judge,As reminder King of the Hill was viewed as a slice of life in Japan and there were Subs v Dubs over there when it came to this show
Judge vs. Judge,Dang it Bobby
Judge vs. Judge,"As messed up as it is, I hope they kill off luanne and lucky. And an old Hank and Peggy find themselves raising Gracie and GH with help from adult Bobby"
Judge vs. Judge,Well not the WHOLE original cast.
Judge vs. Judge,"Dang ol' Mike Judge man bout time tell you what, watchin reruns for dang ol' three decades man."
Judge vs. Judge,"Dammit, Bobby."
Judge vs. Judge,"“Hey, man, dang ol' listen, man.”"
Judge vs. Judge,"This is one of the best things I've heard this year thus far!! Now this show may not be for everyone but for those who enjoyed it or grew up with it being a presence on their TV this is awesome. Some may say this show is dumb, but this show teaches more values, manners, cultural differences, being thankful, acknowledging a mistake and manning up to own it, respect to others in our lives, and how different people can be. I can't wait for this to aire, just as I'm sure John Redcorn can't wait to fix Nancy's next headache. Lol"
Judge vs. Judge,"The first scene has to be Hank walking in on Bobby listening to music on his wireless earbuds, and Hank wants to listen to this [new generation of music](https://youtu.be/6z1neskULsQ)."
Judge vs. Judge,Look forward to this. Sucks Murphy and Petty are gone.
Judge vs. Judge,"This is kinda like Futurama coming back, I'm hoping for the best. 

KOTH had such a great 13 year run."
Judge vs. Judge,Dangit Bobby
Judge vs. Judge,Time to be bullish on propane and propane accessories again!!
Judge vs. Judge,"Damnit Bobby, you better not be fooling around!"
Judge vs. Judge,"Initial reaction: **(Dale Gribble voice)** Wingo! 

Second thought: **(Hank Hill voice)** Don't screw it up, you giblet heads."
Judge vs. Judge,It’s about durn time!
Judge vs. Judge,I tell you whahat
Judge vs. Judge,There is a God
Judge vs. Judge,"So, no Luanne or Lucky?"
Judge vs. Judge,I am sooooooo happy and excited about this. I can’t wait to get back to Arlen.
Judge vs. Judge,Propane powered electric car chargers
Judge vs. Judge,"I'm calling it now: Hank killed Dr. Phil, the timing can't be a mistake"
Judge vs. Judge,Hell yes!! I've literally started watching rerun clips this past month and enjoying the nostalgia. What great news.
Judge vs. Judge,"""Im driving the hell out this truck"" -Bobby Hill-"
Judge vs. Judge,"So, Dale is going to be pretty much full blown QAnon now, right?"
Judge vs. Judge,"Make it happen! This show is so great, it holds up so well. I recall as a child not getting it or liking it very much, but watching it today. . . It’s so well done.

Edit: except for the episode where Peggy reaches sex-Ed, that was always funny to me. 

“Happiness. . . Haa-piness. . . piness. . . penis. . . PENIS!”"
Judge vs. Judge,Time for some spa-Peggy and meatballs!
Judge vs. Judge,I’m honestly a little worried with what they’ll do with it. I worry it might become a lot more political than it was in the past.
Judge vs. Judge,RIP Luann
Judge vs. Judge,Not a single mention of Luanne. Wtf?! RIP Brittany
Judge vs. Judge,"I mean - Dale has gone full QAnon - or he is Q. Peggy has been exposed on Twitter as a Karen. Hank’s been canceled. Boomhower is killing it on Tender. Bill has lost all his money due to an Onlyfans addiction. Bobby has been radicalized on YouTube. Connie’s GPA has slipped because she’s decided to be a TikToker. Life was so much simpler in 2010, I’ll tell you what."
Judge vs. Judge,"I *loved* King of the Hill, but I don't like this at all. King of the Hill was a show of its time through-and-through, and that time has passed. 

I want to be clear: gatekeeping reboots or sequels is dumb, this is not me saying that anyone excited for this is enjoying themselves wrong, I'm saying that I have serious doubts this particular revival can be done well."
Judge vs. Judge,"**Hank:** Get that dang gum phone outta my face Bobby. What in the hell are you doing? 

**Bobby:** I'm just making a TikTok that's what all of the kids are going these days. 

**Hank:** What the world is a TikTok? 

**Bobby:** It's social media. See you can make videos and share them all over the world. I'm trying to go viral! I'm an influencer!

**Hank:** if you don't out that thing outta my face...

**Peggy:** Hank! You need to encourage Bobby! Try to be more into the things he's into. 

**Hank:** I can't understand why anyone would want influenza. That's it! Tomorrow I'm gonna call the doctor and make sure we get all get our flu shots."
Judge vs. Judge,Not Brittany Murphy :(
Judge vs. Judge,No Tom Petty though. :(
Judge vs. Judge,I’d imagine they’d *never* recast Luanne in respect of Brittany. So does this confirm that they’re retiring the character?
Sky Castle,"Korean dramas have been wonderfully done recently and are getting better. If you like The Good Doctor the korean version (which is what the US one is based on) is imo, better"
Sky Castle,I agree!!!
Sky Castle,"The core mythology of the mysterious conduits and the people who control them I think is super fascinating and I wished they spent more time exploring that, I think in S2 they will. 

Also the scene when JKS discovers the thing his wife left and confronts her....so powerful!"
Sky Castle,Sissy Spacek NEVER mails it in. NEVER. Play a telekinetic HS girl? Nails it. Play Rod's mom in Hot Rod? She's got you. She's just an all around great actress!
Sky Castle,Only seen the first 2 eps as my wife hated the slow pace. JK and Spacek are great together and I will definitely be watching the rest this weekend while the wife is away.
Sky Castle,"I decided, fuck it I'll try it out, I love JK Simmons.  And holy fuck, what a slow bore of a show.  It just feels like for the majority of the show nothing is really happening, the plot doesn't develop and it doesn't go anywhere.

And then those last two episodes it's like going on a rollercoaster.  The plot shifts so fast and it has so many unanswered questions that probably should have been addressed by.... you know... the plot.  It spends way too much time being mysterious and not enough time being a story.

I'm kind of the same, I'd watch Season 2.  But I wouldn't watch Season 2 if they're spending as much time being mysterious as they do.  A good amnesia story should involve getting some details back over episodes.... not everything back all at once in the last couple of episodes."
Sky Castle,"Actually enjoyed it way more than I was expecting, didn't mind the pace at all. Helps having two great actors to carry the family drama stuff, but the entire cast was solid. Looking forward to another season."
Sky Castle,Wife and I watching at a slow pace think we are on episode 5 maybe. I wasn’t sure at first but actually getting into it. Simmons and Spacek are great but also enjoying Jude quite a bit. Very charming.
Sky Castle,"The first three episodes are really just slowly building the world around Franklin and Irene. Once all the other players become involved, it really picks up the pace. 

I watched the entire season in one day. They left it at a very interesting place and I hope it continues on to at least wrap things up."
Sky Castle,JK Simmons and Sissy Spacek are in it? I'll at least give it a go now.
Sky Castle,This and cowboy stranger things/ dark is so slow. Not like a slow burn but like the middle episodes drag.
Sky Castle,"I definitely agree with you about the slow start.  I punched out on this early in ep. 2.  I might go back, but Holy God could they have cut the first episode in half.  I also felt the same about Outer Range.  

I know they are trying to establish the characters, but at some point it seems more like belaboring the obvious."
Sky Castle,Watched the first episode.  Don’t really feel the urge to keep going.  Wanted to like it
Sky Castle,Are u guys forgetting that JKwas Vern Schillinger in HBOs OZ? That was fantastic acting. Discuss...
Sky Castle,Had my eye on this for a while. Always down for more good sci-fi shows.
Sky Castle,Man I liked this show but I can’t think of a single person aside from my mother that I would recommend it to.
Sky Castle,"Finished this on my days off and liked it, although it was a bit slow.  I do wish there was a bit more of a lore explanation though."
Sky Castle,"It is slow but I am old so I don’t notice it,,
I just watched it for the second time and it seems to be the type of show that you must watch ,and not just have it play in the background, and they do a lot of things with their hands like picking up things that are related to the show and if you’re not watching that you can miss something important, I don’t know if I explain that properly,"
Sky Castle,Is it only me then that couldn't watch it because I literally couldn't see it? It was just a black screen!
Sky Castle,"How angry does Simmons get? He's an amazing actor, but more than anything, he's the actor that has perfected unadultered rage. Dude is an anger powerhouse, and I love hearing him mad and yelling (Whiplash was perfect)."
Sky Castle,"God, I can't get through 90 percent of the shows I watch these days because of the ridiculously slow first few episodes. The last offender was Archive 81. I wanted so badly to like it and keep watching it because it's exactly my type of show, but I just couldn't slog through the 30+ minutes where nothing happened in the first couple of episodes.  I ended up just watching a recap on YouTube and honestly I think I enjoyed it more than if I'd stayed and put in the time to watch the whole thing. Which is sad but it's like pacing has stopped being a thing, which is weird because with the current binge style of TV show watching you would think it would be even more important."
Sky Castle,"I had enough of shows with good elements but no final payoff.

I've watched the first episode. I'll keep an eye on the next season to see if there will be any satisfying conclusion. If so, I'll watch both seasons.

Same goes for Severance."
Sky Castle,"I just have no faith this will be any good. I love Sissy Spacek and JK Simmons, but I just can't get excited about this. Prime has such a shit track record."
Sky Castle,"Just finished season 1 and I will put a spoiler alert for the final episode question.

>!In the final episode, when Tall man finds their chamber, he says it was lost. But when Franklin and Irene go through and find the villages, how would they have not known about that chamber and gone through? If Franklin and Irene had gone through 800+ times at default and it went to their chamber, how did the villagers not test it?!<"
Sky Castle,"Theres going to be a season 2? Not sure I'll watch. Ok , I will. But I'll complain about it, in my mind, if the story tellers dont stay more focused."
Sky Castle,"Slow and no pay off in the end. Seems like a series that hopes to drag the viewer on until for 9 seasons. Interesting, but don't recommend it for anyone until there's at least 3 seasons out"
Sky Castle,"I love everything space related, but I could not watch this show it was god awfully slow. I had to fast forward through all the filler and nonsense to get to the good parts and even doing that there was barely anything worth viewing.  I'm pretty disappointed and it appears Amazon is not going to continue with a season 2. Bummer"
Sky Castle,https://deadline.com/2022/07/night-sky-canceled-prime-video-one-season-1235058505/
Sky Castle,"100%. Considering how much time they spent developing all the non sci-fi elements, which I am not opposed to, there's just so little resolution in those storylines that will still have to be developed in the next season too. 

I just wish they had spent more time focusing on that huge sci fi mystery that these people have been hoarding to themselves for decades. It was the premise of the show that drew me in and it was almost criminally neglected. Yeah sure save it for season 2 I guess."
Sky Castle,Her role as a woman with Alzheimer's on Castle Rock was also mesmerizing.
Sky Castle,I will allow you to stop watching
Sky Castle,"I felt the same through the full two episodes, but somewhere in the third episode it just “clicks”, and we binged the remaining episodes in one sitting. Was captivating and well done."
Sky Castle,I would suggest not watching Outer Range as well. Some good acting but super slow and no payoff at the end.
Sky Castle,"Then don’t watch it. Just finished the last episode. If you are not turned off by idiot protagonists who don’t communicate effectively because the plot demands it, then this might be for you. The writing is terrible. Really terrible. I’d even go that far and call it season 8 game of thrones-terrible."
Sky Castle,the relationship between simmons and spacek is the core of the show and its a sweet and endearing relationship they have.
Sky Castle,"> I just watched it for the second time and

It just came out last Friday....and you've already watched all 8 episodes *twice*? Where DO you find the time!"
Sky Castle,"We know JKS plays rage well, and we saw how totally *jacked* he was in *The Tomorrow War*, but in this one, JKS is a sweet old man who loves his wife, bad eyesight, a limp and he's forgetful."
Sky Castle,"The dialog between JKS & Spacek is important for the story, not really slow at all. But I'm old, so I liked it. If you like the craze of comic book action movies, you might think this is slow by comparison.

I wanted to like Archive81 too, but only made it about 2 episodes. No one talks about it on reddit, so I lost interest.

Open Range was a poor rendition of Yellowstone meets Black Mirror; even starred Will Patton fer cryin' out loud. I only made it less than 2 episodes."
Sky Castle,"I have a compulsion to complete things, even things I dislike. But from what I’ve heard, no season 2."
Sky Castle,fuck
Sky Castle,"The characters behaved way too irrationally as well. There was no payoff for Jude's secrecy. The villain was very poorly written. The acting of the granddaughter was some of the worst I've ever seen. (That scene when she was shown the portal...)

The girls mom is also an abysmal actor. Where do they find these people? 

Great idea for a show. Truly awesome potential, but completely wasted"
Sky Castle,Did you see Outer Range? I feel it has the same premise. Some good acting in Outer Range but super slow and no payoff at the end.
Sky Castle,I want to love it though :/
Sky Castle,"No, you mustn't! Make them keep watching."
Sky Castle,"I actually ended up binging the entire series in one day and loved it, but thanks for the review I guess lol."
Sky Castle,"I am retired, and bored, and we have shitty weather right now, I did fast forward a lot of it I have it on YouTube TV which has kind of a DVR built into it"
Sky Castle,"I'm 100% okay with this, to be honest."
Sky Castle,"I'm a huge JK fan, is it worth watching even if it ends on a cliffhanger?"
Sky Castle,"I’m late (usual) but I could not wait to finish to come here to say I totally disliked the mom/daughter. And also, I have never hated a character so quickly and thoroughly as I did Byron. I just pretended post friendship Byron was Byron 2. I could not reconcile the 2 otherwise."
Sky Castle,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/uu6ixp/primes_outer_range_and_primes_night_sky_are/
Sky Castle,"if you keep watching you will but you dont have to, this guy is letting you stop"
Sky Castle,"That’s fine, dude. Just needed to rant. But didn’t the inconsistency of the characters action bother you one bit? I really wanted to like it but was put off by the sheer idiocy of the protagonists."
Sky Castle,"I realize this question was not to me and I’m late, but I am going to post my thoughts. 😬

I did not hate watch this. I actually kind of liked it.   
However:   
I did not appreciate several of the actors/actresses (\*cough\* Byron, villain, Nick, mom/daughter guardian, dead son/granddaughter \*cough\*). I did not see how several of the side stories contributed to the story overall. Girl sneaks out, kisses boy, etc. Anything to do with Nick was completely useless. Granddaughter at college, on date, with middle school friend, with counselor, all that and more utterly useless to the story. Byron for councilman!? Ugh- so many…Some seemed like they could have been leading somewhere but were completely forgotten about.   


I cannot recall a time I enjoyed an idiot action driven plot. They usually make me hate watch something.   
But the part that bothered me the most, was that the wife/mom (Sissy Spacek) was going to commit suicide. She was going to inflict that on the man she supposedly loves, after living with the fallout of her son‘s suicide?! & Where did that story go? He was SO MAD at her, he walked away quietly and then it was was over.   


Aside: When I was little and I would try to say my prayers, I would close my eyes, and talk to God very reverently. Quickly sometimes, things would go awry until I would notice that I was just thinking about things to myself. My prayer had gotten thrown off track unintentionally. Example: 

Dear Lord, Thank you for this day. I had a really fun time with cousin, he had new shoes, they were blue, I wonder where he got them? Maybe he got them from the shoe store downtown? That store had a cool mascot outside when it was that restaurant, what did they sell?…  


I apologized to God for the hot mess and would try to stay on track- sometimes I just could not do it. \*\*\*I feel like that is how this movie was. Although I found it over all sufficient for me to watch, it was not what it should have been.\*\*\*"
Sky Castle,"love these kinds of shows

some more off the top of my head:

* Hooten & The Lady
* Covert Affairs
* Timeless
* Franklin and Bash"
Sky Castle,The Mentalist would’ve fit perfectly in that lineup.
Sky Castle,Leverage and Eureka are really good!
Sky Castle,Warehouse 13 was a fun show.
Sky Castle,"Relic Hunter is on amazon prime.  They hunt down artifacts, but it is very different from Warehouse 13 and Librarians in that the focus is on the investigation not the artifacts.  It is supposed to be more indiana jones archaeology."
Sky Castle,"My wife and I love these shows some that haven't been mentioned yet. 

- hustle

- crazy ex girlfriend

- death in paradise

- Franklin and bash

- powerless"
Sky Castle,"The Glades and Lethal Weapon are excellent choices, though I'd just skip the 3rd season Lethal Weapon. Crawford carried that show on his back, and it wasn't the same after he was ousted. 

The Glades, however, is fantastic the whole way through. Jim just oozed charisma, and his interactions with pretty much everyone were gold. Particularly fond of the pilot when [spoiler](#s ""his own boss just loses his fucking mind over his antics."")"
Sky Castle,"More to add to this list:

1. Stargate SG1 and Atlantis

2. Human Target

3. Castle

4. Legends of Tomorrow

5. Suits (esp the first couple of seasons)

6. Quantum Leap

7. Haikyuu - not exactly blue skies but certainly feel good; and obvioulsy anime so not for everyone. I'd posit that anyone who liked the Mighty Ducks movies  will totally dig this.

8. The Rookie"
Sky Castle,Almost Paradise on WGN
Sky Castle,"Person of Interest starts out that way, albeit more serious, and before too long youre trapped in some big story. great show though"
Sky Castle,I was really hoping for more of the Glades
Sky Castle,Is Hooten & The Lady available anywhere?
Sky Castle,Eureka's theme is so damn catchy.
Sky Castle,"Dude, it's so good to see someone remember Human Target. That was such a fun show. Guerrero is a fantastic character."
Sky Castle,"oof idk. iirc, the CW bought the airing rights for the first season, so it might be on their app. i'm not American though, so i can't say with 100% certainty.

edit: also available for purchase on Amazon UK"
Sky Castle,"I know it's messy right now, I'm updating the format and trying to squeeze in as much info as I can. Any help finding sources would be much appreciated. =)"
Sky Castle,"An useful list for a hopeless TV addict like myself, thank you."
Sky Castle,Breaking Bad comes back August 11
Sky Castle,"I really hope Go On gets renewed. I know I'll be hated for this, but it reminds me of Community, but better. I like Community, especially the first three seasons, but it's gotten way too self referential and meta. Go On reminds me of early Community, and hopefully we get more of it."
Sky Castle,"Mad Men is ending in it's seventh season, not the 6th if I recall."
Sky Castle,Community is on the uncertain renewal twice 
Sky Castle,"Mad Men is currently airing its sixth season in the summer, not in the fall, and I'm pretty certain that the series finale will take place in season 7, not season 6. "
Sky Castle,Missing Southland
Sky Castle,I will definitely save this. Thanks 
Sky Castle,"Has Whitney been cancelled?

"
Sky Castle,"You have on your list ""•Untitled John Mulaney/Lorne Michaels Comedy"" and ""•Untitled Lorne Michales/John Mulaney Project"" Might want to get rid of one unless they are working on two projects :).
"
Sky Castle,Forgot Rectify! Started last night
Sky Castle,Boardwalk Empire and Homeland should both be returning in September.
Sky Castle,"Why is 2 Broke Girls listed as a summer show?

There seems to be some duplicates too, like the Untitled JJ Abrams series and Sleepy Hollow, unless there's going to be two different versions.

Shocked to see The Tomorrow People listed, it turns out that it is a remake of the British series. I'm sure I remember watching that."
Sky Castle,"I'm pretty sure the Cleveland show isn't going to get renewed.

I'll be kinda sad if castle won't return."
Sky Castle,Archer's final episode of the season was aired last week
Sky Castle,"Smash is all but cancelled.  I work at an NBC affiliate and they're not even *talking* about it.  No promos, no marketing whatsoever.  It's dead."
Sky Castle,"Needs just a few corrections, but its more than I could do. Great list, I appreciate it."
Sky Castle,you're missing warehouse 13
Sky Castle,Do you have insider access to which pilot shows that have been picked up or are you predicting them based off Deadline's pilot watch?
Sky Castle,"Excited about a lot of things this summer/fall, but hoping The Middle and Go On especially get renewed. "
Sky Castle,"You should add Major Crimes (TNT) (season 2) spinoff to the closer..airs june 10th

Also another website you should check out is www.tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com"
Sky Castle,"Okay, I think I've got all the pilots covered by the big 5 networks: NBC, Fox, CBS, ABC and CW.

I added in Amazon's but anyone know any sources for any other networks? Cartoon Network/Nickelodeon/E, etc. 

**EDIT**: Would it be better if I categorize each pilot by respective networks or should I state which network after each show (similar to how i determine seasons)"
Sky Castle,"Cleveland Show has officially been axed and IIRC the John Mulaney/Lorne Michaels project is just called ""Mulaney"""
Sky Castle,The Untitled Michael J. Fox show already has a full season order. They did it just based on the pilot script. [Source](http://www.hitfix.com/news/nbc-lands-michael-j-foxs-return-to-series-tv)
Sky Castle,It has not been confirmed that Mad men is going to end with season 6 speculation of a season 7 is high.
Sky Castle,Not to be a stickler but now you have Mad Men in the returning shows and it is uncertain if it is coming back for a 7th season (but like I said highly speculated).  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Mad_Men_episodes#Season_7
Sky Castle,"This is great, thanks. "
Sky Castle,"Why are 2 Broke Girls and Arrested Development listed as summer shows?

2BG will be ending in may like all other normal shows and AD will be on netflix where you can watch the whole thing in 1 day if you want so it's more like a movie than a tv show"
Sky Castle,You're missing White Collar (USA).  They posted on their facebook page that they were renewed for season 5 airing in the fall.
Sky Castle,There's a more [interactive version on tv.com](http://www.tv.com/news/whats-renewed-whats-canceled-and-whats-still-in-between-2013-edition-136682993611/) that you can vote on.
Sky Castle,"Great job! 

Also I don't think I see Royal Pains - Season Premiere
Wednesday, June 12th?"
Fugitiva,Have you seen Bitter Daisies? The Spanish True Detective
Fugitiva,"I found this was one of those shows that gave me a reason to hate nearly every character at one point or another. By the end though, Alejandro, Esperanza & f’n Paula (!!) were the only ones still on that list.

Happy that some loose ends were left at the end, for a potential second season."
Fugitiva,It sucks that there is no news on whether there is a season 2 or not. They left the end open.
Fugitiva,I will hunt it down & report back. Thanks =)
Sick Note,Three people i never expected to see on screen together. 
Sick Note,"I'm actually really rooting for Lohan. She was a great presence in literally all of her movies pre-trainwreck. The Parent Trap, Freaky Friday, and even that old Disney Channel movie Get a Clue were staples of my childhood. And of course, Mean Girls. They all hold up really well and she plays a big part in that.

I would love to see a return of that Lindsay. She's proven that she has the talent inside of her, I just hope she's capable of accessing it again. "
Sick Note,[deleted]
Sick Note,"I really hope this is a comeback for her. She's been clean for years now, I believe, and this looks like a really good cast. "
Sick Note,We don't even know if series 1 is any good yet.
Sick Note,"Nice, she's great. She has great potential. Hopefully this works out for her, I have nothing but support."
Sick Note,"Boy, Harry Potter really let himself go"
Sick Note,hope this doesn't keep Frost from being on Into the Badlands
Sick Note,"Never heard of this show, but good for her!  Nice to see she's landed a paying gig."
Sick Note,Can they cast Nick Nolte based on him sharing many letters with the title?
Sick Note,That's a weird combo
Sick Note,"How long do we give her before she's fired for holding up filming with chronic lateness and unprofessional behaviour caused by ""exhaustion""? I give it three weeks. "
Sick Note,"""Show no one has heard of adds failed actress with an unusual cult following that wants to see her do well, at long last, despite never being all that good of an actress in the first place.""

Remind me to tune in. /s"
Sick Note,no ginger jokes?
Sick Note,"Why?  Get out of there Nick.

Run!"
Sick Note,">She was a great presence in literally all of her movies pre-trainwreck. 

plus all of her early SNL hosting stints."
Sick Note,I just hope she's capable of staying clean. 
Sick Note,"I personally think she's really ruined her look with a combination of surgery and drugs. However, I'm still hopeful of an RDJr story here, cause I loved Mean Girls."
Sick Note,I appreciate when Anger Management was still going that Charlie Sheen said she was welcome back anytime.
Sick Note,"She is in a movie called ""Herbie: Fully Loaded"". It has been admitted that they had to use computers and reduce the size of her breasts in some the scenes because of how massive they were during filimng"
Sick Note,"Annoying with streaming sites, too."
Sick Note,Everyone loves a good comeback from drugs. Look at what Robert Downey Jr. came back from. [The late 90s](http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/120914135616-robert-downey-jr-mug-large-169.jpg) were a bad time for him.
Sick Note,Someone seems to have liked it enough to order season 2 right away..
Sick Note,"Maybe Lindsay Logan, but British actors eventually end up working together at some point "
Sick Note,Well Lohan has been Hermione before  http://i.imgur.com/JMjQ9Pq.jpg
Sick Note,"Between this and Simon Pegg being Ron Weasley, I wish we could get them as grownups with someone like Rosamund Pike as Hermione."
Sick Note,"is he even casted in season 3? Because this can be a clue that he isn't

I really like his character. "
Sick Note,I came here to post the same question!
Sick Note,"What, do you not like Nick or Rupert?"
Sick Note,"Honestly I think UK productions are a lot less ""diva friendly"" because most have had to graft their way up to the top, talent isn't ""blessed"" by the industry and pushed as much over here even if the elite may have more inroads to RADA and the RSC. If 300 people turn up to work and one arsehole is holding up production, those 300 people will get angry, not just happily wait for the star to decide to emerge from their trailer on their terms. We're a lot more workman like when it comes to how we treat our actors and honestly it may do Lohan some good to have to deal with a cast and crew who won't indulge her shit because they all want to go home sooner rather than later because they know what their jobs entail, deliver and then want to fuck off, job done, rather than fuck around because someone else is failing their part in the ensemble. "
Sick Note,"It might have ruined her look for the roles she played previously (young, quirky high schoolers), but that doesn't mean she can't act anymore. "
Sick Note,Those bastards. 
Sick Note,[deleted]
Sick Note,well Daniel Wu said he's at least not dead
Sick Note,"I love Nick Frost.  Disappointed to see him share the screen with some washed-out has-been tramp.

I have no opinion on Rupert Grint."
Sick Note,"Honestly I think the U.K. forcing/going overboard of forcing every actor to get training from accredited expensive prestigious schools like RADA,RSC, drama centre, central school,etc  or they won't allow them an agent is stupid. Nobody has the money for that. I also heard the drama school accreditation system Drama U.K. closed because they started getting greedy and changing schools fees that even RADA couldn't afford. Who's gonna accredited those drama schools now?"
Sick Note,Jim O'Heir's laugh in this KILLS ME I lose it every time 
Sick Note,Well..
Sick Note,"Not everyone is classically trained, however those actors generally only get as far as soap operas like Hollyoaks and Emmerdale. It's not as if Michelle Keegan and Helen Flanagan are lacking for money or opportunity, they just aren't going to get the same offers as Rosamund Pike will. "
Sick Note,I don't think pike ever went to drama school
Sick Note,She acted and directed at Oxford University after first being noticed as part of the National Youth Theatre. That's just as good. 
Sick Note,ok
Sick Note,At first I couldn’t get over Rupert Grint playing such a loser of a character but he grew one on me. Don Johnson was incredible.
Sick Note,"Right ? Lol I keep Liking him more as the episodes went by , but I’ve loved Frost from the beginning!!"
Sick Note,"I've heard of Scott Aukerman revealing ONE new show, but Scott Aukerman revealing TWO new shows!?"
Sick Note,"I get the feeling that Jeffrey Characterwheaties is going to object to ""Take My Wife"""
Sick Note,Take My Wife is very obviously about the widow Kulap. Manzoukas is set to lead.
Sick Note,"Met Scotty Auks at the Chicago show and he was such a sincere, nice person. I'm very happy for him."
Sick Note,mah wiiiife
Sick Note,"I just want to point out that so far in 2016, Scott Aukerman has produced three new TV shows (with Bajillion Dollar Properties), filmed a 20-episode season of his TV show, and done a month-long live Comedy Bang Bang tour, all while continuing with weekly (or twice weekly) episodes of the podcast."
Sick Note,Cop Swapperman?
Sick Note,So will this be titled in Borat voice?
Sick Note,"Goddam I assumed it was a bit for CBB for the new season

That's a lot of shows!"
Sick Note,[deleted]
Sick Note,I just want to get caught up on the podcast so I understand all these inside jokes.  
Sick Note,"Awesome, two more shows to not be amused by"
Sick Note,"Heynong man, and reset."
Sick Note,i certainly admire the guy
Sick Note,[Deleted]
Sick Note,Hot Soccermom?
Sick Note,Not everybody listens to Comedy Bing Bong
Sick Note,What is your mission?
Sick Note,"I'm with you. I think scott awkwardman is not funny at all. reggie watts was the life of that show, scott was just fucking awkward and forcibly not funny"
Sick Note,You mean Comedy Big Bang Theory
Sick Note,"Heynong man, I sure as hell listen."
Sick Note,Forcibly not funny is his schtick honestly
Sick Note,"He's never been funny.  He joined Mr. Show as a writer in season 4, aka the one that sucked"
Sick Note,Comedy b.. B...
Sick Note,yea his attempt at dry deadpanned shit is awful. i hate that sohw
Sick Note,i feel like none of you have any idea what youre even talking about lol
Sick Note,"Obviously those guys know more about comedy than the guy who has made his living out of writing, producing, and starring in comedy."
Sick Note,"No Malcolm in the Middle?

Bruh"
Sick Note,"Man I loved Wilfred, such a poignant look on mental illness"
Sick Note,"Trick question what happens in every supernatural episodes 

Nothing it's all filler"
Sick Note,"Wait, you've watched all these shows from start to finish? Or did you include shows where you watched just a few seasons? How did you fit big shows like Supernatural, Gossip Girl, The Office, Parks and Rec etc? Now I'm curious as to how many I've watched this year. lmao"
Sick Note,Meanwhile I've watched the entirety of LOST 3 different times in the past year.
Sick Note,What are your top ten?
Sick Note,"I liked the The Guest Book on hulu and Brooklyn 99, Happy Endings, Better Off Ted, The Mindy Project."
Sick Note,I’ve watched more tv this last year than the entire previous decade combined. Not proud of it but nothing to do.
Sick Note,Did you also watch all the naruto filler?
Sick Note,love death and robots is stupidly good! loved it! s2 is coming
Sick Note,"You are missing stuff. You need to watch Deadwood, Rome, Jericho, Spaced, Peep Show, Extras, True Detective season 1, battlestar galatica, Deadwood again, and then probably watch Deadwood one more time. 

I'm sure you have already watched some of these, just my recommendations."
Sick Note,Stath lets flats.  Get on it!
Sick Note,"Great show list.  I’ve been on a re-watching spree too.  If you enjoy crime drama/thriller stuff, some faves of mine I didn’t see on your list that you might like: The Wire, Dexter, Mind Hunter, Absentia, Jessica Jones, The Fall and Liar."
Sick Note,Now time to calculate how many hours you spent... Supernatural and Naruto alone would probably be 50% of the time spent watching.
Sick Note,No 12 Monkeys Show 🙁🙁 It's one of the best TV shows man watch it
Sick Note,"I've seen a lot of these too in the last year, especially liked Unorthodox, The QG, and Mrs America - all top quality. Haunting of hill house was better than I expected. 

Devs is great too if you can find it, lots to think about black mirror type of scifi. 

Also caught up with some brilliant old stuff that I never would have bothered with if it wasn't for lockdown:

End of the F****** World

The Sinner

Happy Valley

The OA

Marcella

Top Boy

Whiplash"
Sick Note,Should add some Venture Bros to that list.  Very much worth it.
Sick Note,"Dude, you need to get out and get some fresh air and some vitamin D"
Sick Note,"Anyone else just watching same few shows over and over?
Community
What we do in the Shadows
Pushing Daisies
Dead Like Me"
Sick Note,Watch Ted Lasso. Guaranteed to put a smile on your face
Sick Note,Try **Dance Academy**
Sick Note,I am very legitimately curious how many actual hours of TV this is
Sick Note,"I watched a lot of TV this past year too but jesus christ man, not this much... I'm going to assume you are a minor still in school and not an adult with a job lol"
Sick Note,"I sorry but do you do anything but watch TV? If you watched supernatural 8 hours a day 7 days a week for a month you would finish it, Bones would take almost a long as well.  I just can't imagine having this much free time anytime in my life"
Sick Note,"[I've seen over a 100](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/l7uqu0/within_the_span_of_a_year_ive_seen_nearly_100/), I'm sure."
Sick Note,You watched pieces of shit like Gossip Girl and Bridgerton and you never saw The Americans or The Wire? That's terrible.
Sick Note,"Impressive! I'm assuming these are just randomly numbered? Do you have a #1 from this list, or like top 3?"
Sick Note,And your favorite was?
Sick Note,ok now sort them from best to worst
Temperature of Love,The prick turned up to court each day in a rented Rolls Royce. Not really sure what the message he was trying to make was.
Temperature of Love,Gonna chime in on this one and say I have no idea how the people of Britain let this guy fucking win during his season. Like there were absolute pieces of garbage that season and he stood out the most. The show even allowed his now ex-gf to break up with him IN THE HOUSE on an episode after he had sex with another contestant LMAO.
Temperature of Love,People are so stupid.
Temperature of Love,I read that he made 40k from his OF around the time he posted the video. I hope he has to pay her every cent of it.
Temperature of Love,Good. What a POS.
Temperature of Love,[Every time I see this fuckwit I remember him shitting his pants in big brother when that giant opened the door.](https://youtu.be/-dJ-fRGSTEQ)
Temperature of Love,What a gross thing to do.
Temperature of Love,Holy fucking loser Batman
Temperature of Love,"Saw him on 2 seasons of The Challenge and it was obvious he was a major asshole. He had some fun moments but he didn't know when to stop and took things too far.

It was rough watching some of the girls fall for his ""bad boy"" charm over and over (specifically Georgia and Kailah). 

In retrospect that scene where Wes and Bananas stuck a photo of Kailah's boyfriend up above her bed was probably a low-key effort to remind her she was about to cheat on her boyfriend for an absolute prick."
Temperature of Love,Celebrity is quite a stretch
Temperature of Love,Eww. He *drips* douchebag.
Temperature of Love,Maybe Channel 4 can stick a camera up his arse so we don’t miss any of the action.
Temperature of Love,"Not Georgia! She is so lovely 🥺 

...And even if she wasn't, no one should ever suffer this humiliation or invasion of privacy. The court ruled appropriately."
Temperature of Love,I hate everything about this headline.
Temperature of Love,"I have never seen this person, so I guess even winning Celebrity Big Brother doesn't make someone much of a celebrity."
Temperature of Love,These guys trying too hard to prove their masculinity. What a joke.
Temperature of Love,Good. Fucking loser
Temperature of Love,I had to read that headline nine times before I stopped seeing George Harrison.
Temperature of Love,Who and who?
Temperature of Love,"Not long enough considering this dickhead's given her a life sentence, knowing that video will be online forever now because of him. Hope he's put on the sex offender register for life."
Temperature of Love,Oh what a miserable fucking cunt this dude is. I hate him so much. He’s a true monster.
Temperature of Love,"It’s crazy this shit stain got 21 months for posting a fucking video, versus that mega shit stain QB who only got 6 months for beating the shit out of his gf. It’s a very backwards, fucked up system we got"
Temperature of Love,"For context, he will only serve half of this sentence and be on some bullshit probation for the remainder."
Temperature of Love,"Not long enough IMHO, arrogant prick."
Temperature of Love,Never heard of him.
Temperature of Love,"If he’s put on the sex offenders register, will he banned from travel and social media? I really hope so would be nice for him to disappear from consciousness. 

Oh, and I hope prison is thoroughly unpleasant for him. But he’ll probably be protected on the nonce wing."
Temperature of Love,As he should. If not more…
Temperature of Love,Oh my god that’s terrible.  Which website was it?
Temperature of Love,[removed]
Temperature of Love,"Isnt this how the kardashians got their start? They just did it in a sneaky “oops, it got leaked” way."
Temperature of Love,Nasty bastard
Temperature of Love,What's really sad is if you watch the video of him showing up for sentencing there was still loads of girls wanting pictures with him
Temperature of Love,"Disappointed that he turned out to be an actual prick. For what I saw when he appeared in those reality shows my GF watches, he was pretty hilarious. Managed to rub everyone the wrong way. Especially those idiots of the MTV Challenge shows who take themselves way too serious. But fuck him for putting this video online and he got what he deserves"
Temperature of Love,"She looks like a Smut anyway, should have never made a video knowing it could get out."
Temperature of Love,Link?
Temperature of Love,Maybe don’t allow yourself to be videotaped for sex?
Temperature of Love,Lame.
Temperature of Love,Remindme! 2 hours
Temperature of Love,20000 channels here
Temperature of Love,"This is so stupid. Yes if somebody is murderer, robber, rapist, etc.. send them to prison. But this? Wtf this world is so soft lmao"
Temperature of Love,"If two adults consent to recording themselves having sex, you pretty much give up any right to privacy given the risks involved of that video being made public."
Temperature of Love,*Sigh*
Temperature of Love,Money often brings out the trash that was hidden within. Hope he enjoys his three hots and a cot.
Temperature of Love,See ya
Temperature of Love,Loozah!
Temperature of Love,Showing off the dick again. Some guys can’t help themselves.
Temperature of Love,Good
Temperature of Love,"Surely that should be ‘celebrity’ Big Brother. Seriously though, why do we keep enabling biological waste like this numpty?"
Temperature of Love,"How about we change the narrative on this:
""Convicted sex offender Stephen Bear sentenced to 21 Months......"""
Temperature of Love,Dick head. Off to jail. Fker
Temperature of Love,What a douche.
Temperature of Love,"I remember him watching the, “The Challenge”. I never liked him and always rooted against him"
Temperature of Love,"Wait, I'm confused. His only noticeable claim to fame is being on Celebrity Big Brother? Wouldn't that mean he wasn't a celebrity? How the fuck did that happen?"
Temperature of Love,"every brother is big in prison…

have fun."
Temperature of Love,Whoa that’s awesome. I remember when people would literally post videos of themselves having sex with a minor unbeknownst to the other party the other party would be the one that got dragged and everyone else celebrated the poster. Happened to Paris Hilton.
Temperature of Love,Picture checks out
Temperature of Love,Disgusteng
Temperature of Love,Neck tattoos…
Temperature of Love,"What kind of asshols does that?  Just because they have a typical hot attributes of man, doesn't mean this! What a prick."
Temperature of Love,Who is this guy and why is he well known enough to be considered a “celebrity?”
Temperature of Love,Is *everybody* on Big Brother a steaming pile of shit?
Temperature of Love,Both of them are a waste of space
Temperature of Love,And he published non-consensual photos and videos with his ex. So well deserved!
Temperature of Love,A smart rich person would go to rehab and blame it all in the demon liquor
Temperature of Love,"“I’m terribly insecure, please feel jealous of me”"
Temperature of Love,Maybe he was trying to make sure that every single person who saw him loathed him. The crime itself probably was enough but he could have wanted the extra assurance.
Temperature of Love,Trying to be an Andrew Tate alpha dude bro? Because apparently doing sex crimes is fine as long as you own luxury cars
Temperature of Love,He’s probably a big Andrew Tate fan
Temperature of Love,"Must have been trying to let everyone know what a massive cunt he is, as if his previous actions hadn’t already proven it to anyone watching. Not that I condone anything bad happening to him but maybe going to prison as a sex offender will show him the error of his ways, although being a high profile prisoner will probably afford him more luxuries than the average person would receive"
Temperature of Love,How do you know it was rented
Temperature of Love,Imagine the type of people who watch celebrity big brother and I’m sure you’ll find your answer
Temperature of Love,"People vote for the people they want to see more of next week. It's visual clickbait that ends up winning, not because we like these people, but because we like to judge them. 

So this weird symbiotic relationship exists where assholes try and be mega-assholes just to keep the eyeballs glued to their antics. And the viewers get what they want just the same. 

My word for 2023 is ""disengage"". Really I shouldn't even be reading a reddit thread about the guy, it is absolutely what he wants and will perpetuate this sort of personality proliferating."
Temperature of Love,"Many idiots think of people like him as ""alpha males"" unironically... they think they are ""powerful"" and ""real men"" and other shit like that, since they believe themselves to be like that or worse, wish they would be like that, and thats why they vote for that.

Then you have some women that like ""bad boys"" i.e. assholes they think they can ""tame"", when we all know assholes will stay assholes....

Thats sadly how most of reality TV works, the biggest dicks and assholes always win, women and men.

I mean look at Francesca WhatsHerName from Too Hot to Handle on Netflix, she won, when she was not only clearly there for Clout only, but basically fucked over everyone, was a total bitch and basically sold herself for some internet fame... and she still has a huge following because there are too many idiots and lowlifes that love people like that as described above... people are insane."
Temperature of Love,"In Australia when it first started the person who usually wins is just a genuine compassionate down to earth person with empathy.

Most have had good positive careers after it and in talk shows and are just good people.

How the fuck do these cunts keep winning now? Is that what people inspire to be like now?"
Temperature of Love,"Well, this is the same show that produced Andrew Tate, so…"
Temperature of Love,"Didn't watch celebrity big brother but did see him on The Challenge.

He came across as a ""douche with a heart""  

* He would cheat, but be honest that he cheated and show some remorse

* he would lie, but show some remorse for the lie

* he would act tough, but talk about it being a front

* (not a big brother thing but in the challenge he had a string never quite attitude even against much bigger people that made him popular)

On the challenge he played up a character  pretty well.  The bad boy with a heart of gold.  People eat that shit up.

The girl in the video met him on the challenge and ate that shit up.  People love an asshole who looks to have a soft center"
Temperature of Love,None of these shows are chosen by the public. It is all decided by marketing and money.
Temperature of Love,"This entire genre of media is fucking appalling trash, that's how. Its fans are just as awful."
Temperature of Love,Area you trying to rationalize reality TV? Go touch some grass
Temperature of Love,People are so ~~stupid.~~ horrible
Temperature of Love,Which beckons the question why we’re giving them more publicity
Temperature of Love,He’ll probably be paying that in legal fees.
Temperature of Love,Holy shit that guy is huge
Temperature of Love,I don't understand anything that happened in this video
Temperature of Love,The narcissistic wound in public format
Temperature of Love,Lol! Just watched that. What a fucking pussy.
Temperature of Love,"Ironically, after all his attempts at appearing Alpha, he looks just like David in Schitt’s Creek.

“Eeew, David.”"
Temperature of Love,The Challenge is the show I know him from. Wes and Bananas teaming up for that was hilarious.
Temperature of Love,"Ahhhh

Bear from the challenge....

He was fun on the challenge but being a douche on that show won't make you stand out. Pretty much all of them are douches

Him being a little guy who fought with a ton of heart is what got him fans."
Temperature of Love,"I haven't got to this season yet, but I've seen Kailah and I hate hearing this. She's someone I hate due to a lot of her actions, but she's so pretty in exactly the way I like with dark hair and tats."
Temperature of Love,"In the UK he sadly is. This trial was constantly reported on by our tabloids and even the BBC. 

This guy is a scumbag and should absolutely have no celebrity following, but some people live for following this stuff. See also Chris Brown still selling out tours."
Temperature of Love,"The great natural culmination of Big Brother (the UK version anyway) was the blurring of the lines between celebrity and non celebrity Big Brother.   
     
When it started back in the late 90s, it was just some people in a house and you watched them on TV. It was the only reality TV there was. Pre-Facebook world, any ‘social media’ that existed was just bored teenagers listing their favorite bands.       
Then the celebrity one was a charity version of ‘all in a house’ only it was people who were known to the public due to being high profile in some form of entertainment (music, acting, sport, comedy, etc.).       
       
Slowly people started to realise that success on reality TV could be the gateway to ‘a career in being famous’ and being on other TV, so more and more people were less ‘just in a house’ and more trying to achieve notoriety as a springboard to fame.     
And in the celebrity one it became seen as about tacky famewhores and associated with being ‘washed up’, so they were increasingly scraping the barrel of who was ‘famous’.    
The original meta-culmination of this was when they had a non-celebrity-pretending-to-be-a-c-list-celebrity on celebrity Big Brother, which then naturally made her a celebrity.    
       
But then the third act topped it, as social media became more universal and challenged broadcast TV in importance.      
Now you still have attractive young people who want to be famous (aka the people that go on Big Brother), but if they are serious enough about that to be a good Big Brother contestant, they already have a set of high profile social media accounts with many followers unrelated to their real life. They also likely also interact with similar social media personalities (and date similar) so they can all put it on their social media, etc. They’re already ‘scene’ if they’re hungry and importantly attractive enough to become scene, and therefore celebrities.    
       
So by the end both celebrity and non-celebrity versions was an indistinguishable collection of hot 20 something’s who had already got off with each other for likes and ad revenue on various media platforms. Only the celeb version would also have a washed up American star with poor mental health who needed the money for legal issues thrown in to interact with them.      
     
That’s the point that it became clear ‘the kids’ make their own reality-fame these days and it was pointless to broadcast people who constantly broadcast themselves.       
       
Big Brother became a perfect window onto the changing nature of fame."
Temperature of Love,"Ohhhh he posted Georgia...from the challenge

They were both fun to watch on the challenge.

(Yes total douche but everyone is a douche or recovering douche on the challenge. It's part of what makes the eliminations so fun)"
Temperature of Love,"Hilariously, I’m pretty sure that the contestants are supposed to be celebrities before joining the show (that is, they aren’t becoming celebrities because of the show, they are supposed to already be famous). 

Of course, there’s no way to get a genuine celebrity with a real career to agree to do something like this, so the casting people have to go with a bunch of nobodies anyway. Checking Wikipedia, the people who were on that season are mostly from other reality shows for example."
Temperature of Love,"The genre is circular. You are famous by being on reality TV and that feeds back in to the celeb side of reality TV. It just eats itself because no one else wants anything to do with it, because its beyond useless trash."
Temperature of Love,"Just hoping this wasn't America's version of Celebrity Big Brother, which only ran opposite the Winter Olympics."
Temperature of Love,"I saw him on the challenge.  Charismatic douche

Fit in well on the challenge as they are pretty much all douches or recovering douches."
Temperature of Love,"I mean, his onlyfans and twitter is full of videos of him sitting on a huge dildo and fucking himself with objects. Can’t be more masculine than that!"
Temperature of Love,I can't find it
Temperature of Love,"If he posted it on his only fans, then it's not public so no it won't be online forever"
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"I'm kinda tempted to start it, even if I'm not interested, because I want it to do well so that Netflix may consider adapting other stuffs from Jonathan Stroud (yes, this is about Bartimaeus. I want it as a TV show)."
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation, I love Joe Cornish so I’ll jump in with no second season renewal parachute
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"Another fantasy YA!

Netflix is literally a mash up of The CW, Hallmark and Lifetime"
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,STEPHEN!
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"All the reviews I've seen so far are pretty positive. 

https://www.radiotimes.com/tv/fantasy/lockwood-co-netflix-review/

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/lockwood-co-netflix-review-ghostly-adventure-bags-ramshackle/


As a fan of the series and of the movie work Joe Cornish has done (as well as all the Adam and Joe stuff), I am really looking forward to this."
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,And will get cancelled and left on a cliffhanger after season 2.
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"I am a fan of Joe Cornish's previous films, Attack the Block and The Kid Who Would Be King, so I'll take a chance and check this out even though Netflix has burned me so, so many times before."
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"Honestly the trailer doesn't convince me, it seems to have the usual Netflix's decent cgi and teen leads acting cool. But I'll be watching since it's Joe Cornish."
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,I love the books so I hope this series turns out to be a good adaptation
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"Feb 8th 2023: Lockwood & Co. has less viewers than Stranger Things, canceled."
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,Can’t wait for this to be cancelled! It’ll be right after I start watching it too.
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"Ah the girl from As Dusk Falls,

Sounds cool too, I hope it's enjoyable and can last on its own term"
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"Really excited for this. It looks like the makers have tried to keep it real close to the source material too. Also, if this is a hit, we can expect some Bartimaeus stuff soon!"
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,I ll wait2 or 3 seasons before starting it
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,STEVEN?
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"Didn't know Joe Cornish was involved with this, will have to give it a watch."
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"You this show is great and has good ratings  

Netflix: Awesome, cancel it."
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"Positive critic reviews, people seem to enjoy it, annnnnnnd it's canceled by Netflix (soon, probably)."
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"Unless they are absolute must watch, hear about them everywhere shows, I refuse to invest anymore into Netflix"
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,The next news of it will be cancelled after one season.
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"Netflix cancels most shows before the end of a third season in order to avoid having to negotiate new contracts with all creatives and talent involved. Most upfront deals are for three seasons, with pre-negotiated pay scaling. So small “hits” that in prestreaming times might have lasted four or more seasons get canned, since Netflix will have to pay a LOT more to keep EVERYONE. Only truly massive breakout shows are worth them backing up the truck and dumping money. 

Also there’s a presumed Netflix tax, similar to the Disney or Star Wars tax, where everyone assumes they have infinite money so everyone demands more money to work for them. Which forces budgets up for things. Which means they have less money to extend middling or struggling shows.

Also? They just don’t have enough execs to cover their shows. So quality is wobbly as fuck except for their big big spend shows. Which means, shows don’t have someone helping with quality control AND don’t have advocates INSIDE Netflix who can love that wobbly show enough to fight for it to stay around."
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,Has it been cancelled though?
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"What *IS* it about UK casting that is so good? When I watch UK TV, the characters seem like real people. When you watch US produced shows, the characters seems incredibly surreal a lot of the time."
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,Odds on it getting cancelled after 1 season?
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"i just keep giving up on these Netflix YA shows like Locke and Key, First Kill, The Order (latter two were cancelled afterwards)"
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"Have seen 0 advertisements, or marketing, it’s got a young cast and its Sci-fi YA. Do I even watch if it’s just going to get cancelled?"
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,I’m thinking wait until five seasons as I’m concerned they will just cancel it just as I get into it
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,Ah another good show? Sounds like it will get canceled by Netflix here soon.
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,Waiting to hear about it getting cancelled.
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"First I’ve heard of it, so I assume it has already been cancelled?"
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,I would watch this but I'm afraid it will be canceled without a conclusion like everything else on Netflix.  Feels like they are in a bit of a death spiral that they caused.
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,Netflix sucks
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,No more
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"Non ya person here but what’s with the swords? Seems kinda hokey, like swashbuckling Ghostbusters."
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,What does YA mean here?
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,Why can’t we just get an adaptation of the Pepperwood Chronicles
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,important is to know does this season have a cliffhanger yes or no? i read it covers 2 books. but never read the books. so is it a complete story. or will it be very open ended?
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"Here's a lesson in Economics 101: If there's enough demand for something, smart business minds will find a way to make money off of it. That simple. But the execs at Netflix are just too stupid and unimaginative so they cancel everything."
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,Netflix's YA adaptation will not get enough season and end with one or two seasons.
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"Bartimaeus is my favorite book series ever. Could translate well to TV, would need a good budget for sure though."
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"Netflix bases cancellations in large part on what percentage of people finish a show that they started.  If you're starting it for this sake, finish it."
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,I love the Bartimeaus trilogy so bad but I don’t want them to butcher it as a tv series
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"> yes, this is about Bartimaeus

Holy shit you got me excited for a second there thinking this series was somehow related to the Bartimaeus books. I loved those when I was younger. The Bartimaeus series along with Garth Nix Old Kingdom are my dream series to get adapted well."
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"There’s no point in starting it, Netflix will just cancel it. They have this self-perpetuating cancelation loop going and it’s super frustrating. They cancel great shows and then no one wants to watch their shows because they know they’ll just get canceled, leading to low watch numbers and canceled shows. I’m still salty about Midnight Club."
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"I would really recommend watching it, it was an amazing show! I didn't even read the books but I loved it."
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"I wish Joe Cornish had more stuff out since Attack the Block, one of my all time favorites. I need more movies like that from him."
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"I understand why people say this, but if you don’t watch it then they *definitely* won’t renew it"
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"Man, there was like a brief eighteen month period a few years back where Netflix was aiming to be high brow."
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,Just coming!
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,Good ol Cornballs!
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"I prefer books as a medium but I usually don't read ones aimed at a younger audience, so if you don't mind, could I get a little rundown on why you like it?"
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"Based on the trailer, it looks to follow the first two books. While there is an arc that goes over all 5 books, these first two books in particular have self-contained stories."
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,Bold of you to assume there will be a season 2 👀
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,Which is why we are probably canceling Netflix this month. Nothing worth watching since it all gets canceled.
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,The Netflix way
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,Very optimistic. I will probably be canceled while I type this.
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,That long?
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,THAT'S where she's from! I liked that game.
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,....Just coming!
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"> Netflix cancels most shows before the end of a third season in order to avoid having to negotiate new contracts with all creatives and talent involved. Most upfront deals are for three seasons, with pre-negotiated pay scaling.

How many of their new shows have 3-season deals up front?"
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"I would say with this, it looks like they are straight up adapting the books, there is maybe 3 seasons worth of content. There are five books (and one novella). Season 1 looks to cover books 1 and 2. The later books are slightly longer, but not massively. 

Say season 2 covered books 3 and 4 and then maybe a shorter final season for book 5."
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,That’s not true. Netflix pays higher rates in lieu of residuals.
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,We will know when the opening week viewership ratings come in a week from today.
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,I would say that this one was much better than the ones you mentioned
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"There are only 5 novels in the series and the first season of the show uses 2 of those so unless Stroud or the writers are extending the stories further, we'll probably only need 3 seasons to finish the story from the books."
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"So.... everyone will go to a Marvel movie opening weekend to see how bad it is.

But the same everyone will wait to see if a show they're actually interested in gets canceled before they'll watch it.

You do realize, going to the movie you don't like tells networks, make more of this. And not watching the show you might like tells them; don't make this.  

If you watch it, it is less likely to get canceled."
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"It's based on a series of books. Season 1 looks to cover books 1 and 2. While there is an ongoing arc, these two books are pretty light on that (at least in the books) and each book is a self-contained plot."
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"In the universe where the stories are set silver and iron help dispel and weaken the ghosts so the ghost hunters use rapiers made from these metals as their main form of offence & defence against ghosts. I'm a fan of the novels and really looking forward to this series, hoping Joe Cornish has done it justice, I'm sure he will have!"
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"It's based on real-world lore, according to which ghosts and other supernatural entities can be harmed by certain materials - iron, silver, salt, etc. So the weapons used by ghost hunters include rapiers and salt bombs and steel chains and silver lined glass jars for containment."
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,Young Adult. It's one of the age classifications for books. Around age 12 and up.
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"The season ends on a minor cliffhanger, but it’s not related to any major plot points (and you can Google the answer to the question if you’re interested and get the answer from the books). But overall, the season covers the first two books which are self contained stories. There are some threads that link to later plot points but you mostly won’t notice them unless you’ve read the books."
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"The first two books are rather self contained but hint at an overarching plot that really gets going from the third book on. Going of the books, there could be a bit of a cliffhanger, but that won’t necessarily lead to the story of the season feeling unresolved. And honestly, even if the series gets hit by the Netflix cancellation bus, the books are right there, and they are definitely worth a read."
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"Well, the snarky footnotes are one of my favorite ongoing joke mechanisms, but I’m not sure how they could capture the creative side-note nature of it

Like a voiceover can do it, but it may overlap with the ongoing action or dialogue. And there was always the extra fun of finishing a paragraph and finding what Bartimaeus really thought or a funny tidbit of magician history, which I’m not sure how they could capture the Easter egg nature of it.

I’m all for it but adapting it would take a good creative hand"
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,The Bartimaeus Trilogy wa great. I really liked the magic system in that series.
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"If they have to butcher I don't want it either ofc. I'm just hoping that they could do it right, it's a pretty straightforward story too. I can totally see it becoming a hit, but it would need a competent screenwriter."
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,[deleted]
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"> They cancel great shows

Such as?"
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"Cornish has been unlucky. Cornish Snow Crash adaption fell through and he missed out on a few studio directing gigs.

Cornish is working on the Attack The Block sequel"
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"Have you tried The Kid who would be King? 

It's not as good as Attack the Block and I was a little disappointed first time around, but I gave it a re-watch when it came to D+ and I enjoyed it. Maybe a tiny bit too long and definitely aimed at a younger audience, but still entertaining."
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,They are appealing to their majority audience now - young teens and middle aged housewives
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"Obviously, it is YA or maybe even younger. It's aimed at teenagers and not 40-something-year-old men. It's a world in which young people have the upper hand because they are the ones who can see the ghosts and have to deal with them. 

It's hard to say why I enjoyed it. On the surface, it ticks boxes of stuff I like. Ghost stories, investigation, mystery, and action. It's well-written; it has some mildly scary stuff and some great world building. The characters, while typical of YA tropes, are fun and it is light on the awkward teen romance plots that often appear in works for this audience. 

They were just really fun reads. I originally read the first one to see if it was suitable for my son, but ended up reading the whole series."
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"Not the original commenter you’re asking but I can tell you why I enjoyed the books. I started the series in my mid 20s, but I’m mid 30s now and still enjoy them! 

It’s honestly Stroud’s writing style. He could tell any story IMO, and the way he’d write it would make me a fan. He has a wonderful command of writing imperfect characters and the kids in Lockwood are no exception to this, and I am here for it. Often, kids are given characters to aspire to be, and that can make them difficult to empathize with if not handled correctly. 

That’s not the case in this series: Lucy is wonderful at what she does, but struggles hard with people; she’s recovering from a massive event in her life that is relatable to folks of all ages (I mean, not the event itself, but the themes) and I think that makes for a broad audience. She’s not the only one with struggles, either, and it’s a lot of fun watching them grow and navigate situations and complex emotions. 

I’ve not finished the series yet (life got in the way) but I keep trying; I have a habit of starting from the beginning every time and never making it to the last book! But that means I’ve read first few books both in text and in audiobook format a few times. The narrator they have for book one is fantastic; her delivery and stroud’s writing is so good. I’d give that a go if you’re unsure about picking up the series."
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,I was feeling optimistic this morning.
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"Based off the trailer it reminded me of The Bastard Son & The Devil Himself, and that didn't get a season 2. I doubt this will."
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,Yes! So glad you didn't leave me hanging 😄
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"Most players involved in a show have a three year deal in place, HOWEVER, that does not include a guarantee to perform. So Netflix can cancel a show at any point. They may have to pay out a deal if it was canceled after a commitment to produce. This is to keep their costs down. If they want three years, they know lots of fixed costs up front and can control those."
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"You are very wrong. 

They pay less than network tv. They do a buy out in lieu of residuals. The buyout does not affect weekly rates or per-ep rates."
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"Joe Cornish has being saying that in his interviews. There is an end. It isn't something that will go on for a couple of seasons and then get cancelled without a resolution. 

Season 1 covers books 1 and 2, Season 2 will do books 3 and 4 and maybe a shorter season 3 to cover the final book (which if memory serves isn't substantially longer than the previous books). 

There was The Dagger in the Desk short story as well which I guess they could use as a filler episode."
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,Thanks for the info. Trailer looked pretty good.
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,I like it so far but they haven’t really explained “The Problem” and I don’t understand why they have to go at night to fight the ghost when the whole goal is just to destroy or neutralize a source object.
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,thank you for the answer. it is a safe to watch then in case netflix cancels it.
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"thanks for the answer. i do not like reading. it is to boring to me, letters always stay the same just in scrambled order. that is why i prefer watching series or movies."
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"It would have to be Bartimeaus narrating the story but even though I agree it doesn't have good odds of coming across well.

One advantage is the first book is a very well contained story on its own. You'd be able to focus on how to adapt and not have to worry about setting up the trilogy nearly as much."
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,I've never read those. Has a Pratchette sound to it.
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"They did it with A Series of Unfortunate Events. I have kind of mixed feelings about Patrick Warburton's role in that, but I think overall it was okay."
Muhyo and Rojis Bureau of Supernatural Investigation,"Kind of, yeah. I was a big Christopher Pike (the author, not the doomed Star Fleet captain) reader as a kid and there’s much more to the story. It certainly wasn’t finished."

Cells at Work!,My Hero Academia is also really excellent.

Cells at Work!,"Next time I would include Animes that would appeal to Western Taste. Most of these will not be appealing for the general audience. 

Some good animes for the Western Taste (2010s only):

One-Punch Man (Action/Comedy. An overpowered dude that is a hero for fun).


My Hero Academica (Action/Coming of Age story. A weak powerless boy gets the most powerful superpower in the world and his tale to master this power without breaking everything in his body using it.)


Psycho Pass (Thriller/Crime. Dystopian Future where police kills everyone who has a hint of mental instability)

Parasyte (Thriller/Horror. Dude gets infected by an alien parasite but the infection doesn't go as planned.)

Edit: Forgot to add that these all have English Dubs. Most of the list above do not.
"
Cells at Work!,"Gundam: Iron Blooded Orphans
Is a great one, its serious, the animation looks great, it does get dark because it deals with children piloting the mechs"
Cells at Work!,"First, thank you putting this list together and trying to offer more exposure to an entire medium/format/genre (Japanese animation) that is, imo, underappreciated in the west. Now, on to a few thoughts/opinions:

When people actually ask for recommendations, it's best not to overwhelm them with options else they might feel overwhelmed and give up. If they get a response of ""Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, Death Note"" then they already have ~100 hours of watching ahead of them and those are totally fine options. 

There's a lot of comedy and slice of life on this list. While more variety sounds better on paper, I don't think those genres work as well as others with a language/culture barrier. They're usually more character focused and thus body language, dialog, inflection, dialect, translation, nuance, delivery, inside jokes, locality, animation style, etc. become more important. The usual Cowboy Bebop recommendations are generally more serious, conceptual, sci-fi, psychological, seinen, action, mystery -type series that show off what ""adult"" animation is capable of which result in more ""wow!"" experiences (and western media ""borrowing"" from them). The unfortunate ""anime stigma"" in the west is that anime is perverted and characters look/act like 12yo children (which westerners already have in the form of youth-targeted cartoons). So, while I personally really enjoy something like Kill La Kill, I don't think the over-the-top action, ridiculous plot, and easily misinterpreted sexualization would be a good starting point/leave a good first impression for the uninitiated. 

This list is great for those who have already watched most of the popular recommendations for westerners and want to branch out a bit more. That said, new fans should keep in mind that they'll probably dislike 95% of all anime produced. I've watched 300+ series and I wouldn't go anywhere near some of the stuff on this list. And that's OK; it's common with most hobbies/interests. Find what you like, look for more, have fun with it, share your experiences!

For reference, my favorite TV (top 10, random order):

* Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul
* Game of Thrones
* Westworld
* Black Mirror
* Lost

Cells at Work!,"I was kinda hoping you would list [Uchuu Kyoudai](https://myanimelist.net/anime/12431/Uchuu_Kyoudai ) or Space Brothers in English.  Pretty good slice of life/sci fi about becoming an Astronaut.   Here is the [trailer with English sub for it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciS3fDqT1Vw )

Another series maybe not considered in the past decade is [Hajime No Ippo](https://myanimelist.net/anime/263/Hajime_no_Ippo ) even though the 3rd season (Hajime No Ippo: Rising) came out in 2013/2014.  Its a great sport/slice of life/comedy series."

basically anime that does not rely on anime troupes and tells a great story, what would you recommend from this decade?

edit: action oriented is a plus"
Cells at Work!,I'd like to throw a shout for Terror in Resonance too. Great show
Cells at Work!,"Barakamon and Girls' Last Tour are two of my absolute favorite shows, and I'm pretty happy to see them make the list. Sora no Woto is up there too.

Those three are all slice-of-life type shows, a genre that can be pretty hit or miss, but these three do a great job of building a world (or a town, as in Barakamon) and making you keep watching because you're interested in that world, and the characters, even if there's no overreaching plot trying to tie everything together. They aren't necessarily exciting, but they're thoroughly enjoyable. And sometimes you just need a nice calm show like that."
Cells at Work!,Kind of a weird post. I'd expect at least a sorry description with each show. A genre doesn't really cut it.
Cells at Work!,"**Sora no Woto** is surprisingly good. Definitely not what I expected. It's part slice of life, part post-apocalypse, and also an anti-war story. And the music is fantastic. Occasionally feels like **Kino's Journey**, but somwhat less bleak. 

***
**Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu** is a slow burn, but is an exceptionally good period drama set in the post-postwar era where the Japanese economy was beginning to pick up again. One of the popular forms of entertainment was a style of traditonal comic storytelling called Rakugo. In an era where not many had televisions yet, they were often broadcast on radio. 

A recently released convict approaches one of the masters of this artform to become his disciple after having only heard his radio broadcasts in prison. Drama ensues. Lots of dialogue as you may expect. **Joshiraku** is a much less serious take on Rakugo, if you like terrible puns and Japanese cultural references you won't understand, this is for you. 

***
**Natsume's Book of Friends** is really one of the most heartbreaking yet heartwarming series I've ever seen. Main character is the only person who can see the denizens of the spirit world, resulting in him being ostracised by almost every human he meets due to his reaction to heir presence, but returning to his grandmother's hometown changes that, for better or worse. Partly episodic, but with some overarching plot. For another contemporary fantasy series that's kind of similar, try **The Ancient Magus' Bride**. **Mushishi** is also excellent and has a similar spirit detective vibe, but much more serious. "

Do you recommend it? Based on my viewing history and the Netflix catalogue what would you recommend I watch next?"

Cells at Work!,"I'm someone who haven't watched a lot of anime since about 2008 or so, so I'll check out some of these, thanks. 

That said, I feel like the medium has definitely changed a lot since that time. So many shows now have either very strange animation styles (Kill la Kill, Made in Abyss, Devilman Crybaby...) or these strange formulaic stock characters everywhere (at least I don't remember people talking about tsunderes and moes and I don't know what back in the day). I'm sure there's a lot of good stuff once you get past these things, but in most cases nowadays I don't get further than some weirdass synopsis before I sigh and re-watch Black Lagoon or Claymore instead. And I'm someone who, despite not immersing myself into the anime/""weabo"" culture, has after all read and watched quite a lot of manga and anime in my time, and someone who likes 'weird' stuff Evangelion or Gantz.

I think that's the reason why Attack on Titan has been such a hit here in the West, despite imho not being that good of a show (it seems to go for repeated 'shocks' over telling an engaging story). It has a pretty 'realistic' and good looking animation style, characters that for the most part look rather normal, and though the premise is a bit strange it's very straight-forward once it gets going."
Cells at Work!,"Recently saw Made in Abyss because a lot of people have been raving about it.

The main characters are a girl of 14, and a robot that looks like a boy of about the same age.

I would like it a lot more, if there were not shit like recurring ""jokes"" where people look down the robot boys pants and exclaim that he has a penis. 

Like often when people were recommending it, I'd see em specify that it was not for children, and I kinda assumed that was because of horror elements or something. Like god dammit Japan."
Cells at Work!,"Ummm...My Hero Academia?

It's an amazing shonen series with much better pacing, animation and characters than a lot of its contemporaries."
Cells at Work!,"Another one I’d absolutely recommend if you’re looking for a more light hearted/comedic take on anime is “The Devil is a Part Timer”. 

Really funny, great story and quick watch. Premise is pretty simple, Devil comes back to earth and tries to take over the world...by working in fast food. 

If I’m not mistaken it’s still on Netflix, highly highly recommend."
Cells at Work!,Parastye -the maxim- should 100% be on this list. 
Cells at Work!,"I'm gonna use this thread to mention that, yes, One Piece has over 800 episodes, but it is probably the most pure fun that you can find while still managing to be epic, emotional and engaging. "

Cells at Work!,"Pretty good list, though I'd add Higurashi (the official stuff, essentially seasons 1 and 2.) for how damn good it was it combining the slice of life with horror, especially the more psychological aspects. Umineko is different, but good just somewhat odd at times and feels better to read than merely watch.

Cells at Work!,"Don't forget to request to get new seasons of your favorite anime:

https://help.netflix.com/en/titlerequest"
Cells at Work!,"I've only ever watched one anime in my adult life and that's Attack on Titan. I really enjoyed it but I'm fine not watching anything else. I have some personal hang ups about anime being ""for kids"", even the one tailored for mature audiences. "
Cells at Work!,"Not only are these shows that fall out of the ""Same 10 anime"" thing. They're all shows that I can see actually getting people into anime. Shows like FMA:B and Death Note are shows that feel detached enough for people to think ""I'm not too sure about anime, but Fullmetal Alchemist is pretty good"" instead of ""hey maybe I like anime"". All of these shows (at least the ones I've seen) are both great and feel like anime. Good list.


I also want to boost March Comes in Like a Lion to anyone reading this. It's one of my favorite shows. It follows a 17 year old depressed professional Shogi player who just recently started living on his own. Over the course of the series you watch him open up to people and form a familiar relationship that he's never really had in his life. You don't need to know anything about Shogi to understand the show."
Cells at Work!,"I'd like to think that Shouwa Genjou Rakugo Shinju is the pinnacle of anime in recent years. THE series that towers above the rest. It's not my favourite series for sure, but it comes incredibly close to perfection in so many ways. I doubt I'd recommend it to someone new to anime, but there's no excuse for anyone who calls themselves an avid fan of anime to not watch Rakugo. 

And then there's Ping Pong... The things I would give to see another series of this caliber. I'm so glad to see it on your list."
Cells at Work!,All are pretty good except Yuru Camp and Flip Flappers
Cells at Work!,"Kobayashi's Dragon Maid is probably the first new-ish anime I've fully watched in years, since Bodacious Space Pirates and Jormungand. It's poignant, cute, a little... creepy... but still heartily recommended."
Cells at Work!,"I was never an Anime fan.  I remember enjoying Ninja Scroll back in the 90's, but that's about it.  Then one day 'Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress' popped up on Amazon Prime, and I clicked on it, because there was nothing else to watch.  Loved it.  As soon as I finished it, I wanted to see even more.  Attack on Titan was a recommendation I've heard over and over, so I started watching it next.  It was even better than the Iron Fortress.  The animation, the soundtrack, the story - they were all just perfect, and I couldn't wait for more.

While waiting for the next season, I was eager to see all the other great anime shows I've been missing out on.  But here's where the disappointment came.  I would check dozens of the top recommended shows, and they simply weren't my cup of tea.  Either the animation was looking like something made in the 80's, or the story was just meh.  I could barely watch one episode, before giving up in the search of the next Attack on Titan. 

It all made sense, when I found out both Attack on Titan, and Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress are made by the same studio.  I have yet to find any other anime show that comes close to those two.  And this is not me shitting on other shows.  I'm sure they're great, but they just don't do it for me.  There's just something about AoT or KotIF, whether it's the awesome visuals, or soundtrack, that put them in a league of their own."
Cells at Work!,"No sword art online season 1?

What's the point?


Jk (though I do like SAO)

Great list op thanks for sharing"
Cells at Work!,"Maybe doesn't *technically* count, but 48% of Gintama (and potentially more, maybe, hopefully) has come after your cutoff date, and imo Gintama is a legendary anime. Action/comedy, has survived multiple hiatuses, and has reportedly been more profitable than Bleach or Naruto in Western countries, made even more incredible due to its lack of an English dub or mainstream viewing channel (such as Cartoon Network's Toonami). Insane amounts of fun, and I'm incredibly sad to be seeing it go."
Cells at Work!,[deleted]
Cells at Work!,"Totally expected, but still dissapointed that there's no Yu-Gi-Oh. :p  
Just fits well with my personal taste.  
  
My favorite beyond that though is the old anime Ranma ½. Although the manga has better plots and characterization, love the animation, voices and music. :D"
Cells at Work!,"Look at you making a worthless list that doesn't include whether there is a dub, which makes it awful, and by extension you awful."

EDIT: OKAY! Here we go.

**Barakamon:** brash young calligrapher gets exiled to the boonies to find himself

**Blood Blockade Battlefront:** secret society of supers fight weird monsters in wacky New York

**Cells at Work:** Osmosis Jones but with a cute redhead as the lead instead of Chris Rock

**Chihayafuru:** Sports show about a poetry card game. Cooler than it sounds.

**Death Parade:** Bar in purgatory hosts games to judge souls’ fates

**The Eccentric Family:** An eccentric family of shapeshifters go about their lives

**Erased:** Time travel murder mystery where the time travel isn’t that big of a deal. Tearjerker.

**Flip Flappers:** I literally cannot describe it beyond “two magical girls and trippy world”

**Flying Witch:** Extremely relaxing show about a witch training in the countryside

**Girls’ Last Tour:** Two girls journey across a harsh post apocalyptic wasteland. Philosophy?

**Haikyuu:** Hot guys play volleyball. Character development.

**Hyouka:** Bored high schoolers solve boring mysteries. Show is anything but boring.

**K-On:** Cute high school girls play in a band and eat cake. Super comfy.

**Katanagatari:** Finding swords? Weird art style. Weirder dialogue.

**Kids on the Slope:** Realistic jazz coming of age in the 60s. Great music.

**Kill la Kill:** Skimpy lingerie battles at fascist high school. Way better than it sounds.

**Kyousogiga:** Similarly trippy, often confusing show about multidimensional family. Fantastic.

**Land of the Lustrous:** One of the few 3D CGI anime worth your time. About gem people, but not the Steven Universe kind.

**Little Witch Academia:** Harry Potter.

**Love, Chuunibyou, and Other Delusions:** Cute middle schoolers do things? Haven’t seen it.

**Lupin III:** Classic, classy thief steals riches and hearts. Got Miyazaki his start.

**Made in Abyss:** Don’t go exploring the big scary hole, kids. Don’t.\\

**March comes in like a Lion:** Drama about a chess prodigy and his relationships. One of the best. 

**Mawaru Penguindrum:** Brothers and penguins(?) try to help their sister. Haven’t seen it.

**Miss Kobayashi:** Fun, funny show about a woman who adopts a bunch of dragon people into her life

**Mob Psycho 100:** Cool, trippy, great action show about a kid with super psychic powers

**Monthly Girls’ Nozaki Kun:** High school girl’s crush on romance manga artist goes unnoticed; she becomes his assistant in this wacky, hilarious comedy about romance.

**My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU:** Catcher in the Rye if it were anime and there were three Holdens. Very good.

**Mushishi:** Cool-ass spirit detective does spirit detective shit

**Nagi no Asukara:** Very pretty show about water people(?) Haven’t seen it.

**Natsume’s Book of Friends:** Arguably the closest you’ll get to a Ghibli TV show. Guy has spirit friends.

**Nichijou:** Wacky sketch comedy about wacky insane people. Very good.

**Noragami:** Haven’t seen it …. a fallen god is trying to get back on his feet(?)

**Ore Monogatari:** Gentle giant falls in love with pint sized classmate. Adorable as fuck.

**Ping Pong the Animation:** Guys play ping pong, learn about themselves. Looks wacky. Is fantastic.

**A Place Further than the Universe:** Girls go to Antarctica. Sweet and touching show.

**Polar Bear Cafe:** Polar bears and other animals run a cafe (?) Haven’t seen it.

**Shinsekai Yori:** WORLDBUILDING. New generation of humans trying to figure out about themselves(?)

**Shirobako:** An anime show about making anime shows. It’s incredible, heartwarming and educational.

**Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu:** Stand up comedy but it’s sit-down comedy and it’s very old fashioned. Character drama about artists in a dying medium in the 60s, 70s, 80s, and beyond. Slow burn that’s easily one of the best shows of the last few years, anime or no.

**So Ra No Wo To:** Girls in a small brigade run an army corps of musicians. Also they have a tank? There’s more to it but I can’t remember.

**Sound Euphonium:** High school concert band, and all the character drama and shenanigans that go with it. Very good.

**Space Dandy:** About a dandy guy in space. Lots of sexual humor. From the guy who made Cowboy Bebop. 

**Tamako Market:** Girl living in a market district has fun shenanigans with friends. Warm and comfy. The talking bird grows on you. Oh, also there’s a dark-skinned prince who shows up.

**Tanaka kun is Always Restless:** haven’t seen this one -- it’s about a guy who’s always lazy. But supposedly it’s very good.

**Tatami Galaxy:** Very fast dialogue, weird visuals. About a guy figuring out his life in college. Once you get the hang of it, it’s very entertaining and relatable.

**Tsuki ga Kirei:** Adorable show about middle schoolers’ first love.

**Tsuritama:** Haven’t seen it. IIRC there’s a guy who’s like a mermaid? Comedy, I think.

**Usagi Drop:** Relaxing, sweet show about a bachelor who takes in his grandfather’s six year old daughter from an affair. 

**Violet Evergarden:** Gorgeous show about PTSD and a young woman who becomes a letter writer in a semi 1930s world. Don’t go in expecting an action show. 

**Yona of the Dawn:** Semi-historical action adventure about a princess and her crew who go rogue.

**Yuru Camp:** Comfy show about high schoolers camping. Will make you want to camp."

Kills the suspense everytime they battle these villains who are more experienced and powerful than them."
Cells at Work!,Watching that show only makes me pine for OPM that much more. 
Cells at Work!,I feel it's just a copy of Naruto. 
Cells at Work!,How does it compare in tone/style etc to Hajime no Ippo? Definitely loving the idea of another boxing anime.
Cells at Work!,"Oh right, I should get around to watching that."
Cells at Work!,"Parasyte is really good, Imagine Japanese Peter Parker turned into venom before he ever became spider-man, and takes the responsibility to make sure to the best of his ability that humans and alien body snatchers are able to co exist secretly without everyone dying. 

"
Cells at Work!,I dunno those first two are the sort of over-recommended shows that the OP was trying to avoid. 
Cells at Work!,"> Next time I would include Animes that would appeal to Western Taste

Baccano!"
Cells at Work!,Psycho Pass season one is AMAZING
Cells at Work!,Pretty sure OP was going for non-generic picks.
Cells at Work!,"OPM, MHA and Psycho Pass are such cliche recommendations. They're good but defeat the whole purpose of this list. 

This whole ""Western Taste"" nonsense is so exaggerated "
Cells at Work!,"-	imo One Punch Man wore its premise thin pretty quickly
-	I guess I kinda liked My Hero Academia, but that's about it.
-	Psycho Pass sits just right outside my list because of the disappointing 2nd season.
-	I have to give it to you for Parasyte tho. Great show that I somehow forgot while making this list. Not sure which one it would replace tho (probably Kill la Kill or Tanaka-kun is Always Listless)"
Cells at Work!,I'd throw in Berserk and Hunter x Hunter and then call it a day.
Cells at Work!,"Do they get all emo and decide to defeat their enemies through power of love/friendship/telepathy/whatever?

Because I am watching Gundam Unicorn and it's abysmal. Especially since I watched Gundam 8th MS Team, Thunderbolt and Origins before this one and those seemed way superior even though Unicorn is supposed to be some hot stuff.

I mean, where did all that emo/telepathy stuff come from all of a sudden?  

"
Cells at Work!,"My taste overlaps with you quite a bit on live action. I couldn't get into Black Lagoon or Gurren Lagann, but I'll try to give Ergo Proxy, Steins;Gate, Psycho-Pass, and Ghost in the Shell a shot.

Thanks!"
Cells at Work!,This show was hilarious
Cells at Work!,I will never forgive Gainax for what they did in the finale. God fucking damn it. I'm pissed years later.
Cells at Work!,"Damnit how did i forget about this show? If I had to replace a show on my list with Space Brothers, it'd probably be Kill la Kill or Death Parade."
Cells at Work!,Agreed. Every anime fan needs more Jojo!
Cells at Work!,"Since you've seem Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo, the logical next step is to see Space Dandy made by the same director. Where Cowboy Bebop was jazz and Samurai Champloo was hip hop, Space Dandy is disco/funk. It's also a lot weirder than the other two, but in a good way."
Cells at Work!,"My main recs would be Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu and Ping Pong the Animation. You could also maybe try Death Parade, Erased, Katanagatari, Natsume's Book of Friends, Shinsekai Yori, and The Tatami Galaxy."
Cells at Work!,"It's from the 90s but it basically takes the cake when it comes to throwing anime tropes on their head: Neon Genesis Evangelion.  Giant robots fighting giant... ""monsters"" plus depression."
Cells at Work!,"A little late but I would recommend these. parasyte, banana fish, Durarara, psycho pass, and dororo which is airing me but is very good."
Cells at Work!,"Watch kids on the slope, same person who did bebop Anh champloo"
Tree With Deep Roots,This show desperately needs an HD remaster.
Tree With Deep Roots,Weyoun 4.
Tree With Deep Roots,"Watching through the best bits of the show again right now. Currently on Season 5.

The show is still a masterpiece. Characterization is great, everyone has shades of gray. Pretty much all the characters grow and change significantly during the show. You have story arcs that span seasons, flashback episodes covering the occupation, and excellent action episodes around the various wars.

Many episodes are poignant, thought-provoking, and/or touching.

By far the best Trek series for me."
Tree With Deep Roots,"lol She was great. Forgot how good all the beeps and sound effects were in DS9, theyre soothing"
Tree With Deep Roots,"what a show, still in my top five ever. Loved every character, even the ultra boring discount Fiennes Vedek Bareil"
Tree With Deep Roots,Best Trek there is. I can’t believe people don’t like the ending. Sisko owed them that and more!
Tree With Deep Roots,"This info about the Jem Hadar is meant to make them seem badass. But it really reveals a crippling weakness in their military design: almost nobody is all that experienced. A Star Fleet battle commander might have 40 years of experience.. across hundreds of situations and facing numerous types of enemy.  JH: We can fight at age 3 days. Yeah, I'm sure you're super effective knowing absolutely nothing and having practiced using no weapons, tools, ships, gear or studying the enemy."
Tree With Deep Roots,"Sadly, that's a lot more difficult because DS9 was the first Trek show to extensively use CGI. So it wouldn't just be a matter of rescanning the original film and reediting it (already not a simple task), but many of the space battles would have to be remodeled. Some of the assets involved might even have to be rebuilt from scratch, due to changes in technology. 

They did a few scenes for the documentary ""What We Left Behind,"" which looked great, but it was apparently expensive."
Tree With Deep Roots,The TNG remaster didn't really sell that well so that ship is sailed
Tree With Deep Roots,"Eh. I'm old enough to have watched when originally broadcast, but recently bit the bullet and did a full rewatch a couple of years back.  

After awhile I didn't really care about the fact that it wasn't remastered.  DS9 is a masterpiece as-is, as far as I'm concerned.  TNG, DS9, Strange New Worlds, Voyager and fuck everything else except for TOS."
Tree With Deep Roots,Unofficial ones exist.
Tree With Deep Roots,When AI gets good enough you'll see all these older show get remasters en masse.
Tree With Deep Roots,Fun fact: Jeffrey Combs was so good in this role that they invented the concept of the Vorta all being clones specifically to justify bringing him back after they'd already killed his character.
Tree With Deep Roots,"> everyone has shades of gray

That is the best thing in shows. That's why I loved Stargate: Universe so much. Everyone was grey, there were no black/white characters. Black/white is such boring storytelling to me. Unrealistic."
Tree With Deep Roots,Nothing like [warp core sounds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oobIAEhXuU) to soothe the soul.
Tree With Deep Roots,"They're bred to know how to fight, so they can already shoot, punch, and strategise by day 3, which was shown in one DS9 episode. Their limited age is also a control mechanism: by dying earlier, there's less of a chance of them rebelling against the Founders. They remain loyal for the duration of their short lives and never question orders because they never have to learn that questioning orders might be in their favour. 

It's important to remember that everything the Founders built into the Dominion was about controlling solids. The Vorta were originally marsupials living in trees that were genetically altered to serve the Founders and the Jem'Hadar were made chemically depedent on ketracel white to the point where they would die without it. The Jem'Hadar not living long was a feature, not a bug."
Tree With Deep Roots,if I were a billionaire I'd bankroll the hell out of it
Tree With Deep Roots,Selling them for 80 bucks a season might well have had something to do with that.
Tree With Deep Roots,A DS9 remaster is probably the one thing that could get me to sub to Paramount+.
Tree With Deep Roots,I was hesitant about SNW and i still cant believe how good it was. Every episode I was afraid it eas gonna fall off the rails and it just didnt. I love anson mount and ethan peck
Tree With Deep Roots,Lousy upscales don’t count.
Tree With Deep Roots,"Only of certain episodes and scenes, right? No one's ever done the whole series afaik"
Tree With Deep Roots,AI upscales suck ass
Tree With Deep Roots,"That's not going to happen till someone figures out how to train the AI to understand 2D pictures as 3D scenes. Without this, all sorts of weird 2D artifacts will constantly pop up everywhere."
Tree With Deep Roots,"He was great on DS9.  I loved him in The Frighteners, too."
Tree With Deep Roots,"Jeffrey Combs is by far the most underrated Trek actor. He played at least three different iconic characters (Weyoun, Brunt [FCA], and Shran), plus a bunch of others, but was never a main cast member.

Wikipedia says Shran might have become a main character if Enterprise had gotten a fifth season, and now I wish Enterprise had gotten a fifth season even more than I did before."
Tree With Deep Roots,"Got a hotspot on my damn tv because I put one of those 12 hour ""Engine Core"" youtube videos on in the background for a week straight before bed. Then I figured out how to turn the tv screen off and leave the volume on. Ahhhhhhhh yeah. Soothing."
Tree With Deep Roots,"Punching is actually not that useful in a galaxy that has beams and torpedoes that destroy ships with thousands of troops on them in a few hits. And, ya know, guns. 

I didn't get the sense the Jem Hadar were all that loyal, at least not as we were told. In fact, Weyoun even admits this outright the ep that we meet him. If they were so loyal, there'd be no need for the White. But there is a need, isn't there? And we see entire units of Jem Hadar that did rebel in two separate episodes. On two other occasions we see JH defy their orders/superiors and do what they want. 

*The Jem'Hadar not living long was a feature, not a bug.*

Yes, I know. But that doesn't mean it was a sensible feature to add. It wasn't. It was fantastically stupid and self-defeating. Even in the 21st century, you don't win wars with legions of inexperienced, ignorant brutalists who are great at punching and stabbing or even shooting. Effective militaries of advanced societies have commanders that are experienced, knowledgeable, educated, and part of a free society that encourages and rewards independent thinking, creative solutions, etc., It has troops that are trained and taught by those with decades of experience. It ensures loyalty by having a society that values and nourishes them, respects and supports them.. not enslaves and degrades. The Dominion likes to take the long view, what happens over centuries or millennia. You know what inevitably happens to societies like the Dominion over time? They self-destruct like Soviet Russia, or weaken and shrivel into irrelevant, obsolete isolates like NK.   


The Ketracel White is also an exercise in incredible stupidity. The Dominion obviously has to produce this stuff, and produce it in absolutely massive quantities. The Dominion has to protect these factories at all costs... if their enemy takes them out, it's game over. I wonder who would be defending these facilities? Oh yes, we know, Jem Hadar would. All it would take to massively imperil the Dominion is one rogue JH group to take control of a facility, raid its warehouses, or destroy it out of spite. The White makes the Dominion more fragile, not stronger. Because the founders are arrogant morons who apparently have cultural PTSD. Right up to the very end they're convinced of nonsense about ""solids"" that isn't true, despite their massive and completely effective espionage and infiltration.. they remain ignorant fools, unable to understand the most basic things about the solids."
Tree With Deep Roots,Wait seriously?
Tree With Deep Roots,"There’s a full edition that’s AI-upscaled that isn’t horrible, but since it just used the existing releases as the source it can’t be as good as the scenes that the *What We Left Behind* remastered by getting the original film out of storage."
Tree With Deep Roots,Re-Animator.
Tree With Deep Roots,"I loved him on Star Trek Enterprise.  Whenever he is in Star Trek, he brings this magical charm."
Tree With Deep Roots,"It's hard to call him underrated when he's so rightfully celebrated across the fandom. Still, any credit headed his way is deserved, pinkskin."
Tree With Deep Roots,He was also the guy who Jonathan Frakes beat out for the role of Commander Riker on The Next Generation.
Tree With Deep Roots,"> cultural PTSD

Well, yes. That's the point. The Founders distrusted all solids and quite literally wanted to subjugate the galaxy. They're not thinking of it from a 'hey, maybe we should give Jem'Hadar the ability to think because they'll be better strategists if they learn' because, to them, that's giving solids the keys to the Founders' downfall. All solids weren't to be trusted and had to be controlled.

It's also fair to say that the few Jem'Hadar who rebelled, much like that one that had mutated to no longer need ketracel white, were the minority. They killed their own over disloyalty. 

It's not stupid to the Founders, and that's why they ended up losing: they underestimated the Federation, Klingons, Romulans, etc."
Tree With Deep Roots,"That was the original retail price, they went on sale for about 40 or 30 pretty quickly after release, but if you wanted to be a fan who supported the project, yeah, you were paying absurd prices at first."
Tree With Deep Roots,"I guess it isn't cheap, or they thought superfans would pay it.

Either way I think the whole thing failed for them the second they were put on Netflix and company and no one had to pay those insane prices at all, even if at streaming quality."
Tree With Deep Roots,Perhaps. But he is extremely underrated as an actor in general.
Tree With Deep Roots," *that's giving solids the keys to the Founders' downfall.* 

Yeah, except that they did that anyway. They did that the very second they decided their entire security and military apparatus would be 100% dependent on solids. You can't have it both ways. You can't have a force that is incredibly powerful and sentient and also have a force that can never harm you. That isn't how reality works. 

*were the minority.*

Probably so. But this might not matter at all. The Dominion uses several control mechanisms we see: genetic programming, hardcore indoctrination/socialization (""victory is life""), and ketracel white. You know why lots of mechanisms are necessary in the Dominion, but not necessary in, say, Star Fleet? Because the threat of loss of control is very real- and that's according to the Dominion itself. The problem is all of these mechanisms can and do fail. It makes no difference at all if it's a minority of troops because the Dominion has made itself so incredible vulnerable in many ways. It has a centralized population apparently on a single world. A single Dominion dreadnought, taken over by rebels even momentarily could annihilate the entire Link in minutes. A single group of rogue JH could destroy a White factory or warehouse... which then leads to a shortage, which leads to thousands or millions of troops being executed or going mad and turning on the Dominion. And since the Dominion decided to invade and make enemies of nearly every humanoid race in the galaxy, guess who's coming to pay a visit when catastrophe weakens their military strength? Everyone. 

*It's not stupid to the Founders,*

Nothing is foolish and self-destructive to the person or people who choose it. That doesn't mean it wasn't foolish and self-destructive. Hitler thought invading the USSR was a great idea. Japan thought bombing the US and half the pacific was a shrewd move.  They each had their reasons. They were still incredibly stupid or ignorant or both for not understanding the consequences of their actions of important facts about their situation and other civilizations."
Tree With Deep Roots,">It's not stupid to the Founders, and that's why they ended up losing: they underestimated the Federation, Klingons, Romulans, etc.

And the prophets, tbf. They were instrumental in hamstringing the Dominion."
Tree With Deep Roots,Very much agree. And also mad that he's not had a new character in the present live action shows. He could play an older Shran or his son in SNW!
Tree With Deep Roots,"True. Though this is a bit just to further that story element and Sisko character development, not really an organic narrative element of the Dominion war. That said, the Dominion still would have lost. You simply can't wage war against an entire quadrant. Imagine 30 different worlds all locked in an existential battle, all of them working together and pouring R&D and resources into anti-dominion tech and weapons. The Dominion couldn't even manage to control Cardassia, a single race. Rebellion and sabotage bloodied its nose and tripped it up. They resorted to genocide, but this is a losing strategy.. you're destroying an economic base of billions meanwhile your enemies are deploying their own resources in full."
Tree With Deep Roots,Lmao how does he keep a straight face doing these takes
Tree With Deep Roots,[deleted]
Tree With Deep Roots,That's Timothy... He's my friend.
Tree With Deep Roots,I love how every sea creature he has interacted with has died lol
Tree With Deep Roots,The latest YouTube video about him is fucking hilarious. Real eyes realise real lies
Tree With Deep Roots,As a cowboys fan I think it’s so funny that he’s Tony Romo’s brother in law lol I can imagine Tony asking him about work and Chase is like “I fucked a variety of sea creatures so” and Tony is like “….got it”
Tree With Deep Roots,"> This isn't even mentioning the fact that he has a fetish for sea creatures that can't very well consent to his fantasies.

Isn’t he able to talk to sea creatures? It was very clear to me that it was all consensual."
Tree With Deep Roots,"Give

Him

A

Speedo

You

Cowards"
Tree With Deep Roots,">This isn't even mentioning the fact that he has a fetish for sea creatures that can't very well consent to his fantasies.

Isn't his whole deal that he can talk to fish? Hell, the dolphin distracted him by asking for a handy while he was breaking him out of the sea park."
Tree With Deep Roots,"My problem with the writers is they're terrified of killing anybody of note

Maeve and A-Train should've died and it would've been fine

I'm sure they're gonna do another fake out death with Noir too"
Tree With Deep Roots,"The Deep is not deep.  That's the joke.  He's dumb, he's shallow, he's easily manipulated.  His entire persona is a contradiction of his name.  Like a tall guy named Shorty or a bald man named Curly.  His ""arc"" is what-dumbass-thing-can-this-dumbass-do-to-mess-this-up?"
Tree With Deep Roots,Fuck Fresca
Tree With Deep Roots,You know.. I'm always so torn about the characters where the actor is so good at acting that they turn an evil character into some one you viscerally hate!  Like the boy who did Joffrey in GoT.. You hate them because the actor did such a good job at playing the role.  You get this mixed feelings.. like you want to like the person for being a good actor but you hate their character because they were a good actor...  You both like and hate the same person!
Tree With Deep Roots,Would be hilarious if The Deep delivered the final blow to Homalander during the inevitable 7 V 1 end fight. Hughie and Butcher will be 2 of the 7
Tree With Deep Roots,He’s the writer’s punching bag. And I’m ok with that.
Tree With Deep Roots,Now they are in too deep
Tree With Deep Roots,"I know The Deep is a fan favorite because ethe actor is loved by everyone in the show, but the writers absolutely don't know what to do with his character in-show. 

He's literally just there. That's it. His whole ""redemption"" arc was shown to play a huge role in S2, but it was reduced to a couple of scenes of him bickering with his wife here and there. 

The writers don't even know how to utilize his power anymore. I really thought his character was going to get killed in season 3 because he had zero role in that season, but he just survives somehow. 

I guess the show likes having him as a clown and a punching bag for jokes instead of actually bothering to write something good for him."
Tree With Deep Roots,"Now if they could just dial back the frequency with which Hughie says he's sorry, that would be great."
Tree With Deep Roots,"I still kinda wish they updated the jokes.  ""lol aquaman has silly powers"" feels like a super old, super worn out joke.

The ""real"" aquaman already made the same observations, and switched up the character to Biker Merman played by Jason Momoa.  The Boys should be riffing on THAT version.

Have The Deep show up with tattoos, heavy eyeliner, long hair, leather jacket, etc... and slowly reveal that its all a facade to battle his insecurities.  Oh, and the leather jacket is faux-leather, of course, because The Deep still loves animals.  (or maybe it's genuine leather because fuck land-animals)"
Tree With Deep Roots,He's funny but the jokes really got repetitive this season. He's a pushover. He fucks sea creatures. Sea creatures die on him. We get it.
Tree With Deep Roots,"His first main story point was being a rapist. After that, they wrote him as comic relief. It's very strange."
Tree With Deep Roots,He's funny but I feel like he gets way too much screentime. All of the jokes are starting to feel repetitive. Feel like the writers don't know what to do with him.
Tree With Deep Roots,Ironically he is the shittiest character in the series.
Tree With Deep Roots,"I hate the deep and I look forward to the day Starlight ends his fish fucking life.   

The actor is charming for sure,  but the chararcter is a soggy shitheel."
Tree With Deep Roots,"One thing the article says that I disagree with is that the deep has unconsentual sex with animals.

He can talk to them and the one scene in the third season where the octopus joins in does seem like that it's a willing participant.

He also clearly cares for sea animals more than humans, he just seems to have invested so much of himself into being homelanders pet. Like his identity relies on it.

No redemption for the deep but I reckon he will have an arc of sorts."
Tree With Deep Roots,The deep is my favorite character.
Tree With Deep Roots,"""he has a fetish for sea creatures that can't very well consent to his fantasies.""

What the hell? They can, and they do!

Watch the show FFS! He can fucking talk to them!

Damn idiot article writer."
Tree With Deep Roots,"I just learned about the Vought International youtube channel and they have a bunch of clips of The Deep - fuck man, the actor is amazing. Pauses, stutters, tone.....really impressed. 

The character's an idiot but the actor is a treasure."
Tree With Deep Roots,"Reddit already turning on this show is also hilarious, happens every time something gets popular.

The Boys subreddit is a complete shitshow, it got so bad; they had to put out statements talking about victim blaming rape victims as well as addressing Homelander's 'fans'.

Media literacy really needs to be taught in schools tbh, because I keep seeing people going 'BACK TO STATUS QUO NOTHING HAS CHANGED'. If you think nothing has changed in S3, then you're just stupid."
Tree With Deep Roots,Makes sense. He is the hottest.
Tree With Deep Roots,"I honestly thought he was going to have a character arc when it came to season 2, one that involved him becoming a good person. 

This season showed just how much that fame and power corrupts and just how much of a douche The Deep is."
Tree With Deep Roots,"Chace Crawford doesn’t get enough credit for 1. Portraying a coward perfectly, and 2. Being in really good shape for this role"
Tree With Deep Roots,"The Deep is a total piece of shit, but Chace Crawford is very charismatic."
Tree With Deep Roots,Honestly I would have written off Chase as some dipshit from Gossip Girl. Turns out dude is hilarious and incredibly talented.
Tree With Deep Roots,He r*ped someone in the first ep so there is no tasteful redemption they can do. The most you can do is make him entertaining and then have him meet a grissly end
Tree With Deep Roots,Chace Crawford crushes the performance. His look back when they're doing the reality show.
Tree With Deep Roots,Don’t get me wrong I love the boys but this whole article seems pointless. Literally just several paragraphs to say “chase is funny”
Tree With Deep Roots,"I don’t mind this type of favouritism. 

I do mind the type that makes a character like Soldier Boy morally ambiguous when we are consistently told he’s a piece of shit. 

Imo Kripke is too close to Ackles to write him as being too bad of a guy."
Tree With Deep Roots,Sounds like they're Rolling in the Deep
Tree With Deep Roots,So having a character be one-punch joke that became stale a season ago is playing favourites? What happens to characters they don't like
Tree With Deep Roots,"They've probably taken him as far as the character can go.

The writers should have the Deep echo Ezra Miller's crazy antics. 

 Make him get in fights with fans at bars in Hawaii, have him try to groom a teen, remove him from the 7, and throw him in jail"
Tree With Deep Roots,"If there's one ""problem"" I have with this show is the stakes are very low because they can't/are unwilling to kill off popular characters or good actors, unlike the comic where characters drop like flies."
Tree With Deep Roots,The Deep and A-Train both feel like dead weight on this show.
Tree With Deep Roots,He’s probably the one character I don’t know how they end his arch when the shows over
Tree With Deep Roots,Soldier Boy can't say a line while the deep is out here fucking octopuses
Tree With Deep Roots,I almost threw up in the episode with the talking gills. 🤮
Tree With Deep Roots,Dude is like a lab experiment where they mixed the genes of Brad Pitt and Ryan Reynolds.
Tree With Deep Roots,"“Real eyes realise Real Lies”

-The Deep"
Tree With Deep Roots,"Lovable, moronic sociopath."
Tree With Deep Roots,You gotta love the character for being so deep
Tree With Deep Roots,Garth Ennis wrote a far better story
Tree With Deep Roots,"Hilarious, the Deep gets better every season. I can’t wait to see what insane shit they come up for him."
Tree With Deep Roots,So happy this dude has had a bit of a positive resurgence from this show. Felt like the was always more than just a pretty face in gossip girl.
Tree With Deep Roots,Anyone other then me who thinks he looks like stiffler?
Tree With Deep Roots,"Dude's a swimbo, is all I'm saying."
Tree With Deep Roots,This dude is a rapist and is into beastiality Of course it’s Hollywood writers favorite character. Dude is a piece of shit.
Tree With Deep Roots,He’s my favorite character of the show so that’s awesome. Absolutely hilarious situations with him.
Tree With Deep Roots,"Deep is the Joffrey of this show. He’s so despicable, but the actor is on the fucking money"

Kulipari: Dream Walker,">And Rip seriously thinks he is the good guy

Does he? I seem to remember him CONSTANTLY saying that he is not a good man. Did I miss something?"
Kulipari: Dream Walker,It’s a prime time soap opera
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"This show is a non-cowboy’s idea of what it’s like to be a cowboy, told through the genre of soap opera. Nothing at all about it is authentic to real rural western life."
Kulipari: Dream Walker,I watched a couple episodes and decided it wasn't for me. It's one of my grandma's favorite shows though and I did really enjoy 1883.
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"I'm Canadian, not even close to being a ""republican"" in politics or morality. 

But my wife and I enjoy this shoe and it's related shows...including Tulsa King.

It's TV. Sometimes simplistic drama, with pretty aesthetics is all you need.

But I'm only speaking for myself, and Yellowstone et al, is a nice wind down show.

Not everything is a pulitizer or Emmy winner, and that's ok"
Kulipari: Dream Walker,It took me half an hour to realise there wasn't going to be any volcanoes in episode 1. I am not a smart man.
Kulipari: Dream Walker,Sons of anarchy with horses.
Kulipari: Dream Walker,I never understood why people watch TV/movies they despise so passionately.  Why do you put yourself through the torture?
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"I don’t think cowboy wet dream, more like fake macho masculinity ideal wet dream"
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"My father was a true cowboy- he grew up on a ranch riding horses and working cattle all through his childhood.

He can barely make it through a show with all the exaggerated events and falsities."
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"Wait, aren't they supposed to be unlikable? I pretty much unlike every main character, they are despicable and contradict themselves in their own ways but that's the point no? Anyway I love the show."
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"Ok, so let’s hear more about Jamie actually being John Dutton’s son.  What are you basing that off of?  Did I miss something?"
Kulipari: Dream Walker,I’ve thought about watching the spin-off with Harrison Ford. Is it any good?
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"I'm not a cowboy and I love this show, it's awesome.  The flawed yet relatable characters are the best part."
Kulipari: Dream Walker,You’re overthinking it man haha. It’s a guilty pleasure of a show where you can get shot in one episode and get into a fist fight the next. It doesn’t make sense and really doesn’t need to. It’s got all the shit you’ve mentioned along with good scenery and cinematography.
Kulipari: Dream Walker,Yellowstone is lifestyle porn.
Kulipari: Dream Walker,Clearly you know zero cowboys. Most of them hate the show. You’re thinking of rich people who like to pretend they’re cowboys.
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"To the people that say: ""Have you seen Yellowstone? No, OMG ITZ so freaking good. Its the best TV show ever.""  - I CANNOT UNDERSTAND! (I will forever question their logic)

However, its a very MID tier show that is entertaining."
Kulipari: Dream Walker,Haha I bet you’re fun at parties.
Kulipari: Dream Walker,Just living in Montana I hate this show more than anything.
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"As someone in the horse industry, I really like what this show has done for interest in the cutting and cowhorse events. More interest, more people competing, more money to win...it's really a good thing.

I don't really care to watch it for anything other than the horses."
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"The show was watchable to me.  Wasn’t expecting anything life changing   The thing I find funny is the most hated people are Californians who come in and buy land while the Star, Costner, is a liberal
Californian that lives on a ranch he bought in Colorado."
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"The cheese of the show is what makes it fun and watchable, otherwise, any direction towards realism would make the show extremely boring because ranching typically don’t involve murder, shootouts, and political intrigue.

All the characters are terrible human beings, pretty much in line with shows like Seinfeld, It’s Always Sunny, or Sopranos. They’re all terrible human beings that you can’t help but root for.

If I had to guess what makes the show popular, is that it’s just fun escapism—the idea of this last frontier that’s devoid of urban problems can really resonate with anyone. There’s no need for woke-ism when the show established that most of the characters are terrible human beings. I’m not a gun-toting conservative, but I still watch the show and enjoy it for what it is, and I think the show runners are self-aware and understand this."
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"Yellowstone is a show about a family of murderous thugs, who operate an anti-corporatist, eco-terrorist, organized crime ring. 

Republicans seem to think of them as the heroes of the story mostly because they wear cowboy hats and ride horses.

I enjoy the show but it’s definitely slid from something I look forward to each week into a guilty pleasure soap experience."
Kulipari: Dream Walker,It’s Sons of Anarchy for horse girls
Kulipari: Dream Walker,Rip is hot AF.
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"The show is fantastic. I mean I cannot imagine watching 5 seasons of a show and typing out a 8 paragraph review of the most watched cable TV show only for the entire review to be shitting all over it. 

Really makes me wonder what is on the air right now that the OP thinks is good TV."
Kulipari: Dream Walker,The fact that you had to write a novel just to say you “hate” a TV show means it has you interested in more ways than one… 🤷🏻‍♂️
Kulipari: Dream Walker,I feel like it’s cowboys if it was the mafia because these people aren’t good people from what I’ve seen at all
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"Nothing about native Americans living in the Yellowstone area after a hundred years of white man telling us they didn’t, love white representstion"
Kulipari: Dream Walker,Tried watching the pilot episode and made it through...barely. I was laughing at how one dimensional and terrible the characters were by the end of that single episode. I could not even imagine trying to sit through a season. How this show is lauded by anyone is beyond me.
Kulipari: Dream Walker,1882 was good. Yellowstone seems like am expensive soap opera
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"They tried to make a southerner/midwestern godfather but failed to kill the main character (Kevin Costner) because he’s too popular of an actor. If they killed him off at the end of season 1 it would have been a perfect set up to a shit show power grab by everyone. But I’m guessing it was network interference that stopped that. 

It’s a real shame because I watched a few episodes with my grandfather and enjoyed it, but now Ive actually taken the time to watch it and it’s so repetitive I couldn’t finish it."
Kulipari: Dream Walker,It’s Game of Thrones: Montana.
Kulipari: Dream Walker,It's 'Sons of Anarchy' with horses... Just enjoy it for what it is... Have a feeling it won't end well for most of them
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"As I've mentioned previously, I really enjoy the actual cowboyin that went on in previous seasons, especially with Jimmy. But newer season are hot garbage in writing and the acting, besides a few members, seems like it's just trying to ruin the show. It's basically just turned Dallas with guns. Ryan Bingham stays the best part of the show."
Kulipari: Dream Walker,I don’t think many *actual* cowboys (or rural folks in general) really like the show. I know for a fact that the people in the region it portrays range from extreme dislike to a casual eye roll - but not any that I’m aware of like the show.
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"Jamie is not Alexa Carrington. If they'd set him up as a bad guy once for whatever reason, and let him take a fall, knocked him down a few pegs and let him redeem himself in whatever way, it'd be better than whatever this is. What gets me is that Jamie shouldn't be as stupid as he's written. And didn't he get back with the mother of his child? I guess not.

I'm also wondering after all these generations, why there aren't more Duttons out there. Let one of them come and be a villain... for a half season or so.

I saw 1883 first, and I enjoyed it, and I have hopes for 1923."
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"Wyomingite here, and I can’t name a single real cowboy I know that watches that shit, or name one thing on that show that reflects western/ranching life out here other than maybe roping and bunk house shit."
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"It’s literally Sons of Anarchy on horses. Not that I have a problem with either show, but the similarities between them are pretty obvious. I mean same writer and all. He just traded the cut in for a brand and Harleys for hoses. Still both are great dramas and I enjoy them, but they are a lot alike."
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"Personally prefer 1883.

There’s a reason why Yellowstone is very popular though. It appeals to two very distinct and extremes:

A) second amendment gun loving doomsday seekers

B) tech bros from the east and west coast that dream of one day having a ranch"
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"The show, and spinoffs, is creator Taylor Sheridan living out his cowboy fantasies...to the point that he took his Yellowstone paycheck and purchased the 6666 Ranch, where he's setting yet another spinoff. 

Guy is living his cowboy dream, and we're all watching it and paying for it"
Kulipari: Dream Walker,Sounds about as well written as Sons of Anarchy to me.
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"EDIT: A commenter said its inauthentic to real western life so its for people unfamiliar with it. I grew up with cowboy relatives so that might be it.

I kept hearing it's the most- watched show so I watched a few episodes last month. I'm not into  westerns, and I so far dislike every character. It doesn't seem very different from Sons of Anarchy and so on, it just has pretty scenery. At least that was my impression. Don't feel like continuing it."
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"I bailed on this show because of how weirdly it treated Jamie. In season 1 he was ok then in season 2 they made him a pathetic sniveling mess who was scared of Beth. In season 1, Jamie and Beth’s relationship was fun and Jamie was allowed to tell Beth to fuck off.

Then I hear he is adopted and I have seen fans of that show use it as an excuse for why he is the bad guy and “not really family”. Adopted kids are still family wtf?

Anyways, justice for Jamie."
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"YouTube has been feeding me clips of the show for a few weeks now, and I know my brother and grandpa who are both right leaning love the show.  

From the little I've seen which is probably about 10 clips, it looks like this is a manufactured power fantasy for rural states, that rugged individualist, pull yourself up by your bootstrap but don't you dare infringe on me and what I have ideals of the once wild west. It's unrealistic, but not more so than Friends being able to afford those apartments in NYC. 

For me it gives me a hero I don't want, it wants me to look up to Costner and his rough crew for being 'hard working' but a lot of this comes across as the TV patting someone else on the back for not living near a major city. Often people are right because they win a fight, I saw a 'good guy with a gun' scene which would have gotten innocent people shot in real life, and I've seen grandstanding several times about the softness of everyone else vs. how they are. 

But I know people love it so I assume they watch The West Wing with the same uneasy feeling I do watching Yellowstone."
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"Couldn't agree more with this review, most overhyped show of the decade"
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"I really, really, REALLY tried with this show and the prequels, but something about the story just felt off.  I really struggled to get invested in any of the characters.  Eventually abandoned it for other shows, just wasn’t for me, but clearly it works for others."
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"Hot take: you just like hating popular thing to make yourself feel superior. Your criticism is incredibly superficial and shows you did not spend much time actually considering the show. 

A lot of Republicans got brought to the show by their hip, liberal relatives, only to be outraged by a lot of the show’s content."
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"Essentially it’s Sopranos for those who have “Live, Laugh, Love” on their wall in their home."
Kulipari: Dream Walker,Don’t you know Kayce was in the military from the first episode? It goes downhill the more over the top it gets though.
Kulipari: Dream Walker,It’s a soap opera for your maga aunt and uncle. It’s a platter to serve truck commercials on. It’s Costner doing what he does best…act badly. It’s pure schlock.
Kulipari: Dream Walker,It's a show for people who want simple melodrama on a ranch. It's soap opera quality with a budget for people who don't want to think about what they are watching. There's no nuance in any character.
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"It's become ""hip"" to hate Yellowstone on this sub, that's when you know a show has reached true mainstream popularity"
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"The show is incredible, you’re just wrong.

How can you say Beth is unsympathetic when her dying mother told her she was weak before her last breath and her brother caused her infertility without her consent?

Rips character, and yearning for approval of a father that will never be blood son is a great starting point for a character.

And your saying a western gets a little sappy sometimes when love interests are involved… YOU DONT SAY 🙄

Taylor Sheridan is the modern day western writer and anything he touches is at *least* good, but IMO great."
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"Couldn’t get through half of season one. Loved 1883 and so far 1923. 
Edit to change date because I’m a pinecone. Lol."
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"I started watching this show last week, and finally caught up last night.  I think it's a really good show although some of the story is far-fetched."
Kulipari: Dream Walker,I call it “Sopranos with Saddles”.
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"I find the writing of Yellowstone dreadful. Watched first two series hoping it would come good. Binged 1883 in the summer, loved it. Almost unbelievable the same guy wrote both lol"
Kulipari: Dream Walker,Does it confuse anyone else that Beth drives a Bentley? A pretentious British sports car and not an American muscle car or truck.
Kulipari: Dream Walker,I finished season one already.  It's a bit like a country Boardwalk Empire
Kulipari: Dream Walker,I just want the family to lose everything.   Rainwater seems alright so if the Native Americans end up with the land I wouldn’t mind.   Otherwise let anyone but this family keep ownership of the ranch land.
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"show is hilarious, I just can't understand how anyone can take it seriously. Maybe you Americans do since you practically live in a movie, but it's probably the same for you when you watch something like Downton Abbey (which is, it had to be said, total fantasyland even for us)"
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"This is not a western or cowboy genre. Its a soap opera with a country aesthetic. And any other show everyone would be tripping over themselves to praise the dark tone and morally grey characters like in Breaking Bad or Peaky Blinders or Walking Dead or GOT, but because people (mostly redditors) have the mistaken idea that this is somehow a right leaning wet dream they suddenly dont like it.

Turns out most normal people like morally grey people no matter the lens. These characters are anti-heroes. Did you get similarly mad at the Sopranos?

Your dislike is noted, the rest is a thinky veiled attack against your perceived political enemies.

I do feel like watching some Cowboy or Chanbara cinema right nos though, so thanks for that"
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"I know no one likes Beth, but hear me out. When Monica was accused of stealing because she was American Indian and calls Beth. She was eager to bust that store to shit. I’ve been accused of stealing because of the way I look and I wish I had a Beth to call. I had my purse poured out and was patted down. It was humiliating. Yeah, I would have called her, no question."
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"Recently watched season 5 episode 1, and just the amount of ""Us vs them,"" and some of the heavy right wing style dialogue from the Duttons really kinda killed it for me. "" Go back to your own state you fucking babies,"""
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"Yeah, it's a great show."
Kulipari: Dream Walker,It's Grey's Anatomy with cowboy hats.
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"Its Dynasty rip-off for conservative white republican where white billionare killing people, branding people as cattle and doing what ever he wants, while crying about canceling him (governor) on land his grand grand father promised to give back to Native Americans in 1883 series.

there is also Beth will plot armor bigger than Yellowstone itself"
Kulipari: Dream Walker,So it's for Republicans
Kulipari: Dream Walker,It’s a little bit r/conservative + a lot r/iamverybadass
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"It’s republican rage porn. And to top it off, it’s written by liberals. It’s what liberals think republicans want to see: stuff/people they hate getting what they deserve. I work in construction in a major city and all my republican co-workers loved Yellowstone because they all saw themselves as the people who work on the ranch. Well, I actually am from a rural part of the mountains in Colorado and I can relate to Kevin Costumer’s character resenting the disconnected city people coming up and treating his land like it’s theirs. I had to inform my republican co-workers that they were more like the bikers from California than the country people they idolize."
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"Amen, I’ll not say the show is complete trash but I have been saying for a while now it’s overrated. You’re exactly right about the writing being weak. There’s a sequence where the Monica chick gets put into a coma, by a stray punch, from a junior high kid. Then Kayce and the little kid start a fight in the damn hospital waiting room with nurses doing their job!?!?!? I seriously felt like I was watching Days of our Lives. Good stuff OP."
Kulipari: Dream Walker,dang bro idk why you got downvoted so much for giving a tv show a chance
Kulipari: Dream Walker,I don't think you know that much about cowboys.
Kulipari: Dream Walker,I love this show because its mere popularity pisses some people off. LOL
Kulipari: Dream Walker,It's funny how liberals complain about everything if a show doesn't fit into their worldview.  Just move the fuck on and watch Drag Queens or whatever piques your interest
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"We get it, you don't like the political views the show's protagonist has. Stop making posts about it. The majority of the website already agrees with you.

If I made a post about how the show sucks because it's ""STRONK WOMAN! - The show"" you'd probably bend over backwards to defend it. Every 'faction' is headed by a mastermind woman while the men are either bumbling morons or oblivious to anything outside of their own small bubble."
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"Is this considered that new genre named this year, the dad show ?"
Kulipari: Dream Walker,1883 is good though.
Kulipari: Dream Walker,Sounds like it’s not a show for you.
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"Too much cowboy life this season, the show needs to spend more time on the plot."
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"I didn’t like the show much after a few episodes. So I stopped watching it. It was a crazy idea, but it worked."
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"Beth and Jamie are terrible characters, especially after the ""clinic"" storyline which reeks of forced writing to basically eliminate any shades of gray to both characters. The writers Arya Starked Beth to the point where she is totally uninteresting now. 

Great cast, beautifully shot, awful writing. First 2 seasons were solid, but bad since. It's shocking to hear people compare this show to like The Sopranos. If you want a great Western show/miniseries, you'd do better with Godless or Hatfields and McCoys."
Kulipari: Dream Walker,I couldn’t get into it. It’s basically Melrose Place on a horse.
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"I tried to give this show a chance just to have some filler TV, but there was so much violence towards animals in the first couple episodes i had to stop. from the first episode opening with Kevin Costner having to put down a horse to the injured dog crawling away from a house explosion (that’s when i tapped out), it was just not something i was able to enjoy.

edit: lmao yeah fuck me 👍"
Kulipari: Dream Walker,I'd imagine most cowboys think it's really lame
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"Honestly, If you think everyone who watches this show and views it the same way you do, then I have some bad news for you. My dad watches it and almost all the positive messaging people are echoing in here is lost on him. He think all the main characters are ""good guys"" and even worse, now he thinks California=bad. He's not politically savvy so he before this, he didn't even know that as a republican you are supposed to hate California.

To anyone saying there isn't that much political messaging in the show is just being willfully ignorant to the fact. >!Right now John Dutton is the Governor of the state so of course were going to have politics in every episode.!< Not all the political messaging leans right but try to be aware that not everyone see's that messaging the same"
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"It's the West Wing for conservatives. Old white men going around being righteous and right.  The native Americans are villains, the biker gangs are from California, every real estate person is evil and wants to tear down half of Montana and turn it into mini malls.  Every woman is tough talking hottie who just wants to be snuggled by a cowboy.  Liberals are either outright villains or need saving by the common sense cowboys.  A lot like the Walking Dead - right wing fantasy camp."
Kulipari: Dream Walker,Lol I always say that the Duttons are a shit family.
Kulipari: Dream Walker,I like to tell people it’s “R rated Dallas”
Kulipari: Dream Walker,It's just so TACKY I've tried to watch the first episode and I could feel a maga hat just growing out of my head
Kulipari: Dream Walker,Yeah the part wear they humiliate the hippie chick over and over again is very cringe. Cowboys wet dream is a good analogy
Kulipari: Dream Walker,So iTs FoR  rEpUbLiCaNs RiGhT? The retarded left don't know anything else to say...
Kulipari: Dream Walker,Knew some people raving about yellowstone. Watched two episodes. Terrible. Now when someone I meet talks favorably of the show....
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"I just started watching the show…

And now I just stopped. Lol 😂 ruined it for myself."
Kulipari: Dream Walker,That whole show is aimed at the MAGA crowd. A dumb show for dumb people.
Kulipari: Dream Walker,It’s almost like you’ve never seen a tv show before.
Kulipari: Dream Walker,"cowboy.
Nope, doesn’t auto-capitalize. So why do you?"
Motown Magic,"Motown is a beautiful genre of music! It is really timeless music. Mostly because of the choruses.

It's quite catchy - ""You Make Me Feel Brand New"", ""Shop Around"",  ""Betcha By Golly Wow"", ""Please Mr. Postman"" etc. Way too many songs to put in a post etc.

And it's really cool how it started in Detroit. Making it music for anyone.

The genre could be revitalized today since the music's timeless."
The Final Table,"The ""there's no prize"" comment is absurd. The Most popular show in the UK is 'The Great British Baking Show"" or whatever its called, and it literally has no prize except a cheap looking trophy. No money. No promise of their own show or cookbook. But the winner's go on to make a name for themselves. Thats the same for this show. The chef that wins will be known and recognized by the world's greatest chefs and food critics. In the Chef world, that's gold. 

And I REALLY resent this show being compared to Masterchef or some drama filled show like hells kitchen. Those shows feature amateur chefs, while this show features professionals, some with Michelin stars. No one wants to watch Michelim starred chefs bickering. We want to watch them cook.

Anyways, I love this show. Already on the Italy episode :)"
The Final Table,">This brand-new culinary competition takes place in a soundstage on a spaceship that hovers above earth: sometimes over cities at twilight, and sometimes over the entire planet. At least, that’s what the giant wrap-around LED backdrop makes it look like.

Yes, the set is gorgeous. The lighting and camera work give a refined, classic look to the show. Even during the cuts to local areas and personal backgrounds, the cinematography retains the elegance of the studio scenes. I don't understand this person's objections at all. 

>Yet it’s hard to shake how much this casting and format comes across as a transparent Netflix mandate: *Make the show interesting to watch in other countries so more people will subscribe.* 

This is problematic why? Seeing people from other cultures is precisely what international cuisine is about! It's one of the unique strengths of modern culinary competitions, so leveraging that to *make the show interesting to watch* is a really good idea! 

>It's so long. 

There's so many chefs and so much going on in the kitchen that obviously it can't be condensed into 22 minutes. It seems like this critic doesn't care about the food at all. Is their attention span too poor to enjoy a longer cooking show without ad breaks to let them look at their phone?

>Lack of drama. 

I don't want divas in my kitchen shows. I come for the professionals who can do things I'd never even dreamed of, and I enjoy seeing them act professionally when pitted against one another. I suppose that's a personal taste, but the shouting and crying you get on some other cooking shows is a major turnoff for me. 

>The host. 

I admit, the host is lacklustre. I miss Alton Brown's piercing commentary. I think Iron Chef Gauntlet, which had Brown as commentary and judge, was perfect. But with such great chefs, merely adequate commentary is not enough to put me off of the show. 

>There's no prize. 

So what? The chefs are sincerely trying, so who cares if they get a million bucks or not? There's professional credibility on the line, and none of the contestants hold back, so the show does just fine without a concrete award at the end. 

tl;dr - this critic is a peasant with a provincial, proletariat palate. I'm enjoying The Final Table a lot. "
The Final Table,Personally I found the show good but the host needs to be replaced.  He’s emotionless and has an irritating voice. In my opinion at least. 
The Final Table,"Masterchef? These are James Beard and Michelin Star quality chefs, not home cooks. "
The Final Table,"Does anyone know if this was filmed in one day? First, their clothes never change until ep. 5 (I watched up to this.), second, the contestants look increasingly tired as the show goes on. "
The Final Table,I do not like they way this reviewer writes
The Final Table,I hated the finale. No disrespect to the winner. It just didn’t seem like his dish was the best. But well we’re not there to taste so maybe I am wrong. 
The Final Table,MasterChef US or MC UK or MC Australia? Because one is crap and another was nominated for an International Emmy and influenced the GBBO.
The Final Table,"Just finished the series. Overall it's good but the set is too unnecessarily extravagant and distracting at times. It would be been better without the crazy light show, elevating judging panel, annoying host and audience. "
The Final Table,Was anyone else pissed off when they kicked shin and Ronald because the judge didn’t like the presentation but enjoyed the plate.
The Final Table,"Omg. Within 10 minutes I can tell this show is a joke. No pinache, no draw, heavily scripted and very poorly executed. Is this created by American Ninja Warrior people? Lame on the highest of levels. "
The Final Table,"Yeah, crazy right? Only the time allotted to cook mounts up to 20h. They couldn’t have worked 20h+ straight though..."
The Final Table,[removed]
The Final Table,"I’m watching it now and the host is so obnoxious, and his voice isn’t suited to hosting. Otherwise it’s a great show! It’s a shame, the host is so boring"
The Final Table,">Those shows feature amateur chefs, while this show features professionals

This is the key. You're spot on. Hell's Kitchen contestants are basically line cooks from middle America. MasterChef contestants are all home cooks. The contestants on The Final Table are actually chefs. Real, professional, industry-respected, trained culinary artists. They are on a completely different level."
The Final Table,"Super old post, but what did you think of the eventual winner? Well deserved or no? It’s hard to compare dishes with editing and different technique "
The Final Table,I completely agree with your counter argument to the critic’s review. I think what I enjoy the most out of the show is that there is no drama. Everyone is polite and professional. 
The Final Table,"same, when I read till the part where the articles says the show is too long I stopped reading, I find it entertaining and is of enjoyable length. just downloaded two episodes to watch on my flight "
The Final Table,"Totally agree!  I really appreciate just how professional and talented these chefs are!  The multicultural approach to the cooking challenges, the focus on the food and the culture, and most of all the lack of drama are what keep me watching.  Loving it so far."
The Final Table,The original article was such a shitty review. I'm absolutely loving The Final Table for the reasons you mentioned above. Totally agree. 
The Final Table,"Couldn't agree more, especially with the parts about the drama and the international cast.

One of the things that I liked the most was seeing the Australian team getting more and more comfortable as the challenges passed, understanding the competition and somewhat 'breezing' through it: One of the things that I like about cooking reality shows with actual professionals. You can't hide that, these dudes are good, and they know it.

The winner was a bit of a WTF moment for me though"
The Final Table,"Thank you. I'm a big fan of cooking competitions focused on either skill or heart, without the drama. Netflix means you can tune in and out when you want, and if i can pick between 22 min including pre/post-commercial repeats, or one hour of competition; I'd pick the latter. 

After 5 min in it seems a bit too Xfactor-y for me but let's see.."
The Final Table,[deleted]
The Final Table,Same - he didn't make the show feel welcoming at all. 
The Final Table,I agree! Everything else about the show is wonderful but the host needs to change his way of presenting or be replaced. 
The Final Table,"At first I thought cringy 100%, now I've finished the season I think he's Annoying. It's his attitude, you can't hide something that's from the bottom of your self of how you treat people other times outside of the show. Just guessing that has something to do with his food critique editor job. I really disliked the way he questioned things or his terrible jokes wanna-bes...snobby aggressive irritating.

In the last few episodes I am not sure if it's true but I saw team Timothy and Darren, especially Darren was getting impatient whenever the host approached and you could feel they noticed that too and weren't enjoying the host much."
The Final Table,Yes agreed. I don’t know how he possibly got this job.
The Final Table,"He just keep repeating the same things whit a rather annoying voice.
Can't stand hin"
The Final Table,"I hate Masterchef for the very reason that casual viewers believe that the competitors are top chefs and doing super amazing things with food. I had such a long argument with my FIL over this, when he thought the height of culinary innovation was achieved by a chef who put mascarpone in their mac and cheese. Then I showed him Top Chef, Top Chef Masters, and Chef's Table, and he was blown away by how 'next level' cooking could be. 

It's offensive to compare the amazing chefs on Final Table to the calibre of home cooks on Masterchef (who are good at what they do, but c'mon...)

I loved watching this show."
The Final Table,"Considering the contestants are all top level chefs I can't imagine the total filming was more than a week, these people have legit operations to run."
The Final Table,An [article from the South China Morning Post](https://m.scmp.com/culture/film-tv/article/2173364/netflix-cookery-show-final-table-top-chefs-no-shouting-or-screaming) said 40 days. An [article from Eater](https://dc.eater.com/2018/11/20/18104472/johnny-spero-final-table-netflix-reverie-dc) said 6-8 weeks. I now wonder if the countries’ strange order was the result of the chef judges’ schedules. 
The Final Table,Was wondering the same thing. They never changed clothes until the final episode when they wore chef coats. 
The Final Table,"He's my favorite reality TV writer and it's not close. What don't you like about this piece, specifically?"
The Final Table,IMO not having tasted the dishes I think the Canadian should've won. 
The Final Table,"I don't hate US Masterchef, but I definitely prefer the Australian version. Some seasons have Marco Pierre White as one of the hosts and for those who don't know, Marco is the person who taught Gordon Ramsay how to chef and is the person Gordon bases his TV persona on.... but Marco isn't traditionally mean like Gordon he has this whole disappointed dad thing going on and that is 1000% more intimidating than Gordon's shtick."
The Final Table,"I agree, I watched the first episode. It's very over produced, should just let the food and the chefs be the stars no need for all the dramatic cinematography and the weird studio audience.    "
The Final Table,"Pretty sure that people can have the same name but not be the same person. Google easily throws up at least 5 Shin Takagis involved in very disparate fields. Either this person is a polymath who's a chef, CEO, doll maker, scientist and movie director, or you've got this person confused with somebody else."
The Final Table,"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/wdpa3x/japan-trottla-dolls-lifesize-lingerie

It’s the wrong guy, real doll maker it’s his full time job lol."
The Final Table,And the fact that they are the real deal is what makes the show so interesting to me. I want to see the top of the top battle it out. I want to see what a professional chef will do with basic ingredients. The level of creativity and talent is why people should be watching the show. Drama and divas are for cable TV. 
The Final Table,"God. What I love about the show is how professional all of the dishes are, and the losing team is voted out due to technicality, not some egregious mistakes you see in other cooking shows. I think that is the big drama of this show: the judges know they are partaking a masterwork, but must choose the lesser dish.

Great show, and I can't wait for the next season."
The Final Table,"I don't think the show itself was too long, but I do think the episodes could have been trimmed to 30-45 without an issue. I do wish they had stopped trying to push the narratives so hard and just let the chefs kind of build their own mystique. The number of times they used Mark saying his restaurant made him feel constrained was just beaten into you. "
The Final Table,"How do you mean, it's seeming a bit too much like X-Factor? Did it come good by the end of the episode? "
The Final Table,"He was totally unprofessional during the last episode. He took a selfie on stage, wtf"
The Final Table,"Aw come on. I cant speak for all MC viewers but the cooks there appeal because they are more capable than the average viewer, while still being relatable (eg not professional cooks). 

It depends on why you watch these shows. I like to supplement my poor cooking by watching MC, seeing nice (but not too ""fancy"") food to supplement the eye while I chew my pasta with canned tomato sauce. Hyperbole but true to an extent. It's not about pro cooks competing for the best food, it's regular people applying their skill producing something nice; or not. Forgetting whatevers on the stove is just as relateable.

Discounting the US masterchef.. Too much drama and spite between contestants to be enjoyable"
The Final Table,And the judges as well
The Final Table,The first paragraph of the article reads like if Cormac McCarthy had a stroke. You don't see how it's an awfully constructed sentence? 
The Final Table,"Gordon isn't mean in Masterchef.  He's only a jerk in Hells Kitchen and his ""turnaround"" shows.  "
The Final Table,"I don't hate US Masterchef, but this most recent season was particularly bad with the manufactured drama and the ""mentorship"" shtick that contributed zero to the show."
The Final Table,Lol. Love reddit. You agree and have 2 updoots and I have minus 1. 
The Final Table,The article says chef and owner of sex doll company not many people with the same name are both chefs and child sexdoll makers.
The Final Table,By far one of the most cringe moments of the show 
The Final Table,"If you're in a real kitchen where customers are waiting, he's going to yell at you"
The Final Table,"Which article is this ? Unless you’re conflating the picture of Shin Takagi from the Gourmantic, with a separate article in The Atlantic about a Shin Takagi who has never been photographed, I can’t find any article that says they’re the same person. "
The Final Table,"Yeah but I never felt like it's on the level of Hells Kitchen, where he calls people fat donkeys and yells at them until they cry.  "
The Final Table,Yeah they're not the same person
The Final Table,Method directing
The Final Table,"A lot of people in these comments are straight up making things up about what is happening behind the scenes, and not only about this show for some reason."
The Final Table,This seems cruel to do to cast/crew.
The Final Table,"The announcement was so abrupt that it's hard to believe it was planned in advance by Armstrong, even if  he says otherwise. I'm suspecting that some disagreements with HBO will come to light sooner or later."
The Final Table,I mean if they were told before they could be searching other jobs for after the show ended. I would be pissed.
The Final Table,"I wonder if this could wind up being a case like where the Closer became Major Crimes after a change of leads, and nothing else."
The Final Table,Boar on the floor.
The Final Table,Cant make a finale without breaking a few Shivs
The Final Table,"Either the people involved with this show have just been constantly working us, or it seems like one of the more toxic workplaces out there haha. God damn."
The Final Table,Someone pointed out that it's probably not a good sign that the main stars couldn't tell that it was a finale' after reading the script........
The Final Table,There had been rumors before that the show will continue without Cox and it kind of explains why he is happy it's over. It feels like this how Logan would've ended things too.
The Final Table,"I don't understand how anyone can watch season 3 and think ""surely there can be a season 5"", they rehashed so much stuff from season 2, Kendall's depression, his flirting with suicide, they undid so much of season 2 for season 3 to even have a plot and they upped Logan's plot armor to a ridiculous degree. They built up that FBI investigation like it was going to be hell for the company and then it was nothing, it served only as a tease to prolong the season and accomplished absolutely nothing. And the Skarsgaard plot point is nonsense one episode they want to buy his company, the next he can buy them... somehow."
The Final Table,The cast should have been notified way before the finale to prepare.  I know I would want to know if my job was ending.
The Final Table,"On one hand you get to enjoy working on the season without the feeling of dread knowing it's going to end.

On the other hand, this is cruel for those who need to constantly audition for new jobs and could've missed out on a new gig."
The Final Table,"The only reason I'm against them doing this to actors, is they should be given a heads up so they can start looking for their next jobs. I'm sure she will be fine in the long run, but she's not a household name so it will take some work to get the next big thing."
The Final Table,I can't get past the first part of that finale table read quote without GOT PTSD.
The Final Table,How can you keep successing
The Final Table,"I mean it’s been known for awhile that this is the last season.


Does she not read the news?"
The Final Table,Here is the thing that puzzles me if the cast themselves dont know until the final table read that show wasnt ending it points to me maybe that ending was not really satisfying and deserved
The Final Table,Must be painful to be snookered like that.
The Final Table,She doesn’t watch the show if she thought it needed to continue.
The Final Table,"Um, I knew it before they began filming. It was announced."
The Final Table,At least she's got animal crossing
The Final Table,"Well Sarah, keeping you in the dark kept your performance authentic. It’s a lot easier to act like you have no idea, when you truly have no idea."
The Final Table,I am going to miss that juicy butt to be honest
The Final Table,you’ll live
The Final Table,Why did the post such a terrible photo? The angle and it’s out of focus. They literally picked the worst one they could find. She’s awesome and I’m sure has some high quality ones they coulda used.
The Final Table,TIL:   Succession is a TV show that exists. And Sarah Snook is a n actress that also exists.
The Final Table,"Trust me, I don’t know how they didn’t know! I was in a pivotal scene and I knew it was the end, just being an extra."
The Final Table,Is it just me or do her facial expressions weird anyone else out.  It’s like she’s always actively trying to show different emotions with her eyes than she is with her mouth.
The Final Table,"Is this the ""Snuck a Snook up my snizz"" person?"
The Final Table,Good riddance.
The Final Table,"She’s the worst of the show though so I don’t feel bad, next is the dude that plays connor tbh… dude is mid as heck"
The Final Table,Boohoo. Ffs
The Final Table,So no one else knew either or did they all just decide she will be the one left out?
The Final Table,Nobody mentioned it on set?
The Final Table,Good god that site is cancer on mobile
The Final Table,Emotions aside what if you turned another job down during the season?
The Final Table,Snoo snoo
The Final Table,no more Succession?  who's gonna win all the emmys now?
The Final Table,And a pretty big loss of $$$$$$$ as well
The Final Table,I love her sm
The Final Table,Rooting for you!
The Final Table,What?! It feels like there could be 2 seasons left in it. It was just really heating up (as far as popularity).
The Final Table,so when is the spin off staring sarah snook?
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",This will be a lot of people's introduction to the fact that the Doctor married his daughter.
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",David will be excellent being Jekyll and Hyde
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",So not only did she play the role of the daughter of Tennant's Doctor but she is IRL the daughter of Pete Davison who was the Fifth Doctor.
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",Just recently started watching Broadchurch and he’s great - can’t imagine how great he’ll be in this.
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me","I liked her in their 'Staged' show, but they were just goofing around. Other than that i only saw Georgia in that Doctor Who episode. Is there a more serious role one should check out?

Excited for more David's acting, of course."
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",Woah Richard Hammond really has range
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me","The world needs more Fazekas and Butters run shows!

*Reaper* was absolute gold."
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me","I’m always surprised he doesn’t get tagged for being Barty crouch jr. Harry Potter has to be the highest grossing thing he has ever been in and he is the best part of the fourth movie. I know he has all these iconic roles as well that I’m not trying to minimize, just surprised I never see that credit mentioned."
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me","Can't say the plot synopsis inspires me to watch yet another iteration of Jekyll & Hyde, even if I only just realised after reading the article that the creators of Reaper are working on it too."
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me","People. In case you didn’t know. 

She’s the actress from the episode: the doctor daughter. 

She’s also the daughter of the fifth doctor. David Tennants favorite doctor. 

So. He gave his favorite doctor a grandkid."
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me","wonder if they'll get divorced...I feel like people in the industry tend to do projects together to fix a broken marriage and then call it quits afterwards

disclaimer: I know absolutely nothing about their personal lives or their relationship with each other lol"
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me","I’m still waking up, but at first I thought it said “Heckle and Jekyll” and I got really excited."
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",Crazy they got Fazekas AND Butters.
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",This goes onto my radar
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me","That’s fun, more of both please. I wish she had come back for a larger role in later seasons of Who."
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",I really hope it’s a musically. The sound track for J&H slaps.
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",And she is the daughter of another Doctor.
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me","If you've not seen it, check out *Staged*, which was filmed during the first lockdown last year. David and Georgia play exaggerated versions of themselves. Michael Sheen is in it too and there are plenty of famous cameos."
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me","And his step-son Ty is rumored to be Aegon II Targaryen in House of Dragon, Matt Smith is there."
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",The doctor married his daughter who is also the daughter of the doctor
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",And he also married the Doctor’s daughter.
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",Not sure anyone can outdo the Hoff.
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",Misread this as Pete Davidson as the 5th Doctor and now I want to see that.
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",MILLA
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",She was in *The Bill* as the rather dim daughter of one of the officers.
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",He wasn't actually in very much of it - and it came out just before his full debut as the Tenth Doctor in Christmas 2005.
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me","I'm a big David Tennant fan and honestly that's probably my least favorite thing I've seen him do. I've seen him elevate some really crappy stuff but with Harry Potter, while I'm sure he was doing what he was told (it was early career for him), it was just super over the top."
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",Strange thing to say
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me","They made Staged together during quarantine and have five kids, no reason to suspect anything negative.  I think they just like working together."
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me","She is the Doctor's daughter, who played the Doctor's daughter, who married the Doctor, and gave birth to the Doctor's daughter."
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me","I like how you tag Michael sheen at the end there. 

That pretty much sums up the show and Michael's persona in it."
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me","I loved Staged, although I will say I felt like Season One was the much stronger season.  Georgia is great, although the dynamic between David and Michael is clearly the star of the show."
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me","Adopted son, not stepson."
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",oh damn hes doing alright. possibly getting a spinoff on hbo max off doom patrol too
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",When my wife is taking her time getting to the TV room for the show i will belt that out.
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",Oh sure but he is great in it. I just watched the movie the other night and the movie isn’t very good but he really is great in it.
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",You mean in the movie about magic he was over the top? I think it was great work done by two actors that made it feel like one character by the end.
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",I know tbh lol but it's just a random comment on the internet which they're never gonna see and which isn't actually gonna affect them so \*shrug emoji\*
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",Ah hadn't realized they have a daughter... that's just perfect.
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me","Also her mother, Sandra Dickinson, played Trillian in the 80s version of *Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.*

Christmas dinner at their house has a better lineup than a lot of conventions do lol"
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",Now I'm my own grandpa?
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",Time travel is weird
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",Indeed River (Alex) was also a Doctor in her former life  (Role) as well.
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me","I don't know why but I suddenly pictured Dark Helmet yelling [""Everybody got that?""](https://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/everybody_got_that_spaceballs.gif) after reading this comment."
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",Disguised as another dude
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me","What does the movie being about magic have to do with the actor's performance? I was already thrown because his portrayal was very different from that in the book, which is fine in and of itself, but also the whole raging-madness thing felt kind of hammy. Which is fine, it just means I only like MOST things I've seen him in rather than ALL of them :P"
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me","Yeah, she gave birth to a girl, Olive, a couple of months after they guy in engaged.

She played John Barrowman's daughter in The Five(ish) Doctors"
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",Oh they've got more than just one daughter.
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",I did do the nasty in the pasty.
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me","It means that in a movie where a snake man was reborn and did a combination of whispering and cackling, the star is doing show off moves way out of character, and we get the worlds dumbest I hate you now I don’t hate you because I was jealous of you Ron story, a guy who plays up the insanity so that another different actor can also go over the top so you believe both different actors are the same character was pretty great in a movie about magic where everything is constantly over the top. It’s not out of place and serves an important purpose."
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me","They've got a total of five kids; Ty Tennant was from a previous relationship of Georgia's (she has not named the father) and was legally adopted by David. David fathered the other four and when the last one came along, Ty joked he was going to have to explain birth control to his parents!"
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me","> She played John Barrowman's daughter in The Five(ish) Doctors

OH COME ON! <Liar Liar Water Spit.gif>"
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me","Cool. I just don’t really rank it on my mental hierarchy of David Tennant performances, esp as I’m not much of a Harry Potter 4 movie fan in the first place. But I get why you like it relative to the rest of the movie."
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me","Just to be clear, I meant Olive played his daughter"
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me","Yeah, I looked it up... Just funny to perpetuate it another generation. :)"
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me","Man, lot of people shitting on the CW, don't really get it. The 100, iZombie, Crazy-Ex, and Legends of Tomorrow are all legit good to great shows."
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me","Every season it seems CW has a period drama that sounds like it easily be the most interesting thing (at least conceptually) on the network and they always pass, and say it's due to cost. Why the fuck keep paying for the pilots then?
"
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",This sounds dumb as hell and also like something I'll probably watch.
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me","Can't be worse than do no harm.

Wait no it's in Victorian times.this is genuinely interesting."
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",Title sounds like a Decemberists song.
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",Stopped reading at CW. 
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me","But not a Dr. Jekyll Drama, that could actually be interesting to get into the why how, and early on why, Dr. Jekyll is who he is...

NOPE LOL Daughter.

I'm all for female protagonists, but at this rate we can make a League of extraordinary Gentleman's Daughters(Or Gender swaps)"
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",But why CW though?
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",That is possibly the worst name Ive ever heard..
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me","They've tried hard to get a reputation beyond love triangles and highschoolers, and not enough people acknowledge that. They're far more willing to try something off-brand than other networks, which results in so many failed shows but god bless them for trying."
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me","Not to sound like a total feminist cliche here, but are you saying your problem only exists because it's about his daughter, or would you still be disappointed if it was the sons of literary greats."
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",Bad boys for lif3
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me","No no no, this could be great...van helsing for instance i like. Nothing of the gender. Just my personal ""God damn. A Dr.Jekyll serial and it isn't about young Henry Jekyll, and what turns him down the path to even seek out mr Hyde.

I really am just stomping my feet childishly, daughter son doesn't matter. As I said it could be great, doesn't matter son or daughter I was hyped for a young henry Jekyll story to be told."
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",ohhh I understand. Thank you for the solid reply :>
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me","Yeah, well thanks for your candor, and after rereading my comment i can see how it would be construed now."
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",I just see this post and the song is already stuck in my head
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me","Same, didn't watch the clip but can never forget ""Jeckyl jeckyl hyde jeckyl hyde hyde jeckle"""
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",I was the last kid in my neighborhood with cable. Oh the reminders of cursed deprivation. 
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",Slow start but there are some really interesting things going on in the background. I like it.
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",Don't know why this thread is being downvoted I also want to know if its any good. I kinda wanted to watch it as some of it is filmed around medway where i live. 
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me","I do not know what but it needs to do ""something"" differently if it doesn't want to be a 1 season show."
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",I just watched the first episode and really enjoy it. I hope the series does well despite it's scheduling complaints. 
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",underwhelming
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me","thanks, i will likely stay away from it then"
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me","Since when ""teatime"" is 6:30pm? Get a hold of yourselves, lads."
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",Am I the only one who thinks in this situation its the parents responsibility?.  I mean sure if your broadcasting a documentary about serial killers right after my little pony fine.. but yeah.
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me","I've noticed that a lot of shows do this over on the American side of the pond. 'Gotham' and 'Bones' both have some very violent scenes and gore and both come on at 7pm. Bones is especially gory and right around the time I am eating which has annoyed me more than a few times. Ultimately it's up to the viewer to decide whether to watch it or not, though."
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me","I watched and was dissapointed how tame it was,i am a horror nut to be fair."
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",Watched the first ep a few weeks ago to review it. Fucking cringey as fuck. I've been excited about it for months... Next up Frankenstein Chronicles.
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me","I have watched the first episode and really enjoy the show. I am from the US so obviously I watch it whenever I want but I do not see why ITV cant just change the time it is to be aired. I don't generally watch shows at the time they are aired due to my DVR but I can see this perhaps causes an issue. It's disappointing to see that it is getting ""negative"" press due to it's air time. "
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me","I have this theory about old horror films that the scariest thing is losing respectability.  Frankenstein.. guy flips out and kills, and the scientist's reputation is ruined.  Dracula.. woman gets bitten by dracula and turns a noblewoman into a whore.  Jekyll and Hyde.. scientist turns into a very disagreeable man who does violent acts.  

It's like there's nothing worse than losing one's reputation back in those days."
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",That seems a pretty normal time. Are you confusing it to mean drinking tea because otherwise I'm lost on whether you think it's too early or too late. (If you are then 'tea' here is referring to the evening meal.)
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",Perhaps but rules are rules. What I don't get is that no watches even 10 minutes of the show before giving it a time slot. 
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me","The problem is that their are rules. So you have a show airing way before watershed about a classic character.

A responsible parent will use that information when making a choice. And assume it will be okay to watch."
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me","Definitely the parent's responsibility IMO. If you don't want your kids watching this then don't let them watch it. I'm no parent but I see ""parental controls"" as options on just about everything these days. "
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",It's just a j9ke. Since stereotypical English teatime is 5pm
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me","Ahnright, never heard of that and would've thought 6 was more likely. Reckon it's all the 5pmers that need to get a hold of their self and grab a snack."
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me","""Afternoon tea is a light meal typically eaten between 4 pm and 6 pm. ""

""High tea between 5 pm and 7 pm""

""In the North of England, South Wales, the English Midlands, and Scotland, people traditionally call their midday meal dinner and their evening meal (served around 6 pm) tea""

I guess I heard only about  afternoon tea. 

The timing between meals confirms addiction :-)"
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me","One of my favorite all-times is *Dead Like Me,* which was moderately successful at the time but never got the traction it deserved and mostly disappeared for a while. It's really nice to see it having a bit of a renaissance now.

Also *Spartacus* is really overlooked - it's insane and totally unique in the best way, and has some truly impressive performances (especially considering the highly stylized dialogue). It's not uncommon for it to get mentioned offhand but I feel like there's a lot to discuss there and it's rare for anyone to really dig into it."
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",Happy Endings. The best comedy ensemble I’ve ever seen. Elisha Cuthbert is so much more talented (especially as a comedic actress) than anyone gives her credit for.
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",*Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency* not getting another season \*really\* bummed me out.
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",Ugly Americans.
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",Almost Human - Karl Urban and Michael Ealy were one of the top buddy cop pairs.
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me","Life - stars Damien Lewis as an eccentric cop who has recently been released from prison after being falsely convicted of murder. Really odd, but very charming.

State of Play - a political thriller miniseries with a very strong cast and a clever plot"
"Hyde, Jekyll, Me",Terriers
Prince of Peoria,"This show is so good. If anyone has a spare 30 mins, watch a compilation of all of Bob Mortimer's ones.  Theft and Shrubbery, the dentistry, etc. They're so good."
Prince of Peoria,"Lee’s level of detail on this one is great, the invite came through my agent, it didn’t specify the length of the ceremony, my wife couldn’t make it anyway, plus all the social awkwardness of calling David or Robb.  But Lee is also an excellent BS artist."
Prince of Peoria,Love this show!
Prince of Peoria,David's initial reaction is just golden.
Prince of Peoria,"There's a conspiracy theory among WILTY fans that this story was actually true, but Mack quickly switched into a lie after seeing how actually shocked both Mitchell and Brydon were haha. 

Nevertheless, great segment. Hilarious reactions. I love how both Mitchell and Brydon stop the show and turn it into an actual investigation lol"
Prince of Peoria,"I love watching clips of Would I Lie to You? on YouTube. I don't think I've ever seen a full episode though hahaha. Lee Mack is freaking hysterical. His stand up is okay, but he's one the quickest witted people I've ever seen. One of those comedians whose in his best element when he has to think up a joke on the spot. There's compilations of Lee's quick wit on the show on YouTube - I think it's called Mack Speed - that's on YouTube that just shows off how funny he is. David and Rob are excellent as well and work so well as a threesome, but for me, Lee is the MVP of the show if you had to pick just one of the three regulars."
Prince of Peoria,Greg Davies is so good on this too!
Prince of Peoria,"This is my favorite non-James Acaster moment on the entire series.

As soon as it pops up 'true', David's reaction is just perfect.

Even after he switches it, I'm not completely sure that Mitchell knows what to believe.  Poor guy is just in shock."
Prince of Peoria,"Him giving the nickname ""Sniper's Dream"" to one of his friends with a large head is so fucking funny."
Prince of Peoria,"Bob's on the show again next week.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Would_I_Lie_to_You%3F_episodes#Series_16_(2022%E2%80%9323)"
Prince of Peoria,"We do beg your pardon, but we are in your garden"
Prince of Peoria,True but my all-time favorite story is still Kevin Bridge's horse story
Prince of Peoria,James Acaster is always gold too
Prince of Peoria,"Bob Mortimer stories are always the best, no matter what show he's on. They're always so outrageous that you think there's no way it's true, but they always are. He has lived an interesting life and is one heck of a storyteller."
Prince of Peoria,Snipers dream!
Prince of Peoria,"Adil Ray's university story is another favorite of mine.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8BbgUITQa8"
Prince of Peoria,Lee Mack would absolutely never have switched answers because David or Rob were shocked. He would have rubbed it in their faces as much as humanly possible.
Prince of Peoria,"He pretty clearly says ""change it"" into the microphone to the producers to true for the gag"
Prince of Peoria,"The show works better when it's just David and Lee. Rob ruins it, with his awful double entendres

David: Yes, so this is Jane and she wanted the last carton of eggs, which I was holding at the time.

Rob: Well David, tell us did you *give her one*?? **OfTheEggs!!OMGLOL** Oh audience, you're a filthy bunch tonight, aren't you?"
Prince of Peoria,That's a pretty common thing. Not the first time I have heard it
Prince of Peoria,Goddamn I've not watched a live episode in like 10 years but I will. Thank you
Prince of Peoria,A horse? I am sorry I missed the S.
Prince of Peoria,For those curious: https://youtu.be/B94q7gUu75k
Prince of Peoria,The kid with the cabbages!
Prince of Peoria,I love how Bob asks about the open day. Legend
Prince of Peoria,"I think that was another episode where he asks to change it.

I believe this one told him to say it’s true on the card which is why he reacts so funnily to it."
Prince of Peoria,Y’all think they have a secret mic that goes only to the backstage producers?
Prince of Peoria,I wonder how Christopher Eccleston would have reacted.
Prince of Peoria,I liked the part where he danced shirtless to celebrate having sex
Prince of Peoria,"he was fantastic at it, down to the slight limp the Prince carried all his life"
Prince of Peoria,"The Queen apparently watched it too. I remember reading an interview after season 2 released. She said she enjoyed s1 and it was somewhat accurate, but she said s2 was a bit too dramatic for her but she still enjoyed it. In that same interview she said Prince Phillip hated the show and refused to watch passed a few episodes lol"
Prince of Peoria,Wouldn't it be too awkward to watch a show about your family?
Prince of Peoria,The Crown actually shows the Queen in a very good light...he'd have no reason not to like it tbh
Prince of Peoria,"Nice disguise, Daemon"
Prince of Peoria,I wonder what would happen if he saw Morbius
Prince of Peoria,It must be pretty crazy seeing a dramatized account of his family while knowing the real story (which is probably much more boring let’s be honest)
Prince of Peoria,"Tbf, there's probably a lot that the family doesn't talk about amongst themselves."
Prince of Peoria,"Well Harry has a development deal with Netflix now, so that shouldn’t come as too much of a surprise lol both he and The Crown’s production team have the same boss"
Prince of Peoria,"Once Dr Who, always Dr Who"
Prince of Peoria,"after hearing Charles speak for the first time, he sounds remarkably similar to Matt Smith to the point where I misremembered who Smith actually played in the series."
Prince of Peoria,Matt Daemon smith
Prince of Peoria,Who wouldn’t watch such a personalized tv show. I imagine harry and Megan watching it together and he’s correcting shit along the way like “um not at all what happened” or confirming the narrative.
Prince of Peoria,Where did Prince Phillip hide Caraxes?
Prince of Peoria,"Why is this surprising? Of course he would watch it. It's about his family. Who wouldn't want to see how they portray your family?   


They also watched Hamilton, and that doesn't give a very positive portrayal of their family."
Prince of Peoria,I want Matt smith to push me up against a wall
Prince of Peoria,"After watching him on House of the Dragon, now I'll have to watch the Crown. Great actor."
Prince of Peoria,I’m sorry. I can’t see Matt Smith without a bow tie on. It’s the Whovian in me.
Prince of Peoria,"Harry seems to be the only cool royal, the rest are just MEH"
Prince of Peoria,This has big “The Windsors” version of Harry energy and I love it. (And if you like absurd British humor lampooning the royal family for the love of god go to Netflix and watch this show. [It’s so dumb and I love it.)](https://youtu.be/w_DCYMviMsU)
Prince of Peoria,Matt Smiths seasons were the best imo. Seasons after I was born seem less appealing.
Prince of Peoria,"I’ve never seen doctor who, should I watch it all?"
Prince of Peoria,MATT SMITH IS IN THE CROWN?! I would’ve watched it ages ago if I’d known!!!
Prince of Peoria,[deleted]
Prince of Peoria,I wonder when they’ll do the Epstein Island episode
Prince of Peoria,"Why of course, not only one of the best doctors but royalty too."
Prince of Peoria,"“People watch television!!!!””

Anyway"
Prince of Peoria,Wouldn’t you watch a show about yourself?  Of course you would.
Prince of Peoria,Mad respect to this guy. Don’t know him but he just displays the attributes of a good solid dude.
Prince of Peoria,Or he just read somewhere that Matt Smith played his grandad.
Prince of Peoria,Harry is so cool. I love him.
Prince of Peoria,Of course he’s going to watch a show about his own family.
Prince of Peoria,What did Prince Harry call Harry Enfield?
Prince of Peoria,I think Matt's performance was great.
Prince of Peoria,The sexual pairing we didn’t know we needed
Prince of Peoria,i love matt smith
Prince of Peoria,That must've been *weird.*
Prince of Peoria,If you haven’t seen the series…Matt Smith brilliantly navigates Prince Phillip’s persona.  Bravo 👏
Prince of Peoria,Harry arguably seems like the only average Joe of the family in terms of attitude.
Prince of Peoria,"I can’t stand the thought of royalty, simply by birth right…..f the monarchy….

May Elizabeth be forgiven of her sins and Rest In Peace."
Prince of Peoria,Must be weird watching your family portrayed on tv.
Prince of Peoria,What a dumb article. How is this news?
Prince of Peoria,In other news I don't care about the royals.
Prince of Peoria,Could just be confused regarding who his real parents are
Prince of Peoria,Hi sunshine sachs!!
Prince of Peoria,Look! The gracious Prince looked at my show! Ah I feel so fortunate!
Prince of Peoria,Of course they watched it. It’s like sucking themselves off.
Prince of Peoria,I wonder if Harry still has his nazi uniform?
Prince of Peoria,"Hey I know that guy. He's the ""haaaave sex! Haaaavee sex"" 🎶🎶🎶 guy from Morbius"
Prince of Peoria,Fuck the monarchy
Prince of Peoria,You perfectly captured grandfathers racism and idiotic ramblings.
Prince of Peoria,s-should someone tell him?
Prince of Peoria,None of these things ever happened
Prince of Peoria,England is such a sad joke now.
Prince of Peoria,Harry and Meghan admitted they watched The Crown during that Oprah interview
Prince of Peoria,Is this news?
Prince of Peoria,Boring post…. 💤 😴
Prince of Peoria,Iiiiiii doubt it.
Prince of Peoria,They’re just like us!
Prince of Peoria,So what?
Prince of Peoria,I hope Matt Smith is prepared to get a knife on his back courtesy of Hazbeen and Nutmeg.
Prince of Peoria,He didn’t even go see his granddad before he died. Go figures he would credit an actor over his actual relatives.  Such a shame he is useless now
Prince of Peoria,No one give a shit
Prince of Peoria,It's settled then: id I ever meet Kevin Costner I'm calling him my great-great-great-grandfather
Prince of Peoria,"Wait till the Targaryen incest starts…wait, too late"
Prince of Peoria,"I thought he played Prince Phillip, not James Hewitt’s dad."
Prince of Peoria,Harry watches Netflix all day
Prince of Peoria,Just like the judge who singed off on the raid at mar a lago?
Prince of Peoria,Harry's wife let him watch the show?
Prince of Peoria,Would you _not_ watch a show about yourself and your family? Of course he watches!
Prince of Peoria,Who gives a shit
Marcus Level,I was truly unprepared for how real and heavy the last episode of season 2 was.
Marcus Level,"Season 1 was a more funny Season, Season 2 was a better Season. "
Marcus Level,[deleted]
Marcus Level,"While I love American Vandal and the depictions of teenagers within the two seasons, I’d say the shining achievement of American Vandal lies not in its depictions of teenagers, but in how the series uses different forms of media to tell the story. 

Snapchat videos, Facebook posts, Instagram posts, etc. Are all used extremely effectively to convey key pieces of plot information in a subtle and fresh way. We interact with these forms of media daily within our lives, we’re comfortable with them. Yet, when they are utilized by filmmakers in the majority of cinematic examples, they never seem to transition well, often feeling clunky or forced. 

Social media is a huge part of our lives today, so to see it integrated so well within traditional filmmaking (in this case, documentary) was really satisfying. "
Marcus Level,You’re 16 and write like this? You’re pretty much Shit Stain McClain 
Marcus Level,"So true. American Vandal is one of my top shows, of all time. I left school a few years ago now but can still see me and other people I knew in the characters. And the message at season 2 is one of utmost importance at the moment."
Marcus Level,"American Vandal is honestly the most accurate depiction of teenagers I've ever seen on TV or film.

The part in season two where they all the kids thought it was suspicious that someone didn't sit at ""their"" table at lunch was perfect for instance."
Marcus Level,"I agree with your point on the end of Season 2 transitioning into poignant social commentary.

I like Season 1 better because I found the satire of True Crime and plot funnier, and I really liked how the ""documentary makers"" were more intertwined in the school/plot, but Season 2 reaches for more depth and I think it works. I do think they could've moved forward more quickly and given themselves more time/room to explore that depth; first few episodes were too much of an info dump for me.

And both represent young people really well, although I'm not as connected to S2. I'm in my early 20s so the whole social media being ""another life"" thing wasn't as true for me in high school. We still had the option to not really take it seriously or even use it frequently back then and still be popular/cool."
Marcus Level,Hope Netflix renews it for 3rd season.
Marcus Level,"I agree, my only complaint with season 2 is it felt like they edited out a whole subplot of Sam and Peter not getting along as well."
Marcus Level,"Is ""American Vandal has the most realistic teens"" this sub's new ""The Leftovers is so underrated""?"
Marcus Level,"Hey dude. At 16, you're a very good writer. Keep it up.
"
Marcus Level,"I don’t care what any review says. Watching the show is hilarious and showing social media in kids lives makes the show believable. I know my wife thought it was juvenile but I still think the way the show is edited is classic.

It needs more of the crime CGI animations like the first season. Made it seem like a true thriller "
Marcus Level,"I got tsk-tsked last month for suggesting AMERICAN VANDAL is one of the best shows of the millennium. After this season I no longer suggest it, I state it as fact. This show succeeds in so many directions at once it's staggering. It juggles parody, social commentary, crime drama, intrigue, bathroom humor, serialization, teen life, and so many other factors that so many other shows struggle with. And it nails EVERY SINGLE ONE. It's a brilliant achievement of television."
Marcus Level,I wasn't prepared for how deep it would get.
Marcus Level,"I think the craziest part was that I feel like I remember initial reviews saying it wasn't as good as the first. They were wrong! Season 1 was amazing, but somehow season 2 managed to be even better! Can't wait for S3. "
Marcus Level,Now we bet on how long it takes before some idiot actually tries the brownout on their school! I call before the year ends.
Marcus Level,Well said and remarkably well written analysis. 
Marcus Level,"And not just that, to see that some (not all) but some police tactics are like that (reference the Kevin McClain interrogation). "
Marcus Level,"I went on to Facebook today and someone shared the video of the ""Brownout"" thinking it was a real event.

Makes me realize why I don't go onto Facebook anymore."
Marcus Level,"I just finished watching season two tonight and it absolutely blew me away. Some of my favourite television I've ever seen.The scenes with DeMarcus in the season finale actually made me really emotional.

Season one is still great, but the two seasons are pretty different entities. Season one is a better comedy, but I think season two is overall the better story (and I am not really one for poop jokes)."
Marcus Level,"Haven't seen the second season. But my only issue with the first season -- how age appropriate a lot of the actors looked, which only set off how much older the non-age appropriate actors looked. "
Marcus Level,"I kept avoiding this on Netflix because I just thought it was another Netflix crime docuseries.  When I heard what it really was, I binged the first season in 2 days.  I do not usually watch that much of a series in that short of a time.  It's damn good.   It's both hilarious and serious at the same time, it's weird."
Marcus Level,I love Ryan's show The Overly Excited Tourist.
Marcus Level,What... Season 2?! Damnit Netflix which didn't you push this.
Marcus Level,"I don't think you know what the word ""poignant"" really means."
Marcus Level,"Honestly I could see the crimes being something that could happen in the real world, after all america has put kids in jail for far lesser crimes.


As for it being a depiction of teenages now, honey when I was in school, teenagers were like that 15 years ago. I think it's a accurate depeiction of teenagers of any time period tbh, the only thing that's changed is how connected we are and how tolenerant we are now. 


Teenhood and Highschool is rarely easy and if someone says otherwise well either they were lucky or hung up on nostalgia. "
Marcus Level,"So good. Great think piece. Very well written!

Show is so good too I agree. "
Marcus Level,"Thanks for the reminder to watch S2. Have you seen Eighth Grade, and if so what did you think of it?"
Marcus Level,"I really liked this show. Season 1 was good, I felt season 2 wasn't as funny but overall it was better imo."
Marcus Level,"Haven't seen the second season. But my only issue with the first season -- how age appropriate a lot of the actors looked, which only set off how much older the non-age appropriate actors looked. "
Marcus Level,There’s a reason it won a Peabody. 
Marcus Level,"Man. Idk why, I was stoked for season two, but I am having an incredibly hard time getting into it. I’ve re-watched the first episode 3 times and it hasn’t been able to hold my attention. 
"
Marcus Level,LOVE THIS SHOW!!!
Marcus Level,"I started watching because your enthusiasm about the show made me believe it is something I’m missing to be complete. Well done, sir."
Marcus Level,"I'm still on my second episode of the first season. I couldn't stop laughing at those graphics they show, like the numerous handjob vantage points and the top-down view of the parking lot with all those graphic... dicks. "
Marcus Level,"Just finished the first episode of Season 2, without spoiling anything else can someone tell me whether Jimmy Tatro is in this season at all? I’m going to be sad if he’s not :("
Marcus Level,"Guess I'm lucky, when I was a kid bullies just beat you up and stole from you."
Marcus Level,Kevin reminded me so fucking much of finch from American Pie lol
Marcus Level,"One little question... the basketball team captain, someone named Tyler something, sends out that email warning everyone to keep quiet about Marcus being absent from pep rehearsal. But who the hell is this captain? Wouldn't Marcus be the captain since he's an actual pro ball prospect? And why would the captain be such a nobody that we never even see him in the gym or anywhere else?"
Marcus Level,I am a high school teacher and I literally think seasons one could be a real life documentary. It was so spot on and so well done. I just started season two and I think it feels way too forced.  
Marcus Level,s1 is def better. (novelty + main suspect was hillarious)
Marcus Level,"Fair enough, I guess I enjoyed the comedy aspect of the first season and was hoping for more this time around. The end is good, almost like it should be mandatory viewing for teens. I have two teenage boys and it did hit home with me a bit. "
Marcus Level,Couldn’t get past the trailer for season 2. Not a poop joke fan. Liked season 1 though. 
Marcus Level,I wish they had less money for season 2. I've tried twice now and haven't been able to finish the 1st episode. That security guard irks me. Everything feels really contrived vs the 1st season.
Marcus Level,I thought the it got old with the 2nd season
Marcus Level,"Yeah, season 2 was unexpectedly refreshing with the social commentaries. I think millenials can relate a lot with it. And some of the characters are nicely written, like DeMarcus character's progression was fun to watch."
Marcus Level,"> amazingly accurate depiction of teenagers

Is that a reason why I should watch it? It doesn't sound like a positive to me. It's the stage where we're at our most awkward and annoying. Sounds about as entertaining as ""realistic portrayal of three-year olds throwing tantrums"". I'm going through that shit in real life already."
Marcus Level,[deleted]
Marcus Level,"> It's kind of amazing how accurately they parody the camerawork, editing style, voice over, visual style etc. 

Not really, it's just good camerawork, it's not surprising that a professional camera crew and director can shot professionally.

Edit: i am not shitting on the series, I really enjoyed it an agree that it was well shot, but the way OP described it was wrong."
Marcus Level,"That last episode made me tear up twice. The ending was uniquely brilliant, a fantastic commentary on social media and teenagers today."
Marcus Level,"Well fuck, now I don't want to continue watching. Can I just have more poop plz?"
Marcus Level,Absolutely amazing. I like how we had a degree of certainty this season that we know what happened. Season 1's end was a little bit weak because of the lack of closure IMO. 
Marcus Level,dude hot janitor had me dying though 
Marcus Level,"I disagree. I preferred S1 for three main reasons.

1. Novelty. It is always going to be a challenge recapturing the magic of a surprise like American Vandal. I know the creators are aware of this, they nodded to it during Peter's search for a new case. 

2. Dylan. I thought that new characters were very good, DeMarcus and Kevin in particular, but no one really rose to the heights of Dylan to me.

3. Peter & Sam.  One of my favorite things was the producers’ personal connection to the mystery. They were investigating their classmates and Peter really burned some bridges. In S2, they were presented more as producers than characters themselves.

There were aspects of S2 that I thought were better, but overall I still feel that S1 was superior.

But really, they are both great.
"
Marcus Level,"Season 2 definitely had me more interested in the crime and had a better resolution at the expense of the jokes, personally I'd say both seasons are about equal. Hopefully season 3 can combine the strengths of both, but it's still one of Netflix's best series."
Marcus Level,"I thought season 1 was better, as it had a more pointed, insightful look at the role the documentarians take in these true crime stories. Season 2, while still excellent, was not as sharp of a satire, imo"
Marcus Level,"Nah, season 2 lacked in characters and had weaker writing overall"
Marcus Level,Damn thankfully you didn't outright spoil anything with your spoilers since your spoiler tag didn't work. 
Marcus Level,I think that is the point.
Marcus Level,"On top of that, the mock UI's for these apps look remarkably similar to their real life counterparts.  I get annoyed every time a show has an obviously fake interface that it can sometimes break the realism of the scene for me.  But for the most part, American Vandal's graphics are spot on."
Marcus Level,The whole arc with the iPhone glitch was genius
Marcus Level,"If you enjoyed that, then you should see the movie Searching if you have not.

Not quite pitch perfect as American Vandal can be, but it’s still done well."
Marcus Level,I was just trying to write nicely. Didn’t mean to come off like that.
Marcus Level,"I think the underlying message at the end of both seasons was the most important thing. Peter and Sam bring important things to light, but in doing so they unknowingly damage other people without seeming to care. Sarah Pearson from Season 1, Dylan's girlfriend and her family, and even Dylan, who one could assume committed the crime at the end because he was shown Peter's first episode. 

Same with Season 2. He has to message Grayson which triggers the dump, instead of just going to the police. (Also airs information about Demarcus's ankle)

I just love that the humor covers up revealing how messed up the whole documentary process can be. "
Marcus Level,"American Vandal is definitely the more accurate representation of the iPhone generation, but Superbad still takes the cake for me."
Marcus Level,"The lunch time table choice is a pretty common scene in a lot of movies/tv shows.  Agree that AV does a good job representing life in school, but that’s not a unique scene imo "
Marcus Level,"Man, I was annoyed when I got to episode two and they were still bringing us up to speed. It picked up with the third episode, fortunately. "
Marcus Level,Agreed! I wanted more of those two but I can also understand why they took more of a backseat this year. I was also kinda hoping they “hired” Dylan from season 1 as their intern or something so he could make a few appearances this season
Marcus Level,"What gives that impression? They had that in season one, but I didn’t get that vibe in season two at all. 

Though, I did feel like there wasn’t nearly enough of either of them. "
Marcus Level,I don’t think they cut a subplot but they were clearly demonstrating tension between them. I think it will play a part in Season 3. I won’t spoil anything but Peter’s messaging with the Turd Burglar is a massive dick move by him.
Marcus Level,"American Vandal is received very well by most people who've seen it. To me it's one of Netflix's best shows. It's just criminally underwatched  and marketed. 

Leftovers is 50/50. It repays the people that stuck with it through the seasons, but it's easy to tell from the first one if it's not for you. "
Marcus Level,Both statements are accurate?
Marcus Level,But the Leftovers IS so underrated!!!!!
Marcus Level,Fuck television.  It's a brilliant achievement in storytelling.  The kind that won't be as appreciated as much now until the kids now grow up to look back on just how accurate and relevant it was today.
Marcus Level,That’s what she said?
Marcus Level,"I think teenagers behavior has always been the same, but how and why the drama ensues because of social media is what's different. What used to just be rumors that could fade away quickly have more of a sticking factor when a video/picture can spread so easily."
Marcus Level,not US based so haven’t seen it yet but am keen to check it out when I can.
Marcus Level,You will be sad.
Marcus Level,"Gotta have a white kid, cuz leadership. "
Marcus Level,Wait until the last couple of episodes. It changes your perspective on the whole season.
Marcus Level,"I hate poo jokes as well - this is so much smarter than that, Just get past the opening incident and then it’s fine."
Marcus Level,"Keep going, I felt the same way about the first ep but it sucks you in after that. Security guard goes away after first part of second episode "
Marcus Level,"You're aware that satire as a genre has been used to convey weighty themes for like, centuries, right? Or that how something began doesn't define what it becomes over time? Have you even seen season two? It's very clearly a different show with different goals than the first season, one of which is clearly to address and portray the struggles of high schoolers in the modern social media landscape. Like literally, it is that. They monologue about it. And so for you to sit here acting so superior to someone trying to analyze and appreciate this indicates that either you haven't seen this season, or you somehow missed this season's tone shift and the theme they beat you over the head with. "
Marcus Level,Armchair lawyers might have made a fuss but real lawyers were also appalled too. It’s almost like you don’t need to pass the bar to see something vile and be appalled.
Marcus Level,"Keep watching, it's really good."
Marcus Level,Season one couldn't have been any more clear about who did it. They didn't face real consequences or get an admission on camera but I felt there was plenty of closure to who drew the dicks. 
Marcus Level,"I thought the lack of closure was genus. As a person who use to watch Unsolved Mysteris and all the hype theory documentires on history channel and discorvery channel when I was a kid, the open ending is something that was always common. "
Marcus Level,"Lack of closure was also a callback to Serial, the ultimate ""we may never know the truth"" true crime situation with teens."
Marcus Level,"""It would be inappropriate for me to say he is a 10... but he is definitely a 9.""

It was too funny. A perfect use of Pony.

And I loved that we never actually found out his name.

Hot Janitor forever."
Marcus Level,he was muscular
Marcus Level,Hot Janitor was one of the best parts of the season. The best was when they went to visit him and he was a totally progressive dreamboat with all his enlightened hipsterishness. And no one ever said the guy's actual name.
Marcus Level,"I agree with your points, but season 2 was so much more emotionally resonant and socially relevant that I'd still give it the edge. Kevin and DeMarcus were deeper characters than Dylan, even if they weren't quite as entertaining or perfectly portrayed."
Marcus Level,"Season 2 got it just by a bit for me in many places. I think it was a better season as a whole and gave a more satisfying answer by the end, which was very important. It also didn't waste any time. Every episode felt earned and exciting. Season 1 had one big problem, and that was it kinda stalling out toward the end. Season 2 didn't have that issue.

However, I 100% agree with your 3rd point. The lack of Peter and Sam in Season 2 hurt a lot. I missed them being a more key element."
Marcus Level,"Agree with you on point 3, especially since Peter made some questionable decisions that ended up harming people. I think they left a lot on the table this season in that regard."
Marcus Level,"I think they actually use the websites, all of the Instagram accounts actually exist and have videos from the show on them."
Marcus Level,"I’m just talking shit. 

Side note: do you know the proper way to drink tea? "
Marcus Level,expect Superbad was made before the iPhone came out
Marcus Level,They did bring on Ming to do their camerawork
Marcus Level,"Last season there was a subplot of them having a falling out and getting back together.

This season they had a bit in one episode where Peter tells Sam to shut up and look at the thing, and the shot lingered on Sam looking upset over it.

Then they had Peter shushing Sam, DeMarcus kinda commented on it, Peter told Sam to shut the trunk of their car and Sam started then and then just stopped.

I dunno, it just kinda felt like they were building tension with them and their roles, and then they didn't follow through past that.

I suppose they could add on and make it a full part of the next season, it just felt to me like they were going to do more with it this season and then just didn't. "
Narcos: Mexico,"> Diego Calva is about to get his big Hollywood break as the star of Damien Chazelle’s upcoming epic “Babylon,” but Netflix subscribers might already be familiar with the relative newcomer thanks to his supporting role on “Narcos: Mexico.” **Calva starred as the Mexican drug lord Arturo Beltran Leyva in six episodes of the show’s third season**, but it appears he’s not too fond of the series. Speaking to GQ magazine, **Calva said he disagrees with how “Narcos: Mexico” represented his country.**


> “**There’s a moment in your career as an actor that you really can’t choose your roles,” Calva said. “You are just grateful that you’re having a job, and ‘Narcos’ is a great show.** But in my case, it’s a little hard because **the way they put the story of my country, I don’t agree at all. There’s a lot of truth and that’s amazing, but there’s a lot of lies, too.**”


> “**I think my country doesn’t need more narco culture and making these guys heroes,” Calva said**, adding that when the show aired on Netflix he remembered thinking to himself, “This is too raw. I don’t know if I really want to keep shooting people.”

> **“Narcos: Mexico,” a companion series to Netflix’s “Narcos,” ran for three seasons and dramatized the true story of Mexico’s illegal drug trade.** The series starred Diego Luna and Michael Peña in leading roles."
Narcos: Mexico,I think that's a fair opinion to have but as the Cunninglynguists said America Loves Gangstas. The mobster/narco trafficante stories will be eternally popular. The Wire ended almost 20 years ago and Baltimore *still* has that shadow looming over it.
Narcos: Mexico,Is there gonna be next season?
Narcos: Mexico,"there's a fucking Narcos Mexico 3? what, when??"
Narcos: Mexico,I feel like I miss out on The Wire.
Narcos: Mexico,"Third season was the last of Narcos Mexico, but the producers are working on a new series starring Sofia Vergara as Griselda Blanco."
Narcos: Mexico,No. Season 3 was the [final season of ‘Narcos: Mexico’.](https://deadline.com/2021/09/narcos-mexico-ending-season-3-netflix-premiere-date-first-look-photos-teaser-released-1234831990/)
Narcos: Mexico,it’s never too late.
Narcos: Mexico,"Wait, they renewed it only now?"
Narcos: Mexico,"since the timelines seem to be matching up pretty well (or not, someone could correct me), maybe we eventually get Pedro Pascal coming back as the lead? 

they teased that he was going to work in Mexico after Narcos S3"
Narcos: Mexico,"I am kinda suprised that it wasn't renewed earlier, but I guess Covid made things more complicated."
Narcos: Mexico,I will miss seeing Diego Luna on my screen. *sigh*
Narcos: Mexico,How are Narcos/Narcos Mexico? I’ve been meaning to watch them and was wondering if it should higher up my list
Narcos: Mexico,Great news. This is as good if not slightly better than narcos
Narcos: Mexico,Wow the elusive season 3 from Netflix. I’m glad cuz narcos is one of their best shows
Narcos: Mexico,AMADO CARRILLO FUENTES
Narcos: Mexico,"FUCK YES ! 

I hope everyone is safe while filming S3, tho. My concerns are that as the story gets closer to now days it'll get more dangerous for the crews to film it.

Btw, by the way it ended, I was completely fine to not be renewed."
Narcos: Mexico,[deleted]
Narcos: Mexico,"Go for it Netflix, this show is shit hot and has the potential to be great as it continues, throw lots more money at it please"
Narcos: Mexico,Fave Netflix show. Great news 😎
Narcos: Mexico,This is awesome. I really thought it wouldn't get renewed due to COVID.
Narcos: Mexico,Can't believe they actually renewed a show I like.
Narcos: Mexico,🎵”......soy el fuego que arde tu piel..”🎵
Narcos: Mexico,Finally some good news
Narcos: Mexico,Give me more Scoot!
Narcos: Mexico,"Oh great news! Now I'm motivated to restart, and actually finished season 2. Gosh I struggled with that one."
Narcos: Mexico,Bring back Scoot McNairy
Narcos: Mexico,"Well, at least they renewed *something* this year."
Narcos: Mexico,I’m excited for the future seasons about that cartel which pushed opiates on Americans through the medical system.
Narcos: Mexico,I wonder if Los Zetas will get introduced. Look them up. The brutality they introduce to the narco world is on another level.
Narcos: Mexico,"I'm guessing they will focus on el chapo for season 3. 

Netflix should start a narcos asia or Europe too."
Narcos: Mexico,Opening credits music is outstanding
Narcos: Mexico,Am I the only one surprised it took this long to get renewed?
Narcos: Mexico,Will this take the crown as the longest running Netflix series?
Narcos: Mexico,and then no more seasons.
Narcos: Mexico,I was afraid that they will cancel it because of pandemic. I love both Narcos shows. If these were in English both show would become more popular in US and win some emmys.
Narcos: Mexico,Glad Netflix didn’t decide to cancel this great show. You know considering they’ve been shooting them selves in the foot here lately.
Narcos: Mexico,Sweet.  It’s a great show
Narcos: Mexico,Wait. There’s a Mexico season 2??
Narcos: Mexico,"The Border trilogy by Don Winslow is awesome. I cannot recommend highly enough.  I listened to all three audiobooks free through my local library.  Dark and powerfully moving 
Covers the same turf as Narcos in infinitely more  detail."
Narcos: Mexico,"Just FYI, reports that Hunter Biden will play a prominent role in the new season are, as of now, unfounded."
Narcos: Mexico,"""Narcos is going to have a very nice 3rd season..... naaat!"""
Narcos: Mexico,yay! I love Narcos!
Narcos: Mexico,For now...
Narcos: Mexico,Cannot wait for them to do some more limited hang outs for the CIA.
Narcos: Mexico,ORALE
Narcos: Mexico,[deleted]
Narcos: Mexico,It's still going on???
Narcos: Mexico,"Loll I'll probably get downvoted to hell but the concept of Narcos really makes me angry

Making anti-heroes out of real life murderers that truly fucked over Colombia and Mexico is tiring. I know I'll hear the argument that ""Well they're the bad guy you're not supposed to root for them"" but this show kicked off of the popularity of Breaking Bad, which as much as it claims to say ""Oh Walt was actually the bad guy"" still leaves people with the impression of ""Wow Walt is such a badass"". It's more forgivable in that series since it's a work of fiction, but I think one could make the argument that Narcos follows in the coattails of Breaking Bad and also arrives at ""Wow Pablo Escobar is such a badass complex character"" 

Which like fuck that, fuck him"
Narcos: Mexico,Terrible to highlight such a terrible social situation in Mexico
Narcos: Mexico,Stop idolizing the cartel and making shows about it.
Narcos: Mexico,Never watched it. Am I missing anything worth while?
Narcos: Mexico,I hate this series.
Narcos: Mexico,No Mindhunter but this trash gets renewed? Blasphemous.
Narcos: Mexico,Narcos Mexico had a season 2!?!?
Narcos: Mexico,"Yes thank you narcos, for glorifying the cartels. You’re not any better than Univision and Telemundo making cheap money with subpar and terrible shows based on cartels for the money. You’re banking off people dying and at the same time glorifying cartels. Don’t @ me."
Narcos: Mexico,This got renewed but Mindhunter did not....
Narcos: Mexico,Mindhunter should have gotten season 3 instead
Narcos: Mexico,Yawn.
Narcos: Mexico,"What a terrible show, I watched it as I loved the original Narcos. I hated this and it was an absolute struggle to watch."
Narcos: Mexico,[deleted]
Narcos: Mexico,Follow me for tarot card readings!!!!!
Narcos: Mexico,Is this going to be the focus on el chapo rise to power? This is undoubtedly going to be very difficult and likely a flop. I feel like it is incredibly difficult to nail El chapo properly. I’ve seen his real life interview and he seems real complex. Both narcos Mexico and the el chapo series don’t properly capture his character. El chapo in narcos Mexico seems like a clown
Narcos: Mexico,"Diego Luna won't be coming back.

TBH I don't know how I feel about this. Wasn't the biggest fan of Season 2, matter of fact I thought it was very much meh, and don't know if its strong enough to hold up for another season. They tied everything up nicely at the end, why continue on with the current arc? Why not move onto some other storyline?"
Narcos: Mexico,"Thought Zero Zero Zero was season 3?

So this is actually season 4??"
Narcos: Mexico,It was not even close to as good as the first 2 seasons of the original series.
Narcos: Mexico,Wanted Mindhunter instead.
Narcos: Mexico,"God season 2 was so depressing. I couldn't finish it at first then I did, and I got super depressed by it. At least season 1 hints at retribution instead, season 2 was just all bad, no good. nothing good happening in season 2."
Narcos: Mexico,But the cancelled Ozark and GLOW.  Fuckin’ sad.
Narcos: Mexico,"I will not watch until they do Narcos US set in the 80s and showcases the CIA pumping the Black community full of drugs while using the money to prop up right win militias in Latin America. I believe Iran was involved too, so it would be a multiracial, multi ethnic endeavorz"
Narcos: Mexico,People are still watching this bullshit but that sexy puppet show got cancelled? SHAME!
Narcos: Mexico,Nice.More propaganda.End the Drug War!
Narcos: Mexico,Fuuuuck this show
Narcos: Mexico,I couldn’t even finish season 2 of narcos. Got too boring and political
Narcos: Mexico,Lol idk if I'm excited or not S3 of Narcos Columbia was a snoozefest don't know if it's going to be exciting watching a guy from his jail cell.
Narcos: Mexico,Does it contain Pedophilia? It must if Netflix wants it on.
Narcos: Mexico,That's one thing we definitely don't need more of here in Mexico. Fuck netflix so much.
Narcos: Mexico,Shit. They can go all the way til know with this shit. It hasn’t changed
Narcos: Mexico,Yes!!!!!
Narcos: Mexico,"Awesome!

I’ve really enjoyed this series. Sure it wasn’t the same as the Pablo Escobar series, but I appreciate that they’re different."
Narcos: Mexico,Just finished season 2. Mega hyped now!
Narcos: Mexico,"Awesome, can't wait."
Narcos: Mexico,aka: the Final Season.
Narcos: Mexico,Bro
Narcos: Mexico,Nice
Narcos: Mexico,Yessss I can’t wait
Narcos: Mexico,Great
Narcos: Mexico,Love this show!
Narcos: Mexico,Hispanic Lucifer
Narcos: Mexico,This they renew...
Narcos: Mexico,What about the Dark Crystal?
Narcos: Mexico,What took so long?
Narcos: Mexico,Nice.... great show
Narcos: Mexico,"So I guess we're entering the phase of El Chapo soon. The story's gonna be in the 90s now. This is great, and pretty concerning too. They lost a crew member during season 2 if I recall correctly. Working in Mexico and making a show about it's evils is a daring job.

Wouldn't mind if season 3 is the last though. Much as I'd love to see Chapo's prison escape, they'd have to push for season 5 and cover drugs in the 00's for that. It would make sense to end the show if they can wrap it up in a logical way. Hopefully Diego Luna is still involved in some way."
Narcos: Mexico,"Maybe I will have to go back and catch up..loved the original Narcos, watched first season of Mexico and it just did not grab me in the same way"
Narcos: Mexico,YESSSSSS
Narcos: Mexico,Do I have to watch Narcos to understand Narcos: Mexico?
Narcos: Mexico,now only if they crossed over into the Ozark universe
Narcos: Mexico,Bring back Pedro pascal
Narcos: Mexico,They are going to catch up with current events and season 4 will be a live filming of the cartels.
The Kominsky Method,How do they plan to finish the show without one of the main actors?  I loved him in it.
The Kominsky Method,"This is really surprising. His role wasn’t ground breaking so I can’t imagine it was too emotionally or physically taxing. I could understand if it was COVID related, but considering it was decided a while back and it’s the final season anyway I’m just confused."
The Kominsky Method,"He's such a great actor,  I love showing people ""Little Miss Sunshine"" for their first time."
The Kominsky Method,I officially don’t care about the final season now. Damn.
The Kominsky Method,What is even the point of third season then? Ridiculous
The Kominsky Method,This is such a downer. Would have been nice to have three consistent seasons. It was the dynamic between Norman and Sandy that made the show so great.
The Kominsky Method,Crap. He's most of the reason I watch the show.
The Kominsky Method,If they'll kill the character it might be interesting to see a side arc of Sandy (Michael Douglas) dealing with the loss of his friend.
The Kominsky Method,"This is Two and a Half Men all over again. 

I'll be on the edge of my seat waiting for Ashton Kutcher(all aged up with silver locks and a moth eaten cardigan) to appear from behind a street corner. 'Hey Sandy, it's me, your age-appropriate buddy from back in your theatre days. The old man dynamic continues!'"
The Kominsky Method,"This year, Bruh."
The Kominsky Method,"Money, money, money, money..... monnnneeeeeeyyy"
The Kominsky Method,Get Bill Hader to play his role.
The Kominsky Method,I feel bad because I legitimately thought Alan Arkin was dead.
The Kominsky Method,He died on the way to his home planet
The Kominsky Method,"Well, he is 86 so maybe he just doesn't feel like working that much."
The Kominsky Method,"Should be showing them The Russians are coming, The Russians are coming. But first watch it yourself."
The Kominsky Method,Check out Wait Until Dark for a young Arkin stalking Audrey Hepburn. Fantastic movie.
The Kominsky Method,Personally I love him in The Slums of Beverly Hills.
The Kominsky Method,Absolutely. Arkin had the best lines and was actually the pivotal role in the series. Without him there's little point in the series.
The Kominsky Method,Paul Reiser is in it. That's really all I need. It's so much fun to watch him act.
The Kominsky Method,I liked it but I’m not motivated to watch season 3 without Alan Arkin.  Best part of the show IMHO.
The Kominsky Method,"It's always getting nominated for awards, but I've never met anyone IRL who watches or knows this show."
The Kominsky Method,Great show. Easy watch.
The Kominsky Method,This show is outstanding! It’s a shame more people don’t know about it...
The Kominsky Method,"15h, 27 comments, noone managed to describe this show other than ""comedy about life"". Maybe this is why it's unpopular? No identity?

Anyone wants to try describe it more accurately?"
The Kominsky Method,Agree. One of my favorite shows but going to be strange without Alan Arkin….he was hilarious.
The Kominsky Method,"This show is incredibly relaxing and funny to watch, sad that it ended but it was a nice conclusion. I am wondering if there are any other shows with similar vibe?"
The Kominsky Method,"Just saw this show is written by Chuck Lorre of The Big Bang Theory and Two and a Half Men fame, which makes me very skeptical... Is it like those two shows?"
The Kominsky Method,Thanks for this post. I will definitely check it out.
The Kominsky Method,It got 3 seasons it must be somewhat popular.
The Kominsky Method,I'm watching! I'm at the end of season 1 and loving it. It's both funny and sad at the same time.
The Kominsky Method,"I'm watching it for the third time.  It's brilliant.  The writing is superb:  rich characters with real issues anyone can relate to, hysterical dialogue and actual thoughtful takes on life, ambition, success, failure and an enduring friendship.  The acting -- right across the board -- is wonderful.

I thought it would take a serious hit from Arkin departing but the dynamic between Douglas and Turner was also so wonderful that it filled the void.

People who are missing it are really missing the best of entertainment available."
The Kominsky Method,"Just finished season one, definitely a hidden gem."
The Kominsky Method,Mennnnn
The Kominsky Method,It reminded of After Life with Ricky Gervais. I prefer After Life.
The Kominsky Method,"Doesn’t seem like my cup of tea…but on the other hand, I didn’t think Ted Lasso was going to be anything I’d watch and I wound up loving it. Might give it a try."
The Kominsky Method,Brilliant. High quality across all 3 seasons
The Kominsky Method,[deleted]
The Kominsky Method,He is so good in this show
The Kominsky Method,I immediately recognized his voice as Paul Reiser but it took abit for the rest of my brain to catch up with his appearance
The Kominsky Method,"He was one of my favorite parts of the show too, but >!showing how Sandy deals with the loss of Norman!< makes for a really good season, and there’s some powerful moments in there as is common with this show. I definitely thought it was still worth watching this third season for sure."
The Kominsky Method,"Arkin is my favorite part of the show, but I still thought season 3 was pretty good. Turner and Reiser step up to fill the void."
The Kominsky Method,"I had the same thoughts, but season 3 turned out to be great as well. Great writing from start to finish."
The Kominsky Method,It's a bummer but they fill the hole with more Paul Reiser... so no complaints.
The Kominsky Method,My mom likes it
The Kominsky Method,it's a boomer show.  i couldn't stomach 10 minutes of the horrible acting and unfunny attempts at funny.
The Kominsky Method,Because we don't want to see old Boomers complaining about their lives.
The Kominsky Method,"I've only seen it in passing, but it's essentially about a has-been actor who teaches an acting class and his relationship with his daughter and his friend/agent. It didn't seem overly sentimental. Might be a pretty decent show to relax to."
The Kominsky Method,"It's not remotely like those shows. I remember seeing Lorre's name on the end credits after I was several episodes in, and I could not believe this show was written by that guy."
The Kominsky Method,"There's an occasional sophomoric joke, but in general it's not like those shows. You'd never guess Chuck Lorre was in charge of this show by just watching it."
The Kominsky Method,I've only caught it in passing but it is nothing like those shows at all
The Kominsky Method,"TAHM is the worst sitcom ever imo, and I stopped liking TBBT in my senior year of high school. So it is definitely not like those two, and I was surprised it was written by C. Lorre when I had found out"
The Kominsky Method,"It's like those shows it they had shorter runs, bigger filming budgets, and were more influenced by Curb Your Enthusiasm.  Not nearly as absurd, but moments of similar tone in between more dramatic departures.

I challenge the ""true original"" claim.  They even dressed Michael Douglas like Larry David."
The Kominsky Method,I'm grateful for both of them.
The Kominsky Method,"Wasn’t that the point of those speeches? To show how something that’s supposed to be beautiful and respectful doesn’t always end up going the way we think it will? Especially when you’re life was surrounded by characters like these. 

I don’t get what’s so unrealistic about the house sitter (for the neighbor, not *the* neighbor)?"
The Kominsky Method,"I'd say the rest of the season is more like the prior seasons than the first episode was, but I also didn't have a huge problem with the first episode."
The Kominsky Method,I had no idea and after Red Oaks it’s all I need!
The Kominsky Method,I had to look it up just to make sure.
The Kominsky Method,Why would he decide not to be in it any more? Its a very small cast. Short episodes.  Too much work for him? I’m just an everyday average guy asking.
The Kominsky Method,"A really big part of the show is about aging and all the things that come with it. Illness, death, loneliness, etc. I clicked on it on a whim and ended up watching the whole thing in like 3 days. It was a really easy watch and I found it super entertaining. I can understand if some people are not enthralled by the idea of two old guys talking about how hard it is to pee, but it's a good show."
The Kominsky Method,"Wow it's not even close to being the worst sitcom ever, and I don't even like it."
The Kominsky Method,"Way late, but seems like he’s okay not doing acting for the moment and was always planning to be done after two seasons 

https://decider.com/2021/05/28/the-kominsky-method-why-did-alan-arkin-leave/"
The Kominsky Method,"I should have written ""worst sitcom from the most popular ones"" which is what I meant"
The Kominsky Method,Like it a lot. I've watched all two seasons and want more.
The Kominsky Method,"This show seems to get a lot of critical acclaim, yet has had zero marketing or advertising. Whats up with it?"
The Kominsky Method,"Everything was great, acting, dialogue, chemistry all top notch. It took me a sec to recognize Paul Reiser though that threw me for a loop"
The Kominsky Method,I hope there will be. It's great mix of laughter and heart worming story.
The Kominsky Method,"Great show, really well written. I'd watch Alan Arkin in anything tbh."
The Kominsky Method,Loved it. I really think Alan Arkin steals the show. That guy had me laughing all the way through
The Kominsky Method,"I love the chemistry between Douglas and Arkin. Without it, the show wouldn't have worked."
The Kominsky Method,I like it a lot. Easily digestible and the two leads are great.
The Kominsky Method,"On season 2, loving it."
The Kominsky Method,"It's pretty excellent, and I adore Douglas and Arkin as two pals sticking by each other at that stage of life. Can't wait for the next season!"
The Kominsky Method,"Great, funny, heartwarming comedy. Loved it."
The Kominsky Method,I like it.
The Kominsky Method,"Watched it on a whim a while ago, for no other reason than I love Michael Douglas. I think the only thing of Arkin's I'd seen before was Glengarry Glen Ross, but this show made me love him, too. Douglas and Arkin had great chemistry together.

And I was completely bowled over when, several episodes in, I noticed in the end credits that this was a Chuck Lorre show. No other show he's made has been a tenth as good as this."
The Kominsky Method,"I LOVED it.     I joined the subreddit!   So reminded me of Curb Your Enthusiasm crossed with Barry!!    I can't wait for season 3!!!     

The show has been nominated for lots of awards (Michael Douglas won a Golden Globe in 2019 I think).       I'm surprised it's not more well known."
The Kominsky Method,"I'm cautiously interested in it, due to it being a Chuck Lorre show.

All apologies to Chuck, but he does not create good comedy television and probably owes several apologies for Bing Bang Theory."
The Kominsky Method,Can't wait for next seasons.
The Kominsky Method,"As usual Netflix focuses only on promoting their very few flagship shows, letting most of their very good shows fly under the radar and eventually be canceled."
The Kominsky Method,"I don't know why it is so. I myself discovered it on IMDb while browsing through another show under 'More like this' area.
May be it has something to do with the theme of the show 'cause the show creator is the same guy who did The Big Bang Theory. But its so spontaneous & great, I just don't know why people should not watch it."
The Kominsky Method,Same here. Had to look up the IMDb page of the show to find out who Martin was.
The Kominsky Method,The spontaneity with which he delivers his lines is so amazing!
The Kominsky Method,Couldn't agree more. I'd recommend you watch Alan Arkin in Little Miss Sunshine.
The Kominsky Method,I was really surprised that this was a Chuck Lorre series. It's clever and funny-I don't know why he hasn't been writing like this all along.
The Kominsky Method,You read my mind.
The Kominsky Method,Maybe it doesn't need much because many people watch it. Who knows.
The Kominsky Method,Do all other providers promote all content exactly evenly?
The Kominsky Method,Totally agree.
The Kominsky Method,I hope it gets renewed.
The Kominsky Method,Binged it in one sitting. Excellent show and thoroughly looking forward to more.
The Kominsky Method,Agreed. It's only 8 episodes of 25-30 minutes each - basically an extra long movie.  Some great moments in the show.  
The Kominsky Method,"I thought it was fucking awesome the whole way through. I can't believe people are NOT talking about this show. It's like somebody took the show ""Barry"" and just mixed it with the movie ""Wonder Boys"". I'll be seriously bummed if it doesn't get a second season. "
The Kominsky Method,"When do they become roommate? I've watched all 8 episodes, and they both have their own house/apartment. One lives in a big house, the other seems to live in the building that he owns and teaches from(I think?).

I've enjoyed it, and I would have liked more than 8 episodes."
The Kominsky Method,"It's more than worth a look.   If we weren't bingeing This Is Us, my wife and I would have finished this show.   Michael Douglas and Alan Arkin are fabulous. Elliot Gould is really funny as a fictional version of himself trying to push a Taken ripoff.  Lisa Edelman is great as well.  "
The Kominsky Method,Three episodes in and really enjoying it.
The Kominsky Method,"this show is so fucking good, this is hbo level good"
The Kominsky Method,If you like crying and laughing then this is your show. 
The Kominsky Method,It is sad to see it got no attentions just because the main characters are old men.  It is probaly the best sitcom I have ever watched.  Looking for season 2.
The Kominsky Method,So sort of like Grace and Frankie?
Dogs,"Was really excited by the title, thinking Tom Waits. Disappointed a little that it's nothing to do with him. Still, sounds funny and I watch a lot of Brit TV, so definitely interested!"
Dogs,"Two episodes in i'm really starting to like this show.
 The setting feels really grounded while the characters feel like more heightened versions of people you would actually find there. I mean,most of what's been on display could be played as hardcore drama, but it's in how you sense this is a curated story,that there's a storyteller who doesn't mean you any harm, it almost turns into comforting television thh

Doesn't hurt I laughed a lot"
Dogs,I can't stand waiting a week for the next episode!!!
Dogs,My favorite Tom Waits album.
Dogs,"Just from first episode it's like a UK version of Maid but instead of housecleaning, it's sex work."
Dogs,Would be great to have some sort of Tom Waits anthology series populated by characters from his songs.
Dogs,Spoiler much?
Dogs,"Well now I'm so psyched for E4 after just seeing E3. A big house in Brunton, did I spell that right?"
Dogs,"It's really great! One of my top three. I like Foreign Affairs and Swordfishtrombones slightly more but all are desert island records for me, for sure."
Dogs,I'd watch that show.
Dogs,"It's hard for me to not say Nighthawks for him. That is just a perfect record to put on during a relaxing evening. Dim the lights a bit, grab a drink, and just kinda feel like you're in an intimate club listening to the band."
Dogs,"""The coffee wasn't strong enough to defend itself, hehehehe""  
  
I bloody love Nighthawks. His laugh is the greatest."
Dogs,I used to work in northern Alberta driving a pick up around rig sites at night during the winter. That album kept me from feeling lonely during those long cold stretches. Absolutely perfect for the atmosphere. Same with The Heart of Saturday Night.
Dogs,Aho young warrior!
Dogs,"I started calling people shit-ass because of this show. 

Aho young warrior."
Dogs,Skoden!

Dogs,"Stath Lets Flats for more Nadja lol

But yeah, I really liked the show. I didn't have Hulu for a long time but this was always on my list of stuff to watch when I got it... then they had the Black Friday sale for 12 months for $2 a month... so I just recently started watching."
Dogs,"I love it! Season 2 was my favourite season of TV from last year. Pretty much every episode had me on the verge of crying, and also laughing hard. Mabel and Offerings are two 10/10 episodes of tv. The show is constantly surprising and incredibly unique, such a great cast, and the characters are treated with an incredible amount of care. Can’t wait for season three!"
Dogs,It’s fantastic
Dogs,I'll have to give this show a look......I'm close to finishing up WWDITS right now and just watched Flight of the Conchords last month.  I seem to enjoy just about anything Taika Waititi is involved with.
Dogs,It’s such a great show! Season 2 blew me away every single episode. The episode where Willie Jack went to see Hokti especially tore my heart up in the best way!
Dogs,"Season one, hunting episode - it has a flashback of the character who took his own life chatting to his uncle. There isn't a line that makes it explicit how unwell he is, but his sadness just radiates from the scene. I think think about it to this day. Special show."
Dogs,">I've been on a Taika binge (and anything including actors from WWDITS

But have you seen [**Stath Lets Flats**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8GMVFbNKBM)? ;) It stars Natasia Demetriou (Nadja) alongside her brother (who is the main character, Stath), plus Al Roberts, who guest stars in an episode of WWDITS as Guillermo's boyfriend who is cloned and eventually falls in love with himself. Similar energy as Flight of the Conchords but with more unlikeable characters. Sort of like FOTC meets The Office."
Dogs,"Jojo Rabbit might be my favorite piece of media from Taika, immediately followed by Reservation Dogs."
Dogs,Yes it's a great show can't wait for the next season.
Dogs,This is the most snubbed show I have ever seen in terms of awards. It has yet to win a single award for its second season
Dogs,About time you shit ass
Dogs,"I really tried to like this show, especially being such a big fan of Waititi's work. I'm not sure what I'm missing, since so much of it it ""should"" work. All the pieces are there for it to mean something, but I dunno. What is it you all get that makes it such a good show? Welcome any and all perspectives!"
Dogs,"It's a great one. 

I found it incredibly accessible and emotional. Rooting for all of those kids. Such great characters. 

Personally, I didn't like the title. Thought it was a restaurant competition reality show when I first heard the name. But hey, what's a title?"
Dogs,At first I thought you spelled “Reservoir Dogs” wrong…
Dogs,"I enjoyed it, but I found it mid"
Dogs,Why can’t you believe it?
Dogs,"Thought this was the Tarantino movie Reservoir dogs, it made the text really confusing until understood id ""corrected"" the spelling to a whole other thing."
Dogs,Anyone have similar shows to suggest?   Betty on HBO was somewhat similar (not as stellar though)
Dogs,"The episode where bear gets the construction job with the cranberry juice tik Tok guy made me bawl my eyes out.

Such a good show. Hilarious, heartfelt, unique, excellent music, Bobby Lee. It's got it all."
Dogs,Happy to hear your review. I have very similar taste to you and have been keeping this one on hold for a rainy day.
Dogs,"The guy that plays the spirit guide also has some skits on a YT channel.

https://youtu.be/xJ89HBfaLs4

Edit: Another one- https://youtu.be/wRc0aTK0YoY"
Dogs,Shit ass.
Dogs,This guy had me in a laughing fit every time he was on screen. His comedic timing is something else.
Dogs,Low key my fav character
Dogs,Studis!
Dogs,I'd watch paint dry if Willie Jack did the commentary.
Dogs,"Seriously. That episode with all the ""Aunties"" going to that convention. That's a show with like 5 seasons right there."
Dogs,Desperately need a Spirit Guide show that's him just bothering a new person every week for 30 minutes before they accidentally learn a lesson.
Dogs,">verge of crying

Cheese in the group home."
Dogs,"> Can’t wait for season three!

I hope season 3 is just as good as the first two. The season 2 finale really felt like a great place to leave the show, entirely. I always worry when shows push past a great season finale."
Dogs,It was bittersweet watching both the Reservation Dogs and TLOU finale back to back last night. Always a great feeling experiencing such great shows/movies but then you're left with waiting on more/knowing you can't watch it for the first time again.
Dogs,"When you finish res dogs, check out Our Flag Means Death!"
Dogs,"On the other hand, we probably should also acknowledge that the co-creator and showrunner of *Reservation Dogs* is **Sterlin Harjo**, and that [he deserves the lions' share of the praise](https://variety.com/2023/tv/markets-festivals/reservation-dogs-sterlin-harjo-showrunner-award-scad-tvfest-1235500955/) here. While Waititi's name is undoubtedly what got FX to open up their checkbooks, and he co-created and works on the show, Harjo's the one guiding the ship: just look at [the writing and directing credits for the show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservation_Dogs#Season_1_(2021))."
Dogs,"So going forwards, you know not to worry about what does and doesn't get an award. Just enjoy what you like."
Dogs,It isn't really his show.  His co-producer Harjo is really the showrunner here.  Waititi is more in support. And that is a good decision because Harjo is from Oklahoma and you can tell the show actually understands the culture it is depicting. I love how they censor owl eyes.
Dogs,"I love the show, but I can’t slam through the episodes like I can other shows. I think the show requires earnest attention and can’t be absorbed passively. That’s how it is for me, but I’m sure others are happy to binge it. It will make you crack up, but it’s not trying to make you laugh every minute."
Dogs,"> I really tried to like this show, especially being such a big fan of Waititi's work

I went into it thinking it was going to be a lot more like Waititi's other stuff. Res Dogs is not. There's a lot less comedy and a lot more heavy drama aspects to it. And it's definitely less silly than something like Our Flag Means Death or What We Do in the Shadows.

> What is it you all get that makes it such a good show?

For me, the two things I like most about it are:

1. Native culture. I know almost nothing about Native American culture or Res life and I really enjoy learning about other cultures or ways of life via fictional TV/movies (hopefully it was at least semi-accurate). My wife and I made fry bread tacos the other night and it was a great way to connect with the show more.
2. The characters feel pretty real. The show doesn't have me sitting on the edge of my seat with intense action or drama, but I do feel like I can connect with the characters a lot because they and their situations are all pretty relatable.

All that said, it's not my *favorite* show, but I did really enjoy it."
Dogs,"The fact that it's based on truths even if a lil embellished at parts. If you live on the Rez or have ever visited a friend, you can tell this show is 100% up front and real with it"
Dogs,I'd also like to know. I watched the first ~half of the first season and was bored to tears. It was so different than all the hype I'd been hearing that I honestly thought I'd watched the wrong show or something. Dunno.
Dogs,"yeah as a fan of Waititi's stuff, I have no clue why so many people are into this show. Everything happening in the show feels inconsequential or cliche. I want to like it, since it deals with Natives but Idk."
Dogs,"Odd, i feel like pretty much everyone would confuse the title with Reservation Dogs not some reality restaurant show."
Dogs,You weren't the only one.
Dogs,I really loved Somebody Somewhere
Dogs,Ramy !
Dogs,You might like Blindspotting (Starz) (2021)
Dogs,"More commonly spelled ""Stoodis"". \[grin\]

Cracked me the hell up that *Rutherford Falls* (which [shared writers, cast, and a director with *Reservation Dogs*](https://www.imdb.com/search/name/?roles=tt13623580,tt11058054)*,* because the Indigenous talent pool Hollywood knows is *that* small) [had episodes titled ""Skoden"" and ""Stoodis.""](https://www.epguides.com/RutherfordFalls/)"
Dogs,[deleted]
Dogs,The dance scene in their heads then flashing to what it really looked like was absolutely hilarious.
Dogs,"Ya that's why I like the show, it feels very familiar. I'm from Texas and recognize a lot of characteristics of people I hung out with growing up in this show."
Dogs,"That tracks. Makes sense why it doesn't have the same snap that Waititi's stuff usually does and why it's more dramatic. I've not seen any of Harjo's features, but the descriptions are pretty heavy."
Dogs,I'll try watching one or two at a time and see if that helps.
Dogs,I'll try watching it through a dramatic lens and see if that helps.
Dogs,"Yeah, I thought it was some silly Gordon Ramsey competition show trying to be 'edge' and aping off of ""Reservoir Dogs."" 

But my mind goes to these places with titles. I don't think it's bad title, I was just confused for a second, as those competition shows titles like to be cute. ""Face Off"" and ""Drag Race"" and the like."
Dogs,That's another show where everyone feels like real people. Tough losing such a main character going into this season. It will be interesting to see how they deal with it.
Dogs,"Dark Winds is almost this (well minus the comedy part), same actor in the main role and Jackie is also in the cast. Season 1 came out last year and I'm pretty sure more is coming."
Dogs,"Both seasons have had episodes that have heartbreaking moments, mixed with some hilarious comedy in the span of thirty minutes. It’s truly a special show."
Dogs,Dallas Goldtooth (Spirit Warrior) needs to be nominated for best supporting actor in a comedy series.  Damm I love his scenes.
Dogs,This show is a freaking GEM. I love it so much.
Dogs,I don’t know if I can take darker…the show breaks my heart so often already
Dogs,Hope they cover California Indians before leaving the state. And cover the non-local residents and non-rez Indians who where forced from their land to another state and some from that state left or were forced to move to California. I say this because I am part of the Okla Chahta Clan of California where my great grandmother and grandmother moved to work during the WW2 war effort. So we have Small pockets inside of small pockets who still live in Cali.
Dogs,The whole cast is stellar; but ANYTHING with Zahn  McClarnon in it and I’m watching.
Dogs,">But Harjo says not to worry — “Reservation Dogs” remains a comedy, and a show that aims to tell the rarely seen, yet truly relatable story of the Native community.

I've really enjoyed the first 2 seasons and trust those guys know what they're doing. Looking forward to the new season!"
Dogs,I got misty during the scene on the beach in the season 2 finale and it’s pretty rare for me to get that affected by a show. Love this series and hope the next season is just as good.
Dogs,">I wanted to make a show that was very culturally specific, but could resonate with the world and have very universal themes. I think that’s the best of storytelling when you can kind of hit that mark.

Yes!  This is what made the show special, and what makes a lot of good shows special.  The details are intriguing for some and familiar for others, but they ring true, and themes cross ages and life experiences."
Dogs,"I fucking love this show, I'm absolutely pumped for season 3!"
Dogs,"Season 2, particularly the second half of it, was SO much better than I ever expected it to be. Honestly one of my favorite things of the whole 2022. And that year housed The Bear, more Barry, and The Rehearsal which are all arguably masterpiece level media."
Dogs,So many shows lately have had a great balance in early seasons then decide to get darker and I get that they want to lean into the emotional writing but most of the shows I’m watching now can be so depressing
Dogs,and i will be watching!
Dogs,"Oh I suspect so, they made it off the Rez and all the way to LA. Welcome to the wretched world of the white man."
Dogs,Darker than what it already is and I'll break down crying each episode.
Dogs,It's pretty emotional already so I guess more is ok. Great show.
Dogs,It def needs to be darker to live up to reservoir dogs
Dogs,"Season 1 was awesome, season 2 started good but turned disappointing. I like the show, I just hope they do better, the strength is in the comedy."
Dogs,"I thought season one was amazing then two while still good lost a lot of it's heart until towards the end. Also I disliked how they started over using shit ass in season 2. In season one it's mostly just the cop who says it, then everyone is saying it in season 2. That's a minor gripe though. Still a great show."
Dogs,jeez the whole show has been relatively dark so far. how much more do they want me to cry?!
Dogs,"I enjoyed both seasons, not sure we need a 3rd."
Dogs,"Just going through the second season now and im loving it. There is so much emotionally story telling here. I'm also enjoying see more of a culture I didn't grow up around and that doesn't get a whole lot of representation in media.

This along with dark winds has been great proof as to why that needs to change"
Dogs,A'ho! Bad news young warrior
Dogs,Skoden shitasses
Dogs,"I love that about the show - you never know what you're going to get,  but it's always great. It just feels genuine, because life can be messy, sad and funny at the same time."
Dogs,"I’m a grown man and every episode has made me lol, and every season has had me in tears."
Dogs,"“Ah the old Indian saying, Show up and everyone will know how you feel!” So many good lines (might not be remembering it exact)"
Dogs,"That dude makes me crack up when he shows up, because I know he is about to do something great."
Eternal Love,Sometimes i wish i could watch buffy with everyone for their first time. 
Eternal Love,You are definitely in for a few more treats. One of my favorites is “Hush” out of season 4. Happy watching :)
Eternal Love,"One of my favorite lines from that episode is Giles saying ""It's the end of the world""

everyone: ""again?"""
Eternal Love,Season 3 might be the best season. 
Eternal Love,I left that episode thinking Xander saved the world! If he hadn't saved the high school from blowing up wouldn't they all have died?
Eternal Love,"When the villain makes his exit speech about how he'll be back, only to meet Oz."
Eternal Love,"Welcome to the family fellow Watcher. I too have been a lifelong Xander fan and would get into heated arguments about B/X vs B/A at the school lunch table.

Sharp eyed viewers will notice that the creature they were fighting in the library [Spoiler](#s ""was the same one that the Master summoned up through the Library floor during the season 1 finale."")

What Cordelia failed to mention about Zeppo Marx was that he brought balance to the act as the ""[straight man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_man)"". He was an extremely talented actor, that would often take on Groucho's roles on stage when he was needed, with the audience none the wiser. 

Xander does all these things, by being the average man in a group of witches, super humans, and supernatural secret agents. He takes on the ""role"" of the hero by confronting Jack and preventing the explosion with the first stringers none the wiser. Much like Zeppo playing Groucho so effectively the audience aka Cordelia and the rest of the Scooby Gang are none the wiser.

 I would say this episode and The Pack are the best Xander-centric episodes of the season 1-3."
Eternal Love,Buffy is one of the top 10 shows of the 90s. A classic
Eternal Love,"Buffy is my favourite show of all time dude and that episode is great. It really shows Xanders heart and guts and yes, is hilarious!"
Eternal Love,"Not a spoiler, but my take on the, potentially, very best line of the whole show:

[Xander, don't speak latin infront of the books](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyPhX-geVfw)


which is another great example of them making fun of themselves, yet staying entirely in-character and in-world


Also, have tissues ready when you get up to s5e16. Gets me every time. Every. Time."
Eternal Love,Joss Whedon also made dollhouse which is pretty good and short and worth a watch
Eternal Love,Once More With Feeling and Tabula Rasa!
Eternal Love,"Angel is the best thing to come out of Buffyverse for me. Redemption, the absurdity of fighting the good fight, living with remorse without letting it define you, and defying the meaninglessness of existence through helping others are all themes super close to my heart."
Eternal Love,"I had to watch ""Hush"" for one of my film classes and it was amazing"
Eternal Love,I rate this discussion 5x5!
Eternal Love,Are you going to watch Angel too?
Eternal Love,"Just wait until you reach Once More With Feeling. 

I wouldn't put Buffy in my top 5 favourite shows overall, but if i had to rank individual episodes of all TV, I would absolutely argue that it is one of the greatest episodes of TV ever aired, and easily top three. "
Eternal Love,"There's a comic from Boom! Studios that relaunches the Buffy saga in the present - that is, it's 2019 and Buffy just met Willow and Xander at Sunnydale High.

First issue just dropped a month ago; second is coming in 3 weeks. Trade paperback of the first 4 drops in May."
Eternal Love,Mileage may vary. You begin to either keep liking Xander here or start hating him. The whole point of the episode was that we don’t know if his POV was actually how it occurred. Is he like that all the time? I don’t think it was meant to be answered.
Eternal Love,Great episode but unfortunately Xander actually goes way downhill as the show goes on. I don't know if it's the writing itself or if it's just weird seeing the actor look so noticeably older that it's downright creepy to see him still being a complete dope. Especially while everyone else goes through so many changes. By the time the show ended I couldn't stand him. He's like a hybrid of Ace Ventura and Chandler. 
Eternal Love,"I hope you're not reading the comments in this post, spoilers everywhere."
Eternal Love,Wait till you watch the episode “The Body” the most gut wrenching thing of media I have ever seen.
Eternal Love,The show was quite self aware.. 
Eternal Love,"Season six: Once more with feeling. Also willow. I can’t say anything else other than willow. And also silence. Just, silence. Point is you’ve got a lot of great moments coming your way. "
Eternal Love,You haven't seen Hush yet.  
Eternal Love,The Gentlemen still gives me the creeps nearly 20 years later.
Eternal Love,I wish I could re watch this show for the first time again. It's an experience. You're going to keep loving it but now you've made me want to re watch season 3 for the 10th time :)
Eternal Love,"What makes it for me is that Xander sets the stage for what I feel to be he central theme of the show.  The only power the good guys need is the choice they make every day to fight.

Buffy has her moments but she always rallies.  Spike and Angel rally.  Willow.  Giles.  Every single character in that show is in the gang not for their power but for their choice to be there.

Xander's stakes seem lower but in the context, he has the heaviest burden.  He has no super power.  No training.  But he didnt need to be an undead monster or a slayer or anything; he called a dead man's bluff.  He survived where many would not.

Best goddamn swinging balls moment I've seen in television right there lol."
Eternal Love,My personal favorite episode is “Ted”. Hot damn that one creeped me out. 
Eternal Love,"""I like the quiet."""
Eternal Love,Buffy is still prob my favorite show ever
Eternal Love,People raved about The Zeppo but I never really saw why but Buffy was brilliant. Shame they haven't done a Blu-ray set.
Eternal Love,"I ended up liking angel a ton more. Buffy got to preachy at a point and kept falling for dumb shit. Less importantly i HATE when they call significant others ""honeys"""
Eternal Love,"Buffy is unique for simultaneously knowing how to be so bad it's good and so good it's good. I don't know how they toed the line so perfectly, but they did. "
Eternal Love,Buffy. They just don't make them like that anymore. 
Eternal Love,"I started watching when every episode was added to Facebook Watch, and I’ve been laughing so much at the dialogue. Joss Whedon is a master of comedy and oddball writing. Angel is also loads of fun to watch.

I feel like I can relate to Xander a lot, except my awkwardness isn’t as charming and my snark isn’t nearly as good. Watching “The Zeppo” was a huge encouragement to me that I don’t have to waste time trying to be someone I’m not. Well worth rewatching. 

"
Eternal Love,Fun fact - Joss Whedon modeled the character of Xander Harris after himself according to commentary.
Eternal Love,Oh man you're only 2 and a half seasons in? You're in for a rollercoaster. 
Eternal Love,"Yup, that show was one of the greatest I've ever seen."
Eternal Love,One of the best television shows ever made. Rewatching it nowadays in glorious 1080p is amazing 
Eternal Love,"I'm extremely jealous that you get to experience this show for the first time.

Also season 3 is my favorite.

Also definitely check out Angel The Series, I actually like it more than Buffy."
Eternal Love,r/buffy 
Eternal Love,“The Zeppo” and “Earshot” are my 2 favorite episodes 
Eternal Love,"Buffy is one of my favorite shows of all time, so I wholeheartedly agree. That episode is super funny and insightful.

I always compare Xander to Ron from Harry Potter and how Xander is everything that Ron should have been. Xander is just so perfectly lovable in how he has to overcome his insecurities, but I don't want to spoil anything for you. He really puts in an effort. Suffice it to say, Xander is one of my favorite characters in all of fiction, while Ron is... not."
Eternal Love,“Band Candy” and “Tabula Rasa” are my favorites. Happy watching!
Eternal Love,Season 3 of Buffy is their peak.  You are in for some good times
Eternal Love,I love Spike and the musical. Ugh. I wish I could watch this series again with fresh eyes. Maybe in a couple of years. 
Eternal Love,"My favourite episode is with The Gentlemen and their crazy sidekicks where everyone’s voices are trapped in the box. 

When I was way younger my sister would watch it all the time and I decided to watch with her and that particular episode freaked me out so bad I couldn’t sleep that night because of their grins. "
Eternal Love,"Buffy is, if not my favorite show of all time, definitely in the top three. The dialogue alone is fabulous, but there are so, so many good things about it. Also - seasons 1 and 2 are, for my money, by far and away the weakest seasons of the show. It only gets better from here (with the exception of large parts of season 5 - and before anyone says it, obviously there is one episode in that season that is possibly the best episode of television ever made, but the season arc as a whole is very, very weak). 

About Xander, though - I get where you're coming from, but I think as you continue forward in the series you'll find that Xander may, in fact, be the most important member of the gang. True, he doesn't have anything supernatural or superhuman going for him - which is what makes him so exceptional and arguably the bravest one of the bunch. He represents the humanity of the entire cast, even the non-humans. The Zeppo is one of the first episodes that showcases this aspect of Xander's character, because while all the other drama of the world ending (again) is going on with everyone else, what Xander is doing ends up being equally important to saving the day even though right until the end it seems mostly unrelated. This is over-highlighted in The Zeppo, but it's there in any episode he features in (the end of season 4 comes to mind, as does the fight with Caleb in season 7, for those who understand such references). Even if his only contributions are snarky, silly comments and bungling, somehow Xander brings the rest of the cast some insight into themselves or, if nothing else, Xander is always there for his friends. All the main members of the scooby gang are human and they're all friends (yes, I'm excluding vampires here), but they all wield some kind of power that makes them more - Buffy's strength, Willow's magic, Giles' knowledge and experience. Xander's main weapon, though, is friendship and his love for his friends. He maintains the cohesion of the group, and if the group lost that, none of them would last very long on the hellmouth. They might survive without a watcher, without a witch, and even without a slayer - but they cannot survive without their Zeppo. 

Anyway, that's my little rant about Xander and why he should never be anybody's butt-monkey. Also, he has all the best sweaters, so... you know. Do with that information what you will. "
Eternal Love,"The Zeppo is probably my fav episode. Xander is the character I related to the most in the show, especially his story arcs in later seasons. "
Eternal Love,The yellow crayon speech! You are in for it.
Eternal Love,Yess!! I periodically rewatch Buffy and it gets better every time. Once More with Feeling is my all-time favorite ❤️
Eternal Love,Wesley Wyndem-Pryce had one of the best character arcs on television.
Eternal Love,It is my favorite show of all time. Xander is the heart of the scooby gang. He is the human of the gang. The best of the show is yet to come for you. I definitely recommend to start watching Angel one ep after Buffy S4 for contextual crossovers. There are more eps that are 'verbal crossovers' than actual. The actual crossovers are some of the best of the series. 
Eternal Love,Hit me up after they are all silent and once more with feeling oh and there are bunch of other shit I want you to see.  Like how people deal with loss.   Enjoy it.  Great show.  Sticks with it.  We all should have scoobies.   
Eternal Love,I started watching the show in syndication in season 3.  The Zeppo is the episode that convinced me that the show is something special.
Eternal Love,"There’s seems to be an episode of a TV series that you start that you are liking, that suddenly everything clicks. You understand all the characters and how they respond and what is important to them and once you’re at that point, that becomes your favorite episode of the series. That’s my hypothesis anyway. "
Eternal Love,It is incredible. I have seen this show more times than I can count. The pairing of Helpless (what women go through) and The Zeppo (the male version) is so perfect. 
Eternal Love,"Omg, I wish I had the opportunity to watch Buffy for the first time again. "
Eternal Love,Absolutely one of my favourite shows. I used to watch the show with my dad and brother growing up and I remember the episode and remember not paying too much attention with this one. On a rewatch later on (a few years ago now) I have to rate this ep as one of my top 5!
Eternal Love,"I watched The Zeppo as it first aired and it immediately became my favorite episode.  I watched the entire series and it still never was toppled as king of them all, in my book.

I just loved how clever it was.  It was a normal Buffy episode, but seen through the eyes of a side character (and one who offered nothing special to the group)."
Eternal Love,"Xander is good, it is known."
Eternal Love,"Oh come on. S02E14. Linoleum line and ""No weapon forged by man""."
Eternal Love,I am one of the few people that think Angel is better. If you want to learn more about the episode https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOSEc9p62k0
Eternal Love,"I’ve only watched one episode and it freaked me the fuck out as a kid, but I can’t remember what series or episode number it is.

There’s a monster that hides on the ceiling in the dark, and... well that’s about all I remember. It’s given me a complex throughout life about looking up in the dark.

Anyone know what episode I’m talking about so I can rewatch and hopefully not be so scared? Lay my demons to rest so to speak.

Edit: The Queller Demon? According to google. And now I’m scared again."
Eternal Love,Loved The Zeppo. 
Eternal Love,"How strange, I watched this last night and totally agree! Through my own stupidity, I didn't quite get the ""worst apocalypse ever"" was more of a plot joke. It was actually the Buffy / Angel convo you mentioned that made it click, ""I can't watch you die again!"" OH HEY

Everyone listing their best episodes, I get it, but this was one that was almost a spoof and so different because of it. "
Eternal Love,"What I found interesting is that Joss WHedon said that Agents of Shield is a story all about the Zeppo since they weren't the main heroes but the ""support"""
Eternal Love,My favorite is that one Halloween episode where they filmed in the murder house from season 1 of American horror story. I some what recently got into Buffy as well and I can’t believe I went this many years without ever seeing it! Definitely cried when I ran through all the seasons :/
Eternal Love,I was young at the time when Buffy was popular. I was born in 1993 and movies like that kept me entertained at the time 
Eternal Love,Such a great show... you’re making me want to rewatch!
Eternal Love,You should definitely watch the spin-off Angel alongside Buffy season 4.
Eternal Love,"I’ve been watching Buffy for the first time too and just got to season 2. Have to say I was struggling with season 1 but only a few episodes into season 2 and it’s already such a better, more confident show. I watched Inca Mummy Girl which I thought was an episode I really wasn’t going to like but ended up pleasantly surprised. Loving this show!"
Eternal Love,They recently (2 or 3 months ago) added that show on Amazon Prime Video  (in UK at least)  
Eternal Love,"I’m on my first watch too! I’m up to season six, already sad that I’m getting close to the end. You should check out Buffering the Vampire Slayer, it’s a really great podcast hosted by Jenny Owen Youngs and Kristin Russo, they talk through each episode one at a time and write a song about each episode too. It’s *great*! "
Eternal Love,"Oh man, just wait until you hit ""Once More, With Feeling"", the *actually* best episode.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCO0J1N661U"
Eternal Love,Welcome to your first of probably 200 watch throughs of Buffy!
Eternal Love,Don’t forget to watch angel when you’re done! It’s also pretty rad 
Eternal Love,Seasons 3-5 is the show at its peak. Season 4 is my favourite. 
Eternal Love,"When you get to “Normal Again” in season six, you’ll look at the show through different eyes. "
Eternal Love,Definitely check out the Angel spin off after you're done
Eternal Love,"One of my top 5 shows! I loved it so much I named my dog Spike, my cat Willow, and my rabbit Buffy Rabbit. "
Eternal Love,"It's been years since I've watched Buffy but that episode still stands out as one of my favourites. It speaks to the writing that they can take the focus away from the main character, and arguably the more exciting story, and end up with one of the best episodes of the series. I always thought it was an important episode for Xander's character "
Eternal Love,"The Zeppo is definitely one of the most fantastic bits of television. And like others have said, you have many more treats ahead :)"
Eternal Love,"It's a great episode; seasons 3 and 4 are my favourites, I think.

Of the often overlooked, ""lesser"" episodes I have a particularly soft spot for ""Go Fish"" (Season 2). It has an endless amount of good one-liners."
Eternal Love,Man oh man it’s going to get SO MUCH better. This show got me through some hard times and will always be my all-time favorite. Enjoy!
Eternal Love,"Wait until you get to “Tabula Rasa.” It’s my favorite, by far!"
Eternal Love,Joss Wheedon is a fuckin genius yo. Anything he touches is gold
Eternal Love,"There is a reason its in the top 20 of ""greatest tv shows of all time"" lists. "
Eternal Love,"Just wait 'til you watch the spinoff, ""Angel"". Much better show in my opinion. (and i think buffy was awesome)"
Eternal Love,"The Zeppo is actually the best episode. I mean, Hush is great. Once More With Feeling is great. But nothing even compares."
Eternal Love,"Buffy is a classic and some of the very best TV ever made.  It started really good and got great.  Joss Whedon took the cliches and tropes and stood them on their heads in the quick and wittiest ways possible.  Even Dracula.  And yet, that show went and broke the mold. To this day, The Body remains one of the most searingly honest shows I've ever seen. FRIENDS and the other shows at the time couldn't do anything like it. "
Eternal Love,"If you loved that episode, then you’d love the Justice League Unlimited episode “The Greatest Story Never Told” where Booster Gold is basically The Zeppo. "
Eternal Love,"my favorite is 'the body'. 

So real, especially when you were youngish too when something similar happened in your life.. "
Eternal Love,"I think Xander is whiny and awful, but I love The Zeppo. It’s a truly great ep that lightens the mood."
Eternal Love,I will never not upvote a Buffy post. 
Eternal Love,Which season is the musical episode?
Eternal Love,Xander ends up getting some nice screen time in the coming seasons 
Eternal Love,"My friend and I binge watched the entire series together right after college. 

We'd get to one of those episodes and be like, ""Oh, time for another character development episode! This time it's Xander's turn."" LOL"
Eternal Love,"ahhh yes. Zeppo is an amazing episode. It's his [""is he smart?""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLkaLveElpM ""everyone likes it because it shows that Forest knows he's 'different'. "") moment. It's when you like Xander give up on the hope that he'll one day join the A-Tier characters. He's always gonna be B-Tier and he knows it but her goes on anyway and that's kinda cool."
Made in Abyss,Just to note here and its probably mentioned in the article but you need to watch the film Made In Abyss: Dawn Of The Deep Soul before starting season 2.
Made in Abyss,I just caught up with it and learned season 2 is a hidive exclusive
Made in Abyss,Such a great anime. Bring back megaman legend child hood vibes when me and the wife was watching it.
Made in Abyss,"I was never able to click with this one. I didn't dislike anything in particular, just never found anything I enjoyed about it."
Made in Abyss,"lmao this show routinely sexualizes the physical and traumatic abuse of children - when it isn't just regularly showing children in a sexual light. It opens with a preteen girl being stripped naked and tied up in bondage and routinely makes sure to tell the audience about whether or not the little robot boy has a boner and whether or not the little girl is pissing herself. It's a pretty disgusting series transparently written by a pedophile, and the content coming up in season two is worse by far than anything in season one."
Made in Abyss,Kids look like those porcelain Hummels of children old white women like to collect
Made in Abyss,Is it still a HiDive exclusive?
Made in Abyss,"Disappointed to hear about all this fucked up stuff, the series sounds really cool"
Made in Abyss,There are places on the internet where you can watch it for free. Any of the notable fansub sites will likely have it.
Made in Abyss,Episode 10 I think is when shit starts hitting the fan.
Made in Abyss,"This is true and people keep outing themselves in their rabid defense of it. It's always excuses and apologism and denial with this show, even though a simple glance at the author's twitter is all it takes to confirm that he's a freak who should probably be locked up somewhere.

But the show is still extremely good, and the disturbed mind of the author only adds to the fascinating and unique weirdness of it all. You just have to accept it for what it is, and decide if you can stomach it or not. Kind of like Game of Thrones, which is similarly disturbing and whose author also wears his fetishes on his sleeve."
Made in Abyss,"i love how this is a fact that is stated every time this show comes up in discussion, and it is really easy for someone to confirm it themselves, that yes, the way it handles the portrayal of children is very disgusting, along with the source material. but if someone dares say the words ""anime"" and ""pedophilia"" in the same sentence, all of a sudden mysterious downvotes appear out of nowhere. (edit: would you look at that, right on cue)

i've seen the 1st season and i loved the scenery and the vistas. but for the love of god i couldn't keep up with it because i was feeling disgusted with the apparent morality of whoever wrote it."
Made in Abyss,"So I thought you might be trolling because of the downvotes, but even positive reviews are mentioning the fanservice of 10 year old characters. It's amazing how much anime bullshit people just start to accept when they get into it."
Made in Abyss,Thank you for the warning “Bonezone420”
Made in Abyss,Season 2 is. Season 1 is still available on Amazon Prime.
Made in Abyss,"It’s very, very fucked up. It’s also great. They should let the author finish it in a cell lol"
Made in Abyss,"Oh I know but I’d rather use legit streaming platforms because it’s easier.
I grew up with fan subs but I’m not going to pay for multiple platforms"
Made in Abyss,"> . Any of the notable fansub sites will likely have it.

Small correction, they're just ripping the subs from the official source and rehosting it on their own website."
Made in Abyss,"Yeah I just did a 30 min deep dive into this and visited the sub for the manga/anime and boy…I honestly feel SUPER queasy. Not only did some of the things that I read that occurs (particularly in the manga) make me want to throw up, but the defense of the fans left a really dismal feeling in me. Like pretty much everyone admits that the creator/author is a pedophile or has a weird fetish about child torture and sexualization but for some reason think it’s 100% okay. Like they really said it’s the author’s prerogative as long as no one in real life gets hurt. 

Brains are FRIED."
Made in Abyss,[deleted]
Made in Abyss,It's very true and made me stop watching while being a very interesting show
Made in Abyss,"In the manga this anime is adapted from, the current arc they're airing contains panels that would very likely see it delisted from HiDive if it were actually aired. Basically a repeat of what happened with Interspecies Reviewers, but with an extra dash of pedophilia. So... significantly worse.

That being said, I'm going to guess that those scenes won't be adapted as I doubt Japanese television networks would allow it to broadcast.

Made in Abyss is a very interesting story and world aside from the author's fetishes, which do only show up occasionally, and I just skip that shit. Naturally I would prefer the author not include such things."
Made in Abyss,"I genuinely wish I was; like a lot of people will say - the show has a really neat atmosphere and some cool ideas. I read the manga because of them, but it gets bad. And it gets worse. The point where I bailed was shortly around where season 2 will be starting IIRC - there's this moment where the girl eats some spicy food and just starts shitting herself, then all the other characters go off to have adventures. So for the next like three to five chapters it just keeps cutting back to this kid shitting herself.

Except the toilet's also a monster and so you're treated to unpleasant detail about how it's eating her shit and licking her asshole. The character is twelve."
Made in Abyss,"You're welcome, ""Porterhaus""."
Made in Abyss,">Oh I know but I’d rather use legit streaming platforms because it’s easier

In my experience, it's the opposite. Having paid for services like Crunchyroll, it's far more likely to experience interruptions mid-viewing since it's streaming as opposed to downloading from a torrent that while it might not be instant, only takes several minutes on a reasonable connection."
Made in Abyss,how anime fans defend a show/manga that literally shows a 10 y.o. girl taking a shit in a sentient toilet while said toilet licks her asshole is completely beyond me. and then they come and say that they're being marginalized and discriminated against. gee i wonder why.
Made in Abyss,I have gig internet. I don’t get interruptions. I’d rather sit and watch on the tv than on my laptop
Made in Abyss,"Interruptions from Crunchyroll's end, not yours. When I had used their services (when they were first starting out), their servers couldn't properly stream with the influx of users. It might be better now.

&#x200B;

As for the TV part, I just cast my content to my TV to watch it there (if its worth watching on the TV at least)."
Made in Abyss,That line up looks like a classic line up. Cowboy Bebop at 3 in the morning brings back memories.
Made in Abyss,[deleted]
Made in Abyss,I mean incredibly late but good i guess
Made in Abyss,"Yeah... been reading the manga and it's one of those situations that I want to recommend it for the story, and then there's just... absolutely horrifying shit in there that makes me question if I'll even keep reading."
Made in Abyss,The anime is incredibly tame compared to the manga
Made in Abyss,"Normally, I can get past the loli/fetish stuff, but there is just so much of it in this story."
Made in Abyss,"If you consider Nanachi's appearance fetish shit, then I guess the show is unwatchable. But the loli stuff that disturbed (complete wtf of a scene) me was a few seconds in one of the early episodes, other than that the anime hasn't given me sexual vibes. The manga however has some questionable things even later on."
Made in Abyss,Yeah I tried reading the manga and couldn’t get past the naked underage-looking girls. Author has some shit going on.
Made in Abyss,"Oh…there’s that shit in it too?

I saw that this was coming out on AS and started watching it (it’s been out a while, just not on AS).  I’m on episode 3 and it’s boring, overly expositional, and has annoying children that make my ears bleed.

Someone on another sub said it’s good, and I have no fucking clue what is good about it so far. Does it improve…ever?!"
Made in Abyss,....I was thinking that I remember something sketchy about this manga
Made in Abyss,AYAYAYA
Made in Abyss,"Yep, it gets much better. I dropped it after the first ep then binged the whole thing afterwards when people kept praising it."
Made in Abyss,"Its fantastic, would put it up there with  some of the best shows if not for the aforementioned scenes.

Those aside, I was able to get so into the story when some unfortunate things happened to a character i was actually physically sick. That was unfortunate for me but it is very rare for me to get that emotionally into a characters journey where moments can really affect me. Excellent writing overall and a very gripping story."
Made in Abyss,To each their own. I watched like 7 episodes few years ago on the advice of the anime subreddit and it was dreadfully boring. I dropped it
Made in Abyss,"I’m willing to give it another shot, but there better be a damn good heel-turn writing wise, because it’s so fucking boring.  It’s disappointing to hear that even halfway through the season I could still be bored.

Maybe someone can tell us an episode to skip to?"
Made in Abyss,"Skipping is not a good idea. The slower start is very important to later understanding. 

There are two compilation films, Journey's Dawn and Wandering Twilight, which cover the series thus far. The first covers episodes 1-8, and does so in about 100 minutes. I would say watch that, then watch 9-13 in full format. The pacing is much better in Journey's Dawn."
Made in Abyss,"My favourite anime of 2017 so far, no doubt about it. Excellent fantasy/sci-fi adventure series with a sense of eerie horror lingering in the background that's slowly percolating to the forefront.

Shows like this one and last year's *Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu* show how great anime can still be, even when they're surrounded by so many mediocre or bad anime series."
Made in Abyss,"Holy shit, a non-normie post in r/television? This is new"
Made in Abyss,"I used to be a huge anime fan growing up, but right now I'm very cynical of most anime coming out. I watched 3 anime shows this year, The first 2 shows being Baccano and gurren lagaan, I  liked neither of it. Both shows insulted my intelligence. Th 3rd one was My Hero Academia, albeit entertaining, the dialogues and jokes in the show felt unoriginal and flat.

Have heard a lot about Ragugo Shinjuu, hope the show doesn't disappoint me as the rest."
Made in Abyss,"Whaaat baccano insulted your intelligence??? That show's lauded as one of the best of the medium, precisely for being smart, stylish, and refusing to hold the viewers' hands. I mean the plot is essentially a puzzle that makes little to no sense until it all comes together in practically the final episode. 


I get that it's not for everyone because it's disjointed and feels at times almost wilfully obtuse, but if you feel THAT SHOW insulted your intelligence, i'm not sure there are many anime in existence that won't. "

Made in Abyss,"Only 10 years late to *Baccano!* and *Gurren Lagann*, haha! 😉

Don't worry, I'm not the biggest fan of those shows either (although I must admit I fail to see how *Baccano!* could have insulted your intelligence). I can't comment on *My Hero Academia* because I haven't seen it. 

Both *Made in Abyss* and *Rakugo Shinjuu* are excellent shows. I love the characters and brilliant worldbuilding in the former (the ecology and ecosystem are impressing me quite a bit), and the latter show is a very well-written and mature historical drama, although personally I wasn't as blown away by its second season as I was by its first season."
Made in Abyss,"I tend to find myself becoming more critical of animation in general as I get older. Not just anime but western animation too. Gems like Steven universe and gravity falls bore me in comparison to something like Rick and Morty. I think you're better off watching more mature shows. The ones you listed are geared towards a teenage audience (yes even baccano as its based off of a light novel, the Japanese equivalent of a young adult novel). I recommend shows like Death Parade, Monster, Legend of the galactic heroes, gundam Thunderbolt and Aoi Bungaku."
Made in Abyss,"If I criticize the show anymore I will get downvoted furthermore, and I hate that. But here I go anyway 

To the show's credit i believe the show was certainly ambitious and different from most anime ,especially the time period and setting, so I understand the love for this series among the anime community. 

To me the show is too ambitious without the writing to match. A boring, confusing mess of a story with a huge cast of one-dimensional characters

There are so many characters with each character having only 1 particular gimmick to talk about, and almost all of them are forgettable. I get it. You’ve got a big cast, and you don’t have time to give everyone an episode. Then cut or combine some characters. I couldn’t tell one gangster from another, and there were too many characters I didn’t understand what purpose they served to the story other than just existing. There's a lot of dialogue that is just embarrassingly cheesy. Any person after watching great ""prohibition era"" themed works like Brian De Palma's 'The Untouchables' and Sergio Leone's 'Once Upon A Time In America'  would completely disregard this show as complete garbage. 

The story is told in a non-linear way which is just another way of saying,  fuck you if you can’t keep track. One moment you’re trying to understand what’s happening and it’ll cut to different characters in the past without any indication. This isn’t innovative or bold. It’s confusing. Why did movies like Pulp Fiction, Memento, Prestige, 500 days of summer, and Dunkirk worked and this series didn't for me? I’m not asking to be spoon-fed a story. Nobody is, but it’s up to you as the writer to balance between telling the story in an engaging way and making sure it’s understood.

On the plus side, I loved the opening, and was the only reason I kept watching.

Edit: I would like to rephrase the ""insulted my intelligence"" part,I only meant it for gurren Lagann. Baccano was just boring for me. "
Made in Abyss,"Hmm, what shows (anime and otherwise) do you really like? I've got very high standards when it comes to shows (I've only ever rated two anime shows a full 10/10), so I think you probably won't be disappointed with my recommendations."
Made in Abyss,"I tend to watch only the mainstream ones, so this list probably won't surprise you, and which was 1 reason I think very low of Baccano, I haven't seen the worst of the worse.

Anyway,
Yu Yu Hakusho (my all time favorite anime, although I don't know how much of it still holds up) 

Both adaptations of FMA

Steins;Gate( the first few episodes were a slog, but becomes really great after that)

Both one punch man and mob psycho 100, although I liked the latter more. 

Both Coyboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo

FlCl 

Hunter x Hunter( had some pacing issues, but still had a lot of fun watching it)

Neon Genesis Evangelion 

Ghost in the shell

Great Teacher Onizuka

And Dragon Ball (not z, although I love'm all)



Other than anime , my favorite television show , like many other is The Sopranos . I also think very highly of 'The Crown' and Gravity Falls.

Edit: I don't think I'm a expert when it comes to anime, although i have been in and out of anime for the past 10-12 years. Hope you can help me with that, definitely checking out both Made in Abyss and rakugo shinjuu. "
Made in Abyss,"*Yu Yu Hakusho* is some great stuff, although I must admit I prefer *Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood* and *Hunter x Hunter (2011)* when it comes to shonen anime (you didn't specify which *Hunter x Hunter* you watched; if you haven't seen the 2011 version, I'd highly recommend it!). 

I'm going to guess you haven't seen *Yu Yu Hakusho* in a long time and have strong nostalgia and sentimental value for it, because I doubt very much that many would prefer *YYH* over *FMA:B* when looking at both shows critically.

As for other anime I'd recommend, my top two favourite anime series might be shows that you'll love: my favourite anime is Naoki Urasawa's *Monster*, with *Legend of the Galactic Heroes* a close second. 

If you've seen *Rurouni Kenshin* before, the almost flawless, 4-episode prequel about Kenshin's past is something you need to watch (it's called *Rurouni Kenshin: Trust and Betrayal*).

I love *The Sopranos* as well, it's my #3 favourite TV show of all time, just behind *Mad Men* and *The Wire*, in that order. Obviously, I'd urge you to watch those shows too, if you haven't already seen them. 🙂"
Made in Abyss,It looks like both of us have similar interests. I'm gonna take your word for it and watch them all :)
Made in Abyss,"I don't suppose you could add a brief few sentences/words selling us on the series and why they're worth a watch and what makes them special? To me, I just see a laundry list of titles and genres honestly. 

Knowing the animation studio and year released is pretty much meaningless for knowing the quality of character development and plot depth."
Made in Abyss,">Flip Flappers  
Land of the Lustrous  
Mawaru Penguindrum  
Noragami  
Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu  
Tanaka-kun is Always Listless  
Tsuritama  
Yona of the Dawn

Aaand you have great taste! Guess I'm gonna need to take recommendations off the rest of this list."
Made in Abyss,"> Blood Blockade Battlefront

I was confused for a second there, then realized thats the English name for Kekkai Sensen."
Made in Abyss,"Konosuba definitely should be on here for it's hilarious subversion, wherein everyone seems nice but are terrible people"
Made in Abyss,My Hero Academia is also really excellent.
Made in Abyss,"I think you can also add Megalo Box to this list. While the ending wasn't as good, rest of the show was still great, and might actually suit most of the audience here. The old school animation and design, etc. "
Made in Abyss,"Next time I would include Animes that would appeal to Western Taste. Most of these will not be appealing for the general audience. 

Some good animes for the Western Taste (2010s only):

One-Punch Man (Action/Comedy. An overpowered dude that is a hero for fun).


My Hero Academica (Action/Coming of Age story. A weak powerless boy gets the most powerful superpower in the world and his tale to master this power without breaking everything in his body using it.)


Psycho Pass (Thriller/Crime. Dystopian Future where police kills everyone who has a hint of mental instability)

Parasyte (Thriller/Horror. Dude gets infected by an alien parasite but the infection doesn't go as planned.)

Edit: Forgot to add that these all have English Dubs. Most of the list above do not.
"
Made in Abyss,"Gundam: Iron Blooded Orphans
Is a great one, its serious, the animation looks great, it does get dark because it deals with children piloting the mechs"
Made in Abyss,"First, thank you putting this list together and trying to offer more exposure to an entire medium/format/genre (Japanese animation) that is, imo, underappreciated in the west. Now, on to a few thoughts/opinions:

When people actually ask for recommendations, it's best not to overwhelm them with options else they might feel overwhelmed and give up. If they get a response of ""Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, Death Note"" then they already have ~100 hours of watching ahead of them and those are totally fine options. 

There's a lot of comedy and slice of life on this list. While more variety sounds better on paper, I don't think those genres work as well as others with a language/culture barrier. They're usually more character focused and thus body language, dialog, inflection, dialect, translation, nuance, delivery, inside jokes, locality, animation style, etc. become more important. The usual Cowboy Bebop recommendations are generally more serious, conceptual, sci-fi, psychological, seinen, action, mystery -type series that show off what ""adult"" animation is capable of which result in more ""wow!"" experiences (and western media ""borrowing"" from them). The unfortunate ""anime stigma"" in the west is that anime is perverted and characters look/act like 12yo children (which westerners already have in the form of youth-targeted cartoons). So, while I personally really enjoy something like Kill La Kill, I don't think the over-the-top action, ridiculous plot, and easily misinterpreted sexualization would be a good starting point/leave a good first impression for the uninitiated. 

This list is great for those who have already watched most of the popular recommendations for westerners and want to branch out a bit more. That said, new fans should keep in mind that they'll probably dislike 95% of all anime produced. I've watched 300+ series and I wouldn't go anywhere near some of the stuff on this list. And that's OK; it's common with most hobbies/interests. Find what you like, look for more, have fun with it, share your experiences!

For reference, my favorite TV (top 10, random order):

* Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul
* Game of Thrones
* Westworld
* Black Mirror
* Lost
* The Wire
* Battlestar Galactica
* Utopia
* It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia
* Mr. Robot

My favorite anime (top 10, random order):

* Ghost in the Shell
* Ergo Proxy
* Evangelion
* Black Lagoon
* Cowboy Bebop
* Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann
* Full Metal Alchemist
* Steins;Gate
* Psycho-Pass
* Fate/Zero /Stay Night (UBW)"
Made in Abyss,Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt
Made in Abyss,"I was kinda hoping you would list [Uchuu Kyoudai](https://myanimelist.net/anime/12431/Uchuu_Kyoudai ) or Space Brothers in English.  Pretty good slice of life/sci fi about becoming an Astronaut.   Here is the [trailer with English sub for it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciS3fDqT1Vw )

Another series maybe not considered in the past decade is [Hajime No Ippo](https://myanimelist.net/anime/263/Hajime_no_Ippo ) even though the 3rd season (Hajime No Ippo: Rising) came out in 2013/2014.  Its a great sport/slice of life/comedy series."
Made in Abyss,Needs more Jojo
Made in Abyss,"i like cowboy bebop, ghost in the shell, FMA, samurai champloo

basically anime that does not rely on anime troupes and tells a great story, what would you recommend from this decade?

edit: action oriented is a plus"
Made in Abyss,I'd like to throw a shout for Terror in Resonance too. Great show
Made in Abyss,"Barakamon and Girls' Last Tour are two of my absolute favorite shows, and I'm pretty happy to see them make the list. Sora no Woto is up there too.

Those three are all slice-of-life type shows, a genre that can be pretty hit or miss, but these three do a great job of building a world (or a town, as in Barakamon) and making you keep watching because you're interested in that world, and the characters, even if there's no overreaching plot trying to tie everything together. They aren't necessarily exciting, but they're thoroughly enjoyable. And sometimes you just need a nice calm show like that."
Made in Abyss,Kind of a weird post. I'd expect at least a sorry description with each show. A genre doesn't really cut it.
Made in Abyss,"**Sora no Woto** is surprisingly good. Definitely not what I expected. It's part slice of life, part post-apocalypse, and also an anti-war story. And the music is fantastic. Occasionally feels like **Kino's Journey**, but somwhat less bleak. 

***
**Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu** is a slow burn, but is an exceptionally good period drama set in the post-postwar era where the Japanese economy was beginning to pick up again. One of the popular forms of entertainment was a style of traditonal comic storytelling called Rakugo. In an era where not many had televisions yet, they were often broadcast on radio. 

A recently released convict approaches one of the masters of this artform to become his disciple after having only heard his radio broadcasts in prison. Drama ensues. Lots of dialogue as you may expect. **Joshiraku** is a much less serious take on Rakugo, if you like terrible puns and Japanese cultural references you won't understand, this is for you. 

***
**Natsume's Book of Friends** is really one of the most heartbreaking yet heartwarming series I've ever seen. Main character is the only person who can see the denizens of the spirit world, resulting in him being ostracised by almost every human he meets due to his reaction to heir presence, but returning to his grandmother's hometown changes that, for better or worse. Partly episodic, but with some overarching plot. For another contemporary fantasy series that's kind of similar, try **The Ancient Magus' Bride**. **Mushishi** is also excellent and has a similar spirit detective vibe, but much more serious. "
Made in Abyss,Didn't see Steins Gate on here..... Better than 90% 0f the things listed 
Made in Abyss,"My Hero Academia and Assassination Classroom are noticeably not present :o  
I personally fuckin loved AC, I know it's not everyone's cup of tea, but I found it wholesome and touching"
Made in Abyss,Madoka magica ! 
Made in Abyss,"I’m not a huge anime fan. But I watched Erased recently... good lord that’s a fantastic show. Cool plot, good characters, good mystery. Plays on a fantasy I think a lot of people have at least once in their life. And there’s only one season. They got in, told their story, and got out."
Made in Abyss,"Thank you so much, OP, for this! I haven't watched much of anime since my college days, and I have lost track of what's what. Thank you for the recommendations, definitely going to save this post."
Made in Abyss,"You're Lie In April, imo, is also a must watch."
Made in Abyss,Awh no your lie about in April 
Made in Abyss,This is actually a really decent list
Made in Abyss,You need to add Hunter x Hunter 2011 to this list

"
Made in Abyss,"Thank you for making this. I have a hard time keeping up with all the awesome anime coming out. I can barely keep up with all the western shows that are out. Just finishing up breaking bad.

I can recommend darling in the franxx."
Made in Abyss,"If you are looking for slow burn anime's that don't have your typical Japanese pervy tropes, watch Mushishi and Monster. Masterpieces imo."
Made in Abyss,"Blood Blockade Battlefront, Mob Psycho, and Made in Abyss are all in my top 10 anime. Very solid shows. "
Made in Abyss,"What do you guys recommend as good mindfuck mystery type ones?

in the vein of Mirrai Nikki, Madoka Magica, Shinsekai yori"
Made in Abyss,"My anime background is just the classics and most well known (DragonBall, Naruto, Bleach). Right now my only base for anime is Netflix. I've watched Attack on Titan, Tokyo Ghoul, Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, Sinbad, Death Note and One Punch Man, and currently I started watching Sword Art Online. 

Do you recommend it? Based on my viewing history and the Netflix catalogue what would you recommend I watch next?"
Made in Abyss,I would say you’re missing Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure. Besides being awesome it’s a cultural touchstone in Anime that is constantly referenced and parodied. I would argue it’s a must watch show
Made in Abyss,"\>K-On!  


My. Fucking. Man. The best taste."
Made in Abyss,"Devilman crybaby is also a good anime, gory , but good."
Made in Abyss,Add in wotakoi: love is hard for an otaku. It's a really good romance comedy that deals with adults instead of the regular HS ones
Made in Abyss,No love for Welcome to the N.H.K.?
Made in Abyss,"I'm someone who haven't watched a lot of anime since about 2008 or so, so I'll check out some of these, thanks. 

That said, I feel like the medium has definitely changed a lot since that time. So many shows now have either very strange animation styles (Kill la Kill, Made in Abyss, Devilman Crybaby...) or these strange formulaic stock characters everywhere (at least I don't remember people talking about tsunderes and moes and I don't know what back in the day). I'm sure there's a lot of good stuff once you get past these things, but in most cases nowadays I don't get further than some weirdass synopsis before I sigh and re-watch Black Lagoon or Claymore instead. And I'm someone who, despite not immersing myself into the anime/""weabo"" culture, has after all read and watched quite a lot of manga and anime in my time, and someone who likes 'weird' stuff Evangelion or Gantz.

I think that's the reason why Attack on Titan has been such a hit here in the West, despite imho not being that good of a show (it seems to go for repeated 'shocks' over telling an engaging story). It has a pretty 'realistic' and good looking animation style, characters that for the most part look rather normal, and though the premise is a bit strange it's very straight-forward once it gets going."
Made in Abyss,"Recently saw Made in Abyss because a lot of people have been raving about it.

The main characters are a girl of 14, and a robot that looks like a boy of about the same age.

I would like it a lot more, if there were not shit like recurring ""jokes"" where people look down the robot boys pants and exclaim that he has a penis. 

Like often when people were recommending it, I'd see em specify that it was not for children, and I kinda assumed that was because of horror elements or something. Like god dammit Japan."
Made in Abyss,"Ummm...My Hero Academia?

It's an amazing shonen series with much better pacing, animation and characters than a lot of its contemporaries."
Made in Abyss,"Another one I’d absolutely recommend if you’re looking for a more light hearted/comedic take on anime is “The Devil is a Part Timer”. 

Really funny, great story and quick watch. Premise is pretty simple, Devil comes back to earth and tries to take over the world...by working in fast food. 

If I’m not mistaken it’s still on Netflix, highly highly recommend."
Made in Abyss,Parastye -the maxim- should 100% be on this list. 
Made in Abyss,"I'm gonna use this thread to mention that, yes, One Piece has over 800 episodes, but it is probably the most pure fun that you can find while still managing to be epic, emotional and engaging. "
