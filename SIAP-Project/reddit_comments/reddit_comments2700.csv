Killer Women with Piers Morgan,wonder how one of these big online political pundits would do on cnn
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,No one likes Piers Morgan and nobody should be surprised by this
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,/r/upliftingnews
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,"If you have to introduce a show host with the words ""love him or hate him"", chances are he's an insufferable cunt, hated by most."
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,Not surprising the guy is an absolute bellend
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,This article mention that apparently Jeremy Kyle has also been hired to host a show for talkTV? Really scraping the bottom of the septic tank
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,He'll find some way to blame this on Meghan.
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,"For comparison of averages in that time slot 
  
BBC News (130,000)  
Sky News (110,000)  
GB News (33,000)  
  
However that isn’t the whole story as his first week had 64 million online views."
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,Because he’s an utter cunt
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,Awesome. Don't let that shithead get any viewers.
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,“You can’t cancel me.”
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,He's so smug and pretentious. It just feels like Karma for him at this point.
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,Nice
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,"Somewhere in England,Hugh Grant and Ian Hislop are drinking to this good news."
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,Oh no!   Anyway....
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,"""tHeY TrIeD tO CanCeL mE... ThEy fAiLeD"""
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,"Good, he’s a complete schmuck."
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,"This is honestly heartening to read. Outside of a very vocal minority the British people aren’t interested in this culture war shit. Keep throwing your millions at it though, guys!"
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,Watch him blame this on Meagan Markle canceling him on Twitter or some shit.
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,"I cannot fathom how anyone would commission a show featuring this dick twiddler. 

Even if you could stand his views, his obnoxious and self righteous personality is just the dingleberry on top of the pile of degenerate human faeces. 

I’d honestly rather watch Ben Shapiro and Alex Jones have full on penetrative sex on my own bed. 

Even if you could stand his views,"
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,"He blames it on cancel culture. Meanwhile, people don’t like him simply because he is a cunt."
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,All talk shows are so boring now. People are getting tired of hearing just shitty political talk (both sides) and finger pointing. It’s not worth the time.
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,Have they tried changing the host?
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,We’re growing tired of talking heads. All of them.
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,/r/MadeMeSmile
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,"Fuck Piers Morgan, didn't he lose a verbal sparring match with an high schooler?"
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,A bloated ham of a man
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,Why do they keep giving him shows?  Everything he's on bombs.
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,"Imagine being offered as many opportunities to fail as Piers Morgan at anything, and then still being as bad at it as you were when you started 20 years earlier."
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,In the UK I have to see his big stupid face on billboards and buses and it’s nauseating
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,Tears4Piers
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,Also piers Morgan is annoying as fuck. That’s the most likely reason.
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,Peirs who?  He looks like a dick dipped in pickle juice.
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,What're they watching instead? Because they're gonna watch something...
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,"Oh, no.

Anyway..."
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,Explanation in the title.
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,No one likes him on both sides of the spectrum lol. His fate is sealed
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,He had it coming. He is garbage.
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,Fuck Piers Morgan. He’s a malignant cunt.
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,Well he has the personality of a stubbed toe. That could be part of the problem.
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,“Piers Morgan in nobody wants to hear a misery trumpet stir the shit shocker”
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,"Somewhere, Jeremy Clarkson is having a laugh drinking his bee juice"
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,"I have never seen someone say nice things about this thin skinned pompous asshole.  No one likes him, he should go away."
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,More people are finally getting jaded with this pompous windbag? Thought he would have accepted his career is over at this point. Bye bye Piers!
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,"I don't think anyone of any political persuasion likes him. I don't know how he didn't fizzle into obscurity years ago. I bet he sees this as being ""silenced by the woke left"" or a plot by meghan Merkle or some crap excuse"
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,As a being that seems to be entirely fuelled on attention (it doesn't matter if it's positive or negative) this must be devastating for him.
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,What the hell is talk TV? Too many channels now
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,I don't get how this guy keeps getting shows. He seems to be universally disliked.
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,Fuck off forever you despicable dipshit!
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,"is this his fox nation show

the ads are pretty out there. ""They tried to cancel me...they failed. You can't cancel me."""
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,I'd rather have hemmoroids than watch the human toss-puffin that is Piers.
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,"""everyone that refuses to watch me is cancelling me, and is part of the woke mob! Please notice me Megan."""
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,As much as I dislike Piers Morgan it's not just a thing here that people watch news or debate style stuff for entertainment in big numbers
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,Oh yes.  I can image him claiming it's all cancer culture.  Skye News Australia picked him up.  Can't imagine the Australian view ratings are too high either.
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,Idk what talkTV is but it sounds really abrasive and exhausting.
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,Find yourself someone who loves you as much as this sentient cabbage loves himself
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,"I knew Piers Morgan was done when he put the Donald Trump interview behind a paywall.  Just cog in a really old and outdated machine. Also, he does the crowns bidding age has zero backbone. Protect the firm ar all costs. What’s not to love?"
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,The Russian viewer and bot farms are too busy fighting a war.
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,"What a surprise, nobody gives a fuck what these weird old white dudes think. They live in some type of
distorted reality"
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,I guess WANKERVISION isn’t that popular. Who would’ve guessed?
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,"Maybe he should try starting another war, it worked wonders for him last time…"
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,Douchebag says what?
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,We’ve reached television saturation. Mediocrity doesn’t cut it anymore.
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,"Good, I've been seeing posters and ads for this fucking thing everywhere and I hate seeing his smug face plastered all over. 

It would be perfect for it to completely flop.

Though, he's a rich white man, so as usual he'll only fail up and somehow get an even bigger show out of it."
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,All talk shows are so boring now. People are getting tired of hearing just shitty political talk (both sides) and finger pointing. It’s not worth the time.
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,Poor Murdoch
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,"His whole generation are nothing but entitled whiny products of 80s easy money. It’s about time their voice is silenced. Yes, I’m an ageist."
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,I agree with Piers Morgan on a couple of things but my gosh. He’s incredibly two-faced and a massive hypocrite and the way he talks to others and tries to smear the name of others for the sake of his own publicity is just disgusting to me and I find it hilarious how he struggled to get viewers on his new show. Fucking idiot.
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,And the great boomer die off has begun.
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,Good.
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,"while I think this nonce should have been paraded to Smithfield and given a mock execution just to impart some sense and give the St. Bartholomew's patients a free laugh, talkTV is a huge flop for everyone involved, not just him"
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,"A guy like this can't survive on preaching to the choir alone.

Like O'Reilly(back when he was the biggest thing on cable news for many years), PM needs a decent percentage of his audience to be people who mostly tune in to be outraged, or just to see the daily fireworks.

It's a very fine line between ""completely obnoxious, but somehow entertaining"" and ""I don't want to ever hear one more word out of this mother fucker's mouth""."
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,He lost many Americans respect with his daily attacks against our 2nd amendment. Not surprised he’s struggling.
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,"We should do a sweepstake, which fades into obscurity first Piers Morgan or Britain’s Got Talent"
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,Good
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,Also the guys just a tool. An arrogant…..tool
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,Piers Morgan is a chode
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,It's those damn vegan sausage rolls.
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,"The sad thing is that the reason is most likely because he's not terrible enough.  He's always catered to rightwing nutjobs, but since he's been vocal about masks and vaccination, he's alienated that group, and normies already hate him.  So there really is no audience for him."
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,"Right wingers don’t want objective information, even it it’s right-biased. They want information that reinforces their radical views."
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,I’m pretty sure Piers is on Amber Heards side and he disagrees with Johnny.
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,Piers Morgan needs to retire to Spain.  Oh... wait.....
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,"Lol, Conservative media is only successful if it bows down to the cult leader, and that mildly confrontational interview turned off the fanbase for Piers"
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,Well unfairly tried to fabricate some emotional interview with trump the other day and people figured out it was just some tricky journaling to put trump in a bad light and so he lost a lot of credibility after that. This explains the sudden drop.
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,Fuck the guardian too
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,Need to learn from Joe Rogan Show. But no big media houses won’t do that.
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,What the fuck is a piers Morgan.
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,Why does everyone hate him? Isnt he a liberal?
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,Who?
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,Isn’t this dude a piece of shit anyways?
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,Wait the Shiny Trump interview didn’t fix it?!
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,That IS a shame...
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,"Every time I’ve ever seen him, he made me want to bash my head into the nearest table."
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,Piers Morgan is a dunce.
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,He was a recent guest on Bill Maher’s “Club Random” and it was not watchable whatsoever. Piers needs to retire and call it good.
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,It’s because he’s a piece of garbage!
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,I’m sure being a professional asshole has nothing to do with it… /s
Killer Women with Piers Morgan,He completely made up some shit about Trump to get some attention and then the full video and transcripts came out showing Morgan was lying. Pretty desperate to save his show.
StoryBots Super Songs,"I'd like to reiterate, fuck Caillou."
StoryBots Super Songs,here's a [good read on Total Drama Island](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/uptttz/animation_the_tragedy_of_total_drama_reunion_how/) from the r/HobbyDrama subreddit
StoryBots Super Songs,This was a great read.
StoryBots Super Songs,"That was quite the word vomit, and I remember Teletoon fondly as a kid watching it on weekends during sleepovers at friends places. How are you going to write all that and not mention some greats like:

-	Roughnecks (Animated Starship Troopers)
-	The Oblongs
-	Undergrads
-	Mission Hill
-	The Critic
-	Tripping the Rift

And some weirder ones like Home Movies, Quads!, and god knows what else I can’t quite remember. I do recall Cybersix being a little over my head as a kid though and thought the main character was actually a dude for awhile lol.

Edit - I also rewatched the entirety of Roughnecks recently and it actually holds up pretty damn well. The voice acting is done well, and even though the CGI is from that era, it was really well done. I had never seen it all the way through when I was younger due to missing episodes and their infamously bad release schedule, but it was well worth the time to watch. The last season got cut short and it could have ended more cleanly, but I still enjoyed it thoroughly even after all these years."
StoryBots Super Songs,"I was there for the silver age. 

I really liked Delilah and Julius. 

And one I didn't see mentioned later on was Detentionaire. Came in 2011-2015 and was pretty good."
StoryBots Super Songs,"I remember watching Undergrads and Clone high on Teletoon, you mentioned so many shows I totally forgot about....What a loss, but it was time."
StoryBots Super Songs,Teletoon was such a big part of my childhood. I used to watch scooby doo every day after school.
StoryBots Super Songs,Neds newt was the shit. You missed Dragon Ball
StoryBots Super Songs,"Omg I forgot about Megababies. The theme song immediately started playing in my head. I LOVED Braceface and For Better Or For Worse! Ugh I grew up on Teletoon, from the mid/late nineties till about 2004. This post was so nostalgic."
StoryBots Super Songs,"This post was a huge nostalgia trip for myself. Just thinking back there are so many shows that I enjoyed that actually were Teletoon originals and I just didn't realize it - it's kind of amazing! Teletoon circa 2005 through 2009 was my favourite period, mostly because of all the cool action-adventure shows that premiered in that time. I loved watching Chaotic, Bakugan, Spider Riders, Atomic Betty, and Skyland. I did also enjoy 6teen, the first season of Total Drama Island, and Johnny Test, but I never watched them consistently. From their earlier blocks, I will always have a soft spot for The Tofus, What About Mimi, What's with Andy (though admittedly I mostly watched the Romanian dub for this), Rescue Heroes, Maggie and the Ferocious Beast, The Kids from Room 402 (mostly the Romanian dub again)...and the theme song from Flying Rhino Junior High will still occasionally get stuck in my head :P 

I just hope that all these shows will be made more accessible for more folks to enjoy in future and not get put into an inconspicuous vault/removed from streaming without warning."
StoryBots Super Songs,I just bought the entire Redwall book series. 20+ books. Hoping it gets another shot at the screen because it's prime for adaptation imo
StoryBots Super Songs,"I grew up in Quebec and teletoon was my childhood. I remember it had the best animated series out there even before series that had continuity(not episodic) was a thing. Redwall, silvering and toad patrol were amazing."
StoryBots Super Songs,"My parents didnt want to get more than the basic tv package, we didnt have the Teletoon channels, much to my chagrin.

Channel 44 for us, I think that was the french version.

We had to make do with VrakTv (25) and YTV (70?)."
StoryBots Super Songs,Anyone remember Untalkative Bunny? That's the first thing that comes to mind when I think of Teletoon
StoryBots Super Songs,"Man I thought I was the only one who remembered Mega Babies.

Also shout out to weeknights from 8-9pm when The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show was on."
StoryBots Super Songs,Delta state was the shit!
StoryBots Super Songs,"Don't forget Clone High! The late night era with Undergrads, Oblongs, Mission hill and Clone High was the best."
StoryBots Super Songs,Dragon Ball was on YTV
StoryBots Super Songs,I knew I was forgetting one. Clone High was amazing.
StoryBots Super Songs,It was on both actually
StoryBots Super Songs,I seem to remember Sons of Butcher playing in that era with those shows but that might’ve been YTV
StoryBots Super Songs,"Ah, I see now. They aired 13 episodes in 1997. So yeah you're *technically* correct, but I think most Canadian kids who grew up in that era would remember it as a YTV show."
StoryBots Super Songs,Saw that too and I swear they had more than 14 episodes. It was a long time ago so who knows
StoryBots Super Songs,"You can thank J.J. Abrams and Damon Lindelof for inspiring this kind mystery box rubbish.

1899 had a decent a enough premise that, had they tightened up the story and dumped all the needless padding, could've made for a good sci-fi thriller movie. Rather than a simulation in space that didn't totally rip off 'Dark City', it would've worked better if they went the Bermuda Triangle route and the two ships were the same ship from either two different time periods or from a parallel universe with little wormholes spreading throughout the ship one could pass through to the other ship(s).

The use of White Rabbit in the opening credits to Hendrix and Bowie is absolutely cringe-inducing.

1899 is pretentious and thinks it's smarter than it really is.

That's 7 hours of my life I'm not getting back."
StoryBots Super Songs,"Completely agree with everything.
Also: I was so annoyed when they would have like 5 different people who all speak different languages talking to each other in their specific native languages and not understanding each other and then somehow being on the same page??? Like...what?? Or two people talking to each other and you're basically just watching two one sided conversations. That's not moving the plot forward that's just stupid.
God this show could have been so much better."
StoryBots Super Songs,"\>So many things just ignored for no reason (like why David ""killed"" the little blonde girl) and I doubt they would be explained in any followup which I will not be watching anyway.

Damn, I completely forgot about that. And so did the writers, I guess.

They somehow managed to make every reveal less interesting than I thought it would be.

The silent boy, is he an alien, an eldritch abomination? No, just a kid who won't talk for some reason.

Is the pyramid a super cool artifact? Nope, just do the doodad that ends the simulation.

Is there a weird Bermuda time travel loop going on? Nope, just the ""we're stuck in a computer simulation"" plot that's been done a hundred times, but rarely stretched over 8 episodes.

What's the giant pyramid in the background for? Nothing.

Do the characters ever become more than cliques? Nope. I didn't care about them at the start, less when I got to see their backstories, and not at all when learning that its all a simulation anyway."
StoryBots Super Songs,"i can't say the show is terrible since i havent finished it (watched 2 episodes).

but i really don't feel like continuing it...it's just so boring.

there are slow burner shows, but fuck me, 1899 is really slow.

ep 1 i randomly falled asleep during it, and ep 2 i had to force myself to remain awake to finish it."
StoryBots Super Songs,"It's really bad and the last episode makes watching the other episodes even worse. Like the game Fallout did a more engaging simulation, plus the basically ripped that off at the end 😆 like the whole plot was all over the place, the characters were empty but yet had endless filler and all for it to be pointless at the end? Like how was this absolute garbage approved by anyone with a brain"
StoryBots Super Songs,"Honestly I found 1899 very beautiful and enjoyed watching it. However, it really wasted a lot of potential for a lot of the reasons OP listed. It would have been much better as a Bermuda triangle and/or paradox story.

I loved the teacup scene in the first episode and was disappointed there weren't more eerie 'hicups' like that.

Also big miss with the language barriers. Those could have been so useful but we're ignored or observed only when convenient. Why is no one gesturing? Have the writers/actors never been in a multilingual situation? except to introduce themselves NO ONE WAS EVEN TRYING TO USE HAND SIGNALS.

However, I don't think it was a rip off of anything. It's definitely feels a lot like Lost, Matrix, and Inception -- but that's what a genre is. Nothing is 100% unique.

I didn't see anyone else answer this but I believe Daniel killed Ada and others on the ship because he wanted the crew to get to land because he thought it be what ended the simulation. Why he thought that, I don't know. Also why did everyone, including Kreseter(who was seen in the space ship) jump overboard? Why did people stop jumping?"
StoryBots Super Songs,People that have seen Dark understand. That show came around full-circle and tied up loose ends. I don't think being a simulation makes everything meaningless. Clearly we are going to be seeing these characters again and their actions here have a deeper meaning to their values or backstories. Knowing the creators of the show I'm not really too bothered that it doesn't all make sense right away. The only thing I would say is that this season's finale didn't deliver a satisfactory end as say Dark season finales did.
StoryBots Super Songs,"I lost it when it was revealed they were all in simulation. I mean if that's the case then nothing in this show matters anymore cuz it wasn't real anyway, lol. Truly sad cuz I really loved the show when it was just a mystery ship act."
StoryBots Super Songs,I agree that it did not have much substance and kind of masqueraded as profound because everyone on the show looked so dysphoric and troubled all the time
StoryBots Super Songs,"Well, 1899 started promisingly with the atmosphere-loaded ocean liner Kerberos with dark panels and small stuffy cabins where you can feel the cold and moist. And add to it an interesting international passenger list containing all social classes with many different background stories but all running away from something. It could have been a gripping social psychological drama.  Instead, the film set goes completely bananas. It develops the story into some sci-fi drama where people wander in and out of time, dimensions, parallel universes, and suffer from Plato's cave analogy, etc. Nevertheless, I watched it to the end, and I am glad there will not be another eight episodes and that I am not caught in a time loop and have to watch it forever like the poor passengers."
StoryBots Super Songs,[deleted]
StoryBots Super Songs,"Each stimulation lasts 8 days and hence eights episodes of absolute bullshit and padding through, it puts one to sleep but also wants one to stay up given its from the 'dark' makers. 😤"
StoryBots Super Songs,"I wouldn't say it was ""terrible"" but it was incredibly difficult to give a single sh\*t about the characters. I tried as hard as I could but I just didn't care about the characters or their backstories at all"
StoryBots Super Songs,"THANK YOU! The show was just a huge “What the fk is even happening right now?”. I googled this just after finishing the season, and came across Reddit threads praising this bull sh*t.

Only because I hve a curious mind and hate to spoil things is why I stomached to sit through this GOD-AWFUL show."
StoryBots Super Songs,i agree with what feels like low stakes when it's 'all a dream'. but optimistically i also think that the show kind of acknowledges that and is just about a trippy multi-lingual dream boat ride and hey let's play with that.
StoryBots Super Songs,"Bravo, couldn’t have said it better myself"
StoryBots Super Songs,"Omg thank you OP, I honestly thought I was the only one. Was not a fan of the writing at all. It’s like characters just did things without any context or as to why. I watched this show dubbed in English so actually when I think about it, some of the scenes make some sense if they are talking in their native language. Anyway one thing that is bugging me (and I really can’t be arsed to watch it all again) is why the they just didn’t get the key from the beginning of the show, and why Henry just didn’t tell her that’s how to escape, why were other characters who knew about the simulation so Illusive… how the funk did Henry control bits within the simulation. He said a line, I think it was something like “give me the key and all this can end” so ummm not sure why they didn’t just do that and went for all that trouble to change things and the key. Is it a case of only one person can use the key?? I’m with you 100 percent, it’s like the show broke it’s own rules…."
StoryBots Super Songs,Agreed 100% it was just confusing and kept leading to something good and then never reached it’s potential .
StoryBots Super Songs,"I've watched the first few episodes and felt there was something off. The characters are very one-note and uninteresting. The whole thing seems pompous for the sake of being pompous. Putting classic songs at the end of the episodes was kinda atrocious.

The whole thing reeks of Lost (minus charismatic cast) and I had a strong suspicion the mysteries would never pay off. Turns out I was right lol.

I'm now cautious about Dark, I watched the first season when it came out but then kinda forgot about it and it was on my watch list for a long time, but now I wonder if it was also this bloated and only seemed stimulating to me because my German wasn't very good at the time."
StoryBots Super Songs,"Lol thinking about the trailer before this came out… “we’re going to make the audience think it’s a period piece set in the Bermuda Triangle… but what’s actually happening is much, MUCH stupider”"
StoryBots Super Songs,Its still pretty damn cool. Badly executed or not I’m glad someone is trying and delivering on some suspense. Maybe cut back a bit on the salt
StoryBots Super Songs,It was entertaining though
StoryBots Super Songs,"100% agree with you, the show was just pretentious bs.

Far better sci-fi have been cancelled before...this one actually deserved it."
StoryBots Super Songs,"I agree. I’m stunned by how disappointed I was in the show. 

I wouldn’t say it’s the worst show I’ve ever seen and I’d give a season 2 a try, but something that really stood out to me is how poor the character development is. Eyk and Maura have no inner conflict to speak of, they don’t go through growth or have an arc of any sort. They’re just...beacons to move the plot along. I wouldn’t know how to describe their personalities or what makes them unique- Maura is stoic. Eyk is stoic, and he likes alcohol. That’s it. I dare you to name other personality traits they had. 

All of the side characters are flat. I guess the Asian woman and the euro dude had some chemistry, and Jerome was alright but...that’s about all I got. There’s no dilemma with the side characters as gripping as the love triangle with Ulrich, Hannah, and Katarina in Dark Season 1. And any information we DID learn about the side characters? Doesn’t matter, apparently. It’s all a simulation, those are fake memories and not their actual backstories. 

I love the writer/director team behind it and will watch anything they do, including season 2, but I really hope they make changes going forward."
StoryBots Super Songs,[removed]
StoryBots Super Songs,"Well that's a shame if you put it that way and I can see why. I myself did enjoy that and look forward to more but also because I'm a huge fan of such scenarios with the simulations and fake realities.

Having this just as an actual period horror thriller actually set in 1899 without the sci-fi aspect would have been better likely though.

The plagiarism claim is rather baseless btw and well yeah that show borrowed a lot of ideas from other movies or shows but eh"
StoryBots Super Songs,"I really loved this review of 1899, absolutely brilliant breakdown.

I have a question though, what are some of your favorite TV shows of all time? I'm curious if we have some in common.

Once again, awesome critiques of this flawed show. You even made me laugh at times."
StoryBots Super Songs,"My issue is with you saying that this was plagiarized from Black Silence. You can look up the English translation, it's free. Be my guest. Aside from the black pyramid, and the pyramids in the eyes, that's pretty much where the similarities end. Same with everything else you chose to say this was a rip off of."
StoryBots Super Songs,god I hated this show.
StoryBots Super Songs,"It had cool SFX and that's it. I find it bewildering how such simplistic stories are found complex by some people, the Allegory of the Cave is like the very first thing children are taught in philosophy class at school. The principle is so basic that when people think about philosophy, they think it's all about questioning what's real.

The visuals in the ending were cool, though; the writers most likely lack the skills to write a good background story so their take will probably never satisfy or impress, but I wonder what happened to the Earth in that universe."
StoryBots Super Songs,"Bailed after episode two, thanks for the in-depth review"
StoryBots Super Songs,"I agree with you. It was dissapointing to watch but it takes a special kind of idiot to make people down who like this (kind of) show. Just because someone did it before in another movie, show, book or play doesn't mean that this show isn't allowed to exist and if people liked it they did. There are probably shows or movies that you love but others don't because they think it's stupid. So why are you insulting everyone who liked this show? What kind of boner do you get to make other people down for their taste?
Anyways, up until episode 7 I still kind of had hope that this show has a good reveal but episode 8 was so hard to watch. Like why does her father has so much control in this simulation if she is suppose to be the creator? Why are her husband, son and I guess her working against the father if they all want to wake up? The whole brother reveal felt really shortsided and way too much last minute.. 
Someone responsible for this show said this will be a 3 season show so I guess they could still turn it around and make it better but Netflix has to give them 3 seasons first. They do like canceling shows a little too much"
StoryBots Super Songs,"I’m on episode 5 or somewhere and I can’t bother to finish it. I was annoyed by the captain and Maura from the beginning. Most incompetent ship captain ever. Lol. And none of the characters other than Franz is likable at all. I like Franz cz he did the right thing, he wanted to put an end to the madness of turning back the ship just because the captain and his sTrOnG iNdEpEndEnt iMmA dOctOR wUmaN wanted to crack a mystery and didn’t follow instructions. The captain and Maura had no credible reasons to turn back the ship other than their own mental personal agendas which even they didn’t understand. Complete shit show"
StoryBots Super Songs,"\- English not my mother tongue so please (please) bear with me. Plus I am kind of mad -

I am really tired of the Plato's Cave allegory because it is cheap. Plato's Cave is not that good, it is not that clever, Plato was never a good person and had no interest, whatsoever, in listening to anyone else than himself so I can't understand why is he still considered in such a good regard. Plato would not reject society (I doubt he could really stand his own company) and at some point along the way he found some perks in engaging in ""conversations"": he could boost his ego. History also says he was a remarkable athlete... Haha. At best he was a furious man because he could never be a good poet nor a poet at all... Not being an ""aedo/aoidos"" really destroyed his spirit and became utterly rageful at everything he cheered in his youth. Aedos were in touch with the Muses (says the mythology) but what really made them so amazing and well respected was his superb memory and singing skills to be able to sing rhapsodes by heart. They also were able to play instruments with astonishing ability.

So Plato turned to do something totally different and he called it ""reason"" and began doing as much proselitism as you can imagine. He was a really hurt man but he was also determined. Plato's Cave might very well be one of the worst pieces of text ever written in the History of Philosophy but, alas, Plato's theories were optimal to fullfill not only his own interests but also those of the dominant classes. Because he was also a rich boy.

Anyway... All I ask for a show is to respect me as a human being with a functional brain. Seriously... I have a brain and I know how to use it. Why do you, writer of sorts and director of sorts and crew-members in general, think that I am not able to follow a simple story like this one? It does not cease to amaze me how these writers think they are so smart... It is actually infuriating. Who the hell do they think they are? They were petulant enough with Dark when they said that anybody feeling the show too slow (or unnecesarily overly-convoluted) to unravel would likely have trouble following through a Pokemon arch . Like... Seriously, brother, what the fuck?

It really pisses me off (as you can tell) that aura of ""we are so smart and so kind and so advanced that we are going to guide you to enlightment but only through self-discovery and self-growth. We will guide you but we will not hold your hand"".

As I was watching the show (and I did because I wanted to confirm myself that Dark was also a huge pile of pretentious hot garbage) I couldn't help myself to try and picture in my head a meeting of this crew to review the script and the writing and the overall final product. What did they say to each other? How did this come to get a green light? Who was in charge of this project? Why did they think this was a well presented and finely wrapped product? Did they preview the show before signing the contract and putting it live? If so, what were those people doing while previewing the show in order to assses its quality? What the fuck happened in those fancy offices and, I presume, studios?

And now they are crying on their instagram account about the catastrophic disappointment it will be to MILLIONS of fans when they find out the show will not see a new season. The AUDACITY of those people to talk about millions... They are actually like fucking Plato: they do beleive they are smarter than anyone else in the room and thus they do what they do. And they do believe they did it well.

I can not even fathom the dissonances those people have."
StoryBots Super Songs,"Netflix has cancelled the show, LOL! Well done all!"
StoryBots Super Songs,i agree. this show is dogshit wrapped in catshit. plus the stupid soundtrack.
StoryBots Super Songs,"I wish I read your rantview before watching the show. I liked the atmosphere and visuals but what a load of crap I just watched. Like you said, nothing had any weight and the backstories didn’t matter (and of course the only two asian women fell into the same Hollywood trope).

I felt like the writers had one or two ideas and just started cramming random details and red herrings while patting themselves on the back (jo-ing each other through a gate, idk). What a waste of time."
StoryBots Super Songs,Shitty show with filler characters and some shitty wokeness thrown in. The end with the spaceship thing was so bad
StoryBots Super Songs,I am happy it got cancelled
StoryBots Super Songs,"I can understand you not liking 1899. I personally thought it was more of ""so-so"". I think need to rewatch it later on to form a more concrete opinion. 

However, I disagree with the whole Black Silence plagiarism accusation. Because of her accusation, many people read her comic only to realize how they don't actually share any similarity other than the triangle eyes & pyramid visual. 

So much of what she said was extremely far fetched and it seems that she has not actually watched the show but only saw a couple of scenes before going with the whole plagiarism accusation. 

There's a thread going on comparing how 1899 and Black Silence share many similarity but many of them are not only very reaching but not even true. Some of the accusation is hilarious like ""*similar uniforms*"" when they look nothing alike or how both series shows space craft in space being used as an evidence as if other space related medias don't show that. 

The author herself can't even say anything concrete other than vague comparisons like ""there's mysterious event and death"" in both series while unable to give any real comparison. Using her argument, you could compare her comic to Dead Space and several big named movies out there and call it a plagiarism.   

Regardless of that though, I'll have to rewatch it to see if I'll be invested enough for season 2 or not care if it doesn't get another season. I think overall it could have been a bit better but not sure what could/should have been changed."
StoryBots Super Songs,"I wouldn't mind all the characters stories being fake if they were even a little interesting. I never cared about anyone other than Maura and we wasted so so so much time on everyone else and I have no idea why. Everyone else's story was just the most cliched bullshit, I felt like I was watching Days of Our Lives, and while I liked Maura's a bit more because it was tied into the mystery, ""I put my child in a coma to stop him from dying"" has also been done dozens of times before, and better. (I only watched the first few episodes of Dark so I don't really have any frame of reference, but this wasn't an amazing introduction honestly)"
StoryBots Super Songs,"I was waiting for a super great ending that would tie all the people together in ""real"" life. Like WHY put these people together in a simulation with their fake backstories too? It was clearly never just about the dying son, but it makes me angry that nothing was ever really explained. Also, Maura seemed way more into Eyk the entire time...I was waiting for him to actually be her husband. Just some kind of resolution would have been nice, because I actually really did enjoy the show :("
StoryBots Super Songs,I fully agree. It was disappointing especially because I was interested in it from the creators of Dark. Now I saw Dark is a fluke.
StoryBots Super Songs,Definitely. We are thousand online viewers to think this way....
StoryBots Super Songs,"I watched that show a week ago, and i couldn’t recall anything memorable from it."
StoryBots Super Songs,"It had promise.  Which made it worse when it ended up just another tired apocalypse tale.  Earth destroyed ... quack quack ... survivors on a spaceship ... quack quack ... computer run amok ... more quacking.  Can't wait to see what shopworn plot devices they  trot out next.  Maybe zombies, or Dracula.  Yawn."
StoryBots Super Songs,"Agree as well.  I COULD see it using what it’s established for some pretty cool ideas in subsequent seasons, but to waste a whole season on setup would be pretty darn despicable.   Disappointed in the people that put out something as awesome as Dark."
StoryBots Super Songs,"I stopped watching after the 2nd episode. It dies not lure me into the show like Dark did sadly.

The characters i just don't care about the characters and the show feel not well written and the acting is not that great also. It's a bit of a mess. Still it is not really bad. you can see they trying."
StoryBots Super Songs,All I want to know is if it has anything to do with the Aliens franchise. They are on the promethius and it kinda looks like a wayland ship. I don't know.
StoryBots Super Songs,I watched ten seconds and was picking this vibe up. What gave it away was the terrible show titles. Turned it off after about 10 min. Thumbs down
StoryBots Super Songs,[removed]
StoryBots Super Songs,"I think it was a combination of Dark (same director) and Westworld. Yes, it was all pointless."
StoryBots Super Songs,"definitely, the only thing I like about the show is that it was pretty well shot and the acting was mostly good. And to be fair I kinda liked the multi lingual aspect of it, especially since it's a huge ship for immigrants, it made a lot of sense and smth I haven't seen anywhere. That was until I noticed that it doesn't seem to hinder anyone's understanding of the situation or contribute to the plot in any way, so basically it was just a gimmick"
StoryBots Super Songs,[removed]
StoryBots Super Songs,"I dunno why my friend was so mind blown by this. I didn't feel any fresh second watching 6 episodes. And then I could not continue and watched spoiled review. So it's another Matrix packed differently. I don't mind another Matrix. Quite opposite, I'd love another Matrix many times. The problem that it is written horribly. Any event and dialogue that happens in it could be replaced with anything else and it will not change anything. This whole feels like randomly thrown concepts and images that trigger people.

It's far not the first video product that does it. There are thousands and thousands this kind of stuff. People consume it and approve, so it will continue to be produced.

I wish there were like tags which separate real solid story movies from this kind of stuff."
StoryBots Super Songs,"Boring, dumb, terrible."
StoryBots Super Songs,"I don't agree with most of what you said.

But...

I was heavily invested in this show and genuinely liked it, until the simulation reveal. That killed my enjoyment. Every reason I did get invested was actually fake in-universe. Because of the simulation thing. I also can't stand simulation fiction, so that was another reason I ended up not liking 1899.

If everything was real and there was no simulation aspect, and if they chose a different explanation for everything, I would've loved it. This show was intriguing and intense before the writers pulled a Matrix."
StoryBots Super Songs,Ending was a rip off of Dark City
StoryBots Super Songs,"I just found this post but thank you u/blacktuxedobrownshoe for saving me the trouble of writing something similar, and of trying to finish this piece of shit program. I'm on episode 3 and was basically ready to give up, and I had already guessed it's all a simulation (which is just another version of deus ex machina, lazy writing). I was assuming some kind of grief management simulation but sounds like that may have been partially right but slightly off based on your write up. In either case my two biggest complaints:

1.  This show is so dimly lit I can hardly see what is happening on screen. It's preposterous. Sometimes I actually can't see what is on screen, it's just blackness and the rough silhouette of characters. If this is what passes for artistic these days then I guess I'm a simp. 

2. The pacing is absurdly slow. I know it's a ""mystery box"" and we're supposed to be confused / building to clarity, but they make it such a painful labor to watch that I stopped giving a shit what the hell is the explanation. It just feels self-indulgent, and the big reveal in these types of shows rarely pays off."
StoryBots Super Songs,"I get it that a lot of viewers don't like ""1899"". I didn't like it either for all the very good reasons which have been listed in this thread! I can also understand why Netflix cancelled the show after the first season. But IMO many commenters have gone totally overboard with their criticism. If you look at the Rotten Tomatoes audience scores you can see that many viewers actually liked the show. And since the second and the third seasons have been cancelled it's very hard to say if the overall series might not have been far more satisfying than what we have seen so far. The two show-runners are very intelligent and they are known for crafting their overall narratives meticulously. Unlike many other show-runners they certainly do not make it up as they go along. Their biggest mistake was that they failed to make it perfectly clear that from the very beginning nothing was, what it seemed to be. Therefore they attracted many viewers who believed that the show would be a great looking period mystery drama set in an ocean liner on it's way to New York in the year 1899 with potentially interesting characters and a few paranormal twists. But what we got instead was a sci-fi mystery box which was set in the future and in a space ship, and everything which we have seen before, was a simulated illusion.  Or so it seemed. We cannot know for sure because two thirds of the story are missing. If the show-runners had made their intentions more apparent from the very beginning we would have continued to watch the show with a completely different mind set, and those who really don't like this kind of show could have decided after the first episode that this series was not their cup of tea. The show-runners could have accomplished that easily by beginning their show in the space ship instead of the ocean liner! Many viewers felt betrayed because this vital piece of information was withheld for seven episodes, and many viewers felt that  they had wasted seven and a half hours of their lives 😉. The show-runners made a great judgement error when they decided to make the true nature of the show a part of their mystery box. However, I think  that they could learn from this serious mistake. I think it's totally wrong to accuse them of not taking their audience seriously. As I said at the beginning, the show has a lot of fans, and it's hard to say how we would judge the show if we would have had the chance to get the complete narrative."
StoryBots Super Songs,Did anyone else get irrationally annoyed they kept using the phrase “the ship company”?
StoryBots Super Songs,"The one twist I liked - my interpretation of it, I mean - was that Grandpa have not actually been a Disney villain who hated emotions, but just and old grump who watched the same bunch of dumb kids playing and losing the same dumb game over and over, and getting absolutely pissed about it."
StoryBots Super Songs,"Actually this was a very good series. Depth, drama, suspense, fear, love, hate, death, life, etc. Definitely psychological as well. Too bad there won't be a 2nd/3rd season. I bet most kept looking up spoilers before finishing the series for the who's who and what's what details. That's ok. However if this isn't the type of series you were expecting why don't you write your own scripts and take them to the silver screen? Then you get what you want. ( something with a different life force or ghostly I'm sure) Leave the writers of 1899 alone...they did phenomenal. Way better than you I'm sure."
StoryBots Super Songs,"it was time wasting, more dialogues less action, i hate when they just waste time."
StoryBots Super Songs,Thank God Netflix cancelled further seasons.
StoryBots Super Songs,"That's what I was expecting too. A Bermuda triangle, parallel universe, worm holes. What a waste of a great potential."
StoryBots Super Songs,"Are you sure they are in space? Are you certain she really woke up?  I'm thinking the 1980's green screen style monitors don't really scream cutting edge tech. Not to mention all of those ridiculous cords and no indication that there is anyway to keep people alive while dreaming for long periods of time. I'm thinking ""Inception"" and this is just another layer."
StoryBots Super Songs,Exactly! 100%!
StoryBots Super Songs,"Yep 100%. Like I don't know if it was just bad writing, or the characters being so self absorbed that they don't realize the other person in the room can't understand them.

Like the Chinese lady talking to Olek who has no clue what she's saying.

Was also weird how quickly the characters became attached to each other. Krester and the Spanish gay fella, fair enough, that was mostly about the sex anyway. 

But Eyk+Maura, Olek+Ling Yi, French lady and Jerome, got surprisingly close in an 8 day time period."
StoryBots Super Songs,"Oh that was hilarious to me how stupid that was! And I bet they don't even speak different languages in space, so what was the point? And the nerve of grandpa saying, ""They are so stupid because they react with emotion."" Well, when you make them not understand each other, have future technology which is basically magic to them, all this traumatic ""history"", how can they not panic? It's a joke through and through."
StoryBots Super Songs,"And that they never make an attempt to bridge that gap -- point, use simple words -- it's all full complex sentences in a language they know their listener doesn't understand. Except when they do."
StoryBots Super Songs,"That's a very succinct summation of some of the big issues and I appreciate it! Way too many red herrings that ultimately only serve to frustrate the viewer instead of intrigue.

Seriously, just as you listed, there was so much more interesting things they could have done something with."
StoryBots Super Songs,Yeah stop now. It gets worse because nothing you're seeing matters. Only the last like 20 minutes matter of the entire show. And that's only a slight exaggeration.
StoryBots Super Songs,"It doesn't really get to the point until the last 2 episodes, and even then it's a kind of contrived murmur rather than an enlightening reveal. The payoff just isn't worth the time spent watching it."
StoryBots Super Songs,"What's worse is the brainless people praising it. That will only empower more garbage to be made and waste all our time, resources, energy, and we get dumber."
StoryBots Super Songs,The multilingual aspect kinds irritated me because the Polish guy would say something in Polish and the Cantonese girl would basically understand every word. I could maybe understand Dutch to German or French to Spanish a little.
StoryBots Super Songs,"Yeah there seemed to be no rhyme or reason as to why some people lost their mind and jumped and others didn't. Before the reveal, I thought they people had to jump because that's how the simulation was reset, like it was more physical than digital. Or maybe the water wasn't really water or something. But we got what we got instead :("
Mashas Spooky Stories,"Not enough Joe Cornish projects, hope this is good"
Mashas Spooky Stories,"""In London, the most talented teenage ghost-hunters journey nightly into dangerous combat with deadly spirits. Among the many adult-staffed corporate agencies, one small startup is alone: Lockwood & Co, operated by two teenage boys and a psychically gifted girl who are a renegade trio free of financial motives, adult supervision and destined to unravel a mystery that will change history's course.""

Didn't know this show exists. Sounds as fun as Attack the Block and hopefully as good. Netflix horrors is spot on."
Mashas Spooky Stories,"Big fan of the books, and Joe Cornish is great, Attack The Block is a cult classic. Can't wait to see this."
Mashas Spooky Stories,"Sounds fun. I'll check out anything Adam & Joe are involved with.

Plus it has Ben Crompton in who should appear in more stuff!"
Mashas Spooky Stories,Joe Cornish? I'm in.
Mashas Spooky Stories,"So ""Live Boy Detectives""?"
Mashas Spooky Stories,One of the best horror shows on TV. Shame that this is probably the last season.
Mashas Spooky Stories,We need more great horror shows like this tbh.
Mashas Spooky Stories,"Hope it's better than that sorry excuse for ""Girl Power"" trash that was Coven."
Mashas Spooky Stories,"After season 3 I can't say I'm excited. AHS should have only ever been a miniseries. Quality has progressively gotten worse as seasons have passed.

My guess is the new season will revolve around a gory mess of carnival folk in heavy makeup that makes you sick to look at, the rest filled with Jessica Lange singing some chart music."
Mashas Spooky Stories,"They really need to take a year off, and write a decent story. I loved the first season. I know people liked the second season, but I actually thought it as complete crap. Still better than season 3 though."
Mashas Spooky Stories,"Hopefully this season will be better than last. There were some really great moments, but overall it was flat, boring, and had way too many plot holes. Fangoria posted an article with some the actors/actresses that will be returning. I'll put here if anyone wants to take a look http://www.fangoria.com/new/american-horror-story-season-four-titled-freak-show/. I hope Lily Rabe comes back. She's been awesome. "
Mashas Spooky Stories,"They're not even trying for subtlety anymore, are they? "
Mashas Spooky Stories,Spooky carneval was totally my guess at the beginning of last season. But they maybe out of ideas. 
Mashas Spooky Stories,"New cast and writers please. Last season was so horrible unless you like bad comedies.

ZERO character or plot development. Just a mess all over with people coming back to life nonstop. "
Mashas Spooky Stories,American Horror Story: Men Suck
Mashas Spooky Stories,"Coven had its moments. It was entertaining at the least, but the story was a mess. There were so many plot holes and things left unanswered, it made it kind of uninteresting. I have high hopes for this season. I do kind of find it funny though that he denied the idea when rumors started, but here he is announcing exactly what everyone wanted."
Mashas Spooky Stories,Great thing about anthology series is that I only have to buy the season that I liked without missing a part of the story.
Mashas Spooky Stories,Really?  I thought Asylum was the one that was garbage.  
Mashas Spooky Stories,Is Coven that bad? I loved Seasons 1 and 2 and was looking forward to seeing it when it went on Netflix.
Mashas Spooky Stories,"Plus the people who came back to life had basically no residual effects. It might have been at least somewhat interesting is someone had come back and was haunted by what happened in the afterlife. Why was the boy jacked up and basically braindead after he came back and everyone else came back as good as ever? Was it because they ""Frankensteined"" him? I have high hopes for this next season. Hope they aren't misplaced..."
Mashas Spooky Stories,"Now, now. They were both shit."
Mashas Spooky Stories,"I hated season 2 at first, but eventually I just rolled with how they were trying to cram every single horror cliche they could into it.

I wouldn't call AHS a good show. But goddamn is it entertaining."
Mashas Spooky Stories,"When *Coven* was at its best, it was usually just okay -- a few times it was excellent, often thanks to Frances Conroy and Lily Rabe. However, when I got to the end of the season, it turned out so little of the storylines actually mattered. There is no cohesive narrative to the season. The premiere brought up some interesting ideas about where you think it's going to go, but it doesn't go toward any of them."
Mashas Spooky Stories,It's most definitely the worst of the 3 available seasons so far.
Mashas Spooky Stories,"It started out pretty good. The premise is cool. Kathy Bates is amazing and her plotline was really good.

But the way they wrapped things up was extremely unsatisfying. Someone else mentioned there was no cohesive narrative, which I completely agree with. There were so many other interesting things they could have done with the setting and premise but they just stick to X-men with teenage girls for most of it. Really disappointing."
Mashas Spooky Stories,"So disappointing. Terrible characters and a plot that never goes anywhere. Also not scary whatsoever, not even disturbing."
Mashas Spooky Stories,"As someone who loved 1 and 2 as well, 3 was a let down for sure. 6.5/10."
Mashas Spooky Stories,"True, especially when compared to season 1.  "
Mashas Spooky Stories,I'd call it a good show that had a bad 2nd season.  
Mashas Spooky Stories,"Season One was great but had a shitty ending. Season Two was suspenseful the whole way through, and was clearly the best. I don't even want to think about S3."
Mashas Spooky Stories,"Season 1 was amazing all around.  Season 2 was the worst season of a television show that I have ever seen.  I lasted only a few episodes before having to stop due to how stupid and boring it was.  3 was meh, clearly not as bad as 2 but nowhere near as good as 1.  "
Mashas Spooky Stories,Nah you're wrong. Season 3 was the worst by default because they tried to revive Stevie Nicks' career by placing a music video in the middle of an episode. None of the other seasons had Stevie Nicks.
Mashas Spooky Stories,"So the whole S2 sucked because you watched a small portion of it? Ok whatever. 

It was slow and boring? Most of the complaints was that it went too fast or had to many subplots. I dont think you watched it at all...
"
Mashas Spooky Stories,"Nope, I'm right.  Season 2 was easily the worst.  "
Mashas Spooky Stories,"I think 5 episodes is more than enough especially in such short seasons.  It was awful.  Never said slow, I said boring.  Something can be ""fast paced"" (it wasn't) and still be boring, but I never used the words ""slow.""  Slow and boring are not synonyms.  I don't care what you ""think"", it was a terrible season, probably the worst single season of any television show in the history of mankind.  "
Mashas Spooky Stories,"How could you only watch five episodes and say that the entire series sucked? The show had a lot of twists and turns. You didn't even reach the porch yet you judge the house. 

It had a better ending that S1, which is really mostly liked because of the sexual content in it."
Mashas Spooky Stories,"I didn't say the entire series sucked.  I loved S1 and thought S3 was mediocre.  Season 1 was brilliant television, season 2 was awful.  "
Mashas Spooky Stories,It was a mess of a show. I love Josh Brolin and I stuck with it for all 8 episodes and feel like I gained nothing really. The series started off great but ended up being extremely forgettable - for both me & my gf anyway.
Mashas Spooky Stories,"It’s probably the best example there is of “that should have been a movie.” There’s a good 2-hour movie there, but there’s not a market for that kind of movie anymore so it gets stretched out to 8+ episodes."
Mashas Spooky Stories,I did really like the double episode drop per week though. Unfortunately the show took its time too much and the payoff of a twist wasn't enough (honestly pretty sure most people saw the twist coming by episode 3). It definitely needed something extra to keep fans hooked for the next season I agree. I'll continue watching it though as a fan of Josh Brolin and Tom Pelphrey.
Mashas Spooky Stories,OP - I want you to review shows for me now. I feel this is such a typical formula. Interesting premise + family drama + irrational character actions to move to end.
Mashas Spooky Stories,I liked it.
Mashas Spooky Stories,only started it because i thought it was a miniseries and i like imogen poots and the guy from ozark. magine my surprise when nothing was resolved by the second last episode so i googled and found it's a series that ends on a cliffhanger 🙄
Mashas Spooky Stories,"I'm glad you posted this.  The first episode was kind of slow going, and I put it to the side to watch other things. I'm not sure I'm going to pick it up, it just isn't well reviewed enough to plow through opening."
Mashas Spooky Stories,Dear diary...
Mashas Spooky Stories,[deleted]
Mashas Spooky Stories,The big reveal in the finale we all saw coming right? It seemed telegraphed early on.
Mashas Spooky Stories,Wish it was a one-off instead of a series (that will probably get cancelled).
Mashas Spooky Stories,"Yup, I agree. Most disappointing thing I'd it started with so much potential. If they had dropped some of the unnecessary drama crap and focused on the weirdness, I probably would have liked it a lot better."
Mashas Spooky Stories,Can someone please explain to me what the fuck the buffalo and bears have to do with any of it? There is so much missing information that it is unbearable to watch. Why did she make the baby bear bite her? The whole buffalo at the poker table scene? It's like someone had a weird ass dream and wrote it down as a script for a movie. Maybe I'm too simple for this garbage
Mashas Spooky Stories,"Yeah, would have made a much better movie if they could have resolved it."
Mashas Spooky Stories,I had to double check if I was watching it at 1.25x. I've seen tectonic plates move faster than some of the scenes.
Mashas Spooky Stories,"Yea at least 2 episodes worth of content could be skipped. Would be great at 6 episodes but 8 was too much. They had to fill it with people being weird and or vague just for the sake of it. 

If they trimmed the fat the show would shine. I hope season 2 has a less is more approach because the premise is great and it has some fun twists it’s just too much character building that doesn’t actually add anything to them or the show."
Mashas Spooky Stories,"Poots and Brolin did a great job, all the actors did. I just hate all this acting stupid manufactured drama crap."
Mashas Spooky Stories,Yeah save your time for better things.
Mashas Spooky Stories,I guess everyone should just remain silent here? In a place to discuss television?
Mashas Spooky Stories,"> too simple for this garbage

No, you're correct. The bear made zero sense. The buffalo same - zero sense. I read somewhere that people involved with production at Amazon's TV division take a ton of un-prescribed pills. After watching Outer Range I believe that 100%."
Mashas Spooky Stories,"So, I guess their goal today was to take everyone who said D+ had no original content besides The Mandalorian, and pretty much punch them in the face repeatedly."
Mashas Spooky Stories,Hooch is crazy

Mashas Spooky Stories,"Nothing on any of the ""old"" Netflix series has me sad...  Nice write up, though."
Mashas Spooky Stories,/u/arashtp you missed Percy Jackson.
Mashas Spooky Stories,Super stoked on most of this. I’m especially looking forward to the Nat geo content. Can you imagine if Disney+ dropped with half of these titles? Game changer
Mashas Spooky Stories,"Based on the release timelines of those shows, it looks like their strategy is: 

Zeitgeist show for 6 weeks -> 1 week of cool down —> couple weeks of hype up -> next Zeitgeist show -> Repeat"
Mashas Spooky Stories,They're really going all out with the High Republic.
Mashas Spooky Stories,did She Hulk get a trailer or anything?
Mashas Spooky Stories,that's a lot of content
Mashas Spooky Stories,"So strange to realize Ice Age is owned by Disney now. 

Also I’m sort of unexpectedly excited about the continuation of Mighty Ducks!"
Mashas Spooky Stories,A Turner and Hooch reboot yyyeeeeessss!!! I've been a fan (we call ourselves Hoochers) for years and am flipping out right now!!!!

Mashas Spooky Stories,I have only read a hand full of moon knight comics but from what I have heard and read making a PG moon knight show is not going to go over well with fans.
Mashas Spooky Stories,Any specific dates to go with this?
Mashas Spooky Stories,You forgot the multiple tongue in cheek references to Matt Murdock.  Charlie Cox's Daredevil is officially part of the MCU now.  Hes apparently in She Hulk and Spider-Man 3.
Mashas Spooky Stories,"Damn, the Ducks end up becoming what they rebelled against..."
Mashas Spooky Stories,"As a bi dude I'm still waiting for literally anything big that features a non-straight dude. In film they ignored it almost completely out of fear of gay-hating countries banning it and them losing money (like China). 

Really hoping for something to come through, maybe with x-men back in the fold Iceman could get something"
Mashas Spooky Stories,So is Ahsoka taking the place of the Rebels spinoff? Because thats what I was most excited for
Mashas Spooky Stories,Disney is milking Star Wars and Marvel for everything dollar they can squeeze. There are way too many reboots and remakes. They need originally sourced content that has no reliance on existing IP. How about some original NON-Marvel/Star Wars scripted content? I think the Mandalorian is a cute show but I want to see ORIGINAL content for once. This slate of shows are not enough to keep all of their subscribers satisfied.
Mashas Spooky Stories,I just want to have the spin off Thrawn and Ezra travels in space show.
Mashas Spooky Stories,"Hey, bozo, why didn't you mention It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia?

Great list, otherwise."

>Lauren Graham (Gilmore Girls, Parenthood) and Emilio Estevez (reprising his role from the original feature films) star in the next chapter of the hit Mighty Ducks franchise, premiering in early 2021. In present day Minnesota, the Mighty Ducks have evolved from scrappy underdogs to an ultra-competitive, powerhouse youth hockey team. After 12-year-old Evan is unceremoniously cut from the Ducks, he and his mom Alex set out to build their own ragtag team of misfits to challenge the cutthroat, win-at-all-costs culture of competitive youth sports.

I hope Disney has been paying attn to Cobra Kai and takes all the good from it and applies it to the Ducks!!!"

Love Cheque Charge,The sheer build up and execution to the Watchers of the Wall is enough to qualify it alone. But I also love everything else about S4 as well.
Love Cheque Charge,"Season 4 is definitely my favourite. Oberyn Martell, The Trial of Tyrion, death of the cunt king, just an amazing season."
Love Cheque Charge,the craziest thing about this part of the story is that Seasons 3 and 4 are combined into one book. Imagine all the climactic moments from both these seasons but happening back to back to back.
Love Cheque Charge,They should have given us Lady Stoneheart.
Love Cheque Charge,"S4 is hands down my favorite season and one of the best seasons of television ever made. The watchers on the wall puts most movie battles to shame. So many quotables, so many awesome moments, I dare you to not get pumped when the giant is charging the inner gate.

Then there's Oberyn, there's the purple wedding, the Mountain vs the Viper(for better or worse), Sansa finally playing the game(short-lived as that was), Tyrions trial, Brianne vs the Hound... I could go on.

Such a shame it was all downhill from there."
Love Cheque Charge,Season 4 is the peak of the show and books
Love Cheque Charge,"Seasons 1-4 of GoT for me are easily the best pieces of television i've watched, ever. Only thing that comes close would be Breaking Bad, i personally prefer the fantasy epic's over anything, which is why i loved GoT way more. That's just me though.

I used to rewatch every single season of GoT before a new one would drop, was doing this since season 3 or 4 i think. That's how much i loved it.

After seasons 7 and 8 and what they did to the show, a large part of my life was just gone. No interest in further rewatches, no interest in book re-reads, in my head GoT was a great piece of television which aired for 5 seasons and then just abruptly ended, no idea why HBO cancelled it!

( the reason why i included season 5 which wasn't as good as season 4 is beacuse of episode 8 ""Hardhome"", which is a straight 10/10 )

Also season 1 of HotD was fine to me, but nowhere close to season 1 of GoT. I'm interested to see what they can do with season 2, but season 1 was just, eh. I have 0 interest in rewatching it.

The characters and dialogue in HotD for now are just orders of magnitude worse than early GoT 's Tyrion, Tywin, Jamie, Ned, Bobby B, Littlefinger, Varys.... the list goes on and on.

Viserys and Daemon had a few solid moments, but that's about it. I rewatched GoT season 1 alongside the books so many times it's hard to keep track of, couldn't be bothered to even think about a  HotD rewatch. I know i'm judging them by the insanely high bar of GoT, but it is a prequel"
Love Cheque Charge,Shae was a much more interesting character in the show and giving her the same book fate made no sense to me. Season doesn’t work for me for that reason. Wish they went off book for her.
Love Cheque Charge,"It has some of the best moments in the series but its where the cracks first started to show, in the fact everything that happened in the north before the attack on the wall was inconsequential filler."
Love Cheque Charge,I preferred Season 6.
Love Cheque Charge,Not even the best GoT season
Love Cheque Charge,It's not even the best season of the series.
Love Cheque Charge,"That was my favorite season of tv ever.

Until Arcane. Legit the most perfect season of anything I've ever seen."
Love Cheque Charge,[deleted]
Love Cheque Charge,it's not a game though. Remember goat stands for game of all time.
Love Cheque Charge,"GoT season 4 is incredible. The stretch of 1-4 is unmatched 
Side note the best two episodes of tv ever to me tho are at the end of S6"
Love Cheque Charge,GOT S1-S4 is the goat 4 season stretch of television in my opinion
Love Cheque Charge,The 2nd half of book three is just heart-pounding thrill after thrill and season 4 adapted it damn near perfectly.
Love Cheque Charge,Before season 5 aired. They did a big one day event where they were showing the final two episodes of season 4 on IMAX. It is one of my all time favorite movie going experiences.
Love Cheque Charge,"Season 4 has great moments and the intro to Oberyn was flawless.

But its also where I see the cracks in the writing really forming. To me seasons 1 and 3 were all better overall, though 4 benefits from some great pivotal moments done well and more production budget, and was better than season 2 IMO."
Love Cheque Charge,The first 4 seasons of GOT are among some of the best tv I've ever seen. It was very consistent. I'd argue that seasons 1-4 should've won or at least tied with Breaking Bad and other shows that beat it during that era.
Love Cheque Charge,"It is the best GoT season for sure, but The Wire S4, The Americans S6, Breaking Bad S5 are a tier above that imo."
Love Cheque Charge,"Straight banger of a cold open to start the season. Just a final ""fuck you"" to the Starks. This is what happens when you lose. There's no honor, no closure... They melt down your sword and burn your wolf pelt and erase you and your house and your legacy. CHILLS."
Love Cheque Charge,So much happens here. Sansa escaping KL and coming into her own was a big jump in her arc. Jon steadily grows into a significant figure. Arya and Hound continue an unlikely bond with each other. Amazing stuff all around.
Love Cheque Charge,"Oberyn and Tyrion's ""I will be your champion"" scene is the best in the show. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4eH46P-SoU

""'That's not a monster,' I told Cersei. 'That's just a baby.' And she said, 'He killed my mother.... Everyone says he will die soon. I hope they are right. He should not have lived this long.'"""
Love Cheque Charge,Pedro Pascal really felt like the only actor/character that actually challenged Tywin and put him in his place
Love Cheque Charge,That is one of the cuts I can live with. The question is: Where is the character going? We don't know since we don't have the ending for her.
Love Cheque Charge,"That sucked, but what ***really*** got me was the way they resolved Tyrion's arc. 

In the books, he's constantly revisiting the trauma of his relationship with Tysha. She was the first woman Tyrion was ever with, and he wound up falling for her and marrying her. Tywin found out, and ordered her to be raped by his entire guard, then ordered Tyrion to rape her last before he sent her away. Tywin reveals he did this because she was just a whore who was conning Tyrion, and Jaime admits that he knew about it. This obviously fucks Tyrion up, both because of the obvious horror of what happened to her and the implication that nobody will ever love him genuinely. The whole Shae situation reopens this wound. 

When Jaime and Varys come to smuggle Tyrion out of the city, the subject of Tysha comes up. Jaime admits that he lied, and that Tysha was actually just a commoner who fell for Tyrion. Tywin forced Jaime to pretend otherwise to teach Tyrion a lesson. In a rage, Tyrion admits (falsely) to assassinating Joffrey, and tells Jaime (truthfully) that Cersei is fucking just about everybody she can behind Jaime's back. He then sneaks into the Tower of the Hand, murder's Shae in cold blood, then has an argument with Tywin about Tysha. This culminates with him shooting Tywin the second he calls Tysha a whore. 

In the show, all the Tysha stuff is dropped. Tyrion sneaks into the Tower of the Hand unprompted, and tearfully kills Shae in self-defense. He then kills Tywin for calling Shae a whore. He also has a tearful, sentimental farewell with Jaime. All in all, it was a much more sanitized happy ending for Tyrion, and wound up robbing both him and Jaime of their purposes in future seasons. Jaime was supposed to grow distant from Cersei, instead he keeps doing her bidding and we get whatever the fuck that Dorne arc was. Tyrion was supposed to stay on his trajectory of becoming a vengeful monster who wants nothing more than to hurt everybody who's wronged him. Instead he becomes a cheerful drunk who likes to make quips and ask invading queens to pretty-please not kill any of the people who wronged him."
Love Cheque Charge,D&D didn't like all that fantasy stuff in their... Fantasy show.
Love Cheque Charge,They made the right choice to cut it if they weren't going to dive deeper into what's happening in the riverlands.
Love Cheque Charge,dont really agree. that storyline never went anywhere and the character literally had no character. im glad it got cut out of the show.
Love Cheque Charge,"The ending of season 4 was a dud, all they had to do was put the Book 3 epilogue at the end and it would have been the best season of all time"
Love Cheque Charge,">Seasons 1-4 of GoT for me are easily the best pieces of television i've watched, ever. Only thing that comes close would be Breaking Bad

That was the time man, when GoT fans and BB fans used to argue about being the GOAT. As a fan of both, I could barely pick one myself and was just glad to be watching such peak television.

But once again, it was just another proof of why BB having such a perfect ending is a such a milestone in television. It's just extremely rare to have shows that consistently good throughout and also nail the ending."
Love Cheque Charge,I’d say the wire beats both breaking bad and GoT
Love Cheque Charge,"man its just a tv show. and this type of commentary is so exaggerated and nostalgic.

yes the last few seasons were a drop in quality, no it wasnt the worst tragedy in human history and were still fairly entertaining."
Love Cheque Charge,"Good writeup. Yeah those 4 seasons were supreme. Even when met with competition like Breaking Bad or Sopranos, what wins the case for GOT is how many levels above it was compared to others in ambition and scope. Basically it was much easier to mess up Thrones than something like Mad Men or BB. There are just so many parts in motion and a great skill was required to make it all coherent and thrilling.

> After seasons 7 and 8 and what they did to the show, a large part of my life was just gone.

Same. I dunno how many hours I have sunk in watching, reading, discussing, arguing over Thrones. 

>  the reason why i included season 5 which wasn't as good as season 4 is beacuse of episode 8 ""Hardhome"", which is a straight 10/10 )

Hardhome is magnificent. I always get chills during the last 20 minutes or so. Such fine piece of filmmaking.

HOTD was above average. The story isn't exciting and neither are the characters too compelling. But visually it is dazzling."
Love Cheque Charge,"I agree, the Sopranos is so overrated Game of Thrones was better"
Love Cheque Charge,"I don’t see why the show should affect your enjoyment of the books. They are such vastly different stories, in terms of themes explored, that I just separate the two.

Plus, the ending of the show had massive plot points straight up invented by D&D."
Love Cheque Charge,I think you're selling HotD a little short there.
Love Cheque Charge,"Everything about Season 4 was superb to me when first watching it, EXCEPT that exact point! In fact, I thought it was the very first time in all four seasons that GoT had a visible (that I noticed while watching it) plot hole. Everything about the show, every single episode, up to that point, felt like a naturally occurring story. One thing was leading to another with surprising but logical twists and turns.

Then this ""betrayal"" happened.

It was the first time ever it felt like something happening in the show wasn't a ""real-world"" (within the show) event - it was immediately immersion breaking. I was watching a character doing what she was doing not because her character development and the plot had led her to do that in her world, but because the writers of the fake TV show I was watching were making her do that on my TV screen, to force a new soap-drama plot point that they had not developed.

I remember looking on Reddit to see what others were saying at the time, and people were proclaiming ""yeah, that was supposed to happen, she was like that in the books too!"" But after looking into it, it sounded like in the books she never had any scenes where she was doing the right thing or actively trying to help when no one knew what she was doing. She was only pretending to do the right things and help when she thought it would be public to someone(s).

But in the show, there were multiple scenes across multiple seasons where she clearly tried to help and/or do the right thing when it did NOT potentially benefit her and when it would have been more beneficial if she did the opposite. Yet suddenly all at once ""yeah she has been pretending from the beginning"" - when it was very clear in the show (because we the audience were shown things that only we knew, despite other characters not knowing) she was not pretending in any episode previous to her betrayal.

They literally retconned her character. Was the first time I noticed a bad plot problem in GoT. As I said in another post, I have no confidence in GRRM's ability to give a good  conclusion to a long/complex series, but I don't think it is a coincidence he left after the end of season 4 due to ""disagreements"" with the showrunners. I bet how that plot/character was handled in particular was one of multiple final straws for him."
Love Cheque Charge,Ouch. 😭
Love Cheque Charge,"Honestly in my recent rewatch I thought that was one of the best seasons of a TV show I had ever seen. They did a great job of building up to an amazing pay off that happens in the last two episodes with the Battle of the Bastards and Cersi's revenge. 

I can see why there was so much hype going into Seasons 7 & 8, and they definitely fumbled the ball at the goal line."
Love Cheque Charge,The Winds of Winter is the best episode of the show for me.
Love Cheque Charge,"That’s just not true. Plenty happens, some of it wasn’t well written but it doesn’t distract IMO from how amazing S4 is. I agree with OP"
Love Cheque Charge,"Not true. There were solid climaxes on all of the first 5 seasons or so. Yes they fucked the conclusion and we are all lesser people because of it, but you cannot take those first 5 seasons away from us. They were magical"
Love Cheque Charge,"Yep. And with GRRM not even finishing the books, I don't trust that the entire problem was only on those two idiot showrunners. Don't trust HotD at all on landing the ending, and considering they are keeping GoT with its trash ending as ""canon"" for the future of the same world that HotD takes place in, I don't even care about it in the first place. How can anything on HotD even matter or make sense in the context of the non sense that happens in the future?

But in response to the OP - yes season 4 was great. And it was the last great season too :("
Love Cheque Charge,"Low key, Sansa had the best and most consistent arc of the entire series."
Love Cheque Charge,Tiny pink cock
Love Cheque Charge,My best guess is that she will be responsible for the death of House Frey in lieu of Arya.
Love Cheque Charge,Ironically they made GoT S6-S8 typical fantasy with rushed ending
Love Cheque Charge,"They wanted to take out magic to appeal to ""mothers and NFL players"". That's a real quote."
Love Cheque Charge,"To be fair (I haven’t read the books too for what it’s worth), do we *know* it doesn’t go anywhere? I was under the impression it was kind of still developing as of the end of the most recent book."
Love Cheque Charge,"> that storyline never went anywhere

I mean, that has more to do with GRRM not writing anything for the past decade. 

I think there will probably be a couple big roles for LSH in the books. First, she'll be a model for how fucked up the process of resurrection can leave a person. When Jon is resurrected, I think there will be a lot more uncertainty about his temperament, and whether it's even still Jon in there. 

Second, I think at some point she'll meet Arya. They both have similar goals in exacting revenge against those who wronged House Stark, in particular those involved with the Red Wedding. I think this will bring them together, and seeing her mother as a fucked up revenant murdering her way through the Riverlands will be what finally steers Arya away from revenge. It would be a more compelling resolution to that character arc than the Hound looking at her and telling her ""actually, don't kill Cersei"" at the eleventh hour."
Love Cheque Charge,"Should D&D have cut Oberyn Martell because his only function was to get his head crushed by the Mountain?

Lady Stoneheart did serve a function: She was the main person exacting poetic revenge on the Freys. They gave this role to Arya, which is problematic because Arya was already a vehicle for a million other happenings.

It also gave us reasons why Jon Snow's resurrection may not have been a good thing, where in the show it was unambiguously the right decision.

That careful crafting of tension and ambiguity is something D&D forgot to do in the final seasons, something Lady Stoneheart would've given more of."
Love Cheque Charge,Yea i think its safe to say BB wins in the consistency and ending department 💀💀💀
Love Cheque Charge,Sopranos is overrated
Love Cheque Charge,The Sopranos beats the Wire
Love Cheque Charge,"it's a fun debate.  I think the wire is a better show, but i enjoyed breaking bad more."
Love Cheque Charge,"> no it wasnt the worst tragedy in human history

Literally no one said this mate

>  and were still fairly entertaining.

Dude, now you're just making me laugh. If that was entertaining to you then holy shit lol. GoT went from a 9-10/10 rated show to 2-3/10 at best.

GoT was a global and cultural phenomenom in it's prime, and you're surprised people are still sad it got butchered towards the end? Man please, complete nonsense of a comment"
Love Cheque Charge,"The Sopranos is in its own orbit. Nothing like that was made before, and in some ways, since."
Love Cheque Charge,"You can't compare the Sopranos and GoT. They're probably my two favorite TV shows, but it's like they're not even playing the same game."
Love Cheque Charge,The tea I heard was that he wasn’t getting his work done so D&D had to kick him off the show so he could work on the books. People say the Purple Wedding episode was good because GRRM wrote it when he only wrote the first draft. He was trying to introduce all the other book plots (like Ramsey’s wife who gets raped by dogs instead of Sansa) and the writers had to change it so it’d fit the show.
Love Cheque Charge,"Yeah. I don't really understand why so many people seem to extend their justified anger about the last two season to S5+6 as well.

Yes, both seasons start to show some cracks, but they are not a big step down from the first 4 in my opinion. They also deliver a lot on the build up from previous seasons which to me almost makes up for some of the areas that were not as great."
Love Cheque Charge,Then you have brain damage
Love Cheque Charge,"Yeah the notion that an unfinished story has *no* value is a very pessimistic one. We spend plenty of time piecing together the stories of real history even though we know we'll never have a complete picture of it.

It's a fucking shame how it all turned out and I don't blame any individual for not wanting to engage with ASOIAF any further. I just hope that the prevailing narrative that the early seasons/the books are fundamentally tainted will start to shift soon and that they can be appreciated in spite of their conclusion or lack thereof."
Love Cheque Charge,"5 was closer to 6-8 in terms of quality than to 1-4

It had some cool moments but the quality of plot, writing and dialogue took a tumble there"
Love Cheque Charge,It took him 7 years to write book 5. And that was great. And before tv show even started. So I don't think that you can draw any conclusion. He is just a slow writer .
Love Cheque Charge,"> Don't trust HotD at all on landing the ending

The story being told in HotD is already finished in Fire & Blood, they'll have to flesh it out a lot but it has a clear and defined trajectory."
Love Cheque Charge,"There's also the theory the she will be used to resurrect Jon in the books, but that's kinda out there lol"
Love Cheque Charge,"S6 still had some really good moments/episodes and the overall pacing was also fine, compared to S7/8.  
It was much better than S5, which doesn't get nearly enough hate IMO. I read the books afterwards and the way that the Dorne plot was butchered in the TV adaption is absolutely disgusting."
Love Cheque Charge,"It's not a real quote. Someone misquoted them as they were live-tweeting an event, and publications ran with it. When the audio turned up with what they actually said, those publications didn't rush to correct themselves. [What they actually said:](https://watchersonthewall.com/benioff-weiss-reflect-decade-game-thrones-austin-film-festival/)

>“With the fantasy genre on television, tonally it’s very easy [go too] campy. Every scene, you change these two lines and it’s Monty Python and the Holy Grail,” Weiss jokes. “Also, in terms of fantasy exposition, with proper nouns, it’s almost like a game of Jenga, where you’re trying to plow as many of them as possible without the whole thing falling over. In the first pilot, we had one too many and the whole thing fell over. Going forward, we tried to keep that stuff to a minimum, because we didn’t just want to appeal to a fantasy fanbase. We wanted them to love it, and we wanted our parents to love it, and people who play professional football to love it. We wanted to reach a wider audience, and to do that keeping the tone [under control] was very important.”"
Love Cheque Charge,"Ashamed to admit I'm one of the people that this was for. Everytime the show turned into dragon fest i was bored. The dragons are easily my least favorite part of HOTD too. I like the political drama, not so much the fantasy elements."
Love Cheque Charge,"Character was introduced in the final page of a book released 23 years ago. Since then, they've appeared in a single chapter from a book released 18 years ago.

I don't think GRRM has any idea what's going on with the character. I don't blame D&D for dropping her."
Love Cheque Charge,"We don't know if it goes anywhere but the show has been long over and the books don't seem likely to be finished so really, it doesn't matter whether or not Stoneheart is vital to the book storyline.

But currently, she just seems to be a revenge zombie which wasn't something the show needed."
Love Cheque Charge,"developing is a big stretch. there were a few chapters about it and they were quite vague. it was basically just a way to give some well-liked characters a reason to group up.

they arent even really mentioned in the 5th book afair, only up to the 4th book. and that shit was in 2005. almost 20 years, thats no longer ""developing"""
Love Cheque Charge,"I recently did a full rewatch and I don't think the story lost much without her. I think D&D made the right decision. 

For starters, it would've been another storyline/character that D&D would have had to wrap up before the end and they clearly were struggling with what they already had. 

They had Arya do what, 1 or 2 scenes taking revenge on the Freys? They would have needed to add more to justify Stoneheart or it wouldn't have been at all worth it to keep/revise a character that had little to do with the main story. Did we need more scenes of the Freys being hunted down? Nah. Arya standing in place was fine and took care of the Freys. 

With John and Beric and the Mountain being revived from deaths, yet another character coming back would have lessened the stakes. (That said, D&D lessened the stakes anyhow with plot armor for the main ""good guy"" characters). 

They wouldn't have had time to shoe-in more of John struggling about coming back than what was already in the show.

There were so many other problems with the later seasons that Stoneheart would've just been a waste of time."
Love Cheque Charge,"from that perspective it just wouldve been a total red herring (it is, as far as we know since the books wont be finished). jon snow is revived without any issue or drawback and nothing ever happens to him.

also thats a pretty weird comparison to those characters btw who are all well-developed and you know, actual characters with conversations and personality. vs zombie lady who doesnt talk and we know nothing of her intentions/motivations other than general revenge, and we follow her because?"
Love Cheque Charge,I completely understand that. I think the wire is a heavier show to swallow. Some scenes are fucking brutal. I think breaking bad is a much more fun show and easier to watch. Idk if that makes sense
Love Cheque Charge,"> GoT went from a 9-10/10 rated show to 2-3/10 at best.

this is exactly what i'm talking about, this is a completely ridiculous opinion.

you still watched every episode. you were so engaged that you cant let it go until today, years after it's over. *thats* a fucking 2 out of 10? lmao. what rating is the other 95% of garbage pumped out by every studio constantly?

it was entertaining to you as well, you just cant admit it because of the narrative that arose.

if it wasnt, you would have stopped watching it."
Love Cheque Charge,Agreed. GOT is playing in a whole different league. Much harder imho.
Love Cheque Charge,"Season 5 definitely wasn't as good as the first 4, true.

I always give it a pass though beacuse the last 3 episodes in season 5 were really fucking good, especially episode 8."
Love Cheque Charge,"I think that 5 might might not have been as good as season 1-4 but it was a lot better than most other shows, and far from 6-8."
Love Cheque Charge,"> It had some cool moments but the quality of plot, writing and dialogue took a tumble there

That's how I'd describe 6. 5 was a mixed bag and the lows were really low but it still felt like they were trying."
Love Cheque Charge,Seems kind of wonky but who knows. I think George RR Martin has grown to hate his original ending so maybe he should just canonize his favorite fan theories.
Love Cheque Charge,"Even if it were a real quote, a show aiming to appeal a broad audience is not a bad thing."
Love Cheque Charge,"There is a middle ground between Season 1 of the Witcher in which they absolutely do have too many ""proper nouns"" introduced for most viewers, and then whatever it was that they gave us. The key is being a good writer, so, ya know..."
Love Cheque Charge,They wish their writing was half as good as Monty Pyrhon.
Love Cheque Charge,It may not be *verbatim* but that is still exactly what they said...literally the same message
Love Cheque Charge,I agree with you and I'm not ashamed to admit. The political scheming was by far the best part of the show. The dragons and White Walkers were always much less interesting.
Love Cheque Charge,"There are plenty of 100% drama shows out there, no need to ruin a well-written fantasy that incorporates politics into it very well.

I don't want full CGI dragon episodes either but if you completely remove them the story doesn't even make sense.  IMO they would be better used like a monster who you rarely see on screen at all, but that doesn't mean they don't exist and they are erased from the story.

If you are not a fan of fantasy you probably do not even realize what we are talking about with Lady Stoneheart.  Catelyn Stark comes back from the dead.  That's a pretty major plot point for a major character to come back from the dead, and they just left it out because they are clueless schmucks who didn't know what to do with it."
Love Cheque Charge,[deleted]
Love Cheque Charge,"Very few characters are mentioned in both the 4th and 5th books, they take place at the same time in different parts of the world. As of where the books left off, Lady Stoneheart is moments away from executing two of the most important characters in the story, I would say that definitely seems to be going somewhere."
Love Cheque Charge,">For starters, it would've been another storyline/character that D&D would have had to wrap up before the end and they clearly were struggling with what they already had. 

Absolutely not, as the beginning of Lady Stoneheart was the end of Beric Dondarrion."
Love Cheque Charge,People up here still justifying D&D's rampant cuts to the story and over-simplification of characters and themes despite this obviously ruining the show in spectacular fashion.
Love Cheque Charge,"Lady Stoneheart represents revenge the way GRRM intended: limitless, destructive, unclean.

By giving this moment to Arya in a crowd cheering moment, Arya is no longer a real character on a real journey, she instead became an omniscient, fast travelling, can-do-no-wrong dora the assassin.

They removed the best twist of the books post-season 4, then ruined one of the best characters by offloading all that baggage on Arya, and then completely subverted the way revenge is meant to be portrayed as intended by GRRM.

All this... just because Stoneheart might've been a bit meaningless? Lol. At that point, they should've just removed Oberyn Martell too."
Love Cheque Charge,"? Are you actually serious?

Yeah i was totally gonna not watch the last season of a show i've been watching/following/reading books about for years... ?

I have no idea if you're actually serious or just a troll, genuinely no idea.

Season 7 was bad and riddled with mistakes, ofcourse everyone also watched season 8 just to watch the train derail and burn completely.

Bro what are your comments genuinely?"
Love Cheque Charge,"Yeah, ASOIAF was my favorite series and I was so excited (and scared) when the show was announced.    At the time I only knew one or two other people in real life that had actually read the books, and this show made my DAD read them.  And he doesn't read fantasy.    Anyways, I was scared they'd butcher the characters and turn them into caricatures.   The show improved some characters (Oberyn and Davos were show favorites of mine and I did not care for them in the books) and made others worse (book Jon >>> show Jon,  Mance Rayder) and some I feel were perfectly cast (Jaime, Cersei, Tywin, Tyrion,  Jorah).   Plus the show gave us that badass Mormont child leader.   She's the best part of the last seasons.  

Anyways, while the show had book source material it stayed great.  And when it started ""spoiling"" the books for me my resentment and anger (at GRRM, whether that's fair or not)  totally did contribute to my less charitable opinions on the storylines.   I had wanted to read these, not see the dumbed down version with missing character arcs try to wrap it all up.   And it was so underwhelming because the expectations were high AND I was bitter and predisposed to not be happy about it no matter how good it was.   And it did end up being... not great.   Maybe in book format we'd have had enough story added to make the ending work, but we didn't have that here.   But there's no way objectively that it's 2/10.   I'd say 6.5/7.    But if our expectations were for 10/10, then 6 or 7 feels like a huge letdown.   As big of a letdown as if a  6-7/10 average show had a 2-3/10 finale."
Love Cheque Charge,"I feel like The Witcher was confusing on purpose though with the timelines, it's like they wanted you to always be wondering ""wtf was that about"""
Love Cheque Charge,"Aside from the massive difference in tone... they're talking about fantasy *vocabulary*, not magic itself."
Love Cheque Charge,"I know about Lady Stoneheart. I understand the fantasy elements are important to the story, I just said they're my least favorite parts. I didn't ask for them to be removed or anything."
Be with Me,"I mean this is a fairly pragmatic view point for the good of the many, but the entire point of the finale is to confront pragmatism and idealism. Joel would rather the Fireflies fail than Ellie die. His reasons are personal, but it makes no difference to him, he wouldn't sacrifice Ellie in the same way that I probably wouldn't have the strength of will to sacrifice my child, even if it was for a greater good.

It is a controversial story beat and the debate is great! Entirely intended. I don't see a problem with it."
Be with Me,"I'm having a hard time understanding the point of your argument. This nuance to the trolley problem has been a moral dilemma that folks struggle with since ancient times. 

Are you just saying you don't enjoy philosophy that much? Or are frustrated that people don't agree with your world view? I think, as a species, we enjoy finding hyper specific situations and then wondering if we would have done the same, or if actions taken in those moments were justified. I would go so far as to say this isn't a problem in fiction, debates like this happen all the time over history. See: The dropping of the atomic bombs for one easy example.

It's just a very human question, and there's no right or wrong answer. So we have fun talking about the situations where it comes into play"
Be with Me,"Are we talking about the season ending ep’s dilemma between the life of Ellie for the cure and Joel’s choosing to protect her over saving the world, supposedly?? 

I ask, because what struck me as so needless in this dilemma and portrayed disingenuously is…..no research doc worth their salt would go with an experimental cure and plan for it, and kill the only living patient they got their hands on if they were WRONG. 

They would absolutely be wanting to keep her alive if their first best estimate failed."
Be with Me,"Well, yeah, that's the idea, Joel loves Ellie and sees her as the daughter he lost. People felt that emotional connection and put them in the ""good"" category cause it's a nice trait that they want to have, and there can't be flaws in a role model.

Never.

So, yeah, AJ was a fucking dick, no discussion there.

Also unrelated but the ""arguments"" about the doctors not knowing what they were doing is dumb af. The show itself states that's the only possible way, a doctor in the show dies trying to keep Ellie on the operation table. But suddenly everyone is a neurologist and can refute the science of a fictional show that was surrounded by the infected for 20 years

That's, again, people rationalizing Joel's decision to absolve him from any wrongdoing so he can be the good guy again, and therefore the perfect role model"
Be with Me,">If the finale had been about the Fireflies needing to dissect Sam, and Joel still went on his rampage, you would not see the moralizing ""Joel the hero!"" posting you consistently see on this sub, you would see the constant ""sacrifices need to be made and sheltered Hollywood writers can't make hard choices"" posting you see everywhere on Reddit.

Uh... bullshit? Sam is just as innocent as Ellie. We may not cheer Joel on as hard, but swapping them out doesn't change the nature of the problem to any appreciable degree.

>If Game of Thrones presented the option that the Long Night had a chance of being averted if they burnt Olly at the stake, then everyone would want Olly burnt. 

Depends - is this before or after *he became the chief figure in a mutiny that got a beloved character and, in-universe, a competent leader killed*? If he had never become ""Fuck Olly"", then people wouldn't want to see him punished. Stannis' daughter was in the exact position you're talking about and the fanbase went fucking apeshit over her death.

>If the Sopranos presented the option that the gangs *might* leave Tony alone if he drowned AJ in the pool, everyone would want AJ drowned.

WTF? This is just wrong. Nobody has ever wanted Tony Soprano to be an even *bigger* asshole to his kids.

>This is why I think the creators got the exact reaction they wanted: When it is *demonstrably true* that fanbases will jump to immediate moralizing to defend a character they're attached to, then they're effectively in the exact same mindset as Joel. This is why I have issues with even engaging with fiction as I get older (especially in an age of anti-heroes), because at the core, the nature of media is an appeal to charisma and entertainment value.

You're talking as if the only reason people ever support anything is some kind of shallow popularity contest that they jump through hoops to justify. I wanted Joel to kill the Fireflies because they were liars who were about to do something apocalyptically stupid (kill the only known immune person on Earth) to someone without their full, informed consent. If Ellie had been told exactly what she was volunteering for and went ahead with it anyway, then it'd suck, but I wouldn't want Joel to gun down a whole hospital because it'd be objectively wrong. Hell, even the way he went about it was wrong because he didn't give Marlene the chance to wake Ellie up & come clean."
Be with Me,"Are you talking about the doctor, who had no problem killing a kid when neither he nor Firefly had any idea about the cure, into a saint that in the sequel rescues animal just to show how evil Joel is? They've made zero progress while investigating previous infected people. They apparently lost personnel at a previous research base when some idiot let infected monkeys out of the cage instead of destroying them, and the purpose of killing Ellie seems to be nothing more than getting better access to her infection on the assumption that something is different about the infection itself. 

That being a rather dubious line of reasoning they seem to have rushed into. You have the only immune human and instead of starting with things like blood tests, transfusions, they just go right to cutting out her brain. No extracting of cerebrospinal fluid, bone marrow, plasma, nothing, except a scan. Just carve up her brain growth and see what's up. Then the group rushes the experiment even before waking her up, not even letting Joel see her for the last time, or attempt at persuading Joel into see things from their perspective. [Watch Joseph Anderson's analysis to see how incompetent the Fireflies were.](https://youtu.be/ma4DJbvO84I?t=11151)

In retrospect, The Last of Us failed to convey two sides of hypothetical morality. The game presents an utterly incompetent group that is written like a bunch of assholes, yet it wants us to feel conflicted and bad about you going against them in the hosptial. *""Hey, we made you walk across the entire country with this girl that you'd inevitably grow close with, we didn't tell you that she was going to be disected at the end, nor are we planning on telling her. Instead we're basically gonna drug her, drug you and then cut her open and hope that we might get a functional cure... Also, we're not paying you and there's about a 60% chance that we're just gonna shoot you in the back once you leave.""* Like, how is this a conflicting choice. They are best described as untrustworthy and incapable, so even though Joel is acting for emotional reasons, the rational thing to do if you want to kill Ellie to develop a cure is to kill the Fireflies and take her elsewhere like FEDRA. There's not much of a dilemma.

The Fireflies is a shallowly written organization in terms of writing. They are not fleshed out or explored. Are you asking me to sympathize with the group because they are fighting FEDRA--the government we don't even see if they are tyrannical or not? No part of the story makes me think that maybe they’re good people forced to do morally questionable things for the betterment of humanity, especially when we barely get to know who even Marlene is. Compare this to Lady Eboshi and the Irontown from Princess Mononoke, which actually explored those two sides. Even if the story ultimately judges them to be in the wrong, it is not confused by what each side is trying to convey, how it's conveying that, and the pros and cons of each side's method.

And I had hoped they execute this part better in the show. Instead, they made them even dumber."
Be with Me,"I’m not defending Joel when I say people shouldn’t scoop a kids brains out without telling the kid and with no guarantee of success.

I probably wouldn’t go mass shooter since I wouldn’t know how, but one can easily side with the moral dilemma and not think Joel is a hero for the tough choice."
Be with Me,[removed]
Be with Me,"He was ultimately selfish, which makes him a realistic character. He has done bad things before sometimes to survive and perhaps even sometimes just for benefitting from it when he could have walked away, that's his character. he chose to save Elie because she gave him a reason to live beyond just survival.

He made the selfish choice to kill all of those people, and potentially humanity, over losing his ""daughter"" for his own benefit more so than for Ellies.. 

but pragmatically speaking the fireflies should have been impregnating women and getting them infected to recreate multiple Ellies rather than wait 14-16 years. Kind of bleak and morbid and evil to do, but pragmatically speaking it would have yielded better outcomes as I assume the virus being in a baby or a teenager would not matter. Again i know morbid and evil."
Be with Me,"It's not about the show, it's about the repetitive nature of the debate and the double standards applied over the course of an entire decade. I genuinely don't like engaging with it because I really get the sense that human beings only care about characters insomuch as they find them entertaining and charming, which is nihlistic in my view."
Be with Me,Well also you wouldn’t need to kill the patient to get the T cells needed for a vaccine
Be with Me,"Yeah, the Last of Us is not written super well at points. I said this when I was 14 and I still say this at age 24. But there's a difference between narrative execution and narrative intent. The idea presented within was supposed to be that Joel sacrificed a potential chance at a cure for (selfish) love, and for the audience to debate who they sympathize with in the scenario. Instead, the fanbase just debates semantics and moves goalposts. The line of defense in 2013 was

>oh, well, they're extremely vague about their methods of cure, so it won't work

And then the series explains the chemical messenger thing and the debate then shifts to

>well the Fireflies don't have access to infrastructure to build a cure so the whole thing's a bust"
Be with Me,"Oh my god I’m so glad someone said this. People critiquing the fireflies really bend over backwards and are suddenly medically trained professionals while ignoring that the information WE know from watching, is not what the world knows…. 

WE may know the cure probably wouldn’t have worked because WE saw the mycologist in episode 2 explain there is no vaccine for fungus. One lady in Jakarta who was bombed shortly after and didn’t get the chance to speak with anyone. Not to mention that so many of the medical breakthroughs of the last 20 years we know they went without. Time and knowledge stopped for them in 2003! Stop judging them by 2023 science!! 

THEN the fact that people think it was pointless because of the medical infrastructure. I’d hate to be in the apocalypse with those people because nothing would be good enough or worth trying since we don’t have creature comforts we’re used to anymore."
Be with Me,"> Uh... bullshit? Sam is just as innocent as Ellie. We may not cheer Joel on as hard, but swapping them out doesn't change the nature of the problem to any appreciable degree.

My point is that it absolutely would to 90% of the audience because they would sympathize with the Fireflies if you put Sam in Ellie's place and still had Joel do the same thing. You're making my argument for me by pointing out that it's the same scenario.

My argument with Olly can be substituted with Sweetrobin or Hot Pie, and I didn't use Shireen as an example because there was an entire subplot dedicated to making you attached to her.

Also literally look at any clip of Tony and AJ and it's nothing but people wanting Tony to kick the shit out of him.

Note how you didn't have a response to the Ben/Clem thing, because I feel like it outright proves my point."
Be with Me,[deleted]
Be with Me,"Yeah, I enjoyed the show, but I think the game benefitted from its limitations. Less is more, sometimes."
Be with Me,"They were never planning to wait 14 years. Joel kills their research scientist less than 9 months after anyone realizes Ellie is immune, no one knew she was until the Riley incident. For all we know, they were impregnating women and planning to do this, and decided to use Ellie because she was there before any baby and they weren’t sure infecting pregnant women would work — who knows what the time window has to be, after all? They don’t even know that’s the cause of Ellie’s immunity — Marlene was told Anna has already cut the umbilical cord before being bitten, so all they’ve got is a theory about what *maybe* happened, and if it happened *maybe* caused the immunity, and which *might* be reproducible, and no idea of how long they’d have to wait to cut the cord to get that effect. From a researcher’s POV it’s still definitely worth getting your hands on Ellie, who’s confirmed immune and can be examined right now."
Be with Me,"It's not characters, it's how people engage with the world in general. It's only natural for people to favor who they have emotional bonds with. We don't care about strangers or the harm that comes to them nearly as much. And of course there are double standards, humans are full of contradictions. Not just in fiction, but in life. We're not robots, everything we do is subjective and varies based on our feelings at any given moment. Sure, we try to be consistent, but often fall short of doing so. 

I guess I don't understand your comment and point further than ""I dislike prevalent human nature"""
Be with Me,"They weren’t looking for T cells tho. They are thinking the fungus primarily grows in the brain so to get it from her and synthesize they’d have to kill her to harvest her brain

But medically, this doesn’t hold up. and obviously being untried they’d wanna keep her alive to find another way if the first way didn’t pan out

Sry for typos. I have lost my reading glasses nd can’t replace them till tomorrow"
Be with Me,"Also, I didn’t take it Joel acted out of selfish love only. He has remarked with sadness she’s never had the chance to have a life. That’s thinking of her and what it’s like for her"
Be with Me,"I didn't have a response to Ben/Clem because I never played that far in those games, so I'm responding to the rest of the points you made because I'm familiar with them and wouldn't have to guess or be talking out of my ass.

Your overall point seems to be ""if anyone isn't completely in love with a character, they will act like total sociopaths towards them"" and that's horrifying.

>My point is that it absolutely would to 90% of the audience because they would sympathize with the Fireflies if you put Sam in Ellie's place and still had Joel do the same thing. You're making my argument for me by pointing out that it's the same scenario.

You're saying that the audience would support child murder simply because it's a different innocent kid with less character development. I know there's a subset of every fandom that is, shall we say, *more than amenable* to swapping a black boy for a white girl when the situation is life-threatening, but they're by no means a majority, especially not ""90%"".

>My argument with Olly can be substituted with Sweetrobin or Hot Pie, and I didn't use Shireen as an example because there was an entire subplot dedicated to making you attached to her.

Again, you're saying that we will be okay with *child murder* simply based on whether or not we have spent an arbitrary amount of time with the character and like them. You're stripping away and & all context except for whatever you need to twist to make your argument.

>Also literally look at any clip of Tony and AJ and it's nothing but people wanting Tony to kick the shit out of him.

There is a big difference between us wanting a father to make his son not be an insufferable asshole and us wanting him to literally kill him."
Be with Me,"There would be no reason to flesh it out imo.

It’s where they are at. 

The story is not meant to make our issues with the morality any easier. Nearly every big scene or conversation was in one way or another foreshadowing the fireflies, Joel, or Ellie.

I thought it was brilliant in how it made me remember other discussions."
Be with Me,[deleted]
Be with Me,"I guess it's ""I dislike a debate that is by its very nature a personal one that wouldn't be had about anyone besides this highly charismatic character being passed off as if it's a logical and/or moral one""."
Be with Me,"They could have set it up better. They needed at least an episode where the fireflies were being nice and running tests. They figure something out but determine she won’t survive the procedure. They lie to Joel and Ellie, but Joel figures it out and rescues her."
Be with Me,">There is a big difference between us wanting a father to make his son not be an insufferable asshole and us wanting him to literally kill him.

lol check out the comments on this vid

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-zd9Srk3y4"
Be with Me,"I agree. I think people are unintentionally remembering the mycologist and how she said there is no cure for their arguments for Joel without realizing that’s only something WE the audience and her knew. That wasn’t common information to the world because they bombed her country shortly after. 

Saying “they should’ve known it wouldn’t work” makes no sense because they WOULDNT know. They were not privy to that discussion."
Be with Me,"In the cutscenes, dude. And I'm not saying that all video games are like this, just the Naughty Dog style of mission-based games. Also, the caveat is made for the talking head scenes of Joel and Ellie, which is the game's strength. I'm simply saying that actual *cutscenes* are by their nature quick and need to get exposition out ASAP."
Be with Me,"But it's not about putting different characters in Jole and Ellie's shoes. It's about if you were Joel, would you sacrafice or save Ellie l given the information you had. The debate is not about whether you would go on a rampage to save any old kid. The specifics of the situation matter. They're the only thing that matters. Change the situation, you have a different moral dilemma on your hands.

It's the personal nature that makes it worth investigating."
Be with Me,"I see a lot of people making fun of him for pretending to be a tough guy and then crying & pissing his pants when actually confronted with danger, but not a whole lot of ""I wish the bear woulda ate him!"" Are you getting this from somehow sorting your whole life by Controversial?"
Be with Me,[deleted]
Be with Me,"I *know*, reread my OP post, it's not about the game, it's about what the debate around it has effectively devolved into after a decade. You are preaching to the choir."
Be with Me,"Discussing limitations of a medium in which art is presented is not necessarily looking down upon said medium at all. I am a 24 year old zoomer, you don't need to tell me that video games are art, I can give you a whole dissertation. I'm generalizing for the sake of trying to explain why the scene of Joel being given the escort job is 2 minutes in the game vs 12 in the show (I highly prefer the game, btw).

I will edit my initial post, though."
Be with Me,"Your dislike for what the debate as devolved into reads like ""But if we change key elements of this problem, people's choice would be different, therefore there is no merit in the debate"" which seems nonsensical to me. It reads that your point is people are discussing their personal choice, but because there is no objective right choice, any discussion around it is pointless.

There is value in knowing where people's morals stand situationally. This is why we as a species talk about it when these moral grey areas come up. And if, on a wildly extrapolated, primal instinctual level, we view someone's personal choice to be a threat to the community, it makes sense to debate and try to get them to change their opinion. 

Maybe I'm still missing it, but my ultimate thought is it makes sense to debate personal choices, they're arguably the only thing worth debating about."
Be with Me,[deleted]
Be with Me,"I think that there's value in pointing out that, when a debate turns into moralizing, saying ""you would not have this debate about someone else"" effectively torpedos the supposed objectivity of the debate. When people consistently say ""Oh, well the Fireflies' plan wouldn't have worked cause yada yada yada"", I genuinely just don't believe they'd go through the effort of making the debate if it wasn't about someone they're emotionally attached to, which *removes the stance of objectivity that side is taking* and renders their point moot."
Be with Me,"No, I'm...speaking generally. You can *choose* to take my point as clearly intended, which is ""cutscene-based games with single mission campaigns often don't have time to have talking head segments explaining every little detail like HBO shows do"", but instead you're choosing to hyperfixate on my exact wording so you can pretend I'm looking down on video games."
Be with Me,"Just to make sure we keep on that same page, what I'm understanding is: 

People claim saving Ellie objectively the right thing to do. But that objectivity is contradictory because they would not do the same thing for another less liked character?

If that's your point...ok? People are really bad at terms and use ""objective truth"" to gain some sort of advantage in arguments all they time. They can squak about objective truth all they want, it doesn't make their pov objective. I dunno, my comment there is don't let poor use of terms ruin your fun debating, assuming you enjoy debating"
Be with Me,[deleted]
Be with Me,"It's not just use of terms, it's the existence of the debate in the first place and hyperfixation on details that wouldn't happen otherwise. I don't wanna keep explaining it, because I feel like you get my point, but you understand why 10 years of the same cyclical debate gets tiresome."
Be with Me,"Sure dude. Whatever you wanna believe I believe about video games. Please send me whatever ""It's Just a Game"" youtube video playlist you have that lets you feel like a victim."
Be with Me,"The frustration with the fixation on details is the part I don't get, and haven't gotten since the beginning. 

I feel there's a disconnect between what is actually being debated. Your stance is that fixating on these details is irrelevant or unjustified when they're actually **key**. The details define the situation. People aren't talking about the trolley problem, they're talking about in this specific circumstance, with this specific relationship, and this specific world, what would you do. 

It doesn't matter if people would make different choices if Ellie was a different character, or if the fireflies were more or less believable, or wouldn't care about x or y thing if she was less charismatic...that's not what people are talking about"
Be with Me,[deleted]
Be with Me,You are pushing me for answers over and over in a way that makes it seem like you feel insecure for liking video games while simultaneously feeling like I'm misrepresenting them when the reality is I *slightly* misspoke in a way that was trivial to my point.
Be with Me,"This man was the best straight man of our generation. He played his roles with such conviction that you honestly believed him and followed along with some of the stupidest shit said. 

This death hurt me, and I didn’t even appreciate a lot of his roles."
Be with Me,His performance is kind of unbelievable in this for a skit that wouldn't even be that good otherwise
Be with Me,Amazing actor.  RIP
Be with Me,"watching Bosch, I realized how actually big Lance Reddit was. Like damn, there's a scene with him, shot from behind, Titus Welliver, who is not really a big boy, and a woman and Lance's shoulder frame basically shields the two of them"
Be with Me,Sure there is the Wire.  But this...this is the apex.  What a legend.
Be with Me,Will never forget the stare at the end
Be with Me,I'm sad it took his passing for me to see this for the first time.
Be with Me,Toys Were Him :(
Be with Me,"My best friend and I quote this all the time.

“Call Mom and Dad… tell them the second mortgage they got on the house was worth it”

RIP big guy ❤️😭"
Be with Me,His voice is iconic
Be with Me,Listening to his voice is better than ASMR
Be with Me," This man deserved sixteen Oscars for this. Go easy, Lance."
Be with Me,"Getting serious Johnson vibes from ""Peep Show"""
Be with Me,Holy shit this guy's acting is amazing. And hilarious.
Be with Me,"When the kid says the toy store sucks, I love how Lance's face goes full-on death stare to subtle, calculated smirk."
Be with Me,This clip just got me to remember that Lance Reddick played [the CEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7R_TCqFu9g) in [Corporate](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5648202/reference/)! A shame that series didn't last longer.
Be with Me,God I’m so sad he’s gone! Everything he was in was great! The wire and AHS was my favorites he was in. Papa Legba was legendary!
Be with Me,That ending was awful but the beginning was great. Lol.
Be with Me,RIP 🕊
Be with Me,I remember the first time I saw him on Oz back in the day. Man was so talented. He will be sadly missed
Be with Me,Best thing out of funny or die.
Be with Me,No one else could’ve done this
Be with Me,"The punchline is in the title. Come on Funny or Die, what is this? Amateur hour?"
Be with Me,That hog joke still doesn’t land well
Be with Me,"Man, it’s funny. But they didn’t really know how to end it, did they?

That’s ok. To quote THKYK, “Endings are hard.”"
Be with Me,That is fucking hilarious.
Be with Me,I just love the intensity he brings to all of his characters!
Be with Me,They guy never looked a day over 30 to me. I don't understand how we lost him so young. Very unfair. Really enjoyed him in the Horizon games.
Be with Me,"I love finding stuff like this, that's I've never seen, years after it first came out. Lance was superb. 

Also check out Captain Planet."
Be with Me,"He was one of those actors who you just paid full attention to, he truly had a screen aura. I've been a cinema lover since I was young, and television of course but this death has truly saddened me since I heard it. He seemed like such a gent off screen too."
Be with Me,"Definitely feels like it was written with him in mind. I also like the idea that they ran a few stories by him and he was like ""I got to do that one."""
Be with Me,"Dude was fucking jacked in The Wire, 8 pack."
Be with Me,"Also, I think I learned from that show that he was a real talented piano player, which is why he kept jamming on it in the show."
Be with Me,The sip from the Felix the cat mug did it for me
Be with Me,"I'm sad for you too. One day, you will watch this and just smile."
Be with Me,The best award he got was a dedicated fandom that loves him.
Be with Me,"Funny or die has some real gems sometimes.I remember seeing the one with Ralph Macchio years back that had me in tears. 

As soon as I saw the title and his face the first time I watched this, I knew it was going to be epic."
Be with Me,A comment copied from youtube.
Be with Me,"i guess we have a different sense of humour. i laughed outloud at that line. 

For context i'm afab, but identify as pretty gender queer... tho also schizophrenic. Sooo, maybe my craziness makes me think weird things are hilarious? 🫣

In another context i might *not* have found the line funny, and i might have even thought it was offensive, but this hit me just right."
Be with Me,And a voice I will never forget.
Be with Me,"I’m right there with you, this is one of if not the hardest hittin celeb deaths I can remember for me, such a great actor and by all accounts and even better person. Such a huge loss, Lance goes down as a legend in my personal book. It’s gonna be really damn bittersweet watching John wick 4 next week"
Be with Me,"Yeah, he always wore a suit and everything, then you see him in the scene shirtless for the first time and it’s like daaaaaamn"
Be with Me,"Man was ripped as fuck for his legendary Eric Andre show appearance. Seems the guy loved fitness because he was ripped consistently for decades. Just goes to show how fragile life can be, Lance was in better shape than like 99% of 60yr olds. What a huge loss"
Be with Me,"I was like, they waited four seasons before dropping this card??"
Be with Me,"I've been watching the Wire this past few weeks, and I'm sure he had one scene in season 1 where he answered the phone shirtless. My reaction was also along the lines of daaaaaamn!

Think that was when his wife told him there was a call, and might have been when he heard the young'un had lost his eye."
Be with Me,"I know some are using the Megan stuff to bin what I presume is large contracts for him.

But I feel its also highly likely hes just gotten to an age where he's winding down a lot of his stuff too, and is moving towards semi-retiring. And the article has given everyone cover to let him wind down accordingly."
Be with Me,"> “We have a contract. We’re contracted to this [season], so we will do that,” said McCall. “And then we have no future commitments. And we haven’t made any statements about that.”

Is that actually confirmation that it's ending? They might have no future commitments right not but it doesn't really say they aren't open to extending the contract."
Be with Me,TIL - Who Wants to Be a Millionaire still exists in the UK.
Be with Me,"People freaking out over what he said about Markle have never watched Top Gear's The News segment. He said much worst over the years. And also in many other articles he's written over the years.

This will blow over like it always does. He's a great writer and presenter. He's controvertial, but he rakes in so much money, he'll always find a new home.

Until he decides he has had enough and retires on his farm. Being yelled at by Caleb."
Be with Me,No it isn't? And he hasn't been fired either.
Be with Me,"Considering how popular Clarkson is, even with his current issues, I have a feeling by the time his various contracts end he will be able to find work without a problem."
Be with Me,"I'm not surprised, Clarkson has slowly but steadily proven himself a liability. Sure he's a draw and makes networks money but when you can't be certain of when he'll say or do something stupid, it's a problem."
Be with Me,"I think people are putting too much emphasis on Jeremy, he has always been a bit controversial long before ITV signed him on for the show. Yes he's had a recent controversy but no worse than others, that's just his schtick and you either love it or hate it.

Personally I detach the entertainner from the show so it makes no difference, I still watch Grand Tour (although not as good as Top Gear in it's hayday) and Clarksons Farm Season 2 was as good as the first season and the second best show on Prime after Bosch. 

**So why end?**

Gameshows are the problem, what made gameshows so alluring in the 00's was their cheap engagement. The pause between the question and answer isn't to build tension or fill time it's to engage with the audience. Nowadays that engagement is a disadvantage. People are on their phone, tablets, heck playing a game. They don't want to watch something kinda engaging they either want something casual (like say The Great Pottery Throwdown) or something immensely engaging like a crime show. Gameshows are neither.

Furthermore these stations want stuff for their app, plain and simple, but no one is going back to watch old episodes of Who Wants to be a millionaire, so from an app perspective gameshows have zero value. 

I could be wrong and ITV announce a new presenter like Stephen Fry or David Tennant (which would be quite cool) but I more think this is down to the lack of popularity and usefulness of gameshows.

What I think Clarkson would be excellent at, and would love to see him do, is present a reboot of Scrapheap Challenge, or what Americans know as Junkyard Wars.

I also got to thinking about Robot Wars being rebooted then I realised a. It had already been rebooted and b. Jeremy Clarkson presented the original 1998 version."
Be with Me,Some people who hate Jeremy Clarkson love Gordon Ramsay. That's something I'll never understand.

When I See You Again,"They tried to reboot it in 2008, and it sucked."
When I See You Again,"I worked on the 2007-8 reboot. In fact it was my very first job in TV. We were all very excited about the return and right out the gate there was incredible action. A friend pointed out the first barrier in assault. It was a solid block. ""Originally that was a plexiglass screen. First time they test fired the gun it completely shattered it."" Goddamn. Contestants were getting hurt. Broken bones, blown ACL... GODDAMN! At one point we ran out of alternates and the gladiators had to be told to take it easier.




We were all very excited for it to air. Unfortunately you didn't feel any of that intensity on screen. It was edited to death. Got the feeling the producers weren't sports people. ""Let's go to instant replay..."" *Shows the same shot in crappy post slow motion then MOVING ON WE GOT COMMERCIALS TO SELL!*




Wasted potential and probably killed any chance of another reboot. I don't think anyone understood the amazing ridiculous nature of the property."
When I See You Again,"It could be, but like every old show they bring back they’d have an annoying host that screams most of the time, they’d try to really super modernize it to this period of time today, and there’d be a bunch of unnecessary drama and drawing things out.   

I’d love to see something like the original, just two fairly normal people doing some events against some slightly less than pro athletes. Keep all the trends out of it and just make it a competition show with no BS or agenda, or any other crap and it’s be super cool. Daytime Sunday tv or something, it doesn’t have to be a huge Monday or Thursday night at 8am thing. Just give us some cool and fun classic events and some cool and fun new events."
When I See You Again,There’s too many options now. there are fewer people stuck watching channel 9 on a Saturday afternoon
When I See You Again,"it would be more fun to participate. 

I think if they popped up American Gladiator event areas around major cities it would be popular."
When I See You Again,I think it would more interesting if you had retired athletes as American Gladiators. We could see the average Joe vs Pros.
When I See You Again,GUTS on Nickelodeon. Astrocrag!
When I See You Again,"Nope. It was of it's time, but with WWE, MMA, ninja warrior and whatever else, it would just fall flat. Plus what would it be if anyone asked for steroid testing?

It's body quit. It's bird quit. And it's no longer legit."
When I See You Again,Malibu all the way
When I See You Again,Turbo!
When I See You Again,"Game shows were big in the 90's and American Gladiators was the perfect mix of game show and the popular physical fitness trend.

Nowadays I just can't see anything that would grab a modern streaming audience to watch the original American Gladiators and it would need to be changed significantly with things newer audiences demand like more storylines and higher stakes as to be a completely different show. 

People's expectations of physical fitness have also changed and the gladiators would have to be so ridiculously roided out now to be considered as imposing as they were back then to new audiences who have grown up on Marvel movies."
When I See You Again,"No.  Granted, a hit today is a far far lower bar, but this show is would be heavily skewed towards male audiences, and I don't think there's a good channel for it.  It would get lost in the shuffle for streaming, and otherwise on cable, it doesn't really have a home channel that would generate any significant viewership"
When I See You Again,"I remember giving the reboot a chance, and it was lame. I think the day of the roided up athlete is long past."
When I See You Again,"Nope. It'd just be Titan Games. 42 minutes of which 5-10 of it is actual action and a LOT of slow motion while we tell 25-30 minutes of people's sob stories or inspirational stories and the rest is The Rock talking.

I enjoyed Titan Games but it became grating after a while and as competitors advance, they'd fucking reintroduce their sob story again to pad more time."
When I See You Again,It’s also how I figured out I am gay
When I See You Again,Mark Ortega beating Bam Bam at the last second on the Eliminator is still talked about to this day at my family gatherings.
When I See You Again,"It already is a hit today… whether it’s fighting or singing or “surviving “ or running through an obstacle course, it’s still on everywhere, entertaining the same simple intellects as ever"
When I See You Again,"These days, people would be triggered by average people in shape and doing amazing things."
When I See You Again,Only if they replace the tennis balls with live ammo
When I See You Again,"Probably not a hit but it could be fun still. That ultimate tag show was on a couple years ago and I thought it was good, the athletes had personalities and the games were pretty exciting."
When I See You Again,No. There were way less options when the original aired.
When I See You Again,"Well, for my country's best friends, got bad news. We're getting a reboot before you.

But the good news is that the BBC is going to outwit, outplay and, with a bit of luck, outlast Big Brother with a certain format."
When I See You Again,Dress up a couple of dudes as orcs shooting tennis ball cannons at you from a stage dressed like Mount Doom and watch the money roll in on dumptrucks.
When I See You Again,Bring it back with the original gladiators against contestants born in the 1970’s or earlier? Must-see-TV.
When I See You Again,The rock already ripped it off and tried
When I See You Again,Only if they had swords.
When I See You Again,Tried and failed multiple times. I attribute this to actual blood sports getting more popular.
When I See You Again,They have been releasing full old episodes (up to season 5 so far) on youtube FYI
When I See You Again,They are bringing back the UK version. I remember going to see it on tour at Wembley arena back in the day. As a kid it was great. As a adult? No thanks
When I See You Again,"Only if it was real gladiatorial sport, replete with bloodshed and triumph, and that tennis ball rail gun."
When I See You Again,"Always felt a comedy movie or series about it would be better. Cena, Battista, Rock, Hemsworth, Adam Devine, etc"
When I See You Again,"I used to watch that with my father. Great show, definitely think it would be a hit today too."
When I See You Again,Nitro!!!
When I See You Again,"I don't think so, only because since then (even the reboot one) there's a TON of these competitive obstacle courses that are all over TV like NBC. I think The Rock, John Cena and Stone Cold each did one too. I'll be damned if I know the names as I'm not really interested in those shows, but the fact there were so many of them tells me the ratings have been good for them overall."
When I See You Again,"Ow, my balls"
When I See You Again,"It was Saturday morning tv, no ? Unless that was a rerun but that's how i remember it"
When I See You Again,They should mix Family Feud and American Gladiators. Little Cindy on the tennis ball gun takes out that smart ass Webber kid while the moms pummel each other with those giant Q-Tips.
When I See You Again,A friend in college trained to be on the reboot and they rejected him because he made Hulk Hogan look too small.
When I See You Again,I think Assault could be it's own show.
When I See You Again,This was the show to watch during the ‘08 writers strike
When I See You Again,No. It's not stupid enough
When I See You Again,Hell yeah bring back the tights!
When I See You Again,"Anyone remember this knockoff series that was short-lived? I remember watching it and thinking “Wow, what a blatant rip-off…”

The gimmick was unique but it wasn’t as well-constructed nor were the events or final event as compelling as American Gladiators, IIRC. But it was filmed at CBS Studio Center, as was American Gladiators!

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_and_Warriors"
When I See You Again,"No, event TV doesn’t exist anymore outside of the Super Bowl"
When I See You Again,Australian here. We had our own version but I distinctly recall two American gladiators cameo'ed in Hot Shots! Part Deux.
When I See You Again,"A bunch of our friends were talking about American Gladiator then one of my friends said,"" Nitro is my favorite "". We all teased him and said he was gay."
When I See You Again,"Probably, they would go more towards a ""reality"" type show though."
When I See You Again,"The UK version of this was also wildly popular in the 90s and was filmed in an arena in Birmingham. Sky tried to bring it back a decade ago but in a large TV studio, which massively reduced the sense of occasion the original show had, so it was inevitably a flop.

I believe the BBC are going to have a crack it remaking it soon though, and I trust them much more than Sky to do it justice. If they get the tone of it right I reckon it'll do really well tbh."
When I See You Again,"at 8, i learned how to rollerblade from watching american gladiators. no jokes. i realised they were gaining momentum by pushing their feet to the sides"
When I See You Again,"Yes.

They need to keep the show as economical as the 80’s-90’s version.

Here are our 3 challengers going against this stacked team of gladiators and within 3 minutes we’re already at the first event. No sob stories or human interest, roll the balls out and let’s go, we know what we came for.

For the challengers one needs to be a ringer and one needs to exist just to rag dolled. I want to see Hailey, the former D1 track star and Olympic trials alternate who now does BJJ go toe to toe with someone, but I want to see Candace from Grand Rapids who’s listed as “does step aerobics 2x a week” take some L’s.

For the games, make it simple. No rigs, or elastic bands, climbing gear. Bring back breakthrough and conquer, joust and that ball in the center cone game, or go schoolyard, add bulldog, or steal the bacon, don’t try to add sh*t to make it extreme, speed, agility and strength win out, we should be cheering for the impact of one person against the other, not the scenario.

Don’t be above cheesy. If you have “Malibu” let him be Malibu, he’s a ditzy bro surfer who’s the size of a refrigerator. If you have “Titan” let him be a big bad MF. Let the gladiators and challengers talk their sh*t, let them get chippy.

That goes along with - let the gladiators be the stars. Not the host, or commentators. The Rock (Titan Games) and Hulk Hogan (the reboot of AG) suck the air out of the room."
When I See You Again,For what it's worth the American gladiators YouTube channel is slowing uploading all of the episodes from the 90s!
When I See You Again,"Part of the problem with the reboot was that they cut out some of the events for sponsors... Y'know, replacing the content part of the show with the part that people only tolerate."
When I See You Again,"Hulk Hogan + Reality TV = Trash. Who'd've guessed?

Even with Hogan in there if they had kept the basics of the original show, having random assholes on every week, I think it would've done fine. Instead they went the reality TV angle like any of us care about the contestants beyond how they run the course. They ruined a perfectly good format by trying to change it into something else."
When I See You Again,They even brought in the dodgeball ref from “Dodgeball” for star power and legitimacy and it still didn’t stick. Shame.
When I See You Again,"Original one ended in 1996 and rebooted in 2007. 

The reboot is actually closer to the original than today."
When I See You Again,"The reboot also had a really poorly designed competition. I remember that the final course was just dominated by anyone who was fast, so the rest of the show didn't really matter and the ""gladiator"" aspect was kinda lost."
When I See You Again,The games themselves were fine. Just the rest of the show was a train wreck. I’d record on DVR and fast forward the sob stories and commercials. You could watch the show in about 10-12 mins. That’s how much non action was included in the hour long show.
When I See You Again,"Gina Carano in her prime was nice, though ;)"
When I See You Again,Did they ever share why they went reality angle on contestants instead of having different people each week? I think it really hurt the show that you had whole segments wasted on people's backstories over the whole season. It really took me out of by the time they cut back to the set.
When I See You Again,"Luckily my college roommate and I watched this on DVR because the action to filler/commercial ratio was bad lol

Also I hated when Gina Carano would cheat on Joust."
When I See You Again,"Great post, really interesting insight. 

I was watching a doc about the UK version of Gladiators and I really hadn't appreciated just how seriously dangerous it was when I'd watched the show myself as a kid. The toll that shit was taking on the gladiators' bodies during long shoots was crazy."
When I See You Again,"Also, the second season cut out segments and put them on NBC.com because they needed to cut it down to a half hour to show some special series that I have no recollection of.

Rocket from season 2 also went on to compete in American Ninja Warrior."
When I See You Again,"There were talks of a Reboot in association with WWE last year but you can’t find any word of it after the announcement.

BUT 

The UK version is actually set to start filming in 2023

https://variety.com/2022/global/global/gladiators-revival-bbc-one-mgm-1235350537/

If Americans can’t get their shit together, they should just broadcast that one internationally. They’d probably get rid of the stupid melodrama"
When I See You Again,ON AMERICAN GLADIATORS!!11!
When I See You Again,Spike TV did something like this in a show called Joes vs Pros. It was fun to see the old athletes back on TV
When I See You Again,"Titan Games kind of did that.

It had regular people, and then one contestant in each group was a professional athlete (Joe Thomas, Claressa Shields, Victor Cruz, Jessie Graf).

I enjoyed the first season, but not enough to watch the second."
When I See You Again,"“Do do do HAVE IT, GUTS!”"
When I See You Again,WWE is actually in the process of pitching it with WWE wrestlers as the gladiators. I think it could be fun on streaming as a little show people watch through in their down time like all the reality competitions that are saturating those services. They might need a couple of twists and updates though. The original was pretty tame when it comes down to it.
When I See You Again,"> anyone asked for steroid testing

Who the hell is going to do that? There's no officiating body or rules. Steroids aren't illegal."
When I See You Again,Laser
When I See You Again,I always thought Thunder was super cool
When I See You Again,It was syndicated to local stations so it just depended on whenever your affiliate aired it - our FOX affiliate aired it late nights on Saturdays.
When I See You Again,"the fuck was his training schedule, deadlifting bloody wagons like Mr Incredible?"
When I See You Again,"That's why I can't stand *American Ninja Warrior* - that, and they would do one run every frickin 10 minutes, while the rest is ads and fill in the blank sob stories about how hard they've worked."
When I See You Again,"Exactly. The original was treated like a sporting event, and kept fairly ""pure"" -  they had play-by-play and color commentators, the arena was brightly lit like any other indoor sporting event, and stuff about the contestants' lives was at the most an occasional ""did you know"" type of drop-in.

The relaunch ditched every single one of those. They switched to overly dramatic concert-style lighting, they ditched the PxP/color commentators, and obsessed about the contestants' sob stories that brought them to this moment."
When I See You Again,Hogan Knows Best !
When I See You Again,"It happens to every game show now. Has to be 'reality TV' with the played up sob stories and re-running what you just saw 20 seconds ago.

The only reason they probably haven't done it to the ""old and gold"" shows like Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy! and Price is Right is because they'd probably have a revolt on their hands if they tried to do this to them."
When I See You Again,"Not OP but my guess would be $$$. The more you can stretch out of one person for free or cheap the ""better"", because TV producers are hooked on reality style productions. They are so low risk who cares if it fails."
When I See You Again,Omg Gina carano was Crush! That’s so funny I never connected the two
When I See You Again,It's about to get remade over here. Filming in Sheffield some time next year I believe.
When I See You Again,"Back in the States around the time the original was winding down, there was a competitor series trying to take off. One of the athletes suffered a nasty 180° ankle twist stumbling from a spinning platform, with some pretty gratuitous camera angles. That show never returned to air."
When I See You Again,Yea they should continue to allow steroids and hgh so the gladiators can heal faster…
When I See You Again,Yea I remember that stuff. So dumb. I just wanna see slim backyard athletes go against bigger pro-ish athletes. Is that so hard to ask for?
When I See You Again,I’ll tune in when someone starts a Running Man game
When I See You Again,I remember that. I rather have some that are fresh out the league and still wanting a paycheck
When I See You Again,"As long as they keep it out of the hands of network television, it might have a chance"
When I See You Again,"People who point out that it's a show for kids, and promoting a healthy lifestyle is important? Sponsors?"
When I See You Again,"Don't they require a prescription in the US, at least (not that it's necessarily a huge barrier)?"
When I See You Again,"Right. I personally wanna see super humans vs regulars. That’s like the whole point.  That’s what makes it special when you get a UPS driver who used to run track who’s actually a great athlete and steals the show.

So I say juice the gladiators up. But also have some speedsters/specialist gladiators for events that require agility"
When I See You Again,"He was 6'6"" and like 260lbs. Think a less defined to Dolph Lundgren."
When I See You Again,OG Ninja Warrior on G4 was far superior
When I See You Again,I enjoy watching it still. But it's about the same a watching a baseball game; I need a book or something else to do while the tv is muted during commercials and sob stories.
When I See You Again,"As a former competitor I just don't watch anymore. It's reality TV until the second you get on the course and that's a huge if now that they lowered the age to 18. Last year I competed was season 10 and they had over 500,000 people apply."
When I See You Again,"I miss Sasuke (the original Ninja Warrior).  The thing is the series still has annual competitions In Japan, but since G4 shut down, no one else seems to have picked it up."
When I See You Again,"They spent fifteen minutes telling me how this guy almost got on the first show before it cancelled, how much this meant to him, then knocked his ass out of the bracket in the next event I was dying at how bad it was. 

I know a lot of people who would've entertained trying to go on if there more than 8 slots a season had it not been cancelled."
When I See You Again,"I was absolutely in love with her from the show and of course then started watching her fights because I was already an MMA fan. I remember watching her get killed by Cyborg live, and we were just like “yeah, she’s going to Hollywood for good now.”"
When I See You Again,"People who are concerned seem to usually be at the bottom of the list, sponsors who want to sell liquid and solid sugar to kids don't give a fuck about roids. The NFL, MLB and Tour de France can barely keep it contained and those sponsors aren't going anywhere."
When I See You Again,"Yeah, but there are plenty of places to get them with and without."
When I See You Again,"100% 38 concussions, no one bats an eye. Steroids...""oh you're killing yourself!"""
Someone Like You,[deleted]
Someone Like You,"Carson, Conan, and Letterman post clips. It's harder to post full episodes due to issues like music rights. Not just musical performances but also some of the music the band will play. That's why sometimes you'll see random fadeouts in the clips they already upload.

Antenna TV plays full Carson episodes, but often replace music and musical acts."
Someone Like You,It seemed like whole episodes of Carson were on Pluto
Someone Like You,yeah i wish there was more shows from the past easily available. i think it's probably just very complex.
Someone Like You,I watched episodes of Dick Cavett a while back on Amazon Prime UK so it's probably a question of money. YouTube needs to pay for the rights.
Someone Like You,Have you considered piracy?
Someone Like You,"Are you ready to commit to watching an hour or an hour and a half of a talk program where there a two people you don't give a fuck about are guests and finally someone you do care about shows up 45 minutes into the program. If you have Zsa Zsa Gabor, Joey Hetherton and then Muhamed Ali shows up late in the program you might be less inclined to watch. So, chop it up into small segments and you get more views."
Someone Like You,Late night is weird because it’s this one ubiquitous part of pop culture history that you just can’t really ever educate yourself on if you weren’t there for it.  Like I can listen to every Bob Dylan recording and watch every episode of every Star Trek and pick up on all the references to both.  But I will never have more than a vague awareness when something references a famous Johnny Carson bit or moment.
Someone Like You,"Oh man, I uploaded a bunch of old public-domain old TV shows for a youtube educational channel and got a copyright violation for just one of them. It was because in one 5-minute scene, a couple was watching a scary show on TV, and there was eerie music playing in the background. That generic-sounding tune is what had the copyright claim on it."
Someone Like You,I assume those musical acts are removed so they can air more commericals.  Antenna TV is notorious for excessively long commercial blocks.
Someone Like You,"> Antenna TV plays full Carson episodes, but often replace music and musical acts.

I watch those sometimes. The musical acts by guests are usually totally edited out.  

I also own a few different Carson mega-sets on DVD. The music is usually intact there (leading to higher costs), but there are also cheaper releases with few discs (1 to 3) with the same music edits as the TV airings on Antenna."
Someone Like You,"YouTube copyright claim is so funny. I wanted to put up a fanedit of airplane 2 (basically I took out all of the jokes that were just repeats from Airplane and ended up with a funnier -I think anyway- 60 minute version) and got copyright striked for... 7 minutes in the middle, the only part they noticed was from airplane 2, not the rest of the movie including the paramount logo and title"
Someone Like You,What channel? Curious on checking out what you uploaded.
Someone Like You,"Funny isn’t the word I would use. More like, “complete bullshit.” They’ll turn a blind eye to obviously pirated content, but then cease and desist someone over five seconds of a song on the radio in the background."
Someone Like You,Some of that shit is ridiculous you can't show musical numbers if someone is doing watch of an old movie when the entire musical number has been posted by someone else 7 years ago.
Someone Like You,The high school where I work streams our basketball games on YouTube or Facebook sometimes but we have to remind the camera person to make sure there's no sound because the music playing during the warm-ups or halftime triggers the copyright thing and knocks down the stream
Someone Like You,Jack and Karen .. loved them more than Will and Grace sometimes
Someone Like You,**Dollhouse**. I don't think Eliza Dushku is a terrible actress but the supporting cast on the show are so fucking good that you much prefer watching them rather than the lead.
Someone Like You,New Girl
Someone Like You,"Boardwalk empire,Nucky thompson was a good character but Nelson van alden,Al Capone,Chalky White and Richard harrow were more interesting to me"
Someone Like You,Orange is the New Black
Someone Like You,Malcolm in the Middle
Someone Like You,"Niles on Frasier. 

Don’t get me wrong, Grammar did quite well with Frasier, but David Hyde Pierce absolutely blew it out of the park as Niles."
Someone Like You,seinfeld 100%
Someone Like You,Squid Game. IMO Sang-Woo and Sae-Byeok are far better written characters than Gi-Hun.
Someone Like You,Seinfeld
Someone Like You,Homeland.. Carrie is so freaking unlikeable.
Someone Like You,"Star Trek Discovery, for the first 2 seasons. Lorca outshined literally everyone, and Michael is arguably the worst lead in not only a trek show but any show, ever. 


Now the entire cast is just cringe central, but those first 2 seasons had some serious quality in there."
Someone Like You,HIMYM
Someone Like You,Schitt's Creek - I just crushed out on Stevie.
Someone Like You,Not a single mention of Entourage when Vincent Chase is easily the worst part of the show.
Someone Like You,"The Office.

HIMYM

Seinfeld

Parks & Rec"
Someone Like You,"The Man in the High Castle. The supporting character storylines are all fantastic, but the main trio are so insufferable and annoying I couldn’t get past the first season."
Someone Like You,"Superstore 

Someone reboot this show."
Someone Like You,"Avatar: the last Airbender. Aang was good and all, but the rest of the cast was so much more relatable and likeable. Sokka's issues with trying to live up to his father's legacy, Katara's PTSD over her mother's death, Toph's need to prove that she's self-sufficient despite her blindness, Zuko's redemption arc, and literally every second that Iroh is on screen are more engaging than Aang coming to terms with being the avatar."
Someone Like You,"The expanse - Holden is obnoxiously written and obnoxiously acted. It's a bummer because he's almost bad enough to be a caricature of ""the hero"" and it feels like they could have made it more commentary on the absurdity of people who see themselves in that light."
Someone Like You,"Gilmore Girls.

The majority of the characters are far more likeable than Lorelai and particularly Rory."
Someone Like You,Dark - Jonas and Martha have as much personality as a plank of wood.
Someone Like You,"Teen Wolf and True Blood come to mind. Scott and Sookie are quite boring leads that were outshine by most of the others in the cast, imo."
Someone Like You,The Rookie.
Someone Like You,The 100
Someone Like You,"Handmaid's Tale, they can torture June all day I dgaf."
Someone Like You,"Star Trek Discovery. Can't GD stand Burnham but can occasionally tolerate Stamets, Culper, Saru and whatever her name is that Tig Notaro plays. My biggest beef with that series is how uneven the plot weight gets distributed. Like let the rest of the crew save the galaxy occasionally, yeah?"
Someone Like You,"The 100; Clarke is brilliant but the supporting cast are just too good. Raven, Murphy, Lexa, Indra, Octavia, Monty, Jasper all amazing characters."
Someone Like You,Tokyo Vice. Sato is the best. Love Ken Watanabe as well. Jake and the girl are very annoying
Someone Like You,Juliana Crane was so bad that I had to stop watching *Man in the High Castle* even though I liked every other character.
Someone Like You,I can see the Carrie Bradshaw sex and the city comments coming from a country mile away.
Someone Like You,Stargate Atlantis
Someone Like You,"Nobody mentioned ""Orange is the new black"" yet? I can only assume nobody watched it but me, because Piper is, simply, terrible."
Someone Like You,The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina.
Someone Like You,"My brother despises Michael, Jim, Pam, Dwight, and ESPECIALLY Andy, but only approves of Creed, Oscar, and Angela"
Someone Like You,"Scrubs


Person of Interest - Reese is fine.... but Finch, Fusco, Carter, and the other cast members introduced later on are just so much better


New Girl"
Someone Like You,Jane the Virgin. Loved the show the supporting cast was really amazing.
Someone Like You,"Barry. It's not that Barry isn't an alright character, but NoHo and Fuches steal the show, especially NoHo."
Someone Like You,Ally McBeal. The show is best when focused more on John Cage and Richard Fish.
Someone Like You,Assuming we’d call Jack the main character of Lost then it’s Lost.
Someone Like You,Scrubs.
Someone Like You,Scrubs - mid/late series- JD is one of the most insufferable characters invented by American tv.
Someone Like You,"Star Trek Discovery. SNG is a good actor and her character is better written in later seasons but is in the shadow of Doug Jones' Saru and Jason Isaacs' Lorca, as well as the engineers."
Someone Like You,How I Met Your Mother
Someone Like You,Young Sheldon
Someone Like You,Drew Carey show
Someone Like You,"West Wing, assuming you agree that Josh is the main character. Josh is great but supporting cast is out of this world good imo."
Someone Like You,"Lost, always hated Jack"
Someone Like You,Fraiser because Niles
Someone Like You,"Fringe. Not sure if it was the writing or the acting, but I felt like Olivia was usually the least interesting of the bunch."
Someone Like You,Breaking Bad - It wasn't a transition from good to evil but from a covert narcissist to a grandiose narcissist.
Someone Like You,"The Man in the High Castle.

Alexa Davalos was fucking terrible as a protagonist, so easy to dislike and not interesting whatsoever."
Someone Like You,"Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Buffy ain't bad, but the gang is so much more fun."
Someone Like You,That’s how I felt about Peacemaker. I guess he wasn’t developing fast enough as a character for me I was way more interested in literally everyone else.
Someone Like You,"That 70's show. Sadly for Topher Grace...everyone on the show was just a more compelling and hilarious character. 

Though, the series kind of falls apart after his depature."
Someone Like You,Buffy - Buffy is great / but willow/Xander/Giles/spike are more interesting
Someone Like You,"Park and Rec, Leslie is not the reason I watch or rewatch the show.  She’s beyond normal office crazy.  When her and Ben get together later on I always wonder what he sees in her.  It’s a consequence of the writing of course, bc most PaR plots begin with Leslie screwing something up through overconfidence.

Just about every other character knocks it out of the park."
Someone Like You,"Grey's anatomy. 

Without jack I would not have watched 24. Without Meredith I would not have quit after 2 years 

Also on er I did not like Doug or Carol or that tortured love story

And the good wife."
Someone Like You,Grey's Anatomy is the first show I think of for this
Someone Like You,The Wire.
Someone Like You,"Barney is the only likable character on How I Met Your Mother (especially towards the end), even though he'd be the creepiest person in real life. He's also the one with the most character growth."
Someone Like You,Buffy
Someone Like You,SEAL Team
Someone Like You,"Hawkeye Pierce, MASH (post-Trapper); Mary Richards, Mary Tyler Moore Show; Andy Travis, WKRP in Cincinnati"
Someone Like You,Cheers-hated Sam and Diane

Someone Like You,Will & Grace.
Someone Like You,You
Someone Like You,In The Dark;  Murphy Mason kind of turned the lives of everyone she encountered to shit.
Someone Like You,Oz
Someone Like You,Lost - I think Jack and Kate were the leads but everyone else acted circles around them. They even had better flashbacks.
Someone Like You,"Lost.   

The supporting cast was great.  Jack… not as much."
Someone Like You,Boardwalk Empire.
Someone Like You,Criminal Minds- Hotch's was unbelievably wooden and the supporting cast around him was so much better and interesting to me
Someone Like You,"Everyone else in In Plain Sight. Mary was a b#### of epic proportions. It was hard to watch.  She did a short-term stint on ER and was exactly the same. So I don't think it was the character, I think she's just a horrible person."
Someone Like You,"the Expanse, holden is so boring compared to everyone else"
Someone Like You,"Tokyo Revengers is the most definitive answer to this.

Takemichi is like the worst most dislikable AND useless main character to have ever been created, his whole role is just to be camera for the viewer and everything happens around him. He is a TIME TRAVELER with the power of future knowledge yet he always knows the least in every possible scenario. Automichi can be removed and its a much better show."
Someone Like You,"Superhans, Jeff and Johnson in a road trip movie together would be amazing."
Someone Like You,New Girl. The boys stole the show over Zoey Deschanel.
Someone Like You,Will and Grace.  I think it should have been the Jack and Karen show
Someone Like You,News radio - Dave the station manager was s straight man where all his co workers were the funny ones.
Someone Like You,"Abbott Elementary, easily. Quinta Brunson is okay, but her co-stars are consistently funnier. Maybe it has something to do with the Janine character and how its written. 

I even like the earnest lead who wants to do good archetype, like Leslie Knope is one of my favourite characters ever, and easily my top 3 favourite characters on the Parks and Rec, and would be my absolute first if not for Aziz Ansari being so damn funny

The West Wing is another. I really want to like Rob Lowe as Sam and I do, but as the show progresses he gets less and less to work with, while Richard Schiff, Allison Janney, Bradley Whitford, Janel Moloney and Martin Sheen consistently knock it out of the park"
Murphys Law of Love,"I don’t necessarily agree that a movie/book whatever shouldn’t be made because it tells a painful story. But if the resultant media feels pointless or exploitative, people are going to complain about it.

Why are they pretending they had noble intentions for it? That makes it so much worse. Why not just acknowledge that the story felt very cinematic and you had the budget to tell it long-form? You can’t have it both ways."
Murphys Law of Love,Remember 10 years ago when every time he would ask an artist if he could use their music on Glee and they said no he would scream “fuck the Kings of Leon” at the nearest Hollywood journalist? Nice to see he hasn’t matured a bit and still can’t take rejection
Murphys Law of Love,"He also talks about wanting to pay for a memorial to honor the victims.

But it would end up being an attraction where people take artsy Instagram photos, specially for creeps who glorify serial killers."
Murphys Law of Love,Because I'm sure the families want to be reminded of what happened to their children over and over again.
Murphys Law of Love,"Their silence was the response, Ryan."
Murphys Law of Love,"Why should they? Why should they respond to the millionth attempt to exploit one of the worst things that has ever happened to them for profit? Why should they respond to someone creating a film about the brutal rape and murder of their child, their brother, their friend, from the *murderers point of view.* What can they say to the next overzealous director who has no sympathy for them and is just reaching out for public perception? But thank god we can now see the 30th conventionally attractive white man play someone has brutally assaulted, murdered, dismembered, and then bragged about killing someone you *knew,* someone that you *love.* And watch as people around the internet fawn over you child’s pain, say that they “weren’t even scared by it.” That some people are *fucking rooting* for this monster and your brother to have *ended up together.* And when you ask these directors and studios to stop, beg them to let you be, to stop tearing open this wound of grief, they come back with this bullshit of having spoken to families, that they “care.” Fuck this guy."
Murphys Law of Love,have there not been like 18 Dahmer movies already?
Murphys Law of Love,Ryan Murphy is the National Enquirer of scripted television
Murphys Law of Love,"soooo ... turns the families and friends who lost a loved one to a serial killer were maybe not thrlled about reliving the trauma for the benefit of a purient netflix series?

what a shock."
Murphys Law of Love,"""Heeeey, Ryan Murphy here, Glee, AHS. Yeah, so we've got a really exciting project with Netflix that exploits the pain and suffering of your loved ones for some real B grade entertainment. Maybe you'd be into helping us make it gruesomely detailed. Tell me, did your 14 brother have any hopes or dreams that were snuffed out with him, or was he just into being sex canniballed?"
Murphys Law of Love,Because they were horrified you wanted to turn their worst nightmare into entertainment
Murphys Law of Love,"Murphy:

>”It’s something that we researched for a very long time, and we, over the course of the three, three and a half years when we were really writing it, working on it, we reached out to 20, around 20 of the victims’ families and friends trying to get input, trying to talk to people and not a single person responded to us in that process. So we relied very, very heavily on our incredible group of researchers who… I don’t even know how they found a lot of this stuff. But it was just like a night and day effort to us trying to uncover the truth of these people.”

>”Something that we talked a lot in the making of it is we weren’t so much interested in Jeffrey Dahmer, the person, but what made him the monster that he became. We talked a lot about that… and we talked about it all the time. It’s really about white privilege. It’s about systemic racism. It’s about homophobia.”"
Murphys Law of Love,"""Hey, im a complete stranger, but do you remember how your kid was tortured, murdered, raped and eaten by a serial killer all those years ago? Lets talk about that. His corpse was used as a sex toy i believe ...hello? Hello!?""

He is trying to profit off the tragedy of people who lost their family members. They obviously dont want anything to do with that or to be reminded of it.   
Wtf did this guy expect, they dont owe him an explanation or response."
Murphys Law of Love,"The victims’ families weren’t required to do anything. Perhaps they didn’t trust Murphy’s intentions or they just didn’t want to be involved. That was their prerogative, and no one else’s. And while I have watched documentaries about Dahmer, I wasn’t into watching a whole dramatic series about him. That just hits different."
Murphys Law of Love,"Maybe...JUST maybe the friends and family of the victims had no interest in dredging up some incredibly painful memories just so someone can earn a buck off it, I don't know just a thought."
Murphys Law of Love,You're profiting off the murder of people they loved. They owe you nothing you piece of shit.
Murphys Law of Love,"well, no shit that no one responded...  imagine having to relive this over and over again because some people have nothing else to watch on TV."
Murphys Law of Love,Updated headline: murder victims’ families would rather try to heal and move on than be exploited by Hollywood exec
Murphys Law of Love,Why would they?
Murphys Law of Love,I wonder how many “didn’t respond” by telling him to fuck off.
Murphys Law of Love,"The same Ryan Murphy that made a speculative fiction “Anne Frank, secret survivor” who ends up in an asylum in American Horror Story? I find that hard to believe. He’s usually so tactful."
Murphys Law of Love,"What a psycho. Acting like he’s the first one trying to reach out to the victims families. These people were murdered 50 years ago. Lots of people have reached out to these families in the past 50 years. Does he not realize that all of theses families have been hounded by people like him ever since their loved one was brutally tortured and murdered, and that every time someone reaches out to them it’s a reminder of that trauma, the families being re-traumatized every time. That these victims were people, that had lives, and are now mostly remembered as being the victims of Jeffery Dahmer, and not the actual people and lives that they had before their murders. Come on. Everyone wants to use the families, no one wants to pay them. No one wants to tell their stories. They all want to worship And tell the story of the psychopath that killed them."
Murphys Law of Love,"He made a show about a thing that happened that everyone knows happened including the names of the victims. Do victims or their families get right of refusal or something by law? I actually know someone whose family member was murdered by the killer portrayed in The Good Nurse. Their complaint starts with the way the killer is portrayed, then they talk about trauma, then they talk about how they should get money from the film. Yeah, that last one is the key."
Murphys Law of Love,"TBC I haven't watched this show but, can someone explain to me: morally speaking, whats the difference between the Dahmer series and the show Mindhunter (wich i have seen and reddit loves). Or any of the other serial killer focused media that people eat up on a daily basis? Murder podcasts, true crime, TV series etc. All of a sudden People seem to think this series is going too far. Why?"
Murphys Law of Love,Yeah why would you want to rehash a horrific family tragedy with some tv show runner.
Murphys Law of Love,Yeah duh they want to stop being reminded of their trauma
Murphys Law of Love,"No shit, leave them the fuck alone"
Murphys Law of Love,This guy's a dick
Murphys Law of Love,Unpopular opinion: I thought this series told us a lot about the victims and was respectful and kind. They showed more of the victims' point of view than other Dahmer things I've seen or read.
Murphys Law of Love,Kinda funny seeing everyone be against this series in this thread when its been like the most streamed thing this year. So either some people are lying or the small pocket of people who didn’t watch it have made their way into this post.
Murphys Law of Love,"I am getting hugely sick of all the people commenting about what they THINK this show is about when they didn’t actually watch it. Whether or not you think it should have been made is one thing, but don’t pretend that you know the content if you didn’t watch it. It does not glorify Dahmer. It doesn’t make him sexy or attractive. It doesnt make the viewer sympathize with him. You sympathize with the victims, their family’s, Glenda and everyone that tried to stop him. It fills you with rage against the racism, homophobia and inept police that allowed him to continue his crimes. It highlights the injustice. It’s heart-breaking for a purpose."
Murphys Law of Love,"I mean the fact that they didn't respond should tell him all he needs to know. I'm sure many of the family members of the victims are still plenty pissed off because, like John Wayne Gacy, the police kinda didn't care about the people Dahmer was killing. Transients, often gay prostitutes, who they assumed just passed on through or were victims of their own lifestyles."
Murphys Law of Love,"Of course not, Dick. You were contacting them to see how they would feel about you making a movie of the most insanely devastating thing to ever happen to them. Contacting them to see if they wanted to partake in you paying homage to the fckn psycho that destroyed their lives for a buck…are you surprised they didn’t respond? FFS!

FOR YEARS THEY DIDN’T RESPOND. That should’ve been your first clue.
This story did not need to be retold. 

The morbid curiosity and glorification of fiends is something I’ll never understand."
Murphys Law of Love,Perhaps that was enough reason not to do that shit?
Murphys Law of Love,Gee I wonder why???
Murphys Law of Love,"Wait, the same Ryan Murphy who created GLEE a toxic workplace with many people hating him?"
Murphys Law of Love,Ryan Murphy just stays Ryan Murphying. Gross.
Murphys Law of Love,"""For some reason, these people didn't want to talk to us about the tv show we're making with a focus on the guy who murdered their loved ones. Weird.""

Also thank God someone finally pointed out that white privilege was behind Dahmer's murders. Here I was, the fool, thinking he was a crazy person. Now I can rest soundly knowing he was just a white male oppressor."
Murphys Law of Love,Ryan are you saying silence equals consent?
Murphys Law of Love,"I still have no idea why this movie is causing such a fuss.

This isn’t the first bio-project about a serial killer. It’s not even the first project focused on Dahmer.

He was properly shown as a fucking monster rather than some kind of romantic portrayal that tried to humanize him.

It also properly showed that no one at the time gave a flying fuck about dark skinned gay men, and it was a total failure of the police that let him operate for so long."
Murphys Law of Love,"Because they have the right to not respond to this kind of traumatic fucked up thing that is being glorified onscreen, Ryan. Have you ever thought about that?"
Murphys Law of Love,"Hot take: I don’t think people really care that much about this show, I think a lot of this is fake outrage for people to virtue signal about. Some people started rallying against this show now everyone dogpiles on it because it’s a safe and acceptable opinion to act upset about it and show how morally superior you all are.

I call bullshit. Can anyone tell me how this show is substantially different than any of the other hundreds of true crime related content out there? Oh is this show glitzy and sexy and doesn’t wag it’s finger at the criminal enough for your liking? Nobody cares, people consume this stuff not to learn “oh my gosh these people were some real bad apples!” They consume it because it’s interesting and exciting and taboo and weird. 

But yeah whatever keep the circlejerk alive yah hypocrites."
Murphys Law of Love,"I don't necessarily think you need the opinions of the victims to tell stories like these. I definitely think you need to be careful and respectful to the victims and the truth of what happens, but I think it's okay to tell that story 30 years later in a drama form. It was very hard to watch in some scenes, but I think that's the point they were trying to get across because this shouldn't be something easy to swallow.

I understand that there's some fictional pieces to this story that made it easier to digest, but I don't think it's any worse than something like Chernobyl which also saw a lot of innocent lives taken. Some of those victims and their families are alive today."
Murphys Law of Love,So Weird that the victim’s families don’t want to revisit that horrific trauma? just so your entertainment can be more accurate.
Murphys Law of Love,"They don’t have to respond, a person can still make their series, they could still not like it."
Murphys Law of Love,"Their kids were cannibalized, of course they didn’t want to talk to you."
Murphys Law of Love,"People who went through an EXTREMELY traumatic experience dont respond to, well known dickhead, about said  traumtic experience. Dickhead is only one shocked."
Murphys Law of Love,"As someone who watched it and thought it was well done, it really did feel unnecessary and maybe even dangerous. If 20 of the victims families want nothing to do with the project maybe that’s a sign that you shouldn’t do the project lol"
Murphys Law of Love,What a fucking ghoul.
Murphys Law of Love,I always hate to see shows like this become number 1 on trending in netflix
Murphys Law of Love,Why the hell would they or should they?
Murphys Law of Love,Imagine that
Murphys Law of Love,So i said fuck em anyway!
Murphys Law of Love,Fucking moron
Murphys Law of Love,"Well no shit buddy, they’re tired."
Murphys Law of Love,I think...think *was* the response
Murphys Law of Love,"Judging from the viewership and the Nielsen ratings this series is getting it shows people all over the world wanted to know more about Dahmer and his crimes. A ton of you here are acting like ignorant asses and that the only ones watching are young female Americans. Sorry to the families of these victims but if they answered verbally or in writing at the producers requests for accurate feedback then they could see a more reliable story of truth about the victims. If those family members didn't make a spectacle of themselves for the public to see at the hearings, then they wouldn't see themselves 40 years later acting like nutcases. That's what sticks in their craw. It's not about their loved one that was killed. It's the families not liking their own behavior reflected for the whole world to see. Ryan had nothing to do with that scene; he just re-enacted it almost verbatim. They're not ""retraumatized"" about the family member who died. They're straight out embarrassed to see how they were played in the show. Most of you siding with the families are obsessed with coddling them and exaggerating their responses to make you feel like you're doing something for them. They don't even know you. Why do they care how you react to this show?! You think they spend any time on Reddit or Twitter reading all this obsessive virtue signaling on their behalf! Your attention on them is just as invasive and insulting as those who like Dahmer. Leave them alone and keep them out of your mouths!"
Murphys Law of Love,Probably a good reason as to why
Murphys Law of Love,Oh you mean they don’t want to dredge up crazy traumatic experiences ever few years when somebody wants to do a show?
Murphys Law of Love,"I enjoyed Dahmer, the show….I thought it was an interesting story (and I assumed it was dramatized) and one that should be told.

We talk about how mental health should be brought to the forefront and then we’re afraid to talk about some of the most uncomfortable stories about mental health.

If you thought the show glorified Dahmer, we’ll have to agree to disagree on that (though I’m happy to discuss)….in my opinion, the show DID humanize him and I think that’s what makes people uncomfortable.

I don’t think Jeffrey was a “good guy”, obviously, but I think he was damaged and swept under the rug because people didn’t know what to do with him.

I don’t know Ryan Murphy and I can’t speak about his antics, cause this is the first I’m hearing (unless he’s the guy that’s feuding or feuded with H3H3, then I know a little bit), but stories are not necessarily “owned” by anyone.

I doubt he donated any of the money he made to the families, but that would have been the correct move, in my opinion.

Just one man’s thoughts, and I wouldn’t necessarily argue that I’m correct, just how I interpret the situation"
Murphys Law of Love,"Take a hint? 

Dahmer was such a bullshit, offensive show. Ends with the message that we shouldn't glamourise serial killers, having just spent 10 hours glamourising and trying to make us empathise with a serial killer."
Murphys Law of Love,"How about leaving them the fuck alone and moving on creatively. Seriously, how many times can Dahmers “story” be told? It’s old hat."
Murphys Law of Love,"An informative documentary would be one thing, but these shows are just murder-mystery cash grabs. It’s not meant to be educational, because that would be boring and wouldn’t bring in the audience numbers they want out of it."
Murphys Law of Love,"So the  family members who lost a loved one and were traumatized by a serial murderer that was enabled by the ineptitude of local Milwaukee police, didn’t want to speak with an exploitative film troll that wanted to use their grief as a profit center?   


Weird"
Murphys Law of Love,Maybe he should have taken the cue right there
Murphys Law of Love,"It’s ironic: so many people are hopping on the bandwagon of bashing the true crime genre as being exploitative.  But this Dahmer series is actually the worst example they could use.  

It’s well researched, humanizes the victims, and focuses on the social injustices that allowed Dahmer to thrive."
Murphys Law of Love,"I liked the series, I don’t think it’s “glorifying” Dahmer, it’s most of all a tale of undiagnosed mental illness, a dysfunctional family, systemic racism and many other issues in police, penitentiary system, and society overall, and the tale of the difficulties the gay community had to endure even without Dahmer trying to kill them. The strength and inner/outer beauty of people like Tony Hughes, made an example between many, need to be remembered, he alongside the others can’t be only described as “murder victim”, guy was a wonderful person and the world lost a valuable human being with him. I wouldn’t have known his story otherwise, probably.

That said, many people are angry that the victim relatives weren’t involved, and the point made here is that he asked them for involvement, but obviously they wouldn’t want to live it all again so they refused.

That story and the people that we lost shouldn’t be forgotten, the only thing that saddens me is the idea of the relatives accidentally crossing dahmer’s face on posters.

To end this consideration, a memorial site should be built, I agree with that POV."
Murphys Law of Love,"So you took that as a ""go ahead""?"
Murphys Law of Love,It's almost as if that's a sign he shouldn't have made the show?
Murphys Law of Love,"Huh, so the victims families *didn't* want to participate in a cash grab documentary about the absolute monster who destroyed their lives and killed their loved ones?

Shocking..."
Murphys Law of Love,Why the fuck would they?!
Murphys Law of Love,“Hey we want to make ANOTHER movie/doc/series about the guy that killed and ate your son. Would love to chat” Damn wonder why no one responded
Murphys Law of Love,"Let’s never make another tv show or
movie about something that happened in real life cause someone might get offended"
Murphys Law of Love,"Why tf would they? Make a tv show about a horrible killer and make lots of money from it, fine, but don’t expect the victim’s families to want anything to do with you."
Murphys Law of Love,Maybe that was a VERY SUBTLE SIGN that they didn't want a show to be made...
Murphys Law of Love,Hi I'm Joe Holywood and I want to profit on your pain.  Again.  What?  Not interested?  Jeez...
Murphys Law of Love,Talk about not taking a hint.
Murphys Law of Love,Wait until they do a school shooting series.
Murphys Law of Love,"“We never heard back from any of them”
RM: “welp, guess we’re good then!”"
Murphys Law of Love,Bruh.
Murphys Law of Love,The ''True Crime'' boom that televisual content creators are going through is a blight on society.
Murphys Law of Love,So you took it as a yes scumbag?
Murphys Law of Love,"take the hint then, assshole"
Murphys Law of Love,Probably should have taken the hint when none of them returned his calls.
Murphys Law of Love,Yea no shit
Murphys Law of Love,Huh… I wonder why… it’s almost like families don’t want to relive the most traumatizing experiences of their lives…
Murphys Law of Love,"so that means okay, go ahead? yeah, that makes sense.."
Murphys Law of Love,Because it's tasteless and horrible.
Murphys Law of Love,What a dolt
Murphys Law of Love,What a scumbag. I feel bad for the families.
Murphys Law of Love,"Gee, I wonder why."
Murphys Law of Love,"""Hey, do you mind being in my show that I'm producing to make a shitload of money off of your family's misery? No? How dare you!"" - Ryan Murphy, probably"
Murphys Law of Love,Not surprised *at all.*  It might’ve been different if it were a documentary instead of a hollywood series which glorifies the killer of their family/friends.
Murphys Law of Love,"It didn't need to be made. I know I'll get downvoted for this, but as a Black person born and raised in Milwaukee with a gay family member and friends on the “LGBTQ+ spectrum,” its exhausting. This city continues with cultivate injustices for us and this completely reopened wounds for us here (and I'm sure elsewhere!)."
Murphys Law of Love,"It’s almost like the victims/family of the victims don’t want their nightmarish tragedy’s turned into Friday-night popcorn sellers.

Who fucking knew?"
Murphys Law of Love,What did he expect from people whose grief and trauma he intended to monetize? What an insensitive asshole.
Murphys Law of Love,"Yeah, let's talk to some guy exploiting our dead loved ones for profit."
Murphys Law of Love,"No shit, because they dont want to relive this for sick entertainment purposes."
Murphys Law of Love,"Yes, reach out to the families of the victims for input 🙄. A Friend of The Family had input from the victims themselves, who got to heal from the horror of that story. Dahmer’s victims’ families have been through enough, leave them alone and let them have peace."
Murphys Law of Love,"""We didn't want these victims to be erased by history"".

Jesus Christ as if anyone would forget? Reminds me of the time [Daniel Farrands](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/haunting-sharon-tate-director-defends-controversial-movie-1200238/amp/) tried defending [The Haunting of Sharon Tate](https://youtu.be/I-L0dk6zuyE) after he got met with criticism from Sharon's sister, responding with ""I wanted to honor the victims"". No dude, you wanted to make a cartoon out of a real life tragedy. People like him and Ryan Murphy make it about themselves."
Fall in Love with Me,"Drive to Survive got me into watching F1.


Watching F1 got me out of watching Drive to Survive."
Fall in Love with Me,"For any new fans, go back and watch some older races, it’s so worth it. 

Start with the 2021 Belgian Grand Prix…hours of pure excitement!"
Fall in Love with Me,For me it was turning right.
Fall in Love with Me,"I know their are issues with the editing and the relationship Netflix has with the drivers has gotten tense over the 'drama' that the show presents. That being said, I know so many more people watching F1 cause of DTS, myself included. I know next to nothing about the tech aspects of racing but I'm so into knowing the drivers and seeing the season play out and wonder what happens behind the scenes. I'm now looking forward to the whole season and so many others are too. America is really getting into this sport."
Fall in Love with Me,"More like it made me root for Daniel Ricardo, then be continually disappointed in his performance in the following seasons."
Fall in Love with Me,"My mother, of all people, now follows F1 because of that show. She records the entire race and watches the whole thing when it’s convenient for her, she knows the drivers and their teams. My mom takes jabs at me, my brothers, and my dad every football season, because it’s often app we ever talk about. Yet, in her now late 60s has become big into F1 and talks about it a lot. Guess the show worked!"
Fall in Love with Me,"I loved F1 (and WRC) as a kid and can't even remember where I watched it (ESPN?). I don't know why I fell off, but still followed from a distance as an adult, noting WDC when I'd stumble upon it. 

Issues aside, Drive to Survive is so beautifully shot and such a dramatic stage for the incredible artwork that is these cars that it's just a visual treat. It was a nice primer to the current crop of drivers (of which I had only really recognized the ""old guard"" to any degree) and I wouldn't be heading to COTA in October if it wasn't for the show. 

I've been watching it with my two young sons who have since claimed their favorite drivers and it's been fun to see them absorb the rules and strategies and make comments on interval times and purple sectors.

Boy was my 8 year-old tired of Merc dominance last year. Big Max fan, that one."
Fall in Love with Me,"It’s unfortunately also why Spa is about to be off the calendar. I would happily trade both Miami and Vegas to keep Spa on the calendar, these new races in the US aren’t worth it if its own people can’t afford to attend it."
Fall in Love with Me,"worked on me... been waking up at 6AM just to watch qualifiers and races now on a fucking Sunday

i still don't know who to root for, but I might just go with the only ""american"" team in Haas

god it sucks being on the west coast timezone lol"
Fall in Love with Me,"well Americans love hi-octane fiction, which is pretty much what this thing is"
Fall in Love with Me,"The only problem is, they don’t show a lot of the behind the scenes of the political side of F1. Last season was also a joke. It was easily one of the craziest and best rivalry fights in the sport’s history, and they completely glossed over it all."
Fall in Love with Me,Its pretty great but not perfect. I love all the behind the scenes footage that i would have missed otherwise.
Fall in Love with Me,My sister woke up early with me last sunday to watch the Austria GP because of this show.  It's garbage but that was cool.
Fall in Love with Me,"For me, it was the other way around. I found an F1 race on one day last fall, and found what I saw really interesting. I love the one-second drag reduction system (DRS) rule, the responsiveness of the cars and really, the whole production of the broadcasts.

That's when I found DTS on Netflix. That made it even more interesting, hyped-up fake drama besides."
Fall in Love with Me,DTS absolutely got me into F1 and I’m so happy about it. I have never been much of a sports person and have never before experienced that excited high you get from watching a team or player do well or watching a particularly exciting game. Now I totally get it. I guess I just had to find my sport to get excited about.  I look forward to race weekend every time there’s one on the calendar and got the F1 app so I could watch all the content. I get so amped up for race weekends and consume tons of F1 content during the week. I also now can appreciate how ridiculous DTS is now that I’ve become really invested in F1. Still entertaining but everything is so exaggerated and manufactured. I’m still really happy I found it though and really happy there are a lot more fans out there because of it.
Fall in Love with Me,"As a 3 decade F1 fan. I welcome all new Drive to Survive fans.

Yes, we now a lot of it is fake but if it brings up interest in the sport, I don't care.

Bad publicity is better than no publicity. See ya at another >400K COTA weekend!"
Fall in Love with Me,"It got me in the door, but for anybody who’s knowledge of F1 is derived directly from the show: Look in to it more. A lot more. Once you know the reality of F1, how it works, and the relations between drivers you realize that show is bordering on scripted. They use audio from different races to make a race seem more interesting, they flat out lied about who won a race, they splice in clips from different races and pretend it’s the same one. At the very core DTS is good to get a foot in the door, but it’s a whole bunch of malarkey beyond the very surface level of “this is how points work, this is what a penalty is” and so on."
Fall in Love with Me,I wanted to get into it but it was too much drama and not enough actual behind the scenes that I didn’t feel it was worth my time. Wish there was a show that was like it without the baked in drama.
Fall in Love with Me,Drive to survive created the worst fans ever.
Fall in Love with Me,Never even heard of DTS until like my second year of watching F1… too dramatized for me but I can appreciate the attention to the sport from the US.
Fall in Love with Me,"Love is too strong a word. Newest infatuation. 

Americans drift from sport to sport with storylines. We have SOOOOOO many to follow and so many networks to follow them on. 

Will we care about F1 after another world cup, if there is a great golf/tennis/cycling record setter, if there is an olympics competing, if there is suddenly NASCAR drama, if there is suddenly X-Games drama? 

Sports go through bubbles in the US. The dumbest thing is marketers thinking it is never going away."
Fall in Love with Me,they did a great job!
Fall in Love with Me,Thought this was r/mildlyvagina at first glance
Fall in Love with Me,Only in it for the crashes.  Just like nascar.
Fall in Love with Me,Had no idea about Drive To Survive and turned up at USGP Fri AM to go to my usual parking spot only to realize all parking was completely sold out for the weekend.  Thanks Netflix!
Fall in Love with Me,Wouldn't be America without a TV/media series convincing people to like or dislike something.
Fall in Love with Me,"[Bring it on, Earnhardt!](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6ZsUrDcDeHvLILo4/giphy.gif)"
Fall in Love with Me,Ngl hell yeah it did
Fall in Love with Me,Worked for me.
Fall in Love with Me,"The US likes personalities and the show was designed for that specific reason, to showcase personalities. I have been watching it over the past month since I got Covid and have woken up early to watch the past 2 races. 

I like pretty much all the racers but rooting for LeClerc because in the show he talked about racing for his friend, Jules Bianchi and I was like, I’m rooting for the guy who has passion and purpose. (I know they all do, but I connected with that drive)

Even ordered a knockoff LeClerc hat on Etsy."
Fall in Love with Me,Like 10 years ago I was bored at home and the Monaco Grand Prix was on. I was like fuck it I’ll watch it. I haven’t stopped watching it since.
Fall in Love with Me,Interesting. I have followed F1 for a long time but I didn't like the series tbh.
Fall in Love with Me,Has anyone watched MotoGP: Unlimited? How is it and how does it compare to DtS in terms of getting to know teams/riders?
Fall in Love with Me,"I have been watching f1 for years, I started watching with my dad when O was a kid, and this show I found was just fun to watch, even if Knew what happened, because the show just put it in a neat little bow"
Fall in Love with Me,YUP!
Fall in Love with Me,"I've been a motorsport fan since I was a kid, and it has been absolutely WILD to watch the recent rise of F1's popularity here in America, considering we only just got an American race back on the calendar just 10 years ago. We didn't even have a Grand Prix from 2008-2011. Now there are set to be THREE in the US next year. DTS, plus a really well-managed social media effort, have enabled this to happen. 

However... I am concerned about something I see with the current Formula 1 landscape that comes with all this newfound popularity. Formula 1 is chasing the mainstream spotlight really hard right now. And that's fine, but Liberty Media (America-based owner of F1) should be sure to learn some lessons from when NASCAR did the same thing in the early 2000's. NASCAR spent inconceivable amounts of money to build tracks in new markets that, until that time period, didn't have particularly large NASCAR fanbases. In the process, they ended up abandoning many classic tracks in the south (Rockingham, NC is the one that comes to mind first). However, these new fanbases were not sustainable in the long run; people in these markets lost interest over time. Furthermore, NASCAR tried to build off their growth by attempting to appeal more to stick-and-ball sport fans by instituting a ""playoff"" system and dividing races into ""stages"" - yuck. Spoiler alert: Doing this didn't really yield any measurable fan conversion from football/basketball/baseball/hockey etc. What it did do, however, was alienate NASCAR's core fanbase, the fans in the south who had been lifelong, dedicated fans of the sport. NASCAR sacrificed a significant portion of their most dedicated, stable market of fans so that they could chase new fans who didn't end up sticking around. Now NASCAR is really hurting. Look at the stands at any race this season and it's apparent that NASCAR has lost a lot of that popularity they gained just 10-20 years prior. 

I am happy that Formula 1 is becoming popular in the US; I have a lot of friends now with a common sporting interest that didn't exist before! It's awesome! But F1 must remember that their core fanbase is over in Europe, at tracks like Spa, Silverstone, and Monza. There has been a lot of talk recently in the F1 world about removing some of these classic venues in order to race in hot new markets, like Miami or Vegas, to capitalize on F1's current popularity. I see this as a repeat of NASCAR's mistakes and I hope it doesn't happen."
Fall in Love with Me,"Played the game in 2018, and was hooked.  Watched very little of the 2018 season.  Watched DTS and played the game in 2019, and became a good amount more hooked, and followed a bit more.  2020 was when I started watching almost all full races, and 2021 was when I religiously watched all the qualifyings and races.  This year is still fun to watch, but really pales in comparison to not only last year’s season (so far), but to the expectation that we were going to see a more even playing field at the top.  

Anyway, DTS is still a fun compliment to the actual racing, but it has been getting staler after having been introduced to F1.  Still looking forward to watching next season."
Fall in Love with Me,I grew up a fan of F1 and remember watching and reading about Niki Lauda and the others of the time on Wild World of Sports/Sports Illustrated. Remember the story of Ron Howard's Rush playing in real life.
Fall in Love with Me,This series got me into F1. Then I watched the actual shitshow last season where the track judges decided who won the driver’s championship. I quit watching F1 and DTS both.
Fall in Love with Me,"I'm into cars, primarily primarily muscle cars (more on the classic side) but never bothered to look at F1, my co-worker told me about DTS so I decided to watch it after season 2 had just started. Watching Season 1 it initially made me not like Verstappen, but now he's kind of my guy along with Bottas. 

Now I generally try to keep up with the races as the come."
Fall in Love with Me,"I’ve watched a half-dozen F1 races and wasn’t that impressed. Every twenty minutes or do something somewhat interesting happened. About once a race I saw something entertaining. It’s not that what’s going on isn’t impressive in terms of skill and technology. It’s just not very entertaining, even by auto racing standards. It just wasn’t a good use of my time. I was far better off just watching a highlight reel instead. 

This feels like one of those NYT articles that vastly overstates a new “trend”. I’ve never watched DTS and no one I know IRL has ever mentioned. I’m not saying it isn’t popular, just that the headline is clickbait-y and dumb."
Fall in Love with Me,"F1 is a great sport to watch, and other sports should take note.

-	A great streaming product at a reasonable price that allows fans to tune in with ease, live or on-demand.
-	No commercials
-	90 minutes tops
-	for the most part, great production value
-	strong graphics package that helps understand the action
-	Charming commentators who do their job well, with alternates available.
-	This one is North-America specific, but most races in the AM hours so I can watch with my morning coffee and still have a full Sunday after.
-	Generally charismatic drivers up and down the grid
-	and recently, a close championship fight"
Fall in Love with Me,"Só, Americans need drama in all of its entertainment?"
Fall in Love with Me,"Yeah, after watching every race and all the drama of 2021, Season 4 of DTS was such a letdown comparatively.  Still a good intro to the sport though."
Fall in Love with Me,[deleted]
Fall in Love with Me,/r/formuladank is more accurate than DTS.
Fall in Love with Me,"Watching DtS is just weird to me. I already know how the season ended, I dont really need that ""extra"" drama."
Fall in Love with Me,"Same!

I got into DtS during last race season, and watched both concurrently. I made it one episode into S4 and dropped it. Hearing how Max and others were refusing to do interview because of the made up drama, combined with knowing the race results, I just couldn't bother.

But man, I'm *into* F1! Even went to the Canada GP this year."
Fall in Love with Me,I’ve been trying to find the words to describe what you just did. Spot on.
Fall in Love with Me,"Yep this season was completely terrible which is such a shame because season 1 and 2 were pretty good and even 3 was ok, but the direction in this one was awful. I don't understand how they somehow took one of the most exciting seasons in F1 and turned it into a 10 episode snooze fest."
Fall in Love with Me,"I wouldn't be surprised if more drivers start dropping out of the show like Max did.  
I get that it's reality TV and they want to stir some things up but the way they've been making it look like all drivers hate each other is kind of ridiculous."
Fall in Love with Me,Ditto
Fall in Love with Me,"I still watched the latest season (and I’d watch upcoming seasons), but it’s not as entertaining as watching pre/post race, quali, and the race."
Fall in Love with Me,Bruh
Fall in Love with Me,"With all that water, it’s no surprise they call it Spa!"
Fall in Love with Me,Canada 2011 if you have some time to spare.
Fall in Love with Me,it was really nice to watch the boys have a nice relaxing weekend just swimming around.
Fall in Love with Me,In seriousness though I ended up getting f1tv and started watching in 1998. It gets just silly sometimes how many DNFs happen.
Fall in Love with Me,*Suzuka 2005.  Kimi and Alonso at their finest to the sound of V10s.
Fall in Love with Me,You horrible bastard.

Fall in Love with Me,"As a long time F1 fan, I don't like drive to survive.  But it's a good gateway drug.  

Welcome to the wonderful world of f1!  If you want to learn more about the technology look at some of the neat historic cars.  Like the P34. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CofRmGdaShY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CofRmGdaShY)"
Fall in Love with Me,"Imagine if they embraced the sport more. I would love to see episodes about the pit crews for example, or even a single onboard shot that lasted longer than 2s."
Fall in Love with Me,"It is growing in North America but the growth seems to have peaked. During the Covid lockdowns of 2020>2021, there was a 131% increase in viewing figures on average. This year, 2021>2022 that’s dropped to a 49% increase on average. Still better than nothing though and hopefully the growth still keeps coming, albeit slowly if necessary."
Fall in Love with Me,"Agree.  And I doubt Guenther Steiner wouldn’t have gotten as much attention as he’s had, if not for DTS."
Fall in Love with Me,If you grew up in the States during the Schumacher era then you likely watched F1 and rally on Speedvision
Fall in Love with Me,"Look, fake water isn't cheap."
Fall in Love with Me,"Ik this may seem weird, but I just don’t route for anyone, I do have people I don’t want to win though"
Fall in Love with Me,Make sure it includes family said in a low gravely voice too though.
Fall in Love with Me,I was under the impression this was due to Verstappen not really wanting anything to do with the show. Tough to do Red Bull/Mercedes drama without his participation.
Fall in Love with Me,One of the things I like about the show is that it doesn't just concentrate on the top teams.
Fall in Love with Me,"Yeah, it doesn't cover enough racing but it does enable a more ""personal"" relationship with the drivers, kinda like a relaity TV show but better as there are actual stakes."
Fall in Love with Me,"Remember that 99% of the behind the scenes footage was from a different day and time than when DtS presents is as being from. If you think you saw a bts reaction to something, you most likely saw the reaction to something completely different."
Fall in Love with Me,"First two seasons were fine, but by the 4th it wasn't even good as reality TV because so many drivers and teams dropped out."
Fall in Love with Me,"Their marketing campaign has been on point, I randomly saw the highlights of a race on youtube a few years ago (2019?) and then started following. I guess it has to do with Liberty Media taking the reins?"
Fall in Love with Me,">they flat out lied about who won a race

I missed this... what race did they lie about?"
Fall in Love with Me,"Within itself, F1 has plenty of drama without DTS."
Fall in Love with Me,"Get F1TV - tech talk, radio rewind, weekend warmup… the list goes on. So much to see plus I love the fact that you can switch between drivers views during the races. We re-watched Zhou’s crash from literally every other car."
Fall in Love with Me, I think Drive to Survive may have revealed some gatekeepers in the F1 community.
Fall in Love with Me,"But it created fans. That’s all that matters, the more the merrier I see."
Fall in Love with Me,[removed]
Fall in Love with Me,"I think the word you’re looking for is “Seasonal”.

Americans love sports, and they love story lines. I don’t care about football half the year, doesn’t mean I’m no longer a football fan. Same when Kobe left, my interest in watching the Lakers everyday weaned, I’m still a huge Laker fan.

I see myself enjoying F1 as long there’s always development of regulations and teams putting out quality product.

What DTS game Americans is enough insight into the sport to get us hooked, and tv contracts. It’s hard to love a sport you don’t have access to with consistency."
Fall in Love with Me,"What a stupid comment, it’s about exposure and packaging the world of f1 up to quickly understand and get up to speed on why it’s awesome. Go hate American somewhere else."
Fall in Love with Me,"Yeah dude there’s been a ton of talk around Spa and Monaco potentially getting nerfed. People can hate Monaco all they want but that track produces the best qualifying sessions in the sport. And Spa, with the exception of last year, is a fantastic venue. It’s probably the second most iconic track on the calendar, next to Monaco.

I’m worried that things will cool off in a few years. Like you said, F1’s core base is in Europe. Sure people here are loving it right now but who’s to say F1 will garner the same interest in 5-10 years. Having races here should help fuel that fire so long as the racing is good, but we shouldn’t be holding races here at the expense of the classics in Europe. Furthermore, I think choosing to race in Vegas just because it’s Vegas is probably a bad idea. The racing acing should always come first. 

I don’t know if you’ve seen the track layout for Vegas yet but it doesn’t look all that special, but looks can be deceiving so I am optimistic about it. Miami didn’t look great either but it was decent enough and had a couple of really tough sections and was overall entertaining. The new track looks a bit toned down though, and has very long straights. It’s a bit lackluster for Las Vegas, where NOTHING is lacks luster. 

F1 has a history of building circuits that are no longer in use. There’s been a handful just in that past decade. One was built in 2020 that they never even raced. I know there were circumstances unforeseen in most cases if not all, but my point is there’s history of it. 

I think what they’re trying to do is smart by building a partial track and utilizing the existing streets. Purpose built track are damn expensive. I guess my point is that with NASCAR doing what they did, and the things F1 have done in their past, it would be a shame to alienate their European fans while leaving a wake of barely used facilities here in the states. I hope they don’t do too much too soon. Two races would be good for another couple years to see if the hype lasts. Plus there are other country’s who are more deserving to have a race than us, Africa comes to mind. Plus they could stand to race a little less in the Middle East. Anyway, yeah, it’d be a shame if Spa or Monaco get axed. Sorry man, thinking out loud I suppose lol"
Fall in Love with Me,"My favorite is during the grand prix, they will play radio of their engineer telling them ""mode push"" which is something that only ever happens in qualifying..."
Fall in Love with Me,They straight up spliced together audio to make drivers say something they never said in the latest season.
Fall in Love with Me,"Funny enough Max has apparently opted back in for some capacity, just on “his terms”"
Fall in Love with Me,"Such a crazy race, luckily I was on vacation and just napped for 2-3 hours. When I woke up, I was annoyed I missed Spa…but it was still the Brundle and Crofty rain extravaganza."
Fall in Love with Me,As a Seb fan…no thanks.
Fall in Love with Me,"F1 TV if you’re subscribed to it, they have an archive that has full races back to the 1980’s"
Fall in Love with Me,"I grew up watching F1 and I can totally see the opposite. Passing is rare, especially on some tracks like Monaco, and especially before DRS. Worse, the races are much more pre-determined. Depending on the era, only 2-6 drivers have a realistic shot to win a given race. 

So I can see why NASCAR has more appeal if you're looking for more constant action, more variance.

I've been getting into Indy more lately though because I think it's a nice blend of both and has just better vibes in general."
Fall in Love with Me,Tbf for Ricciardo it would be fun because he'd win in it a lot
Fall in Love with Me,Hot take: Indycar has better racing
Fall in Love with Me,"DTS is the reason that I can go to a couple of bars in my area and they'll have the afternoon (EST) races on with a bunch of people watching. This is a huge departure from being able to talk to my dad and this one random Brazilian bartender (Senna was his fav driver of course).

It was a lonely sport to follow for so many years. DTS can manufacture all the drama they want if it means I can share my passion with other people."
Fall in Love with Me,"If your numbers are from here, there’s an error in your interpretation: https://espnpressroom.com/us/press-releases/2022/05/formula-1-miami-grand-prix-on-abc-attracts-record-2-6-million-viewers-largest-live-f1-u-s-tv-audience-ever/amp/

The 131% value is the total change over the last two years combined, not just 2020 to 2021, which would’ve been a 56% increase (from 609k to 949k). 

So the rate of growth is still slightly slowing down in percentage terms, but in raw numbers because the rates compound that’s an increase in viewership of 450,000 this year versus 340,000 last year over the previous year."
Fall in Love with Me,"Obviously it's a drop and I don't have any stats to prop up what I'm about to say but considering how small F1 viewership was in America that you're never going to see that type of huge spike in viewership from year to year like you did during Covid. That being said, I think just seeing how there will be 3 races in America starting next year coupled with more content coming from American media around F1 (Disney+ Docuseries, Apple TV movie with Brad Pitt, podcasts, etc.)then I think there will be a very big market here for F1 for at least 5 years"
Fall in Love with Me,"Covid growth in a lot of industries was unsustainable. When you're looking at those percentages though consider that the second one is off of the base number of the first one. So the viewership doubled, maintained that level and grew by nearly another 50%"

Winter Sun,"Not surprised. I gave it a chance, but it was just not compelling at all."
Winter Sun,That's what you get for making people wait an hour to watch Talking Bad.
Winter Sun,I wanted to like this show but it was just so boring. 
Winter Sun,The AV Club breathes a heavy sigh of relief and orgasms silently 
Winter Sun,"Also known as ""the cue to change channels after Breaking Bad"""
Winter Sun,"There were just too many plots going on at once. There wasn't any character development. It to me would be like if Breaking Bad started in season 4. Just a cluster fuck all at once. As a Michigan native, I'm happy to see it go."
Winter Sun,Because *Breaking Bad* was so fucking incredible that *Low Winter Sun* was basically unwatchable dogshit in comparison.
Winter Sun,"This show was toast even when it had ""Breaking Bad"" as a lead-in. All dark, no humor, gets old quickly. ""Almost Human"" is actually pretty excellent. Some interesting tech ideas that might show up in the real world eventually."
Winter Sun,I kind of feel sorry for David Costabile who finally got a co starring role in a show and it turned out to be a crappy derivative and unpopular show that got canned.
Winter Sun,"* Run down Detroit
* Dirty cops (all of them. Every. Single. One. Of. Them.)
* Enough angst to fill up the Pacific.

I think the problem was that it tried to hard to be ""hard"" and ""gritty"". We watched one and half episodes, let Tivo record a few more. And then when it came time to catch up the wife and I both said ""meh"". And if we wanted to watch promos for the next week's BrBa we just had to wait until the morning and watch it online. That trick may have worked a couple of years ago, but it won't today.

Winter Sun,"As a local, the show just wasn't genuine... not even a little.

Winter Sun,Although I do really like Mark Strong and Lennie James - and hate that they lost their show - does this mean that Lennie can return to Walking Dead now?
Winter Sun,"I didnt watch it for the one simple reason. AMC was trying to
 push that show on everyone waaaaay too much. I wanted to watch BB, then Talking Bad. I didn't want to wait a whole hour to watch TB. The constant commercials and the shoving down the throat. No thank you."
Winter Sun,"Oh great, so we need an hour of wrestlers talking about The Walking Dead but we can't have Low Winter Sun.   "
Winter Sun,"I vowed never to watch this show simply because of how aggressively it was advertised. 

Same with Almost Human.  

"
Winter Sun,"I don't think that Mark Strong is going to find an audience anytime soon -I think he could be a good character actor - supporting actor... but lead character? I can't get behind it, for some reason. He might as well be Stanley Tucci, trying to act tough."
Winter Sun,Rock n' Rolla sequel time now?????? PLEASE Mark Strong.
Winter Sun,"Very strange show. I quit on it once the bald guy's search for his girlfriend ramped up. I also thought it was a strange decision to have David Costabile as this sort of hardass, antagonist. He spent the two previous years as a weakling working under someone else's thumb on the show that was on before LWS. Just a weird casting choice."
Winter Sun,So no need for me to finish season one.  I need that triumphant baby meme
Winter Sun,they were just so invasive with it that I hated it even before watching the first episode.
Winter Sun,Good! That show deserved it after was annoying me with commercials when I was watching Breaking Bad.
Winter Sun,"Cool, since I just now became aware that it existed."
Winter Sun,I really really tried. Watched 2 1/2 episodes and just gave up. I just couldn't take it anymore. I had to check myself into the local mental health facility because if the anguish. 
Winter Sun,"I'm guessing I'm the only one who watched every episode? It's my TV flaw, I commit hard to new TV shows. 

Oh the horror of Rubicon, 10.5 episodes of garbage with the most tantalizing intro on television, 2.5 episodes of excitement, and then cancellation. AMC, why you do this to me?"
Winter Sun,"I am so glad.  Cop dramas are the absolute worst tv has to offer.  Especially east coast type cop dramas.  They are all basically the exact same, despite the plot.  Same good cop, bad cop, soap opera garbage.  I don't know who keeps thinking they are great ideas over there in Hollywood, but they fucking all suck!"
Winter Sun,They cancelled High Summer Moon? Oh well.
Winter Sun,"Enough cop series, more bad guy series."
Winter Sun,Had no chance premiering straight after Breaking Bad.
Winter Sun,"Maybe it was the director's fault, but I actually didn't like the acting on this show. It was way over the top dramatic and over acted. My friends and I couldn't help but laugh every time Lennie James forced out his lines. His acting style was similar on The Walking Dead, but it was more believable since people who've lost their family (and their mind) tend to act over dramatic."
Winter Sun,I think that is what hurt it more than anything.   No one wants to immediately watch a different show right after breaking bad finishes.
Winter Sun,"I watched 30 minutes of that show waiting on the commercial break to see the Breaking Bad scenes. 

It could have been the best show in the world, but I hated it for taking so long."
Winter Sun,"Small Town Security.

""Hey are you enjoying the crowning achievement of television's golden age? Then stay tuned for this weird reality show about redneck security guards!"""
Winter Sun,"Just started watching Almost Human when the company blocked Netflix at work (I watch while I eat lunch at my desk, mostly).  So I streamed the episodes from Fox.com, it's very entertaining."
Winter Sun,"Yeah I watched the first 5-10 minutes that were available for free and instantly I thought the show was trying WAY too hard from the acting, unnatural dialogue, and color tones.  

They desaturated everything and increased the black levels like crazy to give it a ""gritty"" look.  

Lennie James is also standing WAY too close to the other guy that is just seems fake, no one stands that close to each other even in a scene as tense as it was supposed to be.  

The way they promoted it they tried to make it look like the next Breaking Bad or something.  "
Winter Sun,"It's also the complete opposite of what made them successful. They were a station not many people cared about that just rebroadcast movies. Then they decided to make new programs. They bought Breaking Bad, then Mad Men (which aired first), and they were *good*. Really good. Some of the best. And people found it."
Winter Sun,"I agree, I know a few Detroit police and this show completely goes against who they are and what they go through on a daily basis.  I wonder if the writers did any research and actually talked to the real cops of Detroit. No need to invent a dramatic story line, just listen to what they have to say. "
Winter Sun,"I felt the same way. Especially when AMC was advertising it so heavily during Breaking Bad.  It seemed like a desperate move, as if AMC knew Breaking Bad was coming to a close and needed to fill that void at all costs."
Winter Sun,"Not really, check him out in Damages from FX. I had to do a double take when I was told Gale from Breaking Bad was the same guy from Damages.

It's usually never a case of poor casting/acting. It's almost always poor writing/direction *(read: Dean Norris in Breaking Bad compared to Dean Norris in Under the Dome)*."
Winter Sun,"And yet if you saw Damages (where he was basically The Terminator, but less lovable) before BB, you would have the opposite view. So..."
Winter Sun,"I watched all of it.  I thought ""Boss"" was more interesting."
Winter Sun,"Rubicon wasn't garbage, yeah it was a failure but it was an interesting failure that was trying to do something slightly different. Low Winter Sun on the other hand is just derivative garbage that attempts to copy better shows without understanding what made them great in the first place."
Winter Sun,You watch The Walking Dead. Shut up.
Winter Sun,I watched about 10 minutes of the first episode and this is the impression I got too. Everyone was trying to be a serious badass with no emotion. It also looked really cheap and was one of the most boring 10 minutes of tv I've ever watched. 
Winter Sun,"I really cannot stand Lennie James and have no idea why he is so beloved on the internet.  His acting was cringe worthy in both TWD and LWS.  

Having said that, there were some good actors on this show and Lennie and Katya were really the only ones who annoyed me.  "
Winter Sun,"Lennie was hamming it up, but for some reason I just found his chewing the scenery hilarious."
Winter Sun,Completely agree. I spent at least 3 hrs b4 the start of BB gearing up for that show. Everything after BB was a complete letdown. I had zero energy left to concentrate on another dramatic show.
Winter Sun,"I think it was just oversaturation. If a friend of yours tells you you should watch a show, you just might. If they keep telling you over and over, more and more aggressively, you just might come to resist it."
Winter Sun,I never got to see the breaking bad scenes and put up with a good amount of that new fucking show :(
Winter Sun,Small town security didn't get cancelled too did it?
Winter Sun,Small Town Security was nowhere near as bad as LWS.
Winter Sun,"From a business point of view, it makes more sense to put a reality show after an intense television drama than another intense television drama, and especially one as good as Breaking Bad."
Winter Sun,"Rubicon was excellent at the end, and it really built to something, but the first ten and a half episodes were really incredibly dry and frustrating. It was like they were teasing the viewers with this awesome idea, and finally when it got somewhere, they cancelled it :/"
Winter Sun,"Ha, you were smart to bail early. I gave it 3 episodes and it was exactly the same as you describe."
Winter Sun,"He was good on Jericho.Or, well, actually he did the exact same thing you're talking about for the entire series, but it made sense in the context. Dude had an a-bomb in his basement. And that is not a euphemism. "
Winter Sun,"Check him out in Line of Duty. British show renewed for a second season. Armed forces unit in the UK, SCO19, accidentally kill someone assumed to be a terrorist *(big fuckup, 6 was a 9 on the door scenario)* but what they thought was a bomb was actually a baby. One of the unit can't deal with it so he quits and joins Anti Corruption. His target is Lennie James, who is a dirty cop.

It's pretty good. Especially with how guns are so rare in the UK it's cool to see that side of things done well in a British TV show.

Anyway, watch Lennie James in that and you'll see how good he can act."
Winter Sun,"I feel like the standard for keeping shows on the air has to be lowered. Most everyone I know watches hardly any television/cable, everything is watched online (mostly illegally, unless it's available quickly on Amazon or Netflix which it never is). I have no problem paying a few dollars per episode, but it always takes several days for episodes to be put up for sale.

Shows like Low Winter Sun and Dracula (with Jonathan Rhys Meyers from The Tudors) are downright amazing and get terrible ratings, both will likely be cancelled. It's just such a pain in the ass to tune in to a show and even more of a pain in the ass to remember to Tivo it every week. 

The only two shows I make a point to sit down and watch are The Walking Dead and Strike Back, which my father and I get together every week for. The only way a show is getting watched live is if we both enjoy it and it's at a reasonable day/time, Sunday nights are perfect."
Winter Sun,[This right here](http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/10/16/small-town-security-renewed-by-amc-for-season-3-network-greenlights-unscripted-series-king-of-arms/209532/) says that they were renewed for a third season.
Winter Sun,Damn.  Was Low Winter Sun really that bad?  I only ever got around to watching the first episode.
Winter Sun,"I really wanted to give it a chance, so I watched 6 episodes. Ugh.. why"
Winter Sun,[deleted]
Winter Sun,Yeeeeaah boiiii
Winter Sun,"Yeah, I really gave it a chance.  I think I got through three episodes and said to myself ""that's enough.""  I really like everything else that AMC has aired.  Walking Dead, Breaking Bad, Mad Men, Hell on Wheels, even The Killing I liked.  This?  Notsomuch."
Winter Sun,I knew that was gonna happen.   After an intense hour of breaking bad noone sticks around for another intense drama... everyone is heading to /r/breakingbad
Winter Sun,I tried watching the first episode. [It insists upon itself. ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAR-GxoFwBI) 
Winter Sun,I can't believe they try to get you to watch by saying scenes for next week's Breaking Bad will be during one of the commercial breaks.
Winter Sun,Want a dirty cop show? Watch The Shield instead
Winter Sun,"I watched the first episode and while the Mark Strong character is compelling, the black lead (sorry not gonna bother looking up his name) is super annoying.  I love dark shows so that doesn't bother me...but there are too many monologues and philosophical diatribes for me to get into it. "
Winter Sun,"I'll never watch it because AMC tricked my DVR into recording what was essentially just a promo for Low Winter Sun sandwiched by short trailers for Breaking Bad as a ""Premiere Special"" episode of Breaking Bad. I was expecting red carpet, promos, interviews.. Nope. A few clips and a fucking long promo for Low Winter Sun. Fuck you AMC."
Winter Sun,"In the year 2013 I think this kind of ""lead-in"" scheduling is sort of pointless. How many Breaking Bad fans are DVRing the episode and watching it later (or watching delayed to skip the commercials) or waiting for DVD or downloading the episodes online?  Even if I WANTED to watch this show, it's not like I have the choice to just sit there after the recorded episode is done playing and watch it because I'm not watching it live. 

Not to mention-- AMC has like, a half-dozen scripted TV shows that they air pretty much one at a time throughout the year. What's the point in trying to get me to stay tuned to your network for two hours one night of the week when you can't guarantee I'm coming back to your network at all for the rest of the six days of programming you have? I know it's probably a struggle for networks to get new viewers to tune in, especially if you're asking them to remember what time and day some new show is playing. But seriously, the technology exists-- just run some ads saying ""Set your DVR now for Some Show on Some Night"" and that's that. 

Stop trying to be like ""WATCH THIS SHOW RIGHT NOW' and let people discover new programming on their own. Instead of trying to rely on the people who haven't changed the channel after Breaking Bad, you should be encouraging all those people who DVR or download Breaking Bad to check out Low Winter Sun of their own volition and make it easier for them to do so if they choose to.

PLUS-- I mean-- WE'RE NOT STUPID. When networks pull the whole ""see scenes from next week's episode during this new TV show"" that's a signal to me that the new show isn't that good. I mean you're basically admitting that the best part of your  new show is going to be the COMMERCIAL for your old show that plays during it. I mean, if you have to make compromises to your audience to get them to watch a show, that's showing a total lack of faith on your part that the show is any good. "
Winter Sun,Maybe because its boring as fuck
Winter Sun,Everything is the same tone. It is just hushed talking in different rooms.
Winter Sun,"I've watched both episodes, but no more. I just can't give a shit about any of the characters and I don't care what happens to them. "
Winter Sun,[deleted]
Winter Sun,"The only show that can follow Breaking Bad is Breaking Bad.  The last few seasons they've been re-airing the episode immediately after.  I usually want to watch the episode again to pick up on new things and reaffirm others so having to wait an hour for a transparent attempt to hook me on a new show (even thought that's how they got me into Breaking Bad...) is frustrating.  It feels like homework when I'm trying to get more free time for fun.

It actually reminds me of the Rubicon experiment.  They advertised a special extended Breaking Bad episode for the season 3 finale.  My cable's guide even showed Breaking Bad as being an extended episode.  The episode ends after a huge cliff hanger 60 minutes in and the credits roll.  Then fucking Rubicon comes on.  "
Winter Sun,"I didn't even give it a chance because they put it in between Breaking Bad and Talking Bad.  After watching Breaking Bad all you wanna do is either watch something like Talking Bad or come to /r/breakingbad.  I usually intend to only be on [/r/breakingbad](http://www.reddit.com/r/breakingbad) for an hour to kill time til Talking Bad comes on, but I always lose track of time and end up having to watch TB on the net later the next day. "
Winter Sun,[deleted]
Winter Sun,"Yup lets say show sucks when we have only seen 2 EPISODES!!!

Sheesh breaking bad wasn't anything special only 2 episodes in and look at it now.

People are so dam quick to judge shit before actually giving chance."
Winter Sun,"I try to watch every show that comes out that is in my genre of enjoyment, and Low Winter Sun is totally that. Plus it has Mark Strong in it. and he is cool as shit. 

But when I tuned in for breaking bad two weeks ago I slowly realized why I would not be watching. It was shoved down our throats. ""hey, you are watching breaking bad, thats cool, you want more? watch Low Winter Sun!"" or ""hey, you know breaking bad? well after Low Winter Sun you can watch Talking Bad!"" or ""THIS SUNDAY...The intense final season of breaking bad....comes on after Low Winter Sun.""

instead of running ads during the time slow where people would be watching, they paired it with BB in a way that made me not want anything to do with it. I have not seen a single episode, and I doubt I will for a while. I hate stupid ads.


"
Winter Sun,"I tried watching it. I gave it a fair swing, it just wasn't very good."
Winter Sun,"The first episode sets everything up. It was a little dull. The second episode, I feel like the teeth finally catch and the gears start spinning."
Winter Sun,The show is really boring so far and everyone being super duper serious in it drags it down.
Winter Sun,"Too bad really. I like Lennie James and I think Mark Strong is one of the best actors working nowadays. But the show lacks characters. Stuff just happens. And I don't care about stuff, I care about characters."
Winter Sun,Was hoping this show would be more considering Lennie James showed that he can go HAM as an actor while he played Morgan on The Walking Dead. Sucks it sucks though.
Winter Sun,"First episode was ok but was convoluted and seemed all over the place because of it.  The second episode was great.

The problem is, the way AMC marketed it they set it up to fail.  Everyone expected the new Breaking Bad from those stupid promos.  When the show ended up being nothing like it, the Breaking Bad fans hated it...and when that is your lead in audience, you are pretty much screwed.


Also, people tend to forget that Breaking Bad, Justified and a whole mess load of other shows were just ""ok"" through most of the first season.  Complex plots need time to grow."
Winter Sun,"I know the main guy is the dad in Kick Ass, but he reminds me too much of the Cash Cab guy. I know it's not him, but I don't want to see him as a dirty cop. "
Winter Sun,Missed Breaking Bad and started watching that. Holy chit is it good
Winter Sun,"Lower Winter Sun has potential, it just needs to learn to relax instead of trying so hard to be one of the big dogs. That's the best way I can describe its problems."
Winter Sun,"Low Winter Sun needed a great hook in the first few minutes - seconds, even - if they wanted people to get invested in it.

Breaking Bad had one. Man in his underpants crazily driving an RV, bodies in the back. Slams brakes, exits vehicle, aims gun at oncoming police cars. Fuck. I need to watch this show? What is this??

The first few minutes of the Low Winter Sun pilot were some guys talking. It could be a great show, but it wasn't enough to grab my interest (or, as this article suggests, anyone else's)."
Winter Sun,[deleted]
Winter Sun,The 2 main leads are Brits playing Americans.  Don't we have any good actors?
Winter Sun,"[Regina George meme]

Stop trying to make Low Winter Sun happen, AMC.

It's not going to happen.

[/Regina George meme]"
Winter Sun,"I honestly think this is exactly right.  could be the best show ever on afterwards, nobody is going from Heisenberg/Hank showdown to ""heyyyy new AMC show!!!"" mode"
Winter Sun,"Ooooooorrr... Low Winter Sun is crap.

...which is a massive shame, because Low Winter Sun (Scotland) was incredible."
Chefs Table: France,"I kinda want to know more about the ""You are going to die unless you stop making pizza"" bit. Rough quote, I know.

I spent my Summer watching all of MasterChef and MasterChef Junior because I am pathetic, and this looks pretty interesting."
Chefs Table: France,Gonna be watching this while eating Domino's.
Chefs Table: France,"I watched this last night. Not to knock Chef Bianco, surely his pizza is amazing and has inspired thousand's of pizza makers all over Europe and the USA, this Neapolitan artisan style is now widespread and to be honest, has gotten a bit gentrified and boring. I eat this stuff all the time now, of course better than some shitty train station pizza slice, but I have also had some pretty fucking good pizza from places that don't have a wood oven, hand squeezed tomato sauce, perfectly mixed and proofed 00 dough and new york mozzarella. Just some mom and pop love on the back streets of Italy with a fuck load of cheese and fennel sausage."
Chefs Table: France,"I’m watching this right now. Chef’s Table is so pretentious, and that’s coming from someone who loves pretentious food. Like do we need the classical music intro and 100 slow motion shots of the chefs smelling a tomato on an organic farm?"
Chefs Table: France,"How could it ever compete with the Hulu show though? (/s)

https://reddit.com/r/television/comments/wxnayr/best_in_dough_official_trailer_from_the_creators/"
Chefs Table: France,Chefs table pizza: we travel around the world to bake the fun out of pizza.
Chefs Table: France,"Awesome. They made a whole show about pizza and skipped the most important pizza city in the world, and only did one style more or less."
Chefs Table: France,"What we need is a Jon Stewart documentary about Pizza, where he spends the last 10 minutes going into vivid comedic details into why Chicago Deep Dish is the worst thing ever. 

https://youtu.be/jCgYMFtxUUw"
Chefs Table: France,"Really wish they would have featured an NY spot like L&B's Spumoni, a Detroit style joint, something unique"
Chefs Table: France,"My guess it would be the fumes from the wood oven, I think on those kind of wood burning ovens, the only place for air to escape is through the front entry."
Chefs Table: France,“The best pizza is in the alleys of Italy 🥱” *flips hair* *adjusts Gucci sunglasses*
Chefs Table: France,Chef's Table is good for flipping through to various food and scenery highlights.
Chefs Table: France,">Chef's Table: Pizza

This one has chef's xd"
Chefs Table: France,We travel around the world and show different people in fields of wheat.
Chefs Table: France,We can argue if deep dish is not pizza but deep dish is fucken delicious.
Chefs Table: France,"You are required to have the same venting just like any oven. Commercial ones require the same, or you will be fined, and cannot open."
Chefs Table: France,"That is your own quote. Some things just shouldn't be gentrified. Pizza is not meant to be gourmet, it is street food... People like Bianco's for two reasons, 1) they source high quality ingredients, 2) The have to queue all morning"
Chefs Table: France,Yeah it’s a pretty show that’s for sure
Chefs Table: France,"I mean I agree with you, but the whole concept of Chef’s Table is taking something and making it gourmet. Idk what annoyed me about your comment is that you’re saying pizza should be ungentrified street food but you’re still making a judgement call as to what’s good or bad street food (Mom and Pop shops in Italy are good but train station food is bad). 

Doesn’t ungentrified just mean a poor urban area? Like poor people today are gonna eat the cheap shit pizza at the train station because it’s cheap and convenient. Also homeless people in NY go to $1 slice places because …it’s cheap. So we should eat food of the working class if it’s 19th-c working class but not the 21st c working class?

I think this show is guilty of overly romanticizing the past, and of how people used to eat. I really doubt poor 19th c Italians were eating Bianco-style pizzas. Also there were waves of immigration to the US because people wanted to get tf out of Italy. 

Anyways just a few thoughts"
Chefs Table: France,"well pizza in Italy used to be just flat bread... wasn't until Italians went to America that they turned it into some gooey mess. that was exported around the world. Just saying I have had great, if not better pizza in Italy and America than this new style pizza they have everywhere now. And by train station I meant like frozen pizza dough, ingredients etc, baked next to kebabs and asian noodles."
Chefs Table: France,Yeah true true
Chefs Table: France,Oh my gosh…. That would be so scary. I can hear Mads say….. try the liver…. It’s fresh.
Chefs Table: France,"Fans will put Vivaldi's Four Seasons (Concerto No. 4 in F minor) over *anything* to put together a *Chef's Table* parody trailer of their own. Youtube is littered with them.

Just me, but while it's an okay idea, I'm all \[shrug\]. The [original rolodex/recipe box montage of Hannibal cooking to *Faust*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx89rSN0I28) was just **so** much better."
Chefs Table: France,"Lol what? You missed the point of the video altogether. Hannibal always featured beautiful cooking sequences, so this person edited together a fake Chef's Table intro for Hannibal. The link you posted is just a random scene from Hannibal. Also, yes Concerto No. 4 in F minor is literally used as the Chef's Table intro song."
Chefs Table: France,"Oh, no I got the point. It just wasn't nearly as funny, pointed, or smart as the other *Chef's Table* parodies like that that abound on Youtube:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-lfBiatGD8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-lfBiatGD8)

Using *Hannibal* footage? While the *original* footage is actually far more on-point than the parody? It's just dumb."
Chefs Table: France,"Best Netflix docu-series, and it ain’t even close, IMO"
Chefs Table: France,"Chef's Table is my favorite cooking show, will be looking forward to this."
Chefs Table: France,"This is such a fun series. Really beautiful style, and glad they're going a bit of a focused direction with BBQ here as I loved the pastry one.

[For those that haven't seen it, IFC's Documentary Now! did a great parody episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47j9jWMegUs) as well, super funny."
Chefs Table: France,"Premieres September 2nd, for those unable to watch."
Chefs Table: France,I fucking love this show
Chefs Table: France,I once saw this food series on BBQ.  It went to the best places in the US.  A lot of them were in my neck of the woods but the one that stood out was in Cali.  This couple was from KC but moved to Cali.  They got a small hut at the farmers market.  The line is so long people don't even get to eat before they run out of food.  It made me realise that a lot of states don't have good BBQ.  It's sort of sad really.
Chefs Table: France,Omg. I picked a damn good time finally dig in to this series. Just in time for this one!
Chefs Table: France,Looks like the most interesting one they have done of these.
Chefs Table: France,I love all the food docuseries to be honest. They're great
Chefs Table: France,"It was actually a parody of Jiro Dreams of Sushi, an earlier work by the creator of Chef's Table, but I still loved it, the way they parodied the father/son dynamic of the original movie was great"
Chefs Table: France,David Gelb has been amazing for Netflix
Chefs Table: France,Ahh that makes sense too. I always figured Jiro Dreams of Sushi was the inspiration for a lot of the later food docs on Netflix.
Chefs Table: France,"Ugly Delicious is great as well. And Salt Fat Acid Heat.  Also Cooked, as has already been mentioned. Netflix has some fantastic food shows."
Chefs Table: France,Add Jon Favreau food truck show to the list. All of these shows are food porn at its best
Chefs Table: France,Ugly delicious is also quite good. The first episode is the worst of the series so you might not want to start with that one.
Chefs Table: France,"Chefs table has a lot of great cinematography, but I wish it focused more on the food and less on how hard the chefs life has been.

I don't particularly care about how you grew up poor, but I am interested to understand and watch your process for creating and serving amazing food."
Chefs Table: France,"It also helps that Netflix is streaming those shows in 4K HDR. If you own a good TV, the food just looks awesome."
Chefs Table: France,"""Cooked"" is fantastic too. You should add that to your list of you haven't watched it yet"
Chefs Table: France,Agree! 100%
Chefs Table: France,David Gelb is behind both. He also did a pretty famous documentary called Jiro Dreams of Sushi (also on Netflix). It's great if you haven't seen it.
Chefs Table: France,"My favorites so far have been Ugly Delicious (stoked for a new season) and also Somebody Feed Phil. I actually got to use one of Phil’s suggestions, which is the first time I’ve ever been to a place I only saw on a TV Show."
Chefs Table: France,Was about to upvote you for Ugly Delicious but I thought SFAH was absolute trash.
Chefs Table: France,I found the fried chicken episode the worst - very cringy and overbearing especially if you aren't American.
Chefs Table: France,"I don't like Chef's Table anymore to be honest. It used to focus on demystifying the cult of technical, Michelin star cooking with chefs as rock stars and food as a challenge. I thought it was brilliant, engaging and insightful.

But to me it only really works with that kind of restaurant and cuisine. I just don't find the more rustic food and cooks they focus on now really worth spending time dissecting, which is probably why they now pad it out with life stories when they used to shine a light almost exclusively on the food with the chef's journey being complimentary to this."
Chefs Table: France,I've seen it on there but I haven't checked it out yet. Will do for sure though.
Chefs Table: France,I have seen that one actually. It's a really good film.
Chefs Table: France,"This is my favorite docu-series on Netflix, can't wait to watch it

Wish it was more than a 4 episode season though"
Chefs Table: France,"Pretty amazing parody of chef's table 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vcLzu5_Yb8"
Chefs Table: France,I love this series. Super excited for this.
Chefs Table: France,I can’t sleep and this gives me joy 
Chefs Table: France,"The shots look amazing, but take it down a notch with pretentiousness please, you are making food not saving the world."
Chefs Table: France,"Alright, I've had this on my watch list for a while now. I'm a big fan of Parts Unknown/No Reservations. I kinda watched the first episode, but had to go to work and never went back. Is it a show along the lies of the two that I mentioned or is a bit different? "
Chefs Table: France,"The first series and in fact the first episode is still the best.

There are a lot of pretentious chefs on the later episodes."
Chefs Table: France,"Oh thank goodness, this looks great. The Pastry ""season,"" if you'd call it that, was such a step down in quality I was worried it spoke to the future of the show, but it seems like that was likely an entirely different crew. This looks like more of what made the first three years so good. "
Chefs Table: France,This show has gotten more and more pretentious with each season.  
Chefs Table: France,"There are a few funny parodies, but [this one's](https://youtu.be/9kGtgBJKyZM) my personal favourite. "
Chefs Table: France,"It's become a real turn off for me especially when the similar personality is so widespread. There's a lot to admire about their work and talent but for an entertainment series, it can sometimes come across pretty grating. Even on wholesome down to earth cooking shows it sticks out like a sore thumb. For example in Somebody Feed Phil, that chef who gets annoyed when people don't eat oysters properly, or Daniel Boulud insisting his sauce makes the mom's dish better. Or that guy in Ugly Delicious saying tacos are cultural appropriation. Chefs who are pretty down to earth or just as knowledgeable comes across pretty well on camera, like Narda Comedor or Christina Tosi and Carla and rest of the Bon Appetit editors. 

I think that's where the Great British Bake Off, Somebody Feed Phil and Nailed It gets their appeal. It's refreshing to see people who just enioys cooking and eating and just there for the fun of it. "
Chefs Table: France,Not really. Parts Unknown is more about the culture. Chef Table is really about the chef and the food. 
Chefs Table: France,The biggest similarity is that both shows revolve around food in some way or another - Bourdain looks at food in the context of a city whereas Chef's Table looks at food in the context of a chef.  Chef's Table is definitely more theatrical in comparison.
Chefs Table: France,"This series is basically a documentary of the life of the chef, their food, and what they love about their art. Parts unknown is more about the people and the culture around cuisine, not necessarily about the chef. "
Chefs Table: France,What!? The pastry season was amazing. Jordi Roca’s episode was one of the best of the entire series. I don’t think the quality dropped at all. Every episode was shot beautifully. I think it fits in with every other season. 
Chefs Table: France,"I've never seen that one, but it is so dead on. 

My favorite, hands down, will always and forever be this one with the great Fred Armisen. https://www.eater.com/2017/2/28/14765040/portlandia-chefs-table

Chefs Table: France,"To each their own. I found the visual flair to be lacking, and I've heard similar things from other viewers, though it's far from categorical. Felt like it was put together more quickly while they were working on the next ""real"" season."
Chefs Table: France,Chef's Table is the shiitttttt. So glad there's finally going to be more and for pastries! Sucks that it's only 4 episodes but it will be a nice snack 
Chefs Table: France,I wouldnt have thought they would do a  series on pastry. I wonder if they are going to follow the Michelin ranked restaurants. 
Chefs Table: France,This made me smile! Chef’s Table is the best! 🙌🏼
Chefs Table: France,"Really excited. 
Potentially unpopular opinion but I think Tosi's work tends to be cloyingly sweet and almost childish. That being said I'll watch the duck out of each episode happily. "
Chefs Table: France,"God, I love Chef's Table.  Back when it was just the original six episodes I was sick and having a blah day full of boredom, I ended up scrolling through Netflix and my love of cooking shows made me decide to give it a go.  I ended up watching all six episodes that day.  There is just something so wonderful about the way this show is presented, like a mini-biography that's just beautifully shot. 

I can not wait for this instalment."
Chefs Table: France,Chef's Table is one of the best food shows. 
Chefs Table: France,"Man I hate this show. I like how Netflix also has the show ""Ugly Delicious"" with David Chang where they make fun of these types of food videos. "
Chefs Table: France,"I love how each episode is a mini documentary, with a different story and each shot in a different style depending on the chef. It’s not some stale documentary. Great show. "
Chefs Table: France,That's not really what ugly delicious is doing at all...
Chefs Table: France,"It's PG-13 Dee and Kaitlin Olson put any doubts to rest on her ability-- she's a great comedic actress, and she can do her own show, no doubts. But she's basically just Dee in the show, and aint nothing wrong there"
Chefs Table: France,Loved that show. Sad it got canceled.
Chefs Table: France,Mickey's corruption of Alba is one of my favorite TV friendships. We deserved 5 more seasons.
Chefs Table: France,"She pops up because she’s a drunk 🤣

It was such a funny premise and the cast was so great"
Chefs Table: France,You rarely see a comedy cast hit it off right from the start like this one did.
Chefs Table: France,I loved that show but I also have a celebrity crush on Kaitlin Olson. Really wish it were renewed. The comedy was expected but still raunchy and fun enough.
Chefs Table: France,"We've never watched IASIP, but loved The Mick, in our house Caitlin is called The Mick, which spurs revelations like ""Hey the Mick is married to that Wrexham guy"" etc.."
Chefs Table: France,"I enjoyed it, made me laugh a lot. Some really good physical comedy. 

I think it’s better than any of the other Sunny guys projects anyway"
Chefs Table: France,"it was hilarious, jimmy was great on it and the cast dynamic got funnier as it went. glad we got two seasons at least"
Chefs Table: France,"Great show, Sunny crew need to make more shows. I miss the days of pure asshole comedy."
Chefs Table: France,Someone being gruesomely injured or killed in every episode was such a good gag
Chefs Table: France,I love how the dude kept getting his ass kicked.
Chefs Table: France,That was a great show.  Surprising amount of character growth for a one camera comedy also.
Chefs Table: France,Single Drunk Female is like a spin off
Chefs Table: France,"The kid licking the Benihana table

Chef kiss."
Chefs Table: France,One of my favorite shows. Such a good cast playing trashy people with a mixture of physical comedy. I really wish we got a season three.
Chefs Table: France,"it was fine, worth watching once with some burst out laughing parts"
Chefs Table: France,The casting on that show was so good. Red haired kid was such a funny actor.
Chefs Table: France,Fucking phenomenal
Chefs Table: France,"I hated every second that i watched the mick. Unfortunately, i hadn't seen its always sunny yet and because i didn't enjoy the mick its always sunny is now like ruined for me :(. I think that's an unpopular opinion on the mick but to each their own."
Chefs Table: France,If you want to see a show where she does something different check out Flipped with her and Will Forte.  Sadly there's only one short season.
Chefs Table: France,"Between mick, ap bio and mythic quest it felt like a pantheon of bottle episodes titled ""the gang hustles other tv shows"". Sure there's some differences, esp with the depth of mac's apple character...but bio and Mick were just the same lovable scumbags. I hope they reference the other shows in ASIP offhandedly"
Chefs Table: France,I highly recommend watching r/IASIP!
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,Dolly has a beautiful soul.
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,Can this be considered a prequel to *The Orville*?
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,Just when I thought I had seen every piece of Muppet media. Marvelous!
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,"Dolly Parton is a force for good in the world.  She is authentic and unassuming despite her great success as a singer/songwriter.  She shares her wealth in the most productive ways, and without fanfare.  ❤️❤️❤️"
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,"Two big, round beautiful souls."
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,amen
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,What makes her great is that she would joke about this too
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,I think nobody is talking about Joel and Tess being together for at least 13 years. That was huge revelation for me. Makes Joel’s loss that much bigger.
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,The most important part of the episode is Joel understanding the message Bill left for him. Joel is now on board with getting Ellie to this lab to find a cure. It’s why he asked her to show him her arm again.
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,From the tension in the piano scene I thought someone was going to die.
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,"The way the episode was directed was fantastic in my opinion. I like that they don't need to show the couple's corpse at all, it was done really well. In the end of the episode when they were zooming out the window I'm going ""pleeease don't show them, we don't need to"" and sure enough they didn't! Great episode."
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,"Once that Max Richter song came on to start off that montage, I was like ""guess this is my cue to cry happy sad tears now"""
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,Nick Offerman should win an Emmy for his performance
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,"This was one of the most moving, but yet not overly dramatic portrayals of love I’ve seen in a long time. It’s inspiring, relatable and just very well done."
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,"While everyone is rightfully praising the actors, I want to shout out to the writer Craig Mazin for fleshing out a side character and gave us this beautiful story. 

Mazin was also responsible for writing Chernobyl, which also had some beautiful writing with amazing character relationships."
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,"I wasn't expecting the direction this episode took at all.

Nick Offerman made me cry.

Everyone can have their own opinion but to me this was art, not filler."
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,"Joel explained how the fungus rapidly spread through tainted food. This shined light on how the elderly neighbor was infected in Episode 1.

Edit: Plus Joel forgot to get a cake from the store, which presumably would have infected his family too."
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,"I'm hearing either, ""Best episode ever made!"" or ""What the hell was that, pointless!""

It wouldn't be interesting if everyone agreed I guess."
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,This episode was perfectly produced. My only complaint was when bill just shooting from the middle of the street with no cover.. bill seem way more intelligent than that from everything else we saw in the episode.
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,"It was well made, told a kind of slice-of-life story about living in the post apocalypse. Well written, well shot, well acted.

I can't rightly think of another episode like it that isn't filled to the brim with various genre tropes like one of them getting inevitably infected."
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,"It was incredible to see Bill’s growth as a person once Frank came into his life. From an angry, closed-off, highly introverted man to someone who became happy, open and loving. His vulnerability in the very beginning of their relationship and Frank’s patience and calming presence was one of the most moving things I have ever witnessed in a television show. The scene where he and Frank giggled over strawberries was truly heartwarming. I genuinely started crying when they revealed that Frank was terminally ill and love that their journey ended together. Nick Offerman should absolutely win an award for his role in this episode. It is some of the best television that has ever been made."
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,I loved this episode. I can forgive a deviation from the source material if the new material is written well and executed well. And this episode did exactly that. Nick Offerman killed it
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,"Nick Offerman laughing at the strawberries was the moment that got me. That laugh of pure, unburdened joy. It was perfectly used."
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,Honestly didn't expect to cry so hard to an episode of The Last of Us about a gay romance of two one shot side characters
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,As a massive fan of the game since day 1 & never usually like something deviating TOO far from an original story... I thought that episode was fucking incredible
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,All this from a video game adaptation. We've come so fucking far.
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,This episode slayed me. Was totally unprepared. Beautiful.
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,"People asked what more a show could do to expand on TLOU and this is exactly it. It’s expanding on the heart of characters trying to survive in a post apocalyptic world.

I genuinely cried, it was amazing"
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,"I've been very happy theyre sticking to the OG story so closely. This is the first major change theyve made and its great. These are side characters I barely even remember existing, so they play a minimal role in the story. Fleshing out their backstory doesnt detract at all. The addition of a well written, well acted side story like this adds immensely though"
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,"No episode of tv has made me cry like that since Not Penny’s Boat, that’s all I’ll say"
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,"I appreciated the nods to Ron Swanson's birthday dinner.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0SHrmGdIzo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0SHrmGdIzo)"
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,"I don’t feel anything very easily. Nick Offerman is one of those actors that I have had this idea of in my head as being a one-trick pony. Boy, was I wrong. This episode had me weeping. I walked away feeling all kinds of stuff I can’t even explain."
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,Ugly crying!
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,"Just finished the episode. As a long time proponent of please stick to the source material I can safely say that this episode was just absolutely fantastic.

Performances are tremendous, it fleshes out the world the characters inhabit, how they’ve changed over the course of time in a world that’s hopeless. 

If you want a 1 for 1 retelling of exactly how the game is, go play it but for me this  is a video game adaptation (key word is adaptation) done exactly right 

I hope both guys get nominated for many awards for their performance."
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,I haven’t been broken like this from a TV episode in a looooong time
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,"> The Last of Us' just made an early claim to ~~one of~~ the best TV episode~~s~~ of 2023

Only been a month, and maybe Succession will give it a run for its money, but so far it's way out in front. One of the best episodes of television I've ever seen.

This show was just like, ""by the way, here's the most beautiful and devastating love story ever squeezed into an hour"" while helping establish a totally authentic post-apocalyptic setting and give leagues of depth and subtext to the stories of Joel and Tess, all in passing."
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,[removed]
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,[removed]
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,"Much preferred their story here than the game’s version and glad some story beats are changing.

My biggest complaint before was that it I personally was finding a 1 for 1 recreation slightly uninteresting (feels like a harsh word as I’m still think this is a fantastic tv show), part of me was wishing I was just playing the game instead.

This episode was a brilliant change of pace, a perfect filler episode."
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,It was a good episode for sure.
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,Love the ending shot is through the bedroom window. However it bugs me that it looks like it is a second floor window but their bedroom is on the ground floor for easy access.
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,I think this was the first time I actually cried while watching something incredible performance
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,I think a lot of the criticism of it being a filler episode is from people who lack media literacy. It is really not difficult to see how the story told in the ep fleshes out and contextualises some of the wider themes of the game/show
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,"At the end of that episode I crawled into my boyfriends lap and cried for ages. Best bit of telly I’ve seen in a long time, absolutely amazing writing and performances."
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,"""I like you older. Older means we're still here."""
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,"Well, this is one of my favorite episodes of any show ever.  
  
My *emotions*."
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,I do like that they used a mortal kombat 2 machine instead of the fictional arcade cabinet
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,“I never liked you…but I do respect you.” Straight up Ron Swanson.
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,"I totally recognize that the episode was sad because of the ending, but I couldn’t help but feel happy for Bill & Frank. In all that chaos, they built a great life together. Frank had all those amazing paintings, Bill overcame his grudge against humanity, they grew strawberries!!

How many people get undisturbed time (work, school,  obligations) for over a decade with the person they love?  I was really happy and proud of them for that.

Also, very classy of TV Ellie not to raid Bill’s magazine collection, 😂"
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,"When bill was shooting in the street, it was so dumb tho."
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,"I adored it. Felt like one of those classic artsy post-apocalyptic short stories you might have read in high school. But gay as hell.

I also thought the bedroom scene hit exactly the right notes. Not too schmaltzy, not too lurid, but not shying away from it either. It was sweet. Loved seeing this uber macho prepper guy suddenly trembling like a leaf with how nervous and self-conscious he was."
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,I never got to say goodbye to my best friend and to my dad when they passed away in 2020. I wish I had spent a proper last day with me just like frank and bill were able to do.  I cried so much.
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,"Early yes, but hard to disagree. As someone that loved the games, the whiplash of expectation to such a radically different approach to show determination and tenderness in this world was exceptionally effective. For those that have experienced the game and are even remotely media literate, it was phenomenal. I cried, I laughed, I cried a whole lot more. I told my wife that ""that episode was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time,"" and she agreed. 

For those coming in fresh, it was a remarkable way to show depth and complexity and motivation. Taking an episode to do this in an emotional and beautiful way is no waste. It does the functional story moving that the game did in a completely different way. 

I get people having their own tastes and their own opinions, but it's hard to think about people upset for deviating from this show being a play through. I did that. I experienced it. I let it take me along for the story and experience once, why wouldn't I allow this different medium to do the same?"
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,This is when The Last of Us did World War Z better than World War Z.
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,"Man, this was the episode I was most looking forward to/most worried about. I had conflicting feelings on the Bill/Frank stuff in the game. But holy shit was this just one of the most touching, heartbreaking and beautiful queer love stories I’ve seen.

The game was super progressive for even including an overtly gay character but the game kind of makes Bill’s homosexuality into a joke with the discovery of the gay magazine. Hence my complicated feelings on it. This episode knocked it out of the park. It’s so rare to see gay romance depicted in this way, as an aging couple. I think this has a lot to do with the AIDS pandemic and how we lost a massive percentage of a whole generation but seeing a gay couple be able to grow old together was far more moving than I expected it to be. Phenomenal episode imo."
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,Last time Ive cried this much from a show/movie was Titanic.
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,This episode made me weep like a child
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,"So I can’t find any comments addressing it and I kinda wanna see what you guys think. What exactly is Bills profession before this??? That house is expensive. You can see the Boston skyline in the distance. He has an arsenal that seems like it would cost nearly $50,000 not including ammunition or any of the other doomsday supplies. Maybe his mother left him the house, who knows. My guess is a degree in Engineering. That’s the only way I see someone putting together some town like that. Sure someone could slap some stuff together but realistically would probably end up hurting themselves trying to set all that up."
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,"Everyone go watch Devs, it's the best Nick Offerman role IMO."
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,"This episode actually gave me a stomach ache— I mean besides the blatant sobbing it just made me ache. I also laughed out loud more than once (all Nick Offerman).
That scene with Bill and Frank when they are sitting in their suits quietly exchanging rings BROKE ME."
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,"Holy sweet goddamn that show rocked me.

I don’t think I’ve ever been moved that much by tv or a movie.

Nick Offerman and Murray Bartlett were unbelievable."
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,Best thing I’ve watched this year. Loved it.
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,Throughout the episode I couldn’t place where i had seen the actor who played Frank before. When I found out he was from White Lotus I couldn’t believe it was the same guy. Great actor.
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,"One of the most intense and surprising things I noticed was how Bill and Frank are likely the only couple on earth to have such a picturesque, ‘romantic’ ending. They lived and experienced the joys of the old, pre-infection world like maybe only a handful left on earth could experience.

Everything outside their utopia is an apocalyptic dystopia. Most people die in horrible ways, or in substandard, poverty-like conditions in the QZs. It would likely be hundreds or thousands of years before what they had would once again become at least somewhat common."
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,It made the notebook look like the emoji movie
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,I ugly cried with this episode
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,One of the best Episodes I’ve throughly enjoyed because the World building occurred during this time. I do hope if other seasons are commissioned from this franchise… I’ve seen lots of negativity about this and it’s not been enjoyable to read.
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,"Never played the game. Coming in cold. This is one of the greatest (IMHO) episodes of TV that I’ve ever watched. The writing, the acting, the directing. All perfect. So much tension at he start, then the twist, then the gut wrenching ugly man crying at the end. I need to watch it again but I’m not sure that I can take it right now."
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,"Fuck this episode, I watched it for shroom zombies and instead got my 46 year old straight male heart ripped out from under my guts while cried like I haven’t since I was at least 5, not cool with your fancy writing and excellent acting and directing catching me so hard over what was probably less than 30 minutes. Now we never talk about this ever again"
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,This episode was incredible
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,That damn shutter island/arrival song 😢
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,Watching it! That wink when he’s painting 🥲
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,Did anybody else think Bill would be alive when Joel arrived? I thought it possible that he would fake dying to relieve frank of the guilt of leaving him alone
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,"I played the game in 2020 but forgot who Bill and Frank were lol, so I wasn't expecting the episode to go in that direction. I cried like a baby during their last meal. The score was fantastic as well and probably triggered more emotions. Such a beautiful episode all around."
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,This episode was like a long version of UP's love story. loved it.
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,"This particular episode had it all: acting, writing, story, pathos. It’s one of the best shows I’ve seen in a long time. If the quality stays this high it might be the best series ever."
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,"This episode was so fucking touching I almost cried in front of my folks. I don't like crying in front of people (which is normal), but this brought tears to my eyes."
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,[removed]
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,One of the best shows I’ve seen in a long time.  I suspect the right wingers are going to loose their minds.
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,"What a masterpiece. 

And on episode 3. Going to be hard to compete with that one. Man this is a great show."
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,"All I can say as a straight white cis guy watching a show about zombies, I never expected to be in literal tears at the end of a gay love story. I pretty much just consume TV for entertainment and while I really enjoy some shows I don't really get to emotionally invested. This episode gave me so many of the feels."
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,IMHO the greatest queer love story in television history. I'd totally watch a spin off show of Bill and Frank's domestic adventures in post apocalyptia.
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,"It was definitely the best episode of tv of 2023 so far. A touching tale, both heartwarming and heartbreaking. I hope that the guest stars get remembered come awards season."
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,This show is incredibly good. My family was spellbound and quite pleasantly surprised.
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,This is how you tell good stories. I wonder if the writers of rings of power watched it.
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,That really was so good. I was fucking bawling.
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,I knew Nick Offeman was a great actor but gat dam!
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,This show is HBO caliber in the best possible way.  I don’t even like the genre per se and know nothing of the game but when acting and writing is this good I just pop some popcorn and wait until next week impatiently.
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,They introduced a gay Ron Swanson and then killed him in one episode.  :-(
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,"This was a good ep ill admit. Def carried by the actors. But what bothered me about it, and its been done so many times in other shows is.....Bill, standing there....standing straight up, poppin shots with a BOLT ACTION RIFLE IN THE MIDDLE OF FUCKING NOWHERE. Why...just...why do so many shows do this shit. Im to believe this (probably vet), mega prepper gun ""enthusiast"" has no tactical training at all?! That mf'r would be behind cover, dick in the dirt poppin shots from a comfortable distance at his leisure. Not standing straight up in the middle of the fucking road....god i hate that shit, takes me right out. Murray bartlett was incredible tho so...i guess theres that"
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,Beaujolais Villages.  My family’s go to wine. Never heard anyone ever mention it. I was hooked from then on.  What an awesome episode!  Incredible all around. Well done!
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,"Incredible episode. The Bill story in the game was good, but they really took it to another level here. I'm happy they're sticking to the game in certain areas, but this was an inspired change. We got a fantastic, emotional story that still imparts the same lesson to Joel and let's us feel his pain over Tess through Bill's experience."
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,"Just watched the episode tonight. Brilliant first few minutes when he meets frank. My wife and I were just WAITING for frank to kill him. Especially when he sat down at the piano... 50m later were both crying at the love story. 

Brilliant story telling. Absolutely loving the series so far. LOF is a top 10 game for me so it's especially awesome to see the carry over. My wife whos never had interest can't stop watching either!"
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,This was a powerful episode. It’s the kind of rare and unexpected storytelling that I’ll remember for a long time.
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,Ron would be disappointed.
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,"Every now and then, you are watching TV, and you become aware that what you are seeing is far above the level of quality of most TV. This episode was o e of those times. As it ended, I just sat there, stunned. It has been a LONG time since I've seen anything as good as this episode on TV."
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,Idk I thought it kinda dragged.. I enjoyed the 1st and 2nd episode a lot more
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,Waterworks non stop. Finally a gay love story I can rewatch.
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,I cried. That's it.
Kulipari: An Army of Frogs,"I'm sad that they cut Elllies and Joel's scenes with Bill, those are some of the best scenes in the game (including the ""sticky pages"" in the car afterwards.."
Game Winning Hit,I just hope there’s a giraffe at some point
Game Winning Hit,reading this as a Halo fan: :D :(
Game Winning Hit,All I see is the Prince of Dorne babysitting the Lady of Bear Island
Game Winning Hit,"The filming crews shut down parts of Edmonton and Calgary, as well as several other locations in Alberta on and off for a year and..well, went crazy with the ""sets"". 

Like major roads into the city, and in the central business districts, etc... 

Without knowing a darn thing about the game, I can tell you the audience is in for a treat."
Game Winning Hit,"I really hope the ""Joel, we really are the last of us"" and than they proceed to be the last of them scene stays true to the game and hits just as hard 😢"
Game Winning Hit,"> The heartbreaking first 15 minutes of the game are depicted here, and Pascal’s performance underscores the blooming heartache that would fester into a shriveled, diminished soul.

No question, I’m ready to be destroyed again. Except now I’m a married man with a 2 month old, so I imagine this will hit that much harder"
Game Winning Hit,starting at 84 on Metacritic
Game Winning Hit,Paywall removed: https://archive.is/wip/n2yfL
Game Winning Hit,My girlfriend has no idea what’s coming. Gonna be great to watch the show knowing everything while also being able to get her genuine surprise reactions
Game Winning Hit,"Gene’s a great writer and huge videogame fan. If he signs off on it, this show is going to be amazing. Possibly eclipsing the game, narrative wise.

I suspect the shows success will open the floodgates for good videogame television series. Where writers work with developers to be faithful and make a good adaption."
Game Winning Hit,Already drinking more water so I don't dehydrate from tears.
Game Winning Hit,Part of me is very excited for this show but another part of me is a pc gamer who has somehow managed to avoid spoilers for this game and just learned that it’s finally coming to PC and now I just don’t know what to do!
Game Winning Hit,Did people really doubt the creator of fucking Chernobyl?
Game Winning Hit,"I know absolutely nothing about this game. Should I do some research to prepare myself for the show, or go in blind?"
Game Winning Hit,My body is ready
Game Winning Hit,[deleted]
Game Winning Hit,"Halo and Witcher TV show, take some notes pls

Finally a good video game adaption, at least Cyberpunk and Arcane were too"
Game Winning Hit,so best live action tv adaptation of video game? i know its not high bar.
Game Winning Hit,"I'll shit my pants if it's 75% as good as the game, I'm so excited for my non-gamer friends to feel the things I have felt."
Game Winning Hit,"Sorry for the obvious question, but when is this going to be released?"
Game Winning Hit,"PC gamer. really wanted to watch the series, but don't want to ruin the experience. the tempation ooh,,temptation"
Game Winning Hit,"I hope they have one whole episode showing Joel open millions of drawers, collecting little screws and pistol grips and rags."
Game Winning Hit,"Oh look a a director & a company who knows how not to piss off a fan base.

*Cough* paramount plus *cough*"
Game Winning Hit,I'm just interested to see how the story is going to work with spores being removed.
Game Winning Hit,I'm so nervous about introducing my wife to this. She watched me play some of part 2 but has no idea what's coming in the pilot and >!we just had our first child a year ago and so of course watching things in which kids suffer/die is now very emotional!<.
Game Winning Hit,I hate that HBO is literally the only studio you can trust to adapt stuff properly for series. Wtf is wrong with Hollywood these days?
Game Winning Hit,I am nearly done with my replay of part 1 :) I am so ready for this show.
Game Winning Hit,"I'm still not giving my hopes up, but I am really starting to believe this might be amazing.

Please, don't fuck it up."
Game Winning Hit,"So turns out when making an adaptation for a video game you *dont* need to mindlessly change every single detail for no reason and it works? What!?!?

It’s almost as if the reason it’s getting adapted in the first place was because the original product was actually good. Go figure."
Game Winning Hit,"And it looks like they’re also releasing this in 4K, just like HotD. Things looks promising so far."
Game Winning Hit,"i am so happy about this, i also can’t *wait* to see ashley johnson 😭😭😭"
Game Winning Hit,"Sooo fucking stoked to check this out. 

I adore the games. Best storytelling out of any video game medium in my opinion.

The fact that Druckmann has been closely part of this project gives me immense hope and these reviews are feeding the fire.

I honestly haven't seen any promo material for this besides a few images here and there and my first thoughts were skepticism over their casting decisions but I've learned to accept these choices.

Sunday can't come soon enough."
Game Winning Hit,Couldn’t be in better hands. I’m pumped! TLOU 1 and 2 are my favorite games. I even named my daughter Ellie ;x
Game Winning Hit,"Just found out that the first season will cover the entire first game. That is such welcome news. I was worried they’d try and stretch this out over a few seasons. Honestly really, really excited now."
Game Winning Hit,"Hyped! 

Can’t wait to see my wife be devastated so I can call her a loser for crying at a video game adaptation like she laughed when I cried playing the game."
Game Winning Hit,The haters are going to lose it
Game Winning Hit,I'm really hopeful for this.
Game Winning Hit,Is the show going to be super gory? My playthroughs certainly were. Curious to see how true to the game the they handle the showdown with Ellie & David.
Game Winning Hit,Do we have any idea how much story season 1 will be covering? Is it the whole game?
Game Winning Hit,"Mazin is a boss, always had faith in him"
Game Winning Hit,The television writer for this is Craig Mazin. He cohosts an awesome podcast called ScriptNotes for anyone interested in writing for film and tv.
Game Winning Hit,"My daughter was about 15 when I played the 1st game, and she loved sitting in on the story while I played. It’s just us, so the special bond of Joel and Ellie hit home for both of us.  Then she wanted to go to comic con and we decided to go together and cosplay it. 

I’m so excited to watch our first HBO together, old school style weekly episodes. And she’s excited that next time we cosplay them people will know us haha."
Game Winning Hit,Sigh of relief anyone?
Game Winning Hit,I've never played the game but like apocalyptic series. Should I watch this? And what differentiates it from something like The Walking Dead?
Game Winning Hit,What!!!??  wasn't it supposed to come on the 15th?
Game Winning Hit,"I feel like the first episode is definitely going to be as upsetting as the opening was, so Yay... I guess. My wife is going to cry again and probably bust my balls for having her watch that again lol"
Game Winning Hit,"Finished the first game a couple of days ago and started part 2 yesterday. Show must be absolutely brutal, then."
Game Winning Hit,BuT tHeY Don't LoOK tHe SaMe aS tHe ViDeO Game! Worst show ever........ /s
Game Winning Hit,"Can’t freaking wait, finally playing through part 2 right now"
Game Winning Hit,Fuck yeah
Game Winning Hit,This many awards for a link to a review in the first hour? Nothing sus about that.
Game Winning Hit,Doubt
Game Winning Hit,This and then LOVM season 2 in the same month. I'm excited.
Game Winning Hit,"Damn, I wish I hadn’t told my wife every plot detail as I was playing through."
Game Winning Hit,"The other day I was watching people reactions to that intro of the game (the scene with the security guard  right before the title shows up). I must have watched it like 10 times in a row, cried everytime"
Game Winning Hit,"as long as we have at least one big boi rip off someones skull from the jaw, I'll be happy."
Game Winning Hit,Play the game first or watch this first…hmm
Game Winning Hit,I really gotta play this game finally
Game Winning Hit,I hate these [weirdos](https://twitter.com/bigbybadb/status/1612722416530202625).
Game Winning Hit,"I haven't played the game but its going to come out on March 3rd on PC. So, should I play the game first or watch the TV show first?"
Game Winning Hit,Do you think it will be worth a watch for someone who doesn’t care about video games? Trailer looks good.
Game Winning Hit,"it was so funny to see people calling it ""woke fanction"" in the last few days after the Gamer reaction to TLOU2. cannot wait to see hilarious flamin hot takes after this releases. congrats to all the production and folks who worked hard to get it made - and also to rational fans!"
Game Winning Hit,If it’s anything like the game.. we are all in for a very good series
Game Winning Hit,"Hopefully it wont be too long until they confirm and start shooting Season 2.

Also, while they've said that they don't want to do stuff beyond what we've gotten with the games, I honestly wouldn't mine some mini-series for some of the side characters. Bill & Frank, Henry & Sam, Tommy & Maria, Marlene and even Ish are all characters I'd be more than happy to see further explored, even if it's only like 4 episodes of 30 minutes each."
Game Winning Hit,"I haven't even played the games, only know the story, and am very excited for this.

On some level, you just want some good TV, and them staying true to the source is a great endorsement for that"
Game Winning Hit,"Is this just the first game, or does it include the second?"
Game Winning Hit,Can't wait for season 2 what a disaster DOA
Game Winning Hit,"No it doesn't. They didn't even keep the whole spore thing... Forced race swapping and odd choice of casting.  How is it faithful if the 3 main characters shown at the start aren't even the same race for starters?

What a snooze fest this first episode was. I was barely engaged, unconvincing characters, acting and world. Pretty cheesy.

Let's hope it'll change my view."
Game Winning Hit,Good. Now start working on season 2 so we won't have to wait 2.5 years.
Game Winning Hit,Like the Witcher was going to stay true?
Game Winning Hit,Me when I make a cinematic game into a cinematic show and nothing changes 🤯🤯🤯
Game Winning Hit,Nerds are going to be eating good in 2023
Game Winning Hit,"Stays true, but didn't they change the cordyceps virus to have ""tendrils"" instead of spores? You know, something fundamental to the world building and dangerousness of it that provides very specific moments of terror/stress the game and should/would have been perfect for the show?"
Game Winning Hit,"Looking forward to it, seems a little overhyped, and I heard they removed the fungal angle, and apart from the acting that was a really big part of the first game, gave the monsters a uniqueness and roots in reality which made it way creepier.

Cautiously optimistic tho!"
Game Winning Hit,Did a stuido finale figure out that maybe it's not a bad idea to stick close to the source material?
Game Winning Hit,All the whining about casting from Reddit but the trailer looked great.
Game Winning Hit,"Sure they are, all shows are great when reviewed by corporate shields, and then they come out."
Game Winning Hit,I’ll be the judge of that
Game Winning Hit,Reassuring. The game is a complete and utter masterpiece and I hope the show will do it justice.
Game Winning Hit,Pfft I’ll believe it when I see it
Game Winning Hit,I KNEW THIS WAS GONNA BE GOOD
Game Winning Hit,I’m so pumped for this!!!!
Game Winning Hit,"bUT eLliE dOeSn‘T lOok LiKe ThE cHaRaCtEr In ThE gAmE….

hate these trolls…"
Game Winning Hit,"The more journalists claim that, ""It remains true to the source material,"" the more I doubt it."
Game Winning Hit,"This revier, Gene Park, gave a positive review to she hulk. Take that as you will"
Game Winning Hit,"Stay true to game, literally first 10 mins Joel is mexican and his daughter is black"
Game Winning Hit,"How many episodes did they get to review? First 3? Whole season? 

I read a review earlier that said the shows great, but didn't really get the point of it. Just made me think they must not have seen the whole thing."
Game Winning Hit,Fucking paywall...
Game Winning Hit,Seriously considering giving this a watch. Always sceptical of Video Game adaptions.
Game Winning Hit,"Woah, an adaption of a franchise that *doesn't* butcher the source material?!?  

Are there really some good eggs in Hollywood after all?"
Game Winning Hit,Stays true to the game…..uh didn’t they replace the fungus?
Game Winning Hit,just like the game? so that means its a big as a lake but as shallow as a spoon? got it.
Game Winning Hit,Is this releaed weekly or is it all available from the release?
Game Winning Hit,I really want to read the review but that fucking login wall...
Game Winning Hit,I’m going to cry so good
Game Winning Hit,Hooray!
Game Winning Hit,"This is the one, this is the GOT breaker"
Game Winning Hit,Report | People So Desperate To Justify HBO Subscription Decide This One Checks Out
Game Winning Hit,Doubt.
Game Winning Hit,"I have a question but I don't feel like reading the review because it's 4 A.M and I don't feel well.  Does the opening scene make you cry like in the game, because I don't reust anyone that doesn't cry there?"
Lucky Days,"We'll see if they lose more people like you than they gain new people signing up.

They clearly think that this won't significantly hurt them."
Lucky Days,My biggest complaint is that the cost is already per device. It shouldn’t matter where the device is.
Lucky Days,"I sure wouldn't mind a 1 screen 4k option. As it is now, i just subscribe and unsubscribe in intervals because paying full price every month is too expensive for me."
Lucky Days,I travel for work. I shouldn’t have to tell Netflix I’m traveling. I should be able to just use my account.
Lucky Days,I will probably cancel. The price isn't worth it for one household when I can get both HBO and Apple+/Prime instead and even save a few bucks.
Lucky Days,"I just cancelled today.  I don't understand why they wouldn't just do what Steam does with library sharing; If someone is using the service, notify the second user that it is already in use and they'll have to wait.  Maybe the person who was using a shared password would get frustrated and get their own account."
Lucky Days,People have been threatening to leave Netflix for the past 3 years and yet they keep gaining subs
Lucky Days,Feel like I’m in stuck in limbo seeing these copy paste doom of Netflix threads
Lucky Days,"Every time Netflix does anything, this sub starts claiming they’re dooming themselves and they’re terrible at business, and then they do just fine."
Lucky Days,"They need more subs. This will almost assuredly bring that. If they can turn 1 sub in to 1.1 subs, then that is a success for them at this point, even if it means less revenue. For example, they would rather have two subs paying $7.99 each than one sub paying $19.99 just so they can show subscriber growth. They will recoup the lost revenue with incremental price increases.

It sucks, because I am 100% in agreement with you. I pay for 4 screens, who the hell cares who or where? The answer is that they have tied their value to subscriber growth. But then at least let me have 1 or 2 streams with 4k."
Lucky Days,Netflix is up to $20 and cable keeps offering me $40 deals. About to drop my Netflix and Hulu and just go back to cable.
Lucky Days,I’m in the same boat.
Lucky Days,"They lost me when the only option for a single screen at once was standard def only. I want 4K I still only need 1 screen at a time, not 4. Netflix can go fuck themselves"
Lucky Days,For those wanting to cancel because of this (myself included) we should all pick a specific day to do it and leave all at once. The cancelocalypse as it were.
Lucky Days,Problem here is that if this doesn't hurt Netflix it won't stop the others from doing the same.
Lucky Days,I remember when Netflix was the plucky underdog. The more money involved  in any organization the more about profit over everything else it becomes. Rip.
Lucky Days,"As for why the strategy is dumb, for starters it demonizes and insults loyal customers, and loyalty is everything in subscription model businesses.

It also falsely assumes those sharing will happily just sign up and pay.  You can't succeed doing stick only.  You need some carrot.  

Since they decided to break their other big promise regarding advertising, a smarter strategy would have been to make the ad tier pretty limited but free.  No sign up obstacles.  No silly $6.99 fee that they lose money on anyway.  The most successful streaming operation on earth does that.  It's smart.

Just a free very basic taste of Netflix, with ads.  

In an advertising model business, the one and only metric that matters is number of eyeballs.  Making it difficult to view and charging people is deliberately blocking eyeballs.  That's incredibly dumb on their part.  

A free, no-sign up Netflix tier with ads would have been one the largest advertising businesses on earth on launch day.  They would be making bank selling ads, instead of what actually happened, which was that they had to refund the advertisers money because of such low number of eyeballs.

And the whole tier would have served as a 24x7 commercial for people to consider signing up for paid Netflix.

So once they've made that smarter decision on the ad tier, you use that as your on ramp for the so-called ""password stealers"".  

You have them half signed up, so you've lowered that barrier of entry.  You flip them to your free ad tier, but with easy on boarding and generous promotional offers to any of the paid tiers.  They're halfway there.  They have logins.  You just need to tempt them (not vilify them) into inserting their payment info.  

Instead, they treat them like thieves and then expect them to hurdle both on-boarding barriers.

I've said it for many years.  The executives running Netflix are fools.  They got lucky being number one in a one horse race, but when the going started to get tough they resorted to deceptive stock market manipulation, misleading metrics, hiding material information, and dumb strategy after dumb strategy after dumb strategy.  They have the worst run studio in the business and the decisions they made would have bankrupted any other studio fifty times over.  They've survives only on the artificial gravity free environment of debt and other people's stock market money."
Lucky Days,Same. I've been on my parents plan since...forever. I'm not gonna get my own.
Lucky Days,"To be fair it is up to Netflix what you are priced for. I’m not throwing shade I do the same shit but it has always been against their terms and services to share accounts across households. You, like everyone else, were breaking the terms you agreed to when doing that."
Lucky Days,"We share ours with our daughters who live in other houses.  If they try to charge us for that we will cancel.


There is nothing that fantastic on it.  Hell I haven’t really watched anything on there in months.  My wife does watch some things on there but she’d be fine with canceling if we can’t share with our daughters"
Lucky Days,"The negative feedback was probably so big, Netflix removed all mentions of this new policy from their help page today. The only thing is you might have to verify a device via a 4 digit code they send per Email."
Lucky Days,">Netflix will lose me as a customer. This is really going to backfire on them. CEO is not smart for this one.

Considering your relatives didn't pay for years, they aren't going to miss you."
Lucky Days,"If you are paying for four devices to be shared, they are already registered and you should be able to use them wherever you desire.   
Watch the mass exodus."
Lucky Days,Then cancel and stop posting about it.
Lucky Days,"I will probably be killing my subscription.
That said, the rest of my household would all probably create their own accounts so Netflix will be ahead…"
Lucky Days,"Of course there are ""cheats"" who share across several households but I have no faith Netflix will accurately address these people and leave the rest of us alone. If I get a warning or an upcharge, I'm gone. I do not share across multiple households."
Lucky Days,I'm thinking of canceling my subscription. My daughter who's away for a month at a time uses it where she has to work.
Lucky Days,"Exactly my situation with my parents. If that can't work, I'll cancel and I'll maybe subscribe for a month every year or two to catch up. My parents already said they'd be okay with it cause they barely use it as well. 

I say bring it Netflix! Help me save money"
Lucky Days,"If you're paying for Netflix, you're a sucker. Everything on Netflix, and every other streaming service, is on Usenet. For less than $50/year you can download everything and share it with whomever you choose through Plex. To complain about Netflix sharing rules when you've already been getting shafted for years is LoL hilarious."
Lucky Days,Subscribe to a VPN and sail the high seas. (งツ)ว
Lucky Days,"This is exactly why I just canceled. I don't use it enough to justify subscribing for just myself, but I paid for the extra screens so my kids could use it (I don't even know if they do to be honest). Why not just change it to a family plan like YouTube and Spotify? This seems asinine."
Lucky Days,I'm in the exact same boat. I'm thinking I'll just start sending them 20 bones a month and they can start their own account.
Lucky Days,Netflix has done focus groups before announcing so they have a pretty good idea how most people will react.
Lucky Days,"What I don't understand, is that Netflix's whole schtick is ""gathering data about what people are watching."" So, can't they use that massive treasure trove of data to create pricing tiers based on hours watched? Netflix doesn't have to nitpick about account sharing at all. If they just charged people based on hours, the account sharing people would pay more. That would disincentivize sharing while still allowing it as an option. 

And casual viewers like OP can glean value from Netflix without getting shafted. 

And they ALREADY HAVE THE DATA. They just have to link it to pricing tiers. It would be fair to everyone, allow people to continue doing what they've been doing, and bring in revenue. It's a win-win-win."
Lucky Days,"Netflix seem to be under the illusion there are no other streaming options out there and/or that streaming is a necessity not a luxury. 

I'm in no way struggling financially but with a cable subscription, Amazon prime, Dropbox, Audible, Netflix and a couple of others costs add up and I'd set myself a budget for non-necessity services, dropping Netflix and switching to Disney+ means i can now binge watch all the Marvel movies and a load of new shows, win win.

Though whatever the press says we are in a global recession, there's increased poverty, more and more low to middle income families resorting to food banks. Whatever some think, Netflix is a luxury I think they'll continue to see subscriber numbers fall if they force this issue and continue their policy of cancelling popular shows simply to focus on new unproven ideas.

I've dropped Netflix after subscribing for 8 years after recent cancellations, the whole password sharing crap which only hurts low income families who were sharing accounts because college/uni students or parents/grandparents couldn't afford their own subscriptions and the push to further monetise remaining viewers by increasing prices and adding an advertisement driven subscription plan."
Lucky Days,I cancelled my subscription and set sail for the high seas as soon on as I heard it was in the offing.
Lucky Days,"I sincerely hope they lose a lot of subscribers. If their bottom line doesn't get hurt by this, it will encourage other streaming platforms to do the same."
Lucky Days,"Between this and Disney+ increase, I am going to do a full eval of my services. Netflix will be the first to go.

Netflix is biting the hand that feeds. The truth is, if they want more $, they need to expand services. Sell merch right from the service, branch into streaming audio and challenge Spotify, challenge Amazon and start to sell other shit.."
Lucky Days,"If they do that, I will cancel my subscription and start pirating their shows. And with that I mean downloading, not torrenting. Because that's actually egal in Switzerland.

Let's see if they reverse their decision or up the lobbying to make it illegal."
Lucky Days,"I have no dog in this but will say the strategy they're using here is dumb.

On the one hand I sympathize with customers who have been doing this after Netflix themselves encouraged them to do so, bragged about it, promoted it, promised to keep it, claimed it was a non-significant cost, etc.  Now they're treating their own loyal customers as thieves and overstating the impact?  That's slimy.

On the other hand, very few other subscriptions in our lives allow this kind of sharing, and we all know that.  You can't photocopy your gym pass for three other people around the country.  Your login is your login on most services.  Try logging in with multiple software instances at the same time and watch your account get locked.  So it's a little bit odd to expect password sharing on just one of our many services.  Absent of the fact Netflix promoted it and promised it as a feature, of course."
Lucky Days,I just hope that people are more than just talk with their boycott considering this subs track record... And that more people outside this sub finds it just as off-putting.
Lucky Days,"Just so you know, unless all four of you are watching at the same exact time, you should drop down to the lower tier. You don't need the 4 screen tier."
Lucky Days,Dude Darby is fucking crazy
Lucky Days,There's a reason Reed is leaving IMO.
Lucky Days,"I am the same, I hardly watch anything, I use it so I could share it."
Lucky Days,Waiting patiently for that ULPT on how to get past their rules
Lucky Days,"You are exactly right, my family will drop it instantly."
Lucky Days,"The last Netflix show that blew me away was Queen's Gambit. To think that was over 2 years ago now is insane! Seriously, Netflix does not produce enough quality shows ona consistent basis for me to keep a yearly subscription. The only reason I do is because I don't want to interrupt my family if they're watching something. Honestly Netflix is going to be saving me money."
Lucky Days,I am gonna cancel my account. Aint worth it with the shit content they have
Lucky Days,same... everytime you log in from different area.. i mean a lot are mobile users
Lucky Days,"I'm in the same boat. Only reason I paid for the 20/month was to share it was family. Been that way for a decade now? I'm not sure. I was one of the first to subscribe when they went streaming options. 

I'll still subscribe but I'll be paying their lowest, non-ad sub 10/month. I very much doubt my family will subscribe too. We'll see."
Lucky Days,"Said it before, I say it again, the moment im hit with a message about my password sharing I'll cancel my subscription"
Lucky Days,"There was a fight between 2 boys on the playground yesterday, so nobody can have recess the rest of the year...."
Lucky Days,I’m considering leaving Amazon Prime after prime music got a huge downgrade in functionality. You end up paying more money for less… so it’s worth reviewing whether it’s still worth what you’re paying. A lot of people are boycotting unnecessary subscription models these days.
Lucky Days,"From what you've said, I think Netflix knows this. What they are counting on is that, when you cancel your account, the people who do watch Netflix (like your mom or niece) will then be forced to get their own accounts. So, according to Netflix, by cancelling your account, Netflix will get two new subscribers. Whether that logic will stand remains to be seen."
Lucky Days,"For people, like me, who don't have a single home base this makes things very difficult.

It's not that uncommon.  I live in South Florida, and our snowbird population is huge.  They are all going to have problems with this, for example.

I also wonder how does that 31 days work?  For example, if I hit the road for a long trip, 31 days is likely enough for most of those, but when does the count start?  The first time I use the app outside my wifi?  That would be the best case, but seems unlikely.   It seems more likely you could get unlucky and that authorization check happens on day 3 of your trip.  What if I use my netflix to watch movies while I eat lunch at work or on the road?  Do I need to bring my work computer home every 31 days and watch some Netflix there?"
Lucky Days,"I'm with you. I will cancel if they go through with this. Someone should do a vote. I don't know how to make a poll on here but I'm super curious what people would say. Cancel, keep paying the steep price even if they charge more for other households, keep paying but kick of outside users by changing password, or open a new account (if you were one of the outside houses that shared but the buyer canceled or changed password)"
Lucky Days,"IF they do this. Then let me take my ‘login’ from y sisters account and copy to a new account that I pay for. If I cared enough, I wouldn’t want to lose my viewing history and saved for later list. 

I really only watch on my lunch break at work. Since I pay for prime and Hulu, im not sure it’s worth it for another subscription."
Lucky Days,"Been a subscriber since the days of DVDs and will cancel if I now have to pay more for multiple screens. I mean, it’s not Premium TV/movies. There’s less and less I want to watch."
Lucky Days,"I pay $20 for the 4screens, if this goes through, ill cancel my sub, i really dont even need it personally, it was always meant to share with family, i have a HACKED firestick with all those programs for free, thats why i cut my cable also"
Lucky Days,"I hope consumers just leave and forces them to revert this policy 

They need to find a way to balance their budget over trying to get literally every single person who watches them to pay them.
Netflix literally created this model and it’s hard to put the genie back in the bottle"
Lucky Days,I’m in a similar boat. I was thinking about cancelling then I got my parents and AppleTV for Christmas and my mom uses the account quite a bit. I’m thinking about going to a lower tier plan since their TV is 1080p and sailing the high seas for any Netflix content that I want to watch. If I pay for 4 screens it shouldn’t matter where those screens are located.
Lucky Days,"Probably going to cancel as well. I don't want to have to log in every 30 days, signing back in to stuff is a pet peeve. Between that and already paying for 4 screens enough is enough. Their programming has gone very back to basic and formulaic anyway. 

I canceled service back in the day when they tried to pull that separating into 2 services crap. They wanted 2 subscriptions if you wanted to order DVD's and stream. We signed back up during their golden period of quality programming. Probably right around when Stranger Things came out."
Lucky Days,I'm in the same boat. I pay for Netflix but don't use it that much. I keep it so my parents can use it
Lucky Days,"I was trying to figure how to make it work with the 'connect to the primary network once a month thing,' and initially it felt doable, but then I remembered I watch it on my PS console a lot, and there's no way in hell I'm packing that once a month to visit the person who's account I use lol. It'll be easy enough to do for my phone though. 

Besides, to be honest, I've felt for a while now that Netflix isn't worth the cost. There's so much bad content on there that it's a slog to find something worth watching."
Lucky Days,"they lost me, I only kept it constantly with a 4 stream plan because my niece and nephews in a different state watched it."
Lucky Days,"Hi - so about the new policy it seems people don’t fully understand what it is.

1. You can still share your password. Their new policy is making people _verify_ accounts every 31 days. There are lots of other services who already do this. I share my Hulu account with like 20 people and we constantly have to log back in because there too many devices.

2. Whatever devices you set as the primary household will not have to do this verification every 31 days.

3. Netflix has not specified what the verification process is - it could be like an MFA where someone gets texted a code that you have to input. Amazon Prime and Hulu already do this & it’s a common verification process."
Lucky Days,"My mom has the account that I use. She's up there in age and likely has forgotten she even pays for Netflix (It was always meant for me and my brother to use primarily). Once we graduated school she just kept (auto) paying. Both me and my brother live out of state and both of us are very occasional watchers (we're very busy with our careers). The day I log into Netflix to watch an occasional show as background noise and it shows I can no longer watch, is the day I'll proceed to cancel my mom's account. And that will be that. Netflix is insane if they don't realize they're tanking their own company doing this."
Lucky Days,Yea pretty much. My guess is the churn numbers will work out in the long run and short run may be less predictable
Lucky Days,">They clearly think that this won't significantly hurt them.

They may be thinking it'll benefit them long-term, even if it hurts short-term."
Lucky Days,"It's pressure from shareholders that expect growth.
But there is a limit to growth and Netflix kinda hit it.

Just be profitable and stable, but that's and how most companies think sadly"
Lucky Days,"Heres the thing.. **Netflix is expecting people to keep current plan (4 screen) $21 and upgrade to share but whats going to happen is people will downgrade to $9.99 or $15.99 (1 or 2 screens)  and others who are shared passwords will not subscribe like they believe.**

&#x200B;

The 4 screen plans will not be needed for millions of people once the sharing ends."
Lucky Days,"It's actually somewhat unclear what their executives think.  Netflix executives do some pretty reactionary things, then they use fuzzy justifications and dubious claims to support those decisions."
Lucky Days,"Well the problem is much of the modern corporate world is focused on short term growth - even if it harms the long term health. 

To me it seems pretty clear the current crop of executives are looking at boosting short term subscriber numbers to boost share price to make sure they get their contractual bonuses. 

They then leave the company and go somewhere else to talk about how amazing they are at Growth. Then some new schmuck will have to work it out. 

I imagine all the c level executives are looking to get out before stranger things finishes at which point im predicting some big issues for them. 

Their best hope is all the other streamers start banning shared accounts too."
Lucky Days,They will say that it was the Ukraine war again.
Lucky Days,"This really comes down to if people think netflix content has value.  They have increased their content spend by 10 Billion over the last 5 years.  

If people find value in that this will be a blip and people will moan, but sign up.  If the content isn't worth it people will cancel.

Today netflix is the only streamer who has a sustainable business.  Others are likely going to go down this path to some extent in the coming years."
Lucky Days,exactly
Lucky Days,I also don’t see how this isn’t going to make it hard if not outright impossible to use Netflix while travelling.
Lucky Days,"Same.  I hate having to pay for multiple screens just to get 4K, so I just rotate my streaming services, and only have 1 or 2 active at a time, watch anything that's highly rated on it, then move on to the next one."
Lucky Days,Thats smart.. I never did that only because I share and I think about them. But yeah I probably only need Netflix 3 months out of year and of course cheaper plan
Lucky Days,"I have prime and hulu and in the same boat.. prime is the best because free shipping but I rarely watch anything same as hulu. 

I literally be lucky to watch somethign on hulu every 3 months and prime once 2 months."
Lucky Days,"I have other ideas too, but yes you're right that soft restrictions work way better than their insane strategy of calling their customers thieves for doing exactly what Netflix encouraged and promised to support."
Lucky Days,I dont think thats a good idea. People dont want to wait. Netflix started off unlimited though
Lucky Days,"Did we forget that period of time in the last 3 years when the planet shut down and all people could do with their free time was stream shows, movies and play games.

Did we already forget?"
Lucky Days,Yeah that's what this discourse look like. Netflix is dying post are extremely old at this point and yet they keep growing. I don't think this will in any way endanger them. They'll lose subs and then regain even more like 2 quarters later.
Lucky Days,..because sharing is allowed
Lucky Days,Netflix has been threatening to kill password sharing since the end of 2021.
Lucky Days,"They'll unsub for a month or two and then hear that the new season of Arkane is good and there is some new show everyone is talking about, resub for a month, find something else they want to watch and continue to sub while they wait for the next Netflix outrage so they can comment how they are cancelling their sub again. Rinse and repeat."
Lucky Days,"Except that's not true.  They hit customer saturation many years ago.  Netflix execs deceptively started obscuring that by mixing in $4 overseas subs to pad the numbers.  Pandemic gave them a huge relief, but since then saturation and price hikes caused shrinkage.  

Even this recent murky ""gain"" they've announced will be the last time they ever release subscriber growth numbers.  You don't do that because you think the numbers will be good..."
Lucky Days,Astroturf PR campaign by the other major streamers hoping to burn out people's outrage over a policy they're going to adopt in six months.
Lucky Days,Yeah but look Netflix started at $9.99 and pushed itself up to $21 so now its a different ball game. People can only take so much punishment. Personally this is my first time complaining. The content always been ok not a reason for me to complain
Lucky Days,"Im sure the sub is full of exaggerations, but I disagree with ""Netflix is doing fine."" 2022 has been a rough year for the company : unprofitable quarters, the stock tumbled, subscriber counts dropped, lots of employees had to be let go and they have more competition than ever before."
Lucky Days,Squid Games will air S2 and people will flock back lol
Lucky Days,"There aren't more subs to get.  Not really.  Not good ones.  

Nobody you or I know who would be interested in Netflix isn't already signed up.  

And they've hit price levels that are making people want to cancel.

The true solution is to fix their broken studio and promotions, and to cut content costs.  

That would change the whole game for them.  Unfortunately their executives are incompetent and can't see that more surgical solution."
Lucky Days,"[Yes, you do that](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/noboycott.jpg)."
Lucky Days,"Very true but still a dumb move to piss off families worldwide. People will cancel because the audacity to enforce something like this while they already increased prices and originally had unlimited screens and made us start paying per screen.

&#x200B;

To many like myself its already been priced in and further increases will result in a downgrade"
Lucky Days,"Remember ""*Sharing is loving*"" ?

I mean, paid commission fanart is breaking the laws of fair use but no one prosecutes that because the bad publicity is not worth it."
Lucky Days,They will pro ably do it without warning next time which will cause panic and be an even worse reaction
Lucky Days,What do you mean? Obviously OP's 20 dollars a month is the only thing keeping them afloat.
Lucky Days,What would these entitled people whine about then??
My Dangerous Wife,Those stories of Pepsi promotions in the Phillipines were awful.
My Dangerous Wife,In law school we study this case in contracts. I was cold called to brief it.
My Dangerous Wife,I remember the commercials. I remember the case in the news.  And I remember collecting the points.  I turned this Pepsi points in for a Pepsi T-shirt and a Pepsi Beach Blanket that I still have and use to this day.  The blanket was quality!
My Dangerous Wife,"Not a bad watch, but they overpadded it to 4 eps, it couldve been 2 easy"
My Dangerous Wife,I remember seeing those Pepsi challenges in grocery stores when I was a kid. Every time I see those “Pepsi Half Time Show” during the Super Bowl I think of those corny challenge ads.
My Dangerous Wife,This was fun but it didn't need to be 4 episodes of 40 minutes each. They could have finished the whole thing in probably an hour. Each episode just repeated itself over and over until the last 10 minutes revealed something that would carry into the beginning of the next episode
My Dangerous Wife,The friendship these two guys have was the absolute best part of this show.
My Dangerous Wife,"Hoover free flights promotion was a marketing promotion run by the British division of the Hoover Company in late 1992. The promotion, aiming to boost sales during the global recession of the early 1990s, offered two complimentary round-trip plane tickets to the United States, worth about £600, to any customer purchasing at least £100 in Hoover products. Hoover was counting on most customers spending more than £100, as well as being deterred from completing the difficult application process, and not meeting its exact terms.

Consumer response was much higher than the company anticipated andwas disastrous for the 84-year-old company. Hoover cancelled the ticket promotion after consumers had already bought the products and filled in forms applying for millions of pounds' worth of tickets. Reneging on the offer resulted in protests and legal action from customers who failed to receive the tickets they had been promised. The campaign was a financial disaster for the company. The European branch of the company was eventually sold to one of its competitors, Candy, having never recovered from the losses, the promotion and the subsequent scandal."
My Dangerous Wife,Isn’t this what prompted The Simpsons episode where Bart wins an elephant?
My Dangerous Wife,"I just watched it.

It's an amazing story of friendship. Media often depicts spontaneous friendships like this as a sign that something bad will happen. One ends up being a psychopathic predator or something.

A few questions I have:

1. When they met with pepsi lawyers the first time, did the settlement offer pepsi made include the initial $700,000 they invested, or was it going to net profit for them?
2. Was it a bad strategy to ask for more money then. Like maybe pepsi would have seen through their charade and called them out for being sleezy grifters? I feel like they should have seen the whole thing as an opportunity to cash out at an opportune moment.
3. What exactly did Todd do? Is anybody worried he might have been into something maybe just a little bit shady? Or is this one of those hustler rags to riches stories that were so common in the 80s/90s."
My Dangerous Wife,The stuff about Pepsi in the Philippines was absolutely heartbreaking and the strongest part of the entire documentary. It sadly reminded me of how fruit ￼companies exploit so many countries and the poor people in them. ￼￼
My Dangerous Wife,Where's my elephant?
My Dangerous Wife,"What’s kinda funny is that Pepsi tried to relaunch Pepsi Stuff with Amazon in the 2000s (I forgot what year) where you could get dvds, cds, Pepsi products, mp3 download, ect. But it only lasted one year because it was a (amazing) mess! They put out a promo giving every member enough points to get a free song download, unfortunately for them they made it so you could refresh the page and get unlimited points. I ended up getting 50+ dvds, 20+cds, clothes, countless song downloads, and won 2 Zunes from daily contest. It was the best promo ever!"
My Dangerous Wife,Absolutely great and interesting series. Wish he got that jet though.
My Dangerous Wife,"Watched all four episodes last night. 

It’s a good laugh. Lots of light humour."
My Dangerous Wife,"Watched the first episode, but it just didn't hook me. I thought they were leaving out a lot of information about the two main stars backgrounds. So instead of finishing the series, I just looked up the court case results."
My Dangerous Wife,"Not a lawyer, im a regular dummy 

Can someone explain me why pepsi did put the zeroes and a disclaimer on the canada version?
I feel that was pretty damning as proof that they knew what they where doing"
My Dangerous Wife,"My issue here is that both *Leonard and Hoffman themselves knew* that no serious offer was intended by Pepsi: 

1) They both knew that the Harrier jet was not in the Pepsi Points Catalog. If you view the commercial you can see that its purpose was to introduce the Pepsi Points Catalog and show viewers some of the items they could redeem their Pepsi points for. That the Harriet jet was not in the catalog was a clear indication that the offer was not real (if there were doubt to begin with). 

2) Leonard went to insane lengths to research his idea. This included, among many other things, somehow actually getting in touch with a spokesperson for the Pentagon to ask whether Harrier jets were for sale. Yet the one piece of information Leonard never bothered to research was whether the offer was legitimate. Leonard easily could have contacted Pepsi and inquired about this, but he knew they would have told him the offer was not real (and this would have ruined his plan). 

3) Todd Hoffman says that when the commercial was shown to him he thought, ""I like what the commercial shows, which is false advertising."" You cannot, by definition, be a victim of false advertising if you know beforehand that it's false advertising. The fact that Hoffman immediately thought of the commercial as false advertising tells us that he knew it wasn't a serious offer. 

I also have kind of a hard time seeing Leonard and Hoffman (particularly Hoffman) as victims here, the way other people seem to. What happened to the people in The Philippines is heartbreaking, but Leonard and Hoffman were not suing on behalf of those people in the Philippines to help them out. Furthermore, Hoffman argues that Pepsi knew that children would think that the offer was real. But Leonard and Hoffman were not children, and they were not suing on behalf of any children who might have been duped by this advertisement campaign. 

Hoffman's argument was essentially this: Pepsi royally screwed over impoverished people in The Philippines, and also knew that young children in the United States would think this Harrier jet offer was legitimate. So the way to rectify this, the way to make all of this right is for Hoffman, a man worth many millions of dollar apparently, to receive 16 million dollars (half the value of the Harrier Jet), despite the fact that he suffered absolutely no harm. I just can't say I sympathize with this position a whole lot. 

John Leonard and Todd Hoffman saw this an opportunity to cleverly utilize what they thought was a loophole to exploit a large company, and it did not work because the law was not on their side. For all the issues being analyzed and debated, at the end of the day it's pretty much that simple imho."
My Dangerous Wife,"I liked it, but it was way too long. This could have been 1  sixty minute episode."
My Dangerous Wife,"This show was INCREDIBLY over produced. Whole story could have easily been like 45 minutes. 

I couldn’t stand the way they keep portraying the guy as some crazy kid with a dream. He found a childish and bad bad faith loophole for a stupid campaign and used a fortune try to exploit it. This isn’t like the guy who mastered Press Your Luck. Any child with access to that kind of money and guidance could have done done what he did."
My Dangerous Wife,"Just finished this myself. Being a kid of the 90s, I remember Pepsi Stuff and had gotten a couple of those items from the catalog, but had no recollection of the Harrier or this controversy. 

I was pretty shocked to find out >!John (and Todd) lost the case. Fine print being what it is, and there being none of it in the add make me think this was a bad ruling on Judge what’s her face. That should have ended with Pepsi getting John the jet or the cash equivalent to the jet.!<"
My Dangerous Wife,4 episodes of dude sitting by a jet in a hangar… “he didn’t win the lawsuit”. Now That’s false advertising.
My Dangerous Wife,I don't care how good this is. I'm not watching 4 episodes of what should have been an 85 minute documentary. Netflix needs to stop padding run times.
My Dangerous Wife,"The documentary itself was okay.  If you have nostalgia for the Pepsi Challenge, the points, and the Cola Wars, then you'll probably enjoy it.  Definitely should have been two episodes though instead of 4.

It really showed me two things though.  We absolutely deserve a good documentary about the Cola Wars, and what Pepsi did in the Philippines is absolutely criminal.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsi_Number_Fever"
My Dangerous Wife,Did this inspire the “where’s my elephant” episode of The Simpsons?
My Dangerous Wife,"As a Canadian, I always wondered wtf was happening with this because the commercial I saw *clearly* stated it was a gag, turns out that was just a Canadian thing."
My Dangerous Wife,In business school we covered the jet case but the Philippines part was never mentioned.
My Dangerous Wife,"I thought there were three holes in their story.

1. The kid maps out how to buy and store millions of cans of Pepsi and works out all of these warehouses and labor logistics but doesn't see you can buy points? Let's chalk this one up to dramatic story telling.

2. The kid calls the Pentagon and claims without evidence he was told he could own a (demilitarized) jet but never thought to call Pepsi and ask if the commerical constituted a legitimate offer?

3. They claimed to not lawyered up until later, but when the kid went to personally hand over the check he was sent with a paralegal. Wouldn't that mean they were already had some sort of legal consultation?"
My Dangerous Wife,"Like most modern ""desperate"" documentaries, this one was too long and full of insignificant  and useless detail."
My Dangerous Wife,"I was a Pepsi kid growing up. I still would argue given the choice I choose Pepsi. I remember finding out whenever the taste test trucks were, and going repeatedly to get the free swag. 

I saved up enough points and ended up getting a pretty slick black leather jacket. It didn't have a bunch of logos all over it, just the metal buttons were pepsi logos. I still think my parents have it at their place actually."
My Dangerous Wife,"I was surprised they didn't interview Judge Kimba Wood.  She's still alive.  Even if she refused to be interviewed, they should have said that, like they did with that other guy."
My Dangerous Wife,"It was a fun watch, and I do agree that it didn't really need to be 4 episodes. After watching it I think maybe it could have done with 3 but I really liked that the story was heavily focused on this unique friendship that from one person who had the drive and another that happened to have the money to make it happen. It was kind of like winning the lottery in that aspect alone.

For me it was also a great dose of 90's nostalgia. I remember the commercial and I especially remember the catalog. As soon as they showed the catalog I could remember holding it in my hands in the mid-90's. I collected the points and I also lived in a very remote small town and once a week I'd ride my bike up and down the road looking for bottles that had been thrown out of car windows to collect extra points. I don't remember every item I got, but I definitely had the wallet with the chain."
My Dangerous Wife,"*SPOILER*

As a creative type, it seems to me that this whole problem could have been avoided if the executives hadn’t decided to overrule the creative decision to make the number impossibly huge so “they could read it.” Reading it wasn’t the point. It worked to the extent that it did because the harrier jet WASN’T obtainable, and of course the non creative person didn’t get it and made a stupid decision to overrule the creatives. This happens all the time. So many great ideas have been buried or lost bc some vp doesn’t like a word or, especially, they think having humor in their spot will somehow affect the brand badly when almost every single time people will respond better to something that’s a little more human than just insisting your brand is perfect and has no flaws. If they say the harrier costs 753,967,746,998 points, they never get sued."
My Dangerous Wife,I’d watch it if it was not 4 hours long.
My Dangerous Wife,"That documentary is a case study in false advertising itself! It's very blatantly marketed as the guy who wins a jet from Pepsi. Unless you were familiar with the story you would assume from their promos and the four fucking episodes that he will win the jet. I wouldn't call it a spoiler to say he doesn't win it, I'd call it a time saver not to watch this trash. Its also a classic case of Netflix making a hour long documentary into multiple episodes of pointless filler.

 Don't waste your time watching this."
My Dangerous Wife,"Terrible documentary, almost entirely focused on stroking egos and desperately stretching out it's runtime. A 30 minute documentary without the bullshit could have covered it much better."
My Dangerous Wife,I couldn’t finish this. Zero reason for it to be four episodes. This could’ve been done in 90+ mins.
My Dangerous Wife,"As much as I hate corporate advertising, I promise you the reason I psychologically prefer Pepsi to Coke to this day has a lot to do with this ad campaign. And I totally don't think it's fair to promote the possibility of achieving a multimillion dollar prize and then not be willing to fulfill their promotional pitch. The guy shoulda got the jet."
My Dangerous Wife,Oh so this is worth seeing? I remember the Pepsi case.
My Dangerous Wife,False advertising? You mean like how Netflix said they would never have ads and now they have them?
My Dangerous Wife,"Here I was thinking that Pepsi was just a mediocre brand that tastes like ass; doomed to perpetual runner up status. 

Came to find that they’re a shady ass brand that scammed thousands of Filipinos and played on their hopes. Just ANOTHER bad taste in my mouth."
My Dangerous Wife,"Good documentary.  Great characters, great story, >!but the final 15 are just like and nothing happened.!<"
My Dangerous Wife,I’m fascinated that Red Bull gets in legal trouble for something as stupid as “it gives you wings” but there are so many other blatantly false advertising campaigns that go completely unchecked.
My Dangerous Wife,"Coincidence, or is this what the Simpsons episode 'Bart's Elephant' is based on?"
My Dangerous Wife,"I didn't even need to watch that show to know how it would end.  Pretty much if you have the money to fight them in court, you stand a chance of them settling.  If you don't, they will bury you in legal proceedings to the point you give up, and if you do succeed in getting them to settle, it won't be for much."
My Dangerous Wife,"Everyone commenting about episode length or not enough focus on the Philippines part is missing the point. 

This docuseries was as much about their relationship and the human element as it was about Pepsis false advertising practices. 4 episodes really gave time to dig into each person and showcase their relationship. I thoroughly enjoyed it, would’ve been boring and heartless if it was shorter"
My Dangerous Wife,I heard he got the jet it was just gutted and didn't fly. Guess that was one of those wild rumors like Marilyn Manson was the Kid on the wonder years and had some ribs removed so he could suck his own dick.
My Dangerous Wife,I loved this series.  Cyndi Crawford remains hotness!
My Dangerous Wife,"As someone who was an adult when this ad aired, *NOBODY* thought it was real. 

Everyone took as the joke it was intended to be and when we heard about the case it was taken for granted that the kid would eventually lose. Mostly because there was no way Pepsi could get one of those jets to begin with. It was also clearly humorous and humor has a very good track record legally, including the fact that the Supreme Court has ruled that parody is protected speech under the 1st admendment."
My Dangerous Wife,"The United States has laws around contests and false advertising to protect consumers, keep companies honest, and avoid fraud. A great topic to read about is the history of game shows going back to the 1930s when the US started making these laws because of fixed games including showing fake competitions without some sort of disclaimer.

The 1950s saw numerous scandals in game shows due to games being rigged to enhance ratings. These laws are often seen today in reality tv shows that have prizes. Game can't be rigged nor can you advertise fake prizes.

In no way did Pepsi nor the company contracted for the competition intend for the jet to be in the contest and it was a joke. However, the lack of a disclaimer is where Pepsi was at fault. Determining what was ""reasonable"" here is beyond the issue as Pepsi advertised real prizes with a fake one with no disclaimer.

I feel if Pepsi wasn't punished for that with some penalty, then is sets precedent that is going to hurt consumers. This judgement can be cited by any company arguing that a prize was a joke if you can convince a judge it wasn't to be taken seriously. If Pepsi can get away with a bad standard of not having a disclaimer for a prize that isn't real, then that's the new standard."
My Dangerous Wife,It could have easily been narrowed down to a 2 hour movie. So uninteresting.
My Dangerous Wife,"This was such a great watch, but I wish they left out all that fluff about skiing and Antarctica.  It was pure filler to stretch it out.  This should have been done in 3 eps, they still would have had a lot of fluff.

This is why I like the show Forensic Files compared to other shows like it like 48 Hours or Dateline.  FF just gives you all the facts and wraps it up in 22 minutes.  Dateline and 48 Hours do 42 minutes with half of that being fluff and recaps of what they just told you 5 minutes ago."
My Dangerous Wife,Also a great story on friendship.
My Dangerous Wife,Good show.  Pepsi totally messed up and owes that dude a Harrier.   Damn lawyers and big money bought that verdict.
My Dangerous Wife,I cannot describe how mad I was when they didn’t take the settlement.
My Dangerous Wife,Series was decent. Kind of wrapped up too quickly at the end. They should’ve stretched it out for another episode. Also those guys should’ve settled when they had a chance.
My Dangerous Wife,Fuck Pepsi welching ass shitty company
My Dangerous Wife,"But it wasn't false advertising. It was an obvious joke, and thanks to idiots we can't have jokes anymore.

This world sucks."
My Dangerous Wife,I enjoyed this mini series. Interesting story overall
My Dangerous Wife,"I remember that ad and I also thought I could really get the jet. Fuck Pepsi and all their products! Let’s grow the  r/fuckPepsi like a 
r/fuckNestlé"
My Dangerous Wife,That was so tragic. A printing error they didn’t honour. They should have paid out the jet and those poor people and chalked it up to bad luck. That would have stopped these issues dead. How a court cannot side with the people over the company here blows my mind.
My Dangerous Wife,It’s so bullshit that Pepsi didn’t stick to their word. Also bullshit that the judge ruled on summary
My Dangerous Wife,"Never thought I’d be siding with Pepsi on something, but here we are."
My Dangerous Wife,"I came for the interessting premise and wanted to see how it turned out. Was dissapointed by the ending so much because i actually didnt know - but i really enjoyed the show.

It was basically: ""The journey wasnt fun for the final goal, but for the friends we made along the way"""
My Dangerous Wife,I remember being taught this ridiculous case in an Australian law school.
My Dangerous Wife,More like pepsi takes 1 episode worth of content and drags it out over there mini series format
My Dangerous Wife,"I remember seeing the news regarding the Philippines. I also remember the original Jet advertisement. The one without the disclaimer. Still have it on a VHS tape actually. 

Not gonna lie I very much enjoyed the documentary, especially the scenes where the company heads smugly admit to taking part in deceiving the masses, shortly followed up by sudden retractions the moment they realized what they were saying on film didn’t benefit them. 

And all of them? Wealthy white men. 

Funny how that works eh?"
My Dangerous Wife,"I binged this Friday while dogsitting [my grandpupper](https://imgur.com/nVRqMUa.jpg) and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I was mid teens at that time and remember the original commercial and ensuing ""scandal"" came out. The Netflix series was informative, fun, and highly entertaining. One of the best docuseries I've seen lately!"
My Dangerous Wife,Is this another Netflix docuseries that would have been much better explained in two hours instead of eight? Or perhaps not at all?
My Dangerous Wife,I remember this. Even I was pissed for the guy.
My Dangerous Wife,"This was far more entertaining than I thought. And since I didn't remember the orginal story, was not sure how it would end. Todd is hilarious. What a great friend to have."
My Dangerous Wife,"Pepsi really pissed me off about all this, then I thought about it and every company has done something like this. Why do we keep putting up with this shit?"
My Dangerous Wife,Netflix should have made the Pepsi Philippines scandal the main topic tbh. I was too young to remember the Pepsi Points commercials but I did learn about the Jet drama in college. The whole story could have been told in an hour not 4 episodes lol.
My Dangerous Wife,This could have easily been a 30 minute documentary. Instead I wasted 3 hours of it going on and on and on and on.
My Dangerous Wife,Get this man his jets and the Philippines winner their 1million peso
My Dangerous Wife,Loved it!
My Dangerous Wife,No way that judge wasn’t paid off by Pepsi.
My Dangerous Wife,"Haven't seen the show or know how it ends.

Because the whole idea of trying to get a  AV-8B Harrier II is, quite possibly, the dumbest thing I've ever heard of.

If someone walked up to me right now and offered me one, I'd immediately talk to a lawyer about how the fuck I could legally sell it asap...if that's even possible and I doubt it is as if the person was secretly a foreigner from a country that's enemies of the U.S. I'm now guilty of treason and could end up in a SuperMAX concrete coffin prison.

1. This plane is *military* equipment. It's not a commercial jet.
2. It's unbelievably hard to fly. And arguably, it's a poorly designed plane as many crashes have happened even with expert pilots (not gonna lie though, it's cool af).
3. How the FUCK do I pay for fuel, maintenance, and storage hanger (with a LOT of security to keep terrorists out).

Seriously, this guy was insane to want this jet."
My Dangerous Wife,They totally fucked John but no surprise coming from another piece of shit corporation
My Dangerous Wife,They should’ve gave my man his Jet. That judge  was a corporate swine .
My Dangerous Wife,"Aqesome documentary, learned a lot about terrible things Pepsi has done. >!Even in this case, they got a judge that is pro big business and the ruling was awful, wouldn't fly today.!<"
My Dangerous Wife,And how biased the system is.
My Dangerous Wife,How about false media reporting and manipulation
My Dangerous Wife,What the docuseries proves is when u are big company u fuck over who ever u want
My Dangerous Wife,"Cool story, but they did an absolutely terrible job of making this documentary. When the first episode ended, I was like ""what the fuck there are 3 more? No thanks."""
My Dangerous Wife, Bored kid who knew a lot of rich people and got to indulge his wildest dreams. A normal person wouldn't be able to.
My Dangerous Wife,"Hey Iran, suck my free as balls dick!"
My Dangerous Wife,I absolutely loved that documentary. Was the judge bribed?
My Dangerous Wife,I remember Pepsi Blue being disgusting and sold for .35 at Stop and Shop
My Dangerous Wife,"The info about the tragedy in the Philippines was without a doubt the most important and interesting part from the docuseries.  

For the rest, it was pretty boring. If the guy has actually raised the 7M points as intended, then he would have my sympathy to get the jet. But he really didn't make an effort to get those points, he tried to outsmart Pepsi by using the info on the promotion catalogue to buy points but conveniently ignore that within it's content clearly has no jet."
My Dangerous Wife,"This story was dumb.

Could have been a single episode"
My Dangerous Wife,Yet another documentary that could have been 90 min. Stretched out to almost 3 hours.
My Dangerous Wife,Tried watching this. Have up halfway through. So much fluff made it painful to watch.
My Dangerous Wife,"I mean...technically yes Pepsi should have had a disclaimer.  While this is an entertaining documentary, these are two people trying to exploit what is clearly a joke and game the system and say ""Fuck you"" to ""The Man"".  In this case, Pepsi. Nothing more than that."
My Dangerous Wife,those two pepsi corporate fat cats? disgusting
My Dangerous Wife,This was so boring. I gave up
My Dangerous Wife,I lived this event. You were not supposed to take that offer of a harrier jet seriously. I got a jean jacket that got lost during college.
My Dangerous Wife,Most of it is aimed at kids or teens and affects brain development
My Dangerous Wife,Boycott Pepsi for the behavior in the Philippines
My Dangerous Wife,Imagine what government propaganda is capable of...
Two Fathers,"I agree, first 4-5 seasons were excellent. After that, it felt like they needed to keep increasing the intensity and made questionable decisions. This happens to many of these shows. 

The procedurals like Grey's Anatomy, NCIS, etc have it easier."
Two Fathers,"I watched every single episode of this series until the end. To me, it started to go downhill the Leviathan season and what they did to my Bobby Singer. I'm loyal, but I'm honest. There were ups and downs after season 5, but truly, the worst thing they could have done was what they did to Bobby. Ingents."
Two Fathers,"Yup. But I personally wouldn't have wanted it cancelled at season 5, cause we had some really banger episodes in later seasons (weekend at Bobby's comes to mind)  
 
So now whenever I do rewatches I go straight through 1-5, then start skipping around to the good stuff for the rest"
Two Fathers,"The problem with the show in the later seasons is definitely the over reliance on goofy characters. In previous seasons, demons and angels were considered a threat and could be imposing. Then in the later seasons, they become ineffectual comic relief. Every side character becomes a goofy caricature with an over the top accent. The people they meet are cartoons for the most part and the acting is terrible. Sam and Dean also become a bit goofy as well, especially Sam, who’s acting method seems to be simply a large variety of facial ticks and stuttering grunts. Jensen Ackles has too much charisma to be too bad, he’s always watchable but for the most part he becomes a goofy guy as well. The beginning seasons have comedic moments that are pretty good and used sparingly, but they really lean into it in the later seasons and lose all the horror that the early seasons had."
Two Fathers,Yes. I truly pretend season 6-15 never existed and just appreciate seasons 1-5 for what they are. It’s a great five season arc.
Two Fathers,"I was kind of obsessed at the time, and really worried they would cancell it before the planned ending on season 5. 

Although, looking back, I think the introduction of angels took a lot of the original charm, it was really good TV"
Two Fathers,"I definitely grew to miss that really dark aesthetic of the early seasons. I remember a later episode where they're with Rowena rounding up souls in this suburban Canadian neighborhood and it was *so bright* outside. Like distractingly so. 

(It was also one of the few episodes that was very obviously in Canada because the street signs were unlike any I'd seen in the US. But I digress)"
Two Fathers,"They jumped so many sharks, they had to reuse sharks."
Two Fathers,"The first season is rough. I love it, I have seen it several times, I can watch any episode but the first season is rough. Like Stargate SG-1 it takes time until it becomes a diamond."
Two Fathers,"You are correct and there is a clear reason for all of what you said: Kripke only planned the series to be 5 seasons. This is why people call the season 5 finale the “original ending”. But with Supernatural being CW’s most successful show, CW wanted the show to continue. Kripke obliged but he also stepped down as showrunner, and other people took over running the show post season 5. So seasons 6-15 is basically just repetitive season arc’s of fan service, whereas seasons 1-5 had a serialized story that all tied together. The only good thing to come out of seasons 6-15 is >!the confirmation that Chuck is God!<, a lot of fans theorized it before, but if the show had ended after season 5 we never would’ve known for sure."
Two Fathers,"It's a good example of how to transition from ""case of the week"" to overarching storyline in a seamless and exciting way. Still a B-show at best for me, but it was fun when I was a teenager! I never continued after season 5."
Two Fathers,"With these long-running shows that went downhill in the end it can sometimes be easy to forget there was a time when they were excellent, and that's why they ran long in the first place. Looking at you Arrow."
Two Fathers,I hate how they literally wrote in plot armor for them into the series.  It cheapened the whole series.
Two Fathers,The series originally was only planned for 5 seasons.
Two Fathers,"I always wish it had been cancelled after 5. It would have gone down as a great show, not hokey fan service. And maybe Jared wouldn’t have become so unbearable."
Two Fathers,I know people love this show I just don't see it.
Two Fathers,"I'm going through Supernatural now for the first time and I'm halfway through season 7 at the moment. I actually think season 6 is a contender for my favourite. Even though it's clear they juggled several plots that they struggled to interconnect, it has several of my favourite episodes of the whole shows, less Sam and Dean conflict (which was played out by that point anyway) and the best part: more Bobby. Bobby is far and away the best character in Supernatural, so having more of him was only a good thing. Season 7 is a noticeable downgrade.

There's a lot of season 1 and 2 that feels very simple, which is to be expected when you're starting a new show and building up a mythology. It's like early episodes of Buffy or The X-Files (and probably a dozen other shows), with the monster of the week format and finding out how to kill them. Kind of like a police procedural but with monsters. When they start to delve into heaven and hell, then I think it starts to hit its stride (Kurt Fuller is great). I'm a lot less interested when it's just constant brother drama.

The problem is that I don't really care about Sam and Dean (*especially* Dean) but some of the side characters are great. So far, I think the episodes and seasons focused on Bobby and Castiel are some of the best ones (which is why I like season 6 so much) and it's disappointing they didn't make the most of Ellen, Jo, Ash, Rufus and more."
Two Fathers,"Is it ""extremely good""? Or is it ""extremely good for a CW show""? There's a big difference. I remember this sub telling me *The Arrow* was 'extremely good', which caused all confidence in that channel to be lost."
Two Fathers,"More than 10 years since I watched those first 5 seasons and it's still a top favorite of mine.

Somewhere around season 10 was when I stopped watching it weekly. I caught up whenever I had a couple of episodes to binge. After 11 I didn't want to continue anymore. I started a rewatch during that hiatus and I was shocked to finally notice how far the quality had dropped with those later seasons.

After that I came across youtube clips here and there so I have a general idea what the last 4 seasons were like. I did watch the season 15 penultimate episode though and it was just complete garbage. The cgi was so bad the show looked like shit. It looked much better in the earlier seasons. And that was 15 years earlier!

I still watch Kripke's run every other year or so."
Two Fathers,Agreed. The story was told by the end of Season 5. Personally I hated the angels and especially Castiel who was played by an extremely bad actor. He was okay in 4 and 5 but anything after that involving him or the angels was tedious to get through. It was so clearly not working anymore that they wrote him out at one point but ended up bringing him back because of the backlash from (I presume) viewers who thought he was hot.  Sam was a bad actor too but the chemistry with Dean helped offset his bad acting even though I think he actually got worse as the show went on. Supernatural was a great show for the first 5 seasons but the other seasons and focus on Castiel tarnished it.
Two Fathers,"Yeah, there's a lot of good stories that could be told post-Season 5, but the post-Season 5 we got usually just did the worst possible version of each of those stories. Case in point, how do you go bigger than the devil? You could go with the living embodiment of chaos, the Leviathan. And post-Season 5 of Supernatural did that! ...But it wasn't just the one Leviathan, it was multiple leviathans, and they had nothing to do with the chaos dragon of lore or any sort of leviathan mythos really, instead just being virtually immortal versions of an enemy the brothers have already fought multiple times.

What gets me though is that Kripke was still writing on the show in Season 6. Yes, he was no longer the head writer, but he was still consulting, directly writing a couple of episodes, and was apparently okay with all of the lore inconsistencies and plot holes that Season 6 produced (unless he only had knowledge about the episodes he was working on and not any of the others).

Because of that and the low points of the Carver era, I think I would still be skeptical of a post-S5 new Kripke era even though those first five seasons were amazing."
Two Fathers,"While I agree that 1-5 amazing, there were a few standalone seasons that were also very good. I think it's season 11 where they are trying to stop Gods sister, and that was a banger. A redeemed Metatron trying to convince Chuck not to give up on humanity is peak Supernatural.

Of course, then they completely ruin that excellence with the plot twist involving God in the last season.

I think the show had two perfect series finales, S5 and S11. The actual finale got ruined by COVID, so I'd cut them some slack if the rest of the season wasn't terrible."
Two Fathers,"Money is a helluva drug. 

I pretty much tell anyone interested in the show “watch seasons 1 through 5, pause the last episode of season 5 at the end right when the camera is outside of the house, and pretend that’s where the series ended and 6-15 aren’t real.”"
Two Fathers,Is it just me who feels supernatural and Smallville are bizarrely similar in later seasons??
Two Fathers,"I would hardly call ""extremely good"", it was alright

the show was always B tier/CW silliness, especially after season 1"
Two Fathers,"Extremely good?  I mean come on.  They are OK.  Its a good thing to have on in the background while you're doing something else.  Its B level quantity over quality television, which is fine.  There's nothing really outstanding about it.  Its entertaining enough, but the writing, acting, cinematography, are all pretty meh."
Two Fathers,"It's difficult to recommend people to just watch 5 seasons out of a 15 season show on good faith. Yet new people will get a bit afraid seeing a 15 season show to pick up, specially one with so many episodes.

Loved those first 5 seasons and the whole 15 were good overall but gee, makes it difficult to recommend the show."
Two Fathers,"It's actually 2 - 5.  Originally, the brothers weren't meant to continue.  It was going to be a anthology series at first. Their chemistry on screen is what made them stop telling a story about the world with these characters in it, and more about these characters interacting with the world.  Also the budget significantly increases in the second season.  If you watch the end of Season 1, it ends with a car crash with generic ass music playing on the radio.  Season 2 starts and its playing a licensed Ted Nugent song."
Two Fathers,"It's a good YA show, but it doesn't hold up against other top TV shows. 

Swap Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki out for less attractive leads and the show loses a large portion of its female fanbase."
Two Fathers,Wasn't Ben Edlund responsible for the show's uptick (ha!) In quality on seasons 2-5?
Two Fathers,"There are a lot of good episodes in seasons 1-2, but I’ve always felt like the writers strike forcing a shorter season 3 was hugely beneficial. Made them cut out any filler and focus more on the larger plot.

Season 3 also gave us Ghostfacers, so on that alone it’s my favorite."
Two Fathers,"Some good with a lot of meh is a perfect description of the seasons post Lucifer prophecy aka season 6 and onward. I honestly enjoy the over arcing narratives of each season, but wow are there a lot of 'skip' moments in each season/episode. Basically any time Sam and Dean start arguing and then later make up became instant skip scenes. At that point they served no narrative purpose beyond starting and episode with drama and ending the episode with a flimsy disagreement conclusion that set them back to their basic positions. 


As a side note, im still annoyed with how they built up Eve, made super monsters, and then just brushed it all away in about 5 minutes of scene time.


While I personally didnt like the final confrontation, I was fine with the finale/ send-off. But yes the first 5 seasons are quite good and season 5 is one that I occasionally go back to and watch again. Mark Pellegrino was a fantastic Lucifer for the earlier seasons."
Two Fathers,I think there was a drop in quality after Eric Kripke left the show
Two Fathers,"Just finished a full series rewatch myself and I was thinking the same thing about the back ten seasons, but at the same time I really respect them just for going for it yknow?

A lot of people say they hated the Leviathans but honestly that whole ""arc"" for lack of a better term is probably my favorite just because it was amazing to me that they actually managed to find a new villain after the massive shark jump that was lucifer

And although it started to get stale after awhile everytime they managed to pull a new bad guy out of their asses I was honestly floored

Like when Dean massacred the house of frankstein that was pretty dumb, and when there was that one episode about the monster families that run Chicago that never came up again, I was rolling my eyes at that pretty hard but just the charm of jumping the shark and then finding a larger shark to jump over never wore off on me"
Two Fathers,"I put the writing of 1-5 of supernatural against any TV show, and it holds up.

I look at it as 6-15 is just a different show. 1-5 takes itself reasonably seriously, 6-15 is fun popcorn television."
Two Fathers,"I think the only season I skipped in full was season 10. My least favourite choice in the show will always be the dragon copout, too."
Two Fathers,"First 2 seasons were close to x-files ""monster of the week"". Then when we got close to the characters they added epic story."
Two Fathers,End last ep of season 5 as it starts to pan away from Dean having a meal with his adopted family and it's perfect.
Two Fathers,Dean telling Sam what he did while he was in hell is one of the best scenes in TV
Two Fathers,"Agreed... and disagreed. As much as I love SPN season 1-5, I wouldn't say I like how the female characters in it were written. Save Bela. Bela was fucking awesome.

Then again I also don't like how the female characters are written in 6-15 so... Yeah, I really don't know how to feel about the whole show regarding that."
Two Fathers,"I do agree season 1-5 are the best the show has I really liked season 6-11 and imo season 11 works as a series finale too.

12-15 while weaker I still liked them I thought god as the villian was cool but he didn't really do much in season 15 the whole bringing back old creatures was dealt with swiftly.

granted God being evil was abit left field 

the show finale while not the best I still enjoyed it"
Two Fathers,"Yeah Power creep, they beat the devil so the next baddie has to be more powerful, and then the next one, etc.

I still enjoy the later seasons for the monster-of-the-week episodes but almost all of the plotlines are weak."
Two Fathers,"I used to go on the subreddit and speculate how certain seasons would wind up, and I was always wrong because they would just keep getting more and more ridiculous and then a bigger enemy would emerge in the last episode and one of the brothers would disappear. That show had so much potential for good stories but it became fanservice schlock."
Two Fathers,"Near the end of the leviathan stuff is when I stopped, good to know I didn't miss out on anything."
Two Fathers,And then they brought Bobby back! Not the same Bobby but still! I’m guessing they got a lot of backlash killing Bobby off (and the way they did it) and found a way to bring him back and thought everything would be square lol
Two Fathers,"''The French Mistake'', ''Baby'' and ''ScoobyNatural''. Fantastic episodes."
Two Fathers,Seasons 1-5 are the Winchester Gospel. Seasons 6-15 are the apocrypha.
Two Fathers,"I actually didn't finish season 15. I got halfway through and gave up when I heard the ending had been horrible. I read the synopsis of the remaining episodes and it was just a weird way to end it. Having rewatched 1-5, it makes way more sense to stop there and pretend it actually ended there."
Two Fathers,And one episode was called jump the shark.
Two Fathers,"The problem with season one on streaming is that it’s the only season without the original music used in the show. So you’ll have moments of Dean rocking out to a rock song, but it’s the not the song that was originally in the show so they have to edit it weird."
Two Fathers,"After a quick scroll on IMDB i'll give you Bloody Mary, Hook Man, Bugs and Route 666 but I think the rest are watchable to great, even something like The Benders sets up the trope of human enemies always being gross bastards. 18 outta 22 ain't bad."
Two Fathers,Yeah it took a while for them to figure out the right balance of monster of the week with serialized story. As a whole it's good but you can pick it apart pretty easily episode by episode and ultimately the monster of the week stuff just falls short. The real redeeming factor of the show was that serialized story and you sat through the monster of the week to see the weekly 5 minutes of progression for the overarching plot.
Two Fathers,"We went to a Supernatural fan panel at a convention. It was our first con and we thought it would be fun. I forget how my husband ended up with the mic, but he said, well we all know Chuck is God. 

Holy crap was the response not what I expected. Half the room cheered in agreement, the other half grumbled and there were a few boos. One of the panelists wanted to know what led him to believe that. It was obvious she disagreed, and a guy in the audience went on about how how was a Christian and Chuck being God would be disrespectful to Christianity. All I could think was, do you even watch the show?

It was realty wild to see so many people refuse to believe it, and then the big reveal happened. I really liked Chuck being God. Everything after with his character was uneven to downright disappointing."
Two Fathers,The powerhouse they had at Thursday night I believe with Smallville leading into Supernatural made them a ton of money. It’s not surprising they would milk it even after the creators were out of story.
Two Fathers,"And that is why they were the best seasons. Still one of the greatest shows in years in terms of music and art direction. 

I get so angry about the Sera Gamble seasons. Big bad talked about in first couple episodes then forgotten and defeated in the last 1-2 episodes. 

Carver wasn't too bad. 

I popped back for the Men of Letters season when Mary was brought back.

Edit to add: I feel bad for everyone who watched it later via streaming after the original music was stripped out. The classic rock used went with the story in most cases and when it was switched it didn't feel the same. I can only watch it on bluray at this point otherwise there is much rage."
Two Fathers,"Honestly i disagree. While it obviously went downhill after season 5 we still got some amazing and fun episodes along the way up to season 15 that we would have missed. Like my all time favorite one ""The French Mistake"" in season 6. Just that episode alone makes Season 6 worth watching."
Two Fathers,"Extremely good for a network TV show, not just CW. If you have issues with network TV, those issues are still present. If you don't, it's a fantastic time."
Two Fathers,"You have a point, but I personally think it's just a solid show for any network (specifically season 1-5). There is a super cringe part of the fandom that overlaps with The Arrow fans that think that stuff was good. I gave The Arrow a shot after hearing the accolades and it was the most meh piece of TV. The latter years of SPN catered extremely hard to these cringe fans (where the early seasons actually made fun of them). I honestly think Twitter/Tumbler fandoms have ruined many shows because a show gets popular so creators turn to the internet to see what the fans are saying and the most hardcore ones are living there creating the absolute dumbest piece of fanfic possible with everyone praising it. 

The WB/CW was a good melodrama network for teens and young adults and then it turned into PG13 Nickelodeon shows."
Two Fathers,"I think post-5 Kripke was collecting checks and helping the team transition without him. I mean they literally kill him in one episode. After that, he seemed to just get residuals and drop in every now and then. The writing was just terrible after he left though. I know he didn't personally write that many episodes in 1-5, but his showrunning direction must have been what kept things grounded and on a consistent course. 

He seems to be running the Boys like he did SPN and I think that's making people anxious. A big criticism of The Boys season 3 is that it ended just like it started and nothing really changed, just a lot of build up for nothing. To me that's exactly what happened in season 3 of SPN with Dean actually dying and going to hell. He seems to still write like he would for a network TV show instead of a streaming service, and he's said that he's planning to go to season 5 with the Boys. I think he's got good ideas and knows how to string stories along to keep them interesting until they can reach a final episode and come to a conclusion. I'd bet he'd be able to develop a well rounded epilogue to season 5 SPN if he got the chance."
Two Fathers,"For me the only stand-out late season was 12, when the villains went from being angels and demons to just… the English. Such a weird choice but I enjoyed the change."
Two Fathers,1000%
Two Fathers,Probably cuz they reuse the same local Canadian actors.
Two Fathers,"You gotta treat it like I did Arrow. It was a shame they canceled it after 2 seasons. I still have such rage over black canary in s3e1.

It's such a shame SPN got canceled after 5 seasons."
Two Fathers,"You just have to explain to the people that you're recommending the show to that it's not really a 15 season show. It's more like a 5 season show with a 6 season sequel show which has its own 4 season sequel show. And the sequel shows just retained the title of the original show. But you can jump off at the end of Season 5, the end of Season 11, or the end of Season 15 and still get a full story."
Two Fathers,I wouldn't call Bad Moon Rising by CCR generic ass music.
Two Fathers,"I think the anthology series was an idea that got dropped before the pilot even shot. Kripke wanted the scary stories to be front and center with a couple of reporters going around capturing them, but when the studio disliked that he pitched the idea of them being brothers. I think he fleshed out a couple seasons at a time, waiting to see if they would be able to continue before writing any cliffhangers."
Two Fathers,"Maybe. I followed Padiwhack over from Gilmore Girls. Mainly, I was there for the monster of the week with the supernatural twists. Horror is my bread and butter. 

Even better was the classic rock music. So much good music in those early seasons."
Two Fathers,"Yea, and he stayed until season 8 but I think he worked better with Kripke there than when he wasn't."
Two Fathers,"OMFG, I swear it's because Sera Gamble forgot who her big bad for that season was. So much potential just forgotten."
Two Fathers,"I've never really understood this criticism about the female characters. I understand that many times there was a ""damsel in distress"" type character week to week that Dean usually hit on (especially in the early episodes), but they never seemed purposefully written to be a bad stereotype and his advances were usually batted down and he was made to look like a fool.

Jo and Ellen showed up early in the series and appeared a number of times. Each time they held their own against the bad guys and all of the male characters seemed to respect them.

Ruby and Meg were both demons and did demon things and it never seemed like they were written poorly (just maybe acted poorly at times).

Sheriff Jody Mills helps defeat the bad guy after her family was killed.

Bela was well written and beat the guys quite a bit.

These were all season 5 and earlier characters. I think the overall issue is that there wasn't a prominent female character that lasted a long time. Most of them showed up every now and then, but not like Bobby, Crowley, and Castiel who were often in episode after episode. There's only so much room for the regular cast and they'd already settled into a very male-centric show. Two brothers + dad, then two brothers + Bobby, then two brothers + Bobby and a male angel, then two brothers + Bobby and a male angel and a male demon. They seemed to try to rectify this with Rowena and Mary later on, but those episodes were already meh. The crux of the matter is that the show started off as very hetero-focused with Dean being a womanizer. So any woman that was introduced was already being ogled at by one of the main characters. Dean even sleeps with an angel in one episode and Sam sleeps with a werewolf in another episode. The early seasons had women showing up who would eventually swoon for the main characters, except for the ones I listed above. So I think instead of bucking that trend, they just didn't put effort into casting a series regular woman in any role."
Two Fathers,"I loved the series throughout the entire run, but the power creep was pretty hilarious.

They kill literal death, and eventually they kill the actual omniscient omnipresent God, despite having no actual powers. 

Puts DBZ to shame."
Two Fathers,"Until eventually they literally killed Death, Lucifer, and even God. It got pretty silly (I still enjoyed the later seasons, but I also know they were ridiculous and not as good as the beginning)"
Two Fathers,"The extremely meta ""The French Mistake"" in Season 6 is one of the best episodes of a show taking the piss out of its actors, storylines, and fans. There's a reason those gifs are still used today."
Two Fathers,"Yeah, that's when I called it quits as well. The leviathans were hyped up so much, then were completely depowered by the end of the season. The first red flag was when they pulled that same shit with Castiel already."
Two Fathers,Just think; that's about half way through the series. Woof.
Two Fathers,"The single thing I recommend going back for is the Scooby-Doo crossover because it's a standalone.

No, seriously."
Two Fathers,"So much rage over what they did to Bobby.

Flames! Flames on the side of my face!"
Two Fathers,"I used to show friends who weren’t sure if they’d like the show 3 episodes: Mystery Spot, Ghostfacers, and French Mistake. Always a big hit."
Two Fathers,This is perfect. Love it.
Two Fathers,The season 5 ending is the highest rated episodes of the show. The season 15 one is the 3rd lowest out of all the 327 episodes lol.
Two Fathers,"I watched season 6, eventually. My husband watched every episode. Occasionally he would have me watch episodes that I would 'love' and he was mostly right - if I treated it like fan fiction and not canon. Scoobynatural was HIGHLY entertaining."
Two Fathers,I cried during the last episode. It seemed like the perfect sendoff to me. YMMV
Two Fathers,Bugs was the very first episode I watched haha
Two Fathers,Rob Benedict confirmed that Chuck is God back in 2011 at a convention. He even said that Kripke and other writers/producers asked him how it felt to play God.
Two Fathers,"Season 11 had Metatron call Chuck God's meatsuit and that the nebbishness of his personality belonged to Chuck, not God. To me that leaves the door open to either interpretation.

Either:

1) At the beginning of time God knew how everything in the future would play out, knew when the apocalypse would be triggered, and created his angels with the name of a ""prophet"" on the inside of their eyelids that he always knew he would disguise himself as one day. Then when it came time for that ""prophet"" to be born, he paused the prophet-creation mechanic so that no new prophet would be born during Chuck's lifetime, blinded the archangel who was assigned to watch Chuck so that he wouldn't see that God was letting himself be born as Chuck (or came into being as an adult Chuck and simply rewrote Raphael's memories so that he didn't realize he never watched Chuck being born and growing up). And then he pretended to have headaches to pass himself off as a prophet. Then after Raphael had died, he continued pretending to have headaches when no one was around to see him simply because he had gotten that into the character of Chuck. He then left Earth for a while and restarted the prophet-creation mechanic. Then he returned to Earth, had sex with some of his creations that he considers his children, eventually talked to Metatron, and through his conversation with Metatron decided that he wanted to be a writer who told the truth. So he helped the brothers defeat Amara (but possibly lied about Gabriel's death), and then left Earth with her for a while. Then he came back to Earth and decided he instead wanted to be a writer who lies in order to be the best writer of all time. He cooked up ways to torture the brothers, but even though he was able to foresee the apocalypse at the beginning of time, he couldn't foresee the brothers' plans to defeat him. And then the brothers left him alive even though he still has all of his knowledge of magic and powered-artifacts that would let him return as a threat in the future.

or

2) Chuck was an actual human prophet that was born to human parents. His name was written on the inside of the angels' eyelids from the beginning of time. He helped the brothers, and in the Season 5 finale God began using him as a vessel. God began taking on Chuck's memories as his own and pretending that Chuck's experiences were his experiences. When Metatron confronted him about this charade, he led God to the conclusion that he didn't want to be Chuck anymore, he wanted to be a writer who told the truth. So he helped the brothers defeat Amara and then merged with her at the end of Season 11. God's light softened Amara, allowing her to appreciate creation, but Amara's darkness corrupted Chuck, feeding his ego and narcissism, and allowed Chuck to gain control of God and his powers. So now instead of God pretending to be Chuck, it was Chuck pretending to be God. And Chuck had no qualms about being a writer who lies if it meant he would be recognized as the greatest writer ever. But because Chuck isn't God, he didn't have full access to all of God's powers. He wasn't able to see how the brothers would defeat him. And once he was defeated, he didn't have God's knowledge of magic or artifacts that would allow him to become a threat to the brothers ever again.

Personally I think the second option makes more sense and gives the story a better conclusion, but I think people are welcome to go with the first interpretation if they choose.

That said, Kripke confirmed that Chuck wasn't always planned to be God. They were still trying to figure out how they wanted to portray God when they were writing the back half of Season 5, and Kripke confirmed that God hadn't appeared in the show yet at that time even though Chuck had appeared in Season 4 and three episodes of Season 5."
Two Fathers,"Oh the catering to fans really killed Arrow for me. I ended up tapping out. 

And yeah. Becky hilarious.  The musical lame."
Two Fathers,I think this might be why. Thanks!
Two Fathers,"For streaming, they swapped it with Backwater Rising by Tom Coerver.

Two Fathers,"Okay, I don't know about you but I feel like you and I watched 2 different shows. Spoileeeers.

>Jo and Ellen showed up early in the series and appeared a number of times. Each time they held their own against the bad guys and all of the male characters seemed to respect them.


In what sort of ways do you say they held their own?

Jo's first appearance was good but she didn't face off against any bad guys. Jo's second appearance had her kidnapped before Dean and Sam save her. Then she agrees to use herself as bait while the our two heroes trap him in a ring of salt. Third appearance has Meg tie her up and continually harrass her before Dean saves her. The only thing she does in the episode is save him from drowning but that's about it. Fourth appearance has War making her think a demon entered her mother and finally, she shows some combat skills, but she doesn't end up using them against any bad guys. 

And finally, fifth appearance has her finally showing that she's all grown by... once again using herself as bait and Sam and Dean go to steal the colt back from Crowley. Now, she does end up saving Dean but she never manages to kill either of those two dogs, her mother did. She may have been the one who gave the idea of having them blow up the shop while Sam and Dean leave but that's way too late and it was while on her deathbed.

Jo's whole arc is that she wants her mother to see her as a full fledged hunter. As someone who can take care of herself without her mother needing to babying her. But we don't get any sort of acknowledgment from her.

Ellen isn't any better. Good first appearance but no bad guys. Second appearance has her decide to go with Bobby, Sam and Dean before Jake Tally decides to use her as a hostage make her turn her gun to her head. She's does end up helping Bobby close the gate of hell but that's about all she does in that episode. Third appeareance has her being held down by her own daughter and after she managed to overpower her, she runs back to storage and leaves Sam with Jo and Rufus.

 And then there's her final episode. She may have been the one to take out the dogs but it was too late.

>Ruby and Meg were both demons and did demon things and it never seemed like they were written poorly (just maybe acted poorly at times).

 I'm not so sure about that. Yes, they were fine. But when you compare them to someone like Crowley, especially Ruby, it becomes clear that they only had one goal in mind. They never seemed to be fleshed out like he was.

Meg 1 and Meg 2 were fine.

Speaking of the demoness(es?), one thing I've noticed is that whenever a(male) demon is shown to be tortured, that almost always have their clothes on and mostly shown bloody and beaten. However, when Ruby is held by Alastair, she is shown naked with only a metal bar covering her nipples, much is the same way with Meg.

Jody and Bella were fine, I guess.

Female (recurring) characters you have mentioned from kripke era:

>Becky

A caricature of an obsessive fangirl. There's nothing nice to say about her.

>Anna

Man, did she get shafted soooo badly. I'm fully well aware of her potential and that her role was taken by Castiel because he was the fan's favorite but if there's any female character that was poorly written, it's her.

There was a post on SPN subreddit that explained what was wrong with what they had done to her. Here it is.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Supernatural/comments/101mfyo/anna_was_done_so_wrong_on_this_show/

>Lisa

She is there to primarily suit Dean's needs after what happened to Sam. As opposed to all the other love interests, she is not fleshed out well enough. Main thing out her is that she has a son named Ben, who's probably Dean's, had a one night stand with Dean and that's about it. Heck, we're supposed to believe he fell in love with her but we barely know anything about her. 

I don't mind having love interests but the fact that they're there primarily to suit them, never having their own arcs and struggles and even if they did, they just  aren't as complex as the other recurring characters were at when they were at season 5(Cas to Anna, Crowley to Ruby and Meg).

And that would leave us with 1 good female character, 3 evil female characters. Of all those four, only one of them lived on and it wasn't a love interest. 

That's my problem. Love interests are shown from the first episode to either die from being involved with the Winchesters(John to Mary, Sam to Madison and Jessica and Dean to Anna(although that was more of Castiel's fault))

And if you want a much more egregious example look no further further the finale, Sam's love interest is never shown her face. The mother of his children shown out of the shot because... uhhh
Ummm..."
Two Fathers,[deleted]
Two Fathers,"It's so hammy and campy it's incredible imo. I loved when the show was more ""grounded"" but I equally love it for going so hard off the rails while being self aware and REALLY committing to it. 

What other show has done that?"
Two Fathers,">!And the end was a slap on the face - to have plot armor throughout the series to die a stupid death to a usual monster. Yeah, I know the meta story, but the point is, deaths are cheap stake - which is why action genre is considered low, whereas other stakes are harder to develop and pay off. And to use sudden character death in the last episode is terribly cheap!<"
Two Fathers,I liked how they depowered them in the last episode or 2 of  season15 but it felt like that could have come way earlier in the show to get them back to fighting more normal monsters.
Two Fathers,"Yes, but can the brothers defeat a nail in a wall?"
Two Fathers,"Hey, they were super powerful with a devastating weakness for … common household cleaners."
Two Fathers,Hey it’s Tuesday! Pig’n’poke!
Two Fathers,Yellow fever along with those 3 are some of my favorites
Two Fathers,"That's ridiculous, lol. Can you imagine a world where seasons 6-15 didn't exist? With SPN having ended 13 years ago and just been one of those shows that faded into maybe cult classic like status? Going out on the highest rated episode of the series would have been great and people probably would have been discussing a potential continuation for the past 13 years. That's when you get them back together and you pick up with a limited new story and the whole point is to finally get Sam out of hell. Instead, they brought him back before the episode ended."
Two Fathers,"And you didn’t quit there and then? I don’t think I would have been so strong, that episode is ROUGH."
Two Fathers,"Rob Benedict would say at conventions that he thought Chuck was God but he never said yes or no for sure.

The convention I'm talking about was in 2013"
Love Cuisine,There's a chance Netflix might renew the contract now
Love Cuisine,"I watched the Houston episode tonight, and was surprised to see the alert that it was leaving. I’ve always meant to get to the whole series. Surely his work and legacy will become more accessible now that it is finite. "
Love Cuisine,Wait why is it leaving Netflix?
Love Cuisine,Only the Layover series and season 2 at that is on Netflix in the UK which is annoying. Was hoping to binge this weekend.
Love Cuisine,"I would watch it, but knowing he took his life makes it too depressing."
Love Cuisine,"The harsh truth is that there is maybe two or three good episodes of Parts Unknown.  Lyon, San Francisco with the Jiu Jitsu guy, and maybe the one in France where he screws around with the guy that found his hanged corpse a year later.  The rest is fake elitist trash.  The first several seasons of No Reservations is far superior."
Love Cuisine,[removed]
Love Cuisine,"Would not be news if he hadn’t just kacked it. You’re profiting off a mans death. Granted, you’re profiting in internet points ... but still."
Love Cuisine,"I could be wrong and have never been able to find a good source for Netflix contracts with content providers, but I seem to recall it made it on to one of those “Here’s what’s leaving Netflix next month” lists last year and ultimately did not. So that’s hopefully a positive indicator. "
Love Cuisine,"Yeah, you would think they would if they are able to."
Love Cuisine,Contract is expiring probably 
Love Cuisine,"It was planned for a long time, the deal expired."
Love Cuisine,"I disagree that most of the show is shit, but I do think No Reservations was fantastic and am surprised more people don’t talk about that one. "
Love Cuisine,"I'd you don't mind me asking, what do you mean by fake elitist crap?"
Love Cuisine,Having only seen the Nashville episode it was definitely elitist trash. 
Love Cuisine,[removed]
Love Cuisine,At least put the effort in
Love Cuisine,"Fuck him for being the one to inform us, right? What an asshole..."
Love Cuisine,Yeah of course it wouldn’t be news if he hadn’t just died. Have you only just this second realised how the world works? 
Love Cuisine,I know someone who used to work at Netflix negotiating their international contracts and not surprisingly they’re pretty complicated. If Netflix knows what’s good for them and to honour Boudain they would work to extend or renew the contract.
Love Cuisine,[removed]
Love Cuisine,I’m not saying he shouldn’t have posted it ... I’m just pointing it out.
Love Cuisine,[removed]
Love Cuisine,Kind of like when a two year old points out a car.... yeah we know 
Love Cuisine,"Fair enough. At least in my case, im OK with it."
Love Cuisine,Yeah but I’m way cuter than a two year old.
Love Cuisine,"If you really want to get in Bourdain's mind you need to read his books and watch his other series No Reservations, A Cook's Tour, and the Layover. Parts Unknown is a good start but he is an experienced presenter by then, and you sometimes don't get the raw truth like you did in his old shows and books. "
Love Cuisine,"My favorite Bourdain moment was when he was I think in the Philippines the local guide has taken him to a street where the whole community is coming together to make a meal. Bourdain is just watching in awe and the guide mentiones: ""I thought you were going to be a New York blow hard"" But you actually seem excited for this. And he was. They were making a stew. 

The other is an episode in the south of the USA where a lot of farmers come together and they have him shoot a pig. Not knowing, he will be eyeing the blood sausage and blood soup. They turn that pig in to brilliant dishes. But he hovers around the one dish they probably didn't expect him to."
Love Cuisine,Pretty sure Bourdain wrote the dialogue so it was truly narrated in his voice. Has Attenborough done the same?
Love Cuisine,Thank you for the suggestion. I'll look into it! 
Love Cuisine,To be honest with you I haven't got a clue? I imagine he has had some input (at least) to it as he some times actually out there? 
Love Cuisine,To add to that list kitchen confidential TV show with Bradley cooper 
Love Cuisine,"It's now on the list, cheers!"
Love Cuisine,"Man Seeking Woman - Lizard 
Mary Tyler Moore - Chuckles Bites the Dust
South Park - too many episodes to name"
Love Cuisine,"The Hug from Gumball does cringe humor so fucking well, One of the funniest episodes of any cartoon I've seen. The Tent scene had me in stiches "
Love Cuisine,Stress Relief is one of the funniest episodes of any show I've ever seen.
Love Cuisine,"That 70s show: ""Can't You Hear Me Knocking"".

Red reluctantly agrees to take Kitty ice fishing, which doesn't turn out to be as bad as he expected. Kelso accidentally makes a threat on the President, prompting the guys to be paranoid about everyone they meet in an attempt to hide from the government. Donna takes Jackie to a karate lesson that yields unexpected results.

Love Cuisine,Only consider the episodes I put above 
Love Cuisine,Yes. Like any of the others?
Love Cuisine,"No, the only episodes nominated are the ones in the post "
Love Cuisine,Only for the episodes above 
Love Cuisine,I saw that. I don't watch the same shows you do so wanted to point out some new episodes you may want to watch for true belly laughs.
Love Cuisine,I do what I want!
Love Cuisine,"Ok, thank you. Do you like any of the episodes I listed?"
Love Cuisine,"For pure laughs, that Taxi episode is killer! I still watch that DMV scene from time to time when I need a laugh."
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"Liked the first episode, will continue watching. 

Better than night court for me."
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"Would you say it's at all better than the previews? Because I made the decision not to watch based off that, it looked absolutely terrible which is a bad sign when you're trying to put your best foot forward."
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,It worked better that I thought it would after watching the trailer. Nothing I found hilarious or even really funny but it had enough charms that I'm willing to give it a few more episodes to see where it's going.
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,I'm really enjoying it!
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,Animal Control is so bad it feels like it should be a weird B-plot background show in a much better quality show.  The characters all fell like they came straight from a book on writing comedy.  The dialogue feels like it's filmed one line at a time instead of characters actually talking to each other.  The entire premise is the same as every other quick to fail comedy.
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,It’s embarrassingly bad
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,It’s better than all the Chuck Lorre comedies all over the networks which means it will be canceled fairly quick.
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"I thought it was a solid pilot with some great character development in just a small period of time. Laughed quite a bit, so I hope it only gets better from here."
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,I mean it's a network sitcom and it feels like it. I didn't dislike the episode I saw but let's see what happens.
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"The first episode didn’t feel like a 1st episode, it Felt more like an episode 2 or even the second half of a 40 minute episode. 

I’d say it was rough but felt like it could be a decent show much like Sirens, a comedy show about emts dealing with all sorts of calls much like how this show is setup. Drew the comparison because of how similar the “new guy” felt to Sirens’ character Brian, both characters/actors have a very similar upbeat style to them.

Mostly watching for Joel Mchale but I can see this show being a season 1 and done. Had to look up if this was on the same network where he did “The Great Indoors”, canceled after 1 season, but it’s not and at least this show doesn’t have a laugh track."
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,I really like it so far
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"I didn’t dislike the new Nightcourt like I thought I would. Nothing will ever live up to the depth the original had. I feel like if they just did what Law and Order did with it’s reboots and title it differently like, Nightcourt LA or something it’d probably be a lot more palatable."
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"I found the first episode to feel very forced.  Something seemed off and it felt like none of the characters had any chemistry.   

But it’s a comedy so may take some time for then to grow into each other"
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"Yes and it was head and shoulders more funny than the first episode of most comedy shows. It’s always sunny, the office, parks and rec just to name a few; their first episodes were not funny stand alone. It took quite a few episodes with a few of them being outstandingly hilarious to even get into the shows, then after being familiar with the humor in the show the first episode for those shows gets a few chuckles out of me."
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"I loved the first episode, the 2nd episode sucked but I’m already hooked so I’ll keep watching."
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,I can’t believe how truly bad it is and I feel like a crazy person seeing all the praise for it. So thank you
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,That makes a lot of sense as most of the bad takes on the show I see are on their social media ad commenta
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"Show doesn’t need a laugh track with Michael Rowland he and Vella Lovell as Emily are who make the show hilarious. Knowing some of Rowlands regions stand up adds to the halarity, his character having been used to be a pro snowboarder maybe the funniest and most outlandish backstory to a network sitcom character ever."
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"Halfway through episode 1 and I couldn’t stop comparing it to Sirens. It feels eerily similar because of the “rookie” character. Excruciatingly dumb, but extremely lovable. But so far it seems Joel McHale’s character is just Jeff with a different background.

But for now it’s entertaining enough so 🤷‍♀️"
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,Bruh they actually brought in the actor from Sirens! I couldn’t believe it when I saw him - Bob Fisher was a creator of both so the similar character relationships of the gruff asshole and lovable idiot make a lot more sense - as well as the cameo lol
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"I like that idea of a different court in a different place. Maybe Dan retired to Vegas or something.

I can't get behind the lead or the bailiff on that show. They both are terrible actors, but I like the rest of the cast. I keep seeing so much praise for it and I'm scratching my head wondering if people are really watching it for what it is now, rather than what it could be.

With Animal Control, I had no issues with any of the actors, and I even already like them all after 1 episode. I like the boss from Mr Mayor, I think she was better in this show than in that last one with Ted Danson (she had a few great lines in that). I already like the rivalry between precincts, and I like the setup that every episode will have an interesting animal encounter."
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"Highly disagree on Always Sunny, they have one of the funniest pilots imo. The show was still finding itself (Dee was so much better when they made her as deplorable as the rest of the gang), but the first season is still better than most comedies."
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"It's Always Sunny pilot was, and still is, hilarious to me and a lot of other people. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean that's the consensus."
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,Did the second episode look too shaky to you? Like handheld shot on steroids. It was very distracting.
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"Yea, it has me coming back for their 2nd/3rd episode and aside from watching it for Joel Mchale, the other characters seem okay enough to keep watching."
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"It was unexpected, didn’t think they’d actually have him come out and be on screen with his spiritual successor. It all makes sense now and happy see that they brought him in for a role."
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"Yeah I mean, who is Lacretta? It's not bad but I think they need to flesh out these characters some more.

I just started watching Animal Control and it made me google why the boss from Mr.Mayor was in this show (canceled...really unfortunate...:()."
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"HOW'S THAT ASS FEEL?

The first ep of IASIP is classic."
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"Interesting to find out what other people think is hilarious or not. I couldn’t get into the first few episodes of that show, but a few seasons in I flipped back on It’s always sunny and now it’s one of my all time favorites and I enjoy now those episodes with some context."
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"Fuck no, dee was WAY better when she was the quasi normal view.  ‘Whackadoo’ botox dee is juvenile, forced and unfunny.  Season 14 on shes basically 0/10.  Sigh."
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,Did the cameraman eat some of Victoria’s chocolate?
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"I finished episode 3 and it was solid - I take back what I said about Frank basically being Jeff. Still very similar, but different enough!"
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"Thank you, I knew I wasn't the only one, I was actually surprised to see it with the others (and honestly, the other two aren't as bad as many others)."
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"Entirely disagree as well. She was just another sitcom character until the second season.

Plus we'd never have the Gang Broke Dee if she stayed the same, as well as countless other episodes."
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"The gang broke dee was still awesome.  And the slow deterioration into madness was the best part (she had to be kind of normal to start to appreciate that descent).

But now with her perpetual ‘wackadoo’ scenes its just not funny.  The slapstick is forced.  NOW shes just another sitcom character."
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"My favorite part of that episode was the fact that they completely left Dennis out of their plan, and his reaction to it.
""Well, I did and I didn't""
""He totally didn't"""
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,Its so rare for them to sort of bully dennis its AWESOME when it happens
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,I feel like the author needs to either watch or address shows like *Invincible* or *Pantheon*.
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,I really love Vox Machina.  So glad we already know it will have a third season!
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,Anime Watchers: What gap??
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"Absolutely love this show, it’s just so much fun with great characters and voice acting and amazing fight scenes"
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,Undone was the shit
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,Really feel the same way about it. The earnestness is what sets it apart for me. It wears its heart entirely on its sleeve from moving emotional moments of growth to the kind of raunchy jokes and swearing people rattle off with their real friends. It feels far more real.
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"It's fun. Too much toilet Humor at times but it's a nice destraction from the usual doom and gloom stuff.

The characters are assholes sometimes but not *all* of them and not *all* the time.

The world is colourful and bright."
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"Just finished the first season. Its ok... Nothing really spectacular storywise and the animations are a bit weak.

It might be because I've just finished shows like Invincible, Castlevania, and Arcane. But this pales in comparison. As someone not familiar with Critical Role, there's nothing I've gathered from the first season to make me care about the characters or the world."
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"It’s ok, but got tired of them trying too hard to be “adult” with the jokes, sex references and swear words. Like calm TF down and let your story breathe, folks."
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"It's become one of my favourite series of many many years.

Love the animation style, the characters, the silly jokes. I love videogames and medieval fantasy and we don't get many shows like it.

I had no idea what critical role even was before to be honest."
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"It kind of feels like ""Western anime"", to me. In that it's a lot of fun, but it *does* feel like it sticks to themes of ""the power of friendship"" a bit *too* much. Like... sometimes, it feels like they sort of achieve things through sheer power of *emotions*, rather than tactics.

I also feel like, as fun as the action *looks*, it sometimes feels a bit like visual-noise. I'm kind of a novice when it comes to tabletop RPG's, and my father (who I've been watching it with) had never played one (though he's a big fan of MMORPG's), and it doesn't feel like there's any sort of consistency on how powerful these characters are or what they can do? I don't need hard ""power-levels"" or anything, but it's just hard understanding where these characters are in relation to the world around them. They seem effectively demigods sometimes, and then relatively ""normal"" other times.

Overall though, it's been fun.

My only two criticism are A) they lean *super* hard into ""this character is on the verge of death! wait, not really, they're totally fine"". Like... it felt like almost every episode. A part of me actually *wants* a character to die -- not because I don't like any of them, but because it's a cheap writing tactic to get people invested, and they've done it so much that it feels like there are no stakes. Either stop doing the ""fake-out"", or actually kill somebody.

The other criticism, for me, mainly concerns Vax (I think? the male twin). I get Critical Role is all about being super inclusive, that's something baked-into the world they've made. For a lot of folks, and probably the creators themselves, that's part of the appeal. But it creates for kind of a confusing world when seemingly everyone is attracted to everyone else, and in the case of him specifically, I feel like it's created a situation where I don't understand what the relationship dynamics are supposed to be. It feels... inconsistent. The characters can all be Bi, that's fine, but just help us understand what their relationships are, to each other and to other recurring characters."
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"Yeah honestly it rubs me the wrong way that invincible came out first but vox got a s2 first.

Also I would probably put this lower than shows like invincible, Castlevania, Primal, and arcane. STILL really fantastic, but idk that's just me."
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"Easily one of the best animated shows I’ve seen. Considering that the original goal was one 22-minute special episode for longtime fans, the actual outcome is phenomenal. It’s amazing to see this love project become so successful. All of my love to the Critical Role Fam."
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,Huge gap??
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"It's thoroughly okay, in all aspects. Fun time-filler but I wouldn't call it exemplary in any regard."
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,world??? lol. japan put 20 anime a season. Gtfo.
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,Vox Machina is just flat out a really good show.  I'm not a D&D guy at all and just randomly popped the show on one day and have been hooked.  Can't wait for season 3!
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"Great show, definitely recommend it"
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"It is… okay. Lotta fan service that cuts into the show. I wouldn’t call it bad, but I really can’t suggest it to anyone who isn’t a fan of the stream."
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,This show is so amazing
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,I had no idea that it was based on a D&D campaign. The table to screen compilations are 🔥🔥🔥
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,I completely agree with the author! I love animated sci-fi and fantasy but typically these stories star teens. Matter of fact my husband has started teasing me about watching high schoolers save the world. It is not my fault that most things that fall into this category follows teenage protagonists. Things like Vox Machina and Lower Decks are a breath of fresh air for me! I get my animated sci-fi/fantasy with adult protagonists that I can identify with more and not so much of the goofy ridiculousness as you would find in things like Family Guy and Rick and Morty. I hope more stories like these start coming out cause I am here for it!
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,What gap ?
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,So many better shows than vox.
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"I dont know if I've just only seen shitty scenes from it, but the dialog is increadibly cringe in that show."
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"Just finished season 2. Would highly recommend.

It's got great voice acting, great art and superb story.

Can't wait for season 3."
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,Second season is even better than the first one.
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"Such a fun show, I hope it has a nice long run great really funny and a great fantasy show"

Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"It’s genuinely just a fun show. Saw S1 when I had no real idea what Critical Role was, and was only vaguely aware of what DnD itself was or how it worked, but still enjoyed it a lot. 

Didn’t care much for the humor early on, especially in the first couple episodes- it actually reminded me a lot of the first couple episodes of Harley Quinn in how it just front loaded as much profanity, gore and sex jokes as possible. But it balances out over S1 and Season 2’s humor is, while still raunchy at times, far better balanced the same way Harley evened out. 

It’s definitely not a straight up grimly beautiful drama like Arcane. But its heavy enough to have substance while never being outright dour. It reminds me a lot of older scifi/fantasy adventure shows like Stargate, Farscape or Xena in how it has its heavier moments but there never stops being an underlying feeling of fun to it all, like it never takes itself too seriously. The kind of thing you put on and just have a good time with. 


I’d easily put it on par with later Castlevania seasons. Not as good as that shows first Dracula arc, but better than the subsequent ones. Vox Machina also seems to improve with every new batch of episodes as well. 

Id say its worth checking out for anyone who enjoys fantasy, and particularly found family stories, but isnt strictly looking for a pure drama."
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,Just finished season 2 last night. It's a good show.
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"I enjoy the show to an extent but I feel like it is fueled by tropes and stereotypes. When an epsidoe begins, you almost immediately will know how it will end. I also hate how death is nothing in this show. And the modern spin coating everything is tiresome. I mean jesus... Grog is now just ""god of war"" but weaker and dumber. 

Amazon is afraid to get really creative. They play it too safe even in their great tv shows like The Boys or The Expanse."
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"As far as original shows go, it's certainly up there as a fantastic addition to streaming shows. Definitely one I didn't expect to enjoy as much after so many other stinkers."
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,In the American view of the animation world.... Jesus.
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"I’m really enjoying Vox Machina, but it’s not “filling a huge gap” when there are tons of Japanese anime shows right now that honestly blow US cartoons out of the water.

Modern Western cartoon is honestly bare bone when it comes to finding good shows that isn’t shitty adult comedy/ Rick and Morty clones. They just never want to branch out to different genres and keep doing the same stuff over and over again. It’s either comedy or fantasy action, that’s it."
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,Best show of the year so far
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"This show is actually very mediocre.

if ""ehh"" was an animated TV show, this would be it"
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"To it’s credit I did finish the 1st season, but I just felt like it was so corny. Like I want American FMA, HxH, Monster, Berserk… not this."
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"Pantheon 

Primal

Invincible

Castlevania 

*gestures vaguely at anime*"
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,Arcane is amazing.
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,Bruh how can this be adult animation with no comedic gore or gross humor
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,I completely agree with the author! I love animated sci-fi and fantasy but typically these stories star teens.

Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"Vox is fun. That means a lot. Doesn't take itself seriously. Action, comedy, adventure, absurd musical numbers, and fisting jokes. Perfect TV"
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,What’s the show about?
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"I really hope culture changes enough in the next years so that people don't write embarrassing shit like this anymore. ""Saving a fantastical world with the power of friendship isn’t just for kids."" *Yes, it is.*"
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,Primal was fucking great too
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,Don't forget Castlevania. I'm excited about that sequel series they revealed.
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"Those are coming-of-age stories with teenage protagonists, which is precisely what the author of the article *isnt* referring to in the title. 

VM is ""special"" because it has a cast of adult characters with adult humor going around fantasy land and saving everyone. Most shows with a similar premise tend to feature, like I mentioned, teenage casts and coming-of-age stories. Castlevania is the big exception, but it ofc has a very different tone to VM."
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,PANTHEON!! Totally got screwed by it’s platform. If it was on a bigger/more accessible service that shit would have blown up.
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,Then on top of those two you also have Dota: Dragon's Blood and Dragon Age: Absolution over at Netflix. I guess Arcane is more YA than adult aimed but it is definitely serialised fantasy in animation.
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,[deleted]
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"They didn’t pay for an article, fuck em."
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,And Pantheon got cancelled despite being awesome.
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,RIP Pantheon.
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,Arcane?
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"The author is an idiot, but this comment is hilarious because it's the most upvoted and yet dumbs down the conversation so much. Now we have to take a step back and explain to this smug poster what ""coming of age"" means"
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,Don’t forget King of the Hill
Worlds Oddest Animal Couples US,"I feel like you should read the article, the author has seen those shows:

> The Legend of Vox Machina is not the first of these shows, but it is the one that made me realize just how wide the gap between Steven Universe and Rick and Morty is."
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,The Stranger Things Christmas Special sounds like a spectacularly bad idea.

The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,The Sabrina one wasn’t bad.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,"It's really brilliant. If it happens to be showing somewhere, check it out in cinemas."
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,Agreed.   Just a fun show to watch that feels like the episodes fly by.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,Apparently filming finished in July.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,People like Christmas movies around Christmas?  Who knew?
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,Is this the part where we kick you?
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,"If you're saying everything else sounds generic, that just means you haven't watched them. Lost in Space sounded generic as fuck, but it was amazing. You shouldnt judge an entire tv show based on a one sentence description."
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,">A stage director and his actor wife struggle through a gruelling, coast-to-coast divorce that pushes them to their personal and creative extremes."
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,Interesting take...
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,Oh really? For some reason I thought it was much longer than that. Thanks.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,yeah that sounds like a lifetime movie. gonna be a pass from  me. at least Girls had a gimmick.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,"Well you'd be missing out on a favourite for best picture and definitely one of the best movies of the year. It's a seriously brilliant film.

Also, blurbs aren't a good indicator of quality."
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,"Some people just need ""gimmicks"" in their entertainment."

*maybe this could serve as a suggestion for shows*"
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,"So you posted a list? OK, I guess. Who cares? "
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,And no Fargo? Come on man 
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,Use trakt.tv dude
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,Cool! What Doctor Who episodes did you watch?
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,Why didn’t you watch season 3 of Better Call Saul? That’s literally the best season
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,"Yes. What's the point of this other than to say ""look how little of a social life I have. I can knock out show a week""! "
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,Damn boy
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,"You and I could definitely watch low profile TV shows together. Ink Master *and* Trixie/Katya! Cool.

Curious how the Trakt totals work -- did you watch the entire Honeymoon Special three separate times, or did it take you three tries to finish?"
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,yeah for some reason this didn't come out as a list. it looks really poor. 
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,thanks.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,"Maybe it’s just me, but having so many 9/10 and 10/10 shows doesn’t really make sense as a rating system for helping others with suggestions.. Plus you rated nothing as a 6/10 or below. I don’t think everything has to be a Bell Curve or anything, but there has to be some separation/distinction."
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,Idk it was just fun keeping track of it all.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,I've seen the first 2 seasons.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,really? OK then I'll watch it. I wasn't really that into the first 2 seasons. I loved BB though.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,"thanks, for the full list and to browse more my data, go here: https://trakt.tv/users/philrivers/history/shows/added?days=365&start_at=2017-06-23"
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,"Honeymoon special on Netflix is split into three parts so I used the tv show data that listed it in three parts instead of the movie entry as one 90minute piece.  
  
"
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,Love ink master. Some amazing art is.made on that show. 
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,"Well, I thought it was telling.  I try only to watch good series.  Theres so much content out there that I dont commit my time watching a whole season if it's a 6.  You can compare simply!  By taking a show you've seen and looking at how I thought about it and what shows here I watched and the type.  Imo I thought I was helping someone who would be looking for a good series to watch.  For e.g. community is listed s1-3 10/10 seas4-6 7/10 that's helpful imo.  Thanks for the feedback I'm sorry it didnt help you."
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,what did you use for tracking?
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,Season 3 is great. 
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,Yeah each season gets better and better. They just released the season 4 promo today and it looks intense 
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,"I guess I feel that if the worst show you watch is a 7/10, then the scale is broken. But on a more subjective note, I’ve seen 10-15 shows on your list and would give a few a 5 or 6 and none a 10. I would really only give 3 or 4 shows ever made a 10. But hey, this is all very much a matter of opinion. "
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,"I think you're putting too much time into what I offered as suggestions.  All opinions are subjective, my reply was to offer help not to try to change the system of ratings.  I'm just a earthling nothing special.  "
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,that seems like a pretty standard dystopian story move. it's an easy way to fill episodes out and explore the characters before everything went to hell. it's also cheap to shoot in standard before-world so you don't have to use the budget creating and decorating another set with dirt and firefly posters
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,We about to get the tutorial as a TV series
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,I liked how Lost gave back stories to characters. Each episode would cut away a few times showing the survivor's life before the crash.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,"If I had to guess, the first episode is 30-45 mins of regular life and maybe ends with **that** moment."
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,Makes sense for an adaptation. Gives it a little more weight and easily leads into the games intro.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,First episode is going to be Joel filing his taxes. Episode 2 is him mailing stuff at the post office.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,"How well it will go, totally depends on how much time they're actually spending on ""life before"". I'd imagine most show watchers have been burned out about stupid filler material and spending too much time on ""before the outbreak"" would be just that. People aren't watching the show to see the normal lives."
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,I recently started Party Down and now that I picture everyone who bitches about sci-fi or fantasy on the internet as Roman from that show it all makes more sense.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,"In these kinds of movies I love the part just before the outbreak starts. Where the main characters hear rumours of what's happening, but shit has not hit the fan yet. You start feeling tense as you wait for it. And then BOOM! The outbreak happens and there's chaos. You see how bewildered and uncomprehending they are about what's going on as they try to grapple with the unbelievable situation."
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,Isn’t life before the outbreak just a crappy family drama?
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,"So… like normal life?

Why the hell do we want to see that?"
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,"""HBOs new show will finally set up the story"""
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,"I just don't want to see another Station Eleven situation where the interesting post apocalypse setting gets sidelined to drag the audience through meaningless identity melodrama at upper class dinner parties from the Before Time. I know it's a cheap and easy way to pad the runtime, but you kill your pacing when you wallow around in flashbacks that don't matter and a setting that isn't relevant anymore. Civilization is gone and 90% of people are dead, nobody cares that your rich parents were mean to your lesbian girlfriend at Christmas before they died and money became irrelevant. 

I would hope that flashback use will be brief and relevant."
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,I have always wanted to see Joel file his taxes
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,Life before the outbreak is our normal ass timeline up until October 2013. Sounds like mundane filler.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,First game can be done in 8 eps. 2nd game can be done in 2 seasons if they want to streech. How many seasons did they say they would make ??
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,"Watch out reddit, here comes the “they’re running this show before it comes out” crowd."
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,Didnt the writers/creators/producers just come out the other day and say a few days ago that the show would not deviate from the games?
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,That would be funny if it turns out to be a rom-com set in the year before the zombie apocalypse.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,Press X to doubt.  I've heard this song and dance before.  I'm talking to you Fear the Walking Dead.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,Could they not? We know what life was like before the outbreak. Exactly like it is right now.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,"Because that’s the exciting part, right?"
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,I hope it’s not an inundation of past scenes like they did with the Resident Evil joke of a series
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,They are gonna spend an entire episode dedicated to Sarah and make us fall in love with her before...ya know...aren't they?
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,That's called filler. It's the hallmark of a cashgrab.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,Fair enough but I'm really hoping it's not full of flashbacks all the time.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,Sounds like Black Summer
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,"Bet they'll show a bunch of doubters and anti-xxx groups thinking this ""massive outbreak"" is a hoax, and they all inevitably spread the virus."
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,Last of Us had possibly the best intro of any game. I'd be interested in seeing some more build-up to the intro sequence and further exploring Joels relationship with his daughter.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,Does anyone actually care? Life before the apocalypse is just real life.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,"If it’s well done, I enjoy the thrill of a societal breakdown on screen. Means you have to have normal first. Like others have said though, I hope it’s not overdone."
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,I love watching the setup to fungal zombie plagues just as much as I like watching it unfolding! Yay!!
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,It’s a good move for anyone who has not played the game.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,Putting my money on the major premise being people acting like the outbreak is “fake news” up until the point that it consumes the world.  And then some.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,“Last of us Director scrambling to make 8 hour video game a full series”
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,"I feel like hollywood has bastardized what “backstory” means. I dont need to know where Joel went to school and the childhood fights with his brother through multiple flashbacks over multiple episodes. All I need to know about him is that he was a single dad, he and his daughter had a good relationship, and his brother is close enough that when shit hits the fan they rely on each other. TLOU game set up his character beautifully in 15min, I dont see any reason to extend it. 

They could literally do a shot for shot remake of the video game and it would win multiple awards."
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,"oh god, they are going to make me rrrrrreally love Sarah this time. I mean, it was emotional enough losing her in the game and that was just a bit at the start!"
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,ive always wanted this. yayyyy
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,Did walmart Joel work at Walmart or target?
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,"I can’t be the only one that finds one of the favorite part of apocalypse movies/shows is the beginning where no one really knows what’s happening yet and then it’s just chaos. I’m excited to see it expanded. 

Like the baseball game in Quiet Place 2 or Rick’s hospital wake up and the Atlanta bombing in TWD."
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,So TWD with humans being the main bad guys and then zombies…wait a second
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,"Keep telling ya this is gonna suck. I don't want it to, but everything is pointing in the wring direction"
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,I honestly im only interested in the Life Before the outbreak on the opening scene. After that? it will probably be filler scenes to reduce costs and it honestly... doesnt look interesting to me.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,Oh good. Because there's nothing more interesting than watching normal people go about their lives in a normal world.... *That's* the stuff *I* want to see in a zombie survival show...
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.,So the least entertaining part?
72 Cutest Animals,"It's Vi and Caitlyn, where have you been this past month?"

72 Cutest Animals,"Vegeta and Bulma kinda. Vegeta is such an asshole that it's a miracle any earth woman fell for him, let alone Bulma. The two were seriously made for each other though. His gigantic ego and her sass and lack of fear of him despite the fact that he could tear her like wet TP makes them awesome."
72 Cutest Animals,You’re supposed to say what show it’s from
72 Cutest Animals,To be honest it looks to me like it's going to be one of those examples of shows that is going to repeat itself every time you come back from a commercial break and really drag out the handful of content you have to show. Having said that I will give it a go. Best of luck to you.

72 Cutest Animals,"[Serious] Show looks great. I am from the US. Where is it going to air, only Australia or will we get it over here? Looks really interesting and I would definitely watch it and my 9 yo son would love it as he wants to grow up and become an ""Animal Scientist"" as he puts it."
72 Cutest Animals,I can actually say that its not. Every episode pumps through the infomation and its actually interesting. 
72 Cutest Animals,Haha you'll have to watch and find out
72 Cutest Animals,Kinda being the key word here
72 Cutest Animals,"Oh awesome thanks mate! It will air in the US, it will be on Nat Geo in early August. As I have more airing details I'll flick you a message!"
72 Cutest Animals,Will be sure to keep an eye out for it.  Keep up the good work and thanks again.  Will be sure to mention it to friends and family also.  
72 Cutest Animals,"Hey mate! An update on this, The firs Episode has aired in Australia.
Its on Nat Geo Wild every Tuesday night at 7:30pm 
Sorry for the late reply just remembered about this."
72 Cutest Animals,Wow ! Thanks a bunch. Was wondering about that lately and tried to look for it on Nat Geo Website a couple of weeks ago to no avail. I *REALLY* appreciate you thing of me and remembering to contact me. You are what makes Reddit great !!!
72 Cutest Animals,"Oh well thanks heaps!
Let me know what you think about the show, love to hear some feedback"
72 Cutest Animals,"Having a hard time finding it in the channel listings, including the dates and times you listed. Does not seem to be on ???"
72 Cutest Animals,No one wants to be the girl who played Meg but left and got replaced by Mila Kunis.
72 Cutest Animals,Honestly who the hell couldn’t schedule around Rick and morty voiceovers. Doesn’t seem like it takes that much time and she could kind of do it whenever. Insanity
72 Cutest Animals,"Grammer:

>""I had been in a situation where I had done another show and they were like, 'Sorry, you're gonna have to leave this,' and I was like, go f*** yourselves, this is the only thing I like.' I don't care if I don't make any money on this show. This show brings me joy every time I read a script, every time I go in there and record this character, I laughed my a** off, I'm proud of the work. I was like, 'I will go work in an office, there's no way I'm not doing this show"""
72 Cutest Animals,Keep Summer safe.
72 Cutest Animals,I love her I was such a big Greek fan lol
72 Cutest Animals,"Oddly I used to live in her old apartment and still got her old mail! 

Her mom, Doreen Alderman (one of Kelsey Grammer’s ex wives), is a landlord/slumlord in NYC. Doreen’s father owned a few buildings and she inherited them. Not a great landlord in my experience btw haha."
72 Cutest Animals,Why in the world would someone ask her to quit one of the most popular animated series where she's a main character? That's such a ridiculous thing to demand.
72 Cutest Animals,I sincerely doubt that nobody is getting rich off Rick & Morty. They sell their clothes at H&M. All those bongs. Somebody’s making money.
72 Cutest Animals,Way to go summer camp!
72 Cutest Animals,I absolutely heard that in her Summer voice
72 Cutest Animals,I’m surprised she isn’t making much money from this show - she’s a main character in the most popular animated series that’s been renewed for 72 series. What gives?
72 Cutest Animals,She was really good on Greek.
72 Cutest Animals,[deleted]
72 Cutest Animals,"This brings *me* joy. Summer went from being just a boring minor character in the show to easily being my favorite character. In fact, Rick+SumSum adventures are some of the best episodes the show has produced.

Also I totally read that entire article in Summer’s voice."
72 Cutest Animals,">Part of what helps Adult Swim function is the fact that they keep budgets for their shows incredibly low     

I promise you R&M isn't operating on anything approaching the standard adult swim budget."
72 Cutest Animals,"I work in animation. When you're a celebrity or you have a lead with a busy schedule, the production will find a way to accommodate. Recording on a weekend, recording in remote studios near your filming location, sending equipment to your house. Production can temporary record scratch tracks of her voice and keep the show going until she's able to record, all the way up until if she were to have to dub the temporary voices later. That's months to half of a year of open room to record. 

Storytime: I was supposed to direct a celebrity talent (fell through), and there was at one point a moment in the talks where I would have had to move a pre-fabricated sound booth into the actor's house so they wouldn't have to leave their home. And especially with so much being capable of being done remotely and cheaply, there's no way that any show couldn't accommodate her being on multiple series. Only if it risks missing a deadline will they not do it. Rick and Morty records solo, as seen in their behind the scenes. So they could pick her VO up anytime.

So unless you leave to dive head first into something that requires your method-level attention 7 days a week for a year, there's no way any production couldn't accommodate her leaving for a few hours to record a show in her trailer. My guess is whatever network wanted her on their production wanted some exclusivity for some insane reason probably doing with networks having controlling contracts or fighting between executives or worrying about appearances/branding. Some networks will have contracts that could say something like if you have a lead role on (let's make up some networks for a pretend example) an NBC series that you can't have one on ABC at the same time. And my guess is that it was probably something like that. It's called exclusivity. It happens in advertising so us actors aren't the lead in a Coke and Pepsi commercial at the same time. My guess is those exist because they don't want a Sydney Sweeney having billboards up for an HBO and a Netflix (pretend examples) show coming out the same week or airing at the same time and the networks feeling like they're competing for viewers with the same actor, which let's face it, as actors we're products.

One of my pals is a prominent lead in an ensemble animation series and I watched him once record three episodes in an hour. So unless your directors are really sculpting the performances or you have some big episodes, recordings do not take that much time especially if her character might have one or two prominent episodes where she's featured, then a bunch where she has a couple dozen lines at best."
72 Cutest Animals,I'm sure all that 'Frasier' money her dad has didn't influence her decision.
72 Cutest Animals,"It’s probably not, but I wonder if the other project was “The Barbarian and the Troll” puppet series. It’s done one season so far, but no news on a second one. She’s a main character in that show, so I would imagine it takes more time to work on that project than R&M."
72 Cutest Animals,Why does Morty call his grandfather by his first name?
72 Cutest Animals,"Let’s be honest, she’s a millionaire and is doing fine."
72 Cutest Animals,"Honestly, this is such a Summer thing to say lmfao"
72 Cutest Animals,Had a total crush on her as a teen watching Greek.
72 Cutest Animals,What I love about this is it just seems like such a Summer response.
72 Cutest Animals,I wish I never had to worry about money.
72 Cutest Animals,Keep Summer Safe
72 Cutest Animals,"“I’ll go work in an office.” Or you know, have my insanely wealthy dad pay for things. I love her work as Summer but come on Spencer, you e never been hurting for money a day in your life."
72 Cutest Animals,">'I will go work in an office, there's no way I'm not doing this show""

No you won't, your family is rich beyond believe and this show pays you a lot of money.

This whole thing is a rich person kissing her own ass and wanting us to admirer her for it."
72 Cutest Animals,[deleted]
72 Cutest Animals,Kelsey Grammer's kid... Proof that your chance of making it in Hollywood is pretty much who you're related to.
72 Cutest Animals,"Her saying she doesn’t care if she makes money on it is cute and all, but I thought to myself she must have grown up rich and googled her.  Didn’t realize she was Kelsey Grammer’s daughter. Makes sense."
72 Cutest Animals,Her dad likes bees what a dork.
72 Cutest Animals,I can imagine that it is a blast voicing character in R&M.
72 Cutest Animals,Haven't seen her face since the Greek finale.
72 Cutest Animals,"If you get her dad mad, he will toss some salad and scrambled eggs"
72 Cutest Animals,"Spencer Grammer can do whatever she wants thanks to being the daughter of Kelsey Grammer. I loved her in Greek, and she's great in Rick and Morty, but she could literally do nothing or everything because her father has a ton of industry credit (and money)."
72 Cutest Animals,"It’s funny, even on a show with Justin Roiland, Sarah Chalke and the legend himself Chris Parnell the girl who plays Summer Spencer Grammer has always done a great job bringing her character to life and making it one of the most interesting on the show to watch 

Early days Rick and Morty Summer was just the annoying big sister who occasionally was in episodes, it was smart of them to give her a more important part, even if that resulted in the weird incest baby story"
72 Cutest Animals,Gotta do what you love
72 Cutest Animals,Lol I didn’t know summers dad is Kelsey grammer
72 Cutest Animals,TIL Spencer can also be a girls name.
72 Cutest Animals,Sounds exactly like something summer Smith would say
72 Cutest Animals,"Well duh, you don't have to think about the money from other offers when your Dad took down the Money Plane. That guy is loaded."
72 Cutest Animals,Keep Summer safe.
72 Cutest Animals,Well you can definitely tell she’s having fun her summer dub is insane!
72 Cutest Animals,"To be brutally honest, she doesn’t have to make choices based on money. It’s much easier for her to say no than it is for other actors."
72 Cutest Animals,David Zaslav then breaks into your house picks you up by the neck shouts OH LIKE THAT SHOW DO YOU then slams your skull into the TV shouts CANCELLED as the TV screen shatters.
72 Cutest Animals,She embodies Summer so well.
72 Cutest Animals,I have loved her since Greek
72 Cutest Animals,When you work for 2 weeks out of every 3 years reading a script what’s preventing you from doing other work
72 Cutest Animals,Keep Summer safe!
72 Cutest Animals,What an absolute weird headline? Would have sufficed: Spencer Grammer turns down job offer. To busy.
72 Cutest Animals,She’s got Tegrity
72 Cutest Animals,Meanwhile the co creators are filling their plates up with other shows.
72 Cutest Animals,Ahhh nepotism babies
72 Cutest Animals,So brave with millionaire parents.
72 Cutest Animals,Why is everyone involved with this show from the actors to the fans just so needlessly aggressive?
72 Cutest Animals,"Oh weird, we're getting articles about 'behind the scenes' stuff about Rick and Morty right before the season starts. Totally a real notable thing that happened in production and not a marketing post to get people talking about the show.

I miss when Reddit and the Internet at whole didn't feel so manufactured."
72 Cutest Animals,Best animated series of all times in my opinion
72 Cutest Animals,Seems real odd. Like I’d imagine it takes her a week to record a season? If that?
72 Cutest Animals,"This exact article was posted on here in the last week or so, same title and everything.

Seems to have been removed now though."
72 Cutest Animals,Keep Spencer Safe
72 Cutest Animals,As a Dan Harmon fan that almost makes me forget her dad is a raging dickhead
72 Cutest Animals,"Rick and Morty has always been kind of shit, wouldn’t mind if it went away. Almost all of Adult Swim’s ‘big shows’ before were much better. My opinion obv, I get why people like it. But it feels like a Disney cartoon with ‘dirty humor.’"
72 Cutest Animals,Spencer has terrible taste.
72 Cutest Animals,"She sounds exactly like Summer: ""Go fuck yourselves this brings me joy, I'll work in an office if I have to"". 

It is also a really douchey quote, as if office work is the worst thing ever or as if she would ever really need to worry about money."
72 Cutest Animals,Too bad the show sucks now
72 Cutest Animals,what is she 11?
72 Cutest Animals,must be steroid Summer. love her.
72 Cutest Animals,Why is everything I read about this show moderately annoying
72 Cutest Animals,So quirky like the fans of the show.
72 Cutest Animals,"Why is it when I look up Spencer Grammer the first autofill is ""Spencer Grammer feet"""
72 Cutest Animals,">”This show brings me joy every time I read a script, every time I go in there and record this character, I laughed my a** off, I'm proud of the work.”

Kind have a crush on ol’ Spence now."
72 Cutest Animals,Rick and Morty is still on?
72 Cutest Animals,"So she signed a contract, when it came time to make good on that contract, she refused and told people to fuck off... sounds like a rich kid Karen move. I bet if her parents were anyone else she wouldn't have gotten away with it. Yet another petulant rich kid getting whatever they want. Hilarious."
72 Cutest Animals,"If this isn't mentioned in the show, I am ""Pickle Rick"" rioting.

Not really, but that would be crazy, right?"
72 Cutest Animals,Too bad Rick and Morty is a shell of what it once was….
72 Cutest Animals,Way to not sell out.
72 Cutest Animals,Sounds like a great way to never get work again.
72 Cutest Animals,My man!
72 Cutest Animals,"This whole time when I saw Spencer in the credits, I thought it was the dungeon master from Harmontown."
72 Cutest Animals,I wonder what show it was she was offered?
Cyborg 009 VS Devilman,"I’m watching The Wire for the first time. I can’t tell if he’s supposed to be the hero, but McNulty is pretty creepy and gross. I appreciate that most of the characters are complex, but he’s just crossed a line for me. Finishing up season 3."
Cyborg 009 VS Devilman,"OK, Im gonna throw one out there from just a few years back. I really wasn't sure whether this one actually qualified because, A) he's almost universally recognized as one of the truly nice/good guys on TV, and B) because even though I recognize the behaviors that would qualify him for inclusion here, I also view him as one of the truly nice/good guys on TV. 

So if you're old enough to remember, what do you think about Hawkeye Pierce?"
Cyborg 009 VS Devilman,"Ted Mosby of How I Met Your Mother is massively creepy towards women, imprinting on them like a duckling looking for its mother. Edit: And the show treats him like a hopeless romantic."
Cyborg 009 VS Devilman,"Hmm, I don't know. I feel like you're conflating unlikeable protagonists with ""heroes"" pretty heavily here. A character being a protagonist or hanging with the protagonists doesn't make them a hero, or even imply that the creators think they are a hero or want you to believe that they are. Often the conflict between the differing moralities of your protagonists can add a lot of spice.

I guess what I'm saying is that in many cases these characters not being particular heroic probably means they aren't meant to be."
Cyborg 009 VS Devilman,Jack Bauer from 24 immediately comes to mind.
Cyborg 009 VS Devilman,Almost everybody on Heroes. There's basically no heroic acts on that show besides the once yearly world saving.
Cyborg 009 VS Devilman,Rick from Rick and Morty is a pretty big anti-hero
Cyborg 009 VS Devilman,"JD in scrubs



Don Draper"
Cyborg 009 VS Devilman,"Spartacus and pirates come to mind, romanticized to hell and beyond while conveniently glossing over the raping, massacring and pillaging they merrily carried on on a daily basis. At least WOTD *slightly* acknowledged that not all rebels were saints and not all Romans were assholes"
Cyborg 009 VS Devilman,Carrie Bradshaw in sex and the city
Cyborg 009 VS Devilman,"He was pretty much the show's statement of the fact that unlike most cops depicted on TV... the reality is anybody *that* truely devoted to solving cases would be seriously messed up and devoid of a healthy personal life. Doing it just soley to bury thier problems and to show off their smarts amidst a sea of corrupt idiots who couldn't care less.

Just like Sherlock Holmes, considered the world's smartest detective, is an arrogant ass whose addiction to drugs helps him cope with the downtime between cases."
Cyborg 009 VS Devilman,"If you dont like McNulty now, just wait til you get to season 5."
Cyborg 009 VS Devilman,But he’s natural poleece
Cyborg 009 VS Devilman,"I think the only real negative Hawkeye is supposed to carry is that be treats women like dirt, which they address by having him learn to respect women one episode every year. The rest of what might seem to be negatives - the emotionalism, the drinking, the bullying - I think are considered natural and sometimes healthy reactions to being in a war zone."
Cyborg 009 VS Devilman,"Makes sense. I appreciate them showing the personal toll policing takes on people… I just feel like he’s shifted into being a lecherous drunk w a small side of policing at this point, but I can’t tell if that’s their intent, or just my 2022 perspective."
Cyborg 009 VS Devilman,Oh dear...about to start season 4!
Cyborg 009 VS Devilman,Yeah being in a warzone does supply a built in stimulus for that behavior. Good answer.
Cyborg 009 VS Devilman,"It's absolutely on purpose. Lots of other shows make being a cop/detective look exciting, like an adventure. The Wire shows that it's really kind of a shit job full of politics and stress and shows the toll it takes on them."
Cyborg 009 VS Devilman,"Agreed, the pacing has pretty much been non existent this season, with each episode going at a hundred miles per hour to shove as much as they can in the 20 minutes they have, but at the same time nothing really happens either. I'm a little over half way through and I'm still struggling to find the main plot of the season

Methinks that they're relying too much on the steaming age binge method where they expect you to binge it all in a day or two, so instead of being just 26 episodes it feels just like a long movie"
Cyborg 009 VS Devilman,"It's definitely not as addictive as the previous seasons (currently @ ep 24), not really feeling the newer characters/story for some reason.

I have to agree about the accents, they are so jarring it breaks any immersion I have when watching. :("
Cyborg 009 VS Devilman,"Same shit as Season 2. Too many characters, too many plots, way too much exposition. I hate to be a dick, but I think this show ended for me with everyone making out in the Watchtower. God, Season 1 was so fun..."
Cyborg 009 VS Devilman,"I'm a huge fan of Young Justice and I completely agree on all points. A few things.

1.) Cyborg Ex Machina much?

2.) Hi, I'm Dr. Jace. Let me explain to you specifically why actually I've been the bad guy all along instead of us wasting resources on animating a story that would better illustrate this monologue I'm about to give.

3.) Heyo, I'm random meta-psychic guy that we've never really laid the groundwork for to be a mole this entire time because we could have just taken over the government before the big battle because I was already psychically controlling the 1st prince

The best episode this season was the Vandal Savage origin episode. I'd have to say my favorite though was seeing Roy's security team. 

I like seeing the team have lives. But at this point I have no idea who the ""team"" is. They've introduced and re-introduced so many people. It feels like they are setting up 80 different story arcs. Honestly, I'll watch 80 seasons of Young Justice. By now, I care enough about the core group. I'm just worried this is bad writing and not long term plotting. There were a lot of signs of ""wha-oh, we need to wrap this up right now"" writing this season. There's not much of an excuse for that when a lot of episodes felt like parts didn't even have to happen THIS SEASON. Or maybe ever? I don't feel like it's been like that in the past.

Vandal Savage was so under-utilized in Legends of Tomorrow. My favorite Justice League episode is that one where Superman runs into him in the future and he helps Superman because he's done with villainy. 

I really like YJ's version of Vandal Savage so far. He believes he isn't a villain. He's doing whatever it takes to uphold Earth as a power player, a place not to be messed with from the likes of Darkseid.

TLDR; I agree. Not a great season. Not a horrible season. Too many characters. Bad pacing."
Cyborg 009 VS Devilman,"Disagree, I love how big the universe is getting, how the reveals are well set up with good reveals. The Season also decided to be much more experimental as well and it mostly worked. 

I didn't expect Brion to become one of the more interesting characters in the series. Especially from when he was introduced. 

I also like that they developed the Apokolips side of the story where they are now a distinct faction now instead of it just being the Light vs the Heroes. It's very much a 3 sided tug of war now."
Cyborg 009 VS Devilman,"I'm enjoying the series; on a side note, 

for some reason I really like the end credits with the ambient background and sleeping dog noises!. 

Super chill and relaxing"
Cyborg 009 VS Devilman,I expected more but all I see is..... nitpicking
Cyborg 009 VS Devilman,I have just started watching and am on episode 16 of season 1. Show is okay but I definitely was expecting more. Skimming what you said not to ruin too much for myself sounds like will be underwhelmed too. I went in thinking big stories and great team dynamic.
Cyborg 009 VS Devilman,"I actually really liked season 2. But with season 3 it's like they took certain things that worked better in previous seasons and doubled down on them. Like having so many conspiracies going on and moles. 

It's like what happened with 24. They found a formula and ran it into the ground. There's a bad guy, midseason finale: psych! there's actually a bad guy behind the bad guy. 

Jack Bauer gets captured, tortured, escapes and tortures someone himself for information, he has a new group of people who work with him,one of them is the mole in season x, in season y it's not one of them doing it intentionally but he/she has been hacked, in season z it's one of them but this time that person has been in deep cover after stealing someones identity and having an ideology behind it, in season x it was just someone that did it for the money. See, it's all different!

Next season we'll see the protege of Elongated Man join the outsiders. He or she will fall in love with Static Shock. Turns out this protege was sent into the team by Elongated Man with a purpose. He's actually a part of a secret team within the Justice League. A team that has been put together by Black Lightning himself and his story arc is about how difficult it is to be a leader in the short amounts of screen time he'll get due to the influx of plenty of new characters.... again. He set the team up because there have been leaks to the press about internal Justice League knowledge. Turns out the protege of Elongated Man was also being controlled by Queen Bee, the league didn't know about this but Kaldur figured it out and fed Queen Bee with fake information. Elongated Man's protege then feels like he's failed everyone, Static Shock is angry at him/her and they break up. HOWEVER! They get together again after Static saves his/her life and realizes that life is too short."
Cyborg 009 VS Devilman,">Hi, I'm Dr. Jace. Let me explain to you specifically why actually I've been the bad guy all along instead of us wasting resources on animating a story that would better illustrate this monologue I'm about to give.

Yeah that was also so silly. The whole Jace storyline was just a convoluted way to tie Granny Goodness into taking Halo. An other great example of a convoluted covert operation by a mole in the team. 

>  But at this point I have no idea who the ""team"" is. They've introduced and re-introduced so many people. It feels like they are setting up 80 different story arcs.  

You got the Justice League. You got ''The Team'' they never bothered naming in this world where everything and everyone gets a codename.  Then you got the outsiders. It's a team, within a team, within a team. 

I also liked Black Lightings disdain for covert operations all season, while masking his face, taking on a codename to hide his identity, to be a hero that works outside the law because of a self proclaimed sense of justice he has to carry out... and then he states that the covert part of ''The team'' will still be needed. After being all upset by covert operations. Just watch him keeping secrets in the next season because he's a leader now and bares the responsibility of the whole freaking world by leading the worlds strongest heroes. I don't get how such a person won't have to keep secrets. 

Yeah, the Savage episode was really the best. Because it was one of those episodes where there was actually some world building going on with his backstory, having children, the pact he made with Darkseid etc."
Cyborg 009 VS Devilman,Arguing that the show spends too much time on character introductions and fewer amounts of time to actually develop a story is a pretty big core problem.
Cyborg 009 VS Devilman,"If you think developing the core story was a problem this season, then I don’t know what to tell you"
Good Morning Call,"Will he ever revisit his Jonestown series? Originally planned for HBO I believe? Regardless, super interested in anything he does next."
Good Morning Call,"Time to revisit his acting career, I hear he’s gonna be the Luke Skywalker of VHS interactive video games"
Good Morning Call,This universe has over a hundred hours of high quality storytelling. Haven’t seen something like this in a tv universe before. Such a rare treasure that I’m glad exists.
Good Morning Call,"Considering his work on the X-Files, I would love for the Breaking Bad team to tackle a supernatural horror series with the level of quality and storytelling we’ve seen so far."
Good Morning Call,Do Something New By Making **Another Great Show!** We're With You Vince.
Good Morning Call,"TV series, mini series, movie, whatever man, just keep bringing me that."
Good Morning Call,"It's great he wants to go off and do new stories, but I do fear this opens it up for AMC to bastardize the franchise and hire a bunch of people to churn out spinoffs."
Good Morning Call,I would love to see another show with this cinematography and level of character development without needing to tie it into an already developed world.
Good Morning Call,"Cmon Vince, give the people what they want: kaylee ehrmantraut’s high school adventures played by a mid 30’s actress"
Good Morning Call,"I like that he keeps the door open for revisiting more stories in this universe in the future, but I can totally understand his desire to try other things. Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul are a truly outstanding 1-2 punch of shows he created. BCS is one of the more impressive feats of TV storytelling I’ve ever seen."
Good Morning Call,"In the article he definitely said almost exactly the opposite of leaving for good as in the title:

“Yes, I could do more with this universe. And maybe someday I will, especially if I fail at everything that comes next. Then I’ll come crawling back. But right now, whether there’s more room to grow or not — and there probably is — I feel like it’s time to do something new.”."
Good Morning Call,Amazing work. Loved this series just as much as BB.
Good Morning Call,This guy could make a series about someone filing their taxes and I’d still watch it. Excited to see what he does next.
Good Morning Call,"He left for good then made El Camino, people can say they’re done but you never can be sure"
Good Morning Call,something new as in slippin jimmy season 2
Good Morning Call,"Oh man, what I wouldn't give for him to do a new season of The X-Files. His episodes on the original run were some of the best of the entire series.  I remember him saying in an interview that he would have come back when they did the revival, but he was too busy with Better Call Saul. That would be my dream come true."
Good Morning Call,pimento
Good Morning Call,Give us the story of skinny Pete rising up to be the next drug lord of Albuquerque
Good Morning Call,P I L E  O F  B U L L E T S
Good Morning Call,Give it a few more years and we will get a sequel series about Jesse Pinkman
Good Morning Call,"Make a globe trotting corporate crime show 

Call it Madrigal"
Good Morning Call,"The headline is kinda misleading:

>I can definitely imagine revisiting it. Selfishly, I’d like to do so, to keep this thing going. But without naming any names, I look around at some of the worlds, the universes, the stories that I love, whether they’re on TV or in the movies. And I think there’s a certain point, and it’s hard to define, where you’ve done too much in the same universe. Just leave it alone. And some universes are much bigger and more elastic. Ours is a very small one, Albuquerque, New Mexico, versus some of these worlds and series of movies and TV shows. The main thing I’m scared of is becoming too much of a one-trick pony. Yes, I could do more with this universe. And maybe someday I will, especially if I fail at everything that comes next. Then I’ll come crawling back. But right now, whether there’s more room to grow or not — and there probably is — I feel like it’s time to do something new."
Good Morning Call,Until Roof Pizza gets a spin-off
Good Morning Call,I respect it. There's so many good shows that turned bad because they were dragged out too much.
Good Morning Call,"Their so much stories to be told from the Breaking Bad universe. So many characters that could make for a great series. But whatever he chooses to do next I will for sure watch, because his cinematography is amazing."
Good Morning Call,Need a prequel set in the 90s starring the same cast
Good Morning Call,I’m squinting while writing this because I don’t want any spoilers but wow I loved BCS better than breaking bad. Honestly laughed and cried and everything in between. Also nacho!!!! I don’t know why I felt so much empathy for him but I did.
Good Morning Call,Or... or (and just hear me out): Skinny Pete and Badger: The Adventures Continue!
Good Morning Call,"Good. As much as I want to say ""wait there's more stories to tell"" I'm happy that BETTER CALL SAUL is seen as the final chapter in this saga. Maybe they revisit it down the road for a Gus Fring prequel (in any medium tbh) but for now, I'm very excited to see Gilligan sink into something fresh. 

This franchise will always be one of the most legendary pieces in storytelling... I can't wait for the BCS finale!"
Good Morning Call,I hope it works out better than Battle Creek did.
Good Morning Call,I'm ready for something new from him. I have utterly enjoyed the Breaking Bad Universe and I typically hate dramas.
Good Morning Call,I thought he left the show in season 3
Good Morning Call,"He can always adapt my Sly Stone biopic into a television show.

Spoiler: I have a part for Jack White as a pimp"
Good Morning Call,The next series he will start is 'Fixing Good'
Good Morning Call,Write more X files Vince!
Good Morning Call,"This is for the best in my opinion. They have made two great shows and a movie. The more times they keep coming back to the well, the more they risk putting out something that is not as good and sullying the story that has been told. 

I want to see Vince Gilligan give us something completely new and awesome that we can all obsess about over the next couple of years."
Good Morning Call,Truly a master class in tv
Good Morning Call, usually last season don’t get much hype cause people don’t know how to end shows nowadays.  but the writing and directing the camera action Vince is literally goated some of the best I’ve ever seen. Even breaking bad the writing is crazy and camera action always stood out to me.
Good Morning Call,"INB4 they make a cringey remake or spinoff in like 2 years without him

I love Nacho too mucho"
Good Morning Call,I thought he was going to make a series about that vet doctor thought that was a really cool idea
Good Morning Call,"Wait, but what about the prequel ""Hanging with Howard Hamlin""?"
Good Morning Call,"Between BB, BCS and the one off Jesse movie I think the Breaking Bad story has been fully told.

&#x200B;

Some of the best TV of all time."
Good Morning Call,Must be nice to be so successful you can walk away from what made you successful. Serious comment. No snark intended.
Good Morning Call,They should do a No Country for Old Men show. That’d be pretty sweet imo.
Good Morning Call,Wanted more mike and Gus backstory but oh well
Good Morning Call,"If David Simon could make great TV without having to resort back to his greatest creation, why can't you?"
Good Morning Call,Wait it's still not over?
Good Morning Call,As long as I never have to see a 40 something year old Aaron Paul play a 20 something year old Jesse Pinkman again
Good Morning Call,"Next up will be a sequel with Finn who starts cooking meth himself after finding half of his dads formula which later on leads to a search for Jessie and the other half.

I hope not but these days everything is a universe and they need sequels ..."
Good Morning Call,Given that Kim is the only one who seemingly escapes Jimmy I think it's only fair she gets her own El Camino. If that means 2 hours of Kim playing checkout at some hodunk grocery store so be it.
Good Morning Call,come on Vince… We all want a cartel series!
Good Morning Call,"I really want him to do a Half-Life show, couldn't tell you why, I just think it'd be good."
Good Morning Call,I really like Gilligan as a director on the X-Files. Has he done anything worth watching since then?
Good Morning Call,"dont worry, as long as theres money to be made, spinoffs will be made, 

Im sure they will make another breaking bad spinoff, if they had half a brain, they would make a show about gus, its basically free money."
Good Morning Call,Not a Jesse Pinkman or Hank show? Aw come on!
Good Morning Call,"Or, hear me out, what if you reboot the X-Files"
Good Morning Call,Would be nice to watch all of season 6 on Netflix
Good Morning Call,I'm ready to make a joke about Breaking Bad cameo in whatever he planned next.
Good Morning Call,A lalo spinoff would be awesome
Good Morning Call,"It’s nice to have one guy in Hollywood who knows when enough is enough. 

We don’t need ANOTHER Spider-Man"
Good Morning Call,What about Better Fuck Chuck or Better Fuel Huell? Unbravo Vince
Good Morning Call,So much for my dreams of a Lalo prequel. :)
Good Morning Call,Game of Thrones by Vince could be awesome!
Good Morning Call,Good cause the last 3 episodes of BCS made me fall asleep.
Good Morning Call,"He could have done something new with Saul, and I thought he was going to the way they had Kim's arc play out, but no.  She's a surprise Skylar after all.  All wives have to have some innate moral compass that makes them the antagonist who shits on the criminal dreams of their men.  

It's like Vince's motto is ""Women be Trippin'"".  Even our girl Marion fell victim to his trope."
Good Morning Call,Also Vince Gilligan: so my next show’s gonna be a prequel about the Salamancas
Good Morning Call,"ITT: bunch of people salivating over potential series based in the BC universe, despite the headline"
Good Morning Call,"Knowing Kim doesn’t die is a spoiler, even if we’re fully caught up on all the aired episodes."
Good Morning Call,It was dead before Call Saul
Good Morning Call,"I struggled with BCS, I didn’t find it very engaging."
Good Morning Call,The problem with that is nothing new he does will ever be as interesting as the Breaking Bad universe. Its like a rap artist going country. It would be a better idea to do a new series based on Jesse after BB or on Gus before BB.
Good Morning Call,Based off his work in El Camino I’d love to see him get after some feature films. He’s got quite a unique and enthralling style about his work from writing to cinematography especially when it comes to creating tension. Excited to watch more of his career!
Good Morning Call,"I loved his work on the x files so I'd love to see him creating a sci-fi show. I remember he said that he was working on a jonestown show called ""Raven"" for HBO a few years ago, I wonder if he is still working on it or it was scrapped."
Good Morning Call,Very excited for whatever else he's got brewing.
Good Morning Call,I look forward to what they come up with.
Good Morning Call,Sci-fi show please
Good Morning Call,Sucks I wish he would do more w it but whatever he does next I’m sure it’ll b great
Good Morning Call,Unbravo vince
Good Morning Call,Huell's Rules baby!
Good Morning Call,"Its a shame because id love to see more but its difficult now because of the age of characters and how many have died. I just rewatched BB for the first since it ended and its still so good especially getting back story on some key characters like Gus, Mike, and Saul. I will miss thia universe."
Good Morning Call,"I've been reading Alan Sepinwall's stuff since he had his own blog, ""What's Alan watching?"" And been reading his recaps of episodes in the BB universe for a huge chunk of my life. Happy to say goodbye, but I'm going to miss it all."
Good Morning Call,Next show: Does VG make Mexico yellow?
Good Morning Call,BB universe has had a great run. I just AMC can’t legally make anything without him..
Good Morning Call,"I just want to see the scene in the finale, a long shot of Saul and Mr.Driscoll talking."
Good Morning Call,Are we going to pretend that a show about a Salamanca story is not next?
Good Morning Call,Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Good Morning Call,I can’t see the Constitution and not sing the Preamble song
Good Morning Call,*crosses fingers* Pile of Bullets. Pile of Bullets.
Good Morning Call,"Good for him, I'm excited what he does next."
Good Morning Call,There goes the Kim spinoff I was hoping for in my head
Good Morning Call,"Books end. Movies end. Stories end. This universe, like all other universes built by authors worth their salt, have to end"
Good Morning Call,And here I was hoping for Breaking Badder next year.
Good Morning Call,Kid named finger spin off
Good Morning Call,"Feel as if I scrolled forever and no one pointed Hank could have his own spin off too. Dude is literally DEA and Gus donated to them for years, he could tie in a ton of the characters pre-Heisenberg"
Good Morning Call,"Damn,  I was looking forward to 6 seasons of Wendy's life......."
Good Morning Call,"Honestly, I do think he would be a good fit for the upcoming Netflix television series adaptation of *Death Note*. When initially watching *Breaking Bad*, it did feel like a non-supernatural take on *Death Note* in terms of basic character arcs, and the rise and fall of its protagonist."
Good Morning Call,"I’m in support of that, mean you made a great thing all hail to you, at this point all you can do is fuck it up somehow so yes leave it be and go craft a new gem"
Good Morning Call,One last bravo Vince
Good Morning Call,"Didn’t he say he’s leaving the universe for a while to prove he can create something else to himself, but that there’s still many stories to be told >_>"
Good Morning Call,Leave it before you fuck it up.
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,Weird. My wife watched the red carpet and told me he was there.
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"He lives in Montecito, which was under evacuation order because of flooding yesterday. I can understand how he might be more concerned with his family and their safety than the Golden Globes."
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,Oh no! Anyway....
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,r/firstworldproblems
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,I’m sure he’s so distraught /s
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"Laughing at this was not cool.  Regina Hall needs to take a breather. If for any reason to think, people have died. So he made it as an excuse. She actually was at an awards show, while people were losing their homes & so forth.  Wrong thing to roll your eyes at & laugh about with her."
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,That's just his stunt double.
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,RLy???
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,r/onepercentproblems
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,“guess i just gotta go back to my santa barbara estate alone- maybe my neighbor Oprahs home”
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"He didn’t make it as an excuse, it was a true fact."
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,I didn't mean to say he was lying. He used it as the reason he wasn't there.
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"Oh ok, I got ya."
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,This show was everywhere in the 90s. There were 90210 dolls.
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,Rest in peace Luke Perry
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,Back when theme songs were almost 2 minutes!  Loved this theme and Melrose Place and the iconic Special Guest Star title.
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,One of the greatest shows ever. Good ole days
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,Remember when Shannon Doherty was the tabloid 'Britney Spears' of the early 90's?
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"This is some peak 90s production here. Camera work, editing, color saturation, it's all on display."
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"It's pretty perfect. This theme and the show helped put FOX on the map. After a low-rated first season that ended in May 1991, FOX smartly launched season two in July and the key audience, out of school for the summer, discovered it."
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,I still have sideburns because of JP and LP.
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"Everyone growing up in the 90s watched it. 

It hasn't aged too well, but it was a big part of my youth."
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"Melrose Place's intro was way better.

The guitar riffs and main theme melody >>>> anything from 90210."
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"the intro is meh, and I thought the same when it first aired. MacGyver it ain't"
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,I still have some of the Topps Cards.
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,They are still in my attic somewhere!
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"Was he not 28, or something in this?"
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,🎶 Too many Cooks 🎶
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,shes still notorious for being insane and hard to work with
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,What about forehead wrinkles?
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"Born in the 80s.  I knew of it, heard a ton about it, but never watched it

I thought it was a cop show until right now"
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,Pogs
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,Yep
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,Ooh is she?! I haven’t heard much. Like what?
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannen_Doherty#%22Bad_girl%22_reputation
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,Ohhh okay I thought you meant there was something recent and ongoing
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"oh nah, she has terminal cancer at the moment, but I remember there being issues in one of her last projects within the last 5 years"
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"Carteris is older than Ziering. 

Carteris turned 30 during the first season when the character was 15. Ziering turned 30 in Season 4, when the characters were in college."
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,She was/is 3 years older than Ziering.
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,If I recall correctly people made fun of Ian losing his hair while playing a teenager.
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,We made fun of his acting instead
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,In my circle people made fun of all the supposed teenage cast.
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,She looked 40
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"As mentioned here, GC was even older than Ian. But GC seemed much older than anyone else on cast."
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"They aren't the same age.  Ziering was born in '64, Carteris in '61."
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"Also, Steve was a light-hearted fun character while Ohn-drea was a bit of a pill that none of the other characters particularly liked."
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"Pure sexism by Hollywood. Although through media, I saw many fans of the show were making fun of most of the cast who were playing teenagers  when they were in their late 20's or early 30's . People in my school would make jokes about the ""old""  cast members"
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,maybe because she wasn't really considered to be all that attractive
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,[deleted]
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,Its only 3 years difference. Not that big of an age gap.
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"By that logic the entire cast would get made fun of for being too old, even the ones playing their age."
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"Your logic is even worse . David Austin Greene & Tori Spelling were that only one remotely close to their character ages. Never heard anyone picking on them. Just heard people making fun of Jason Priestly, Luke Perry, Shannon Doherty, Gabrielle Carteris & Ian Ziering for how old they were when playing high schoolers."
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,What is my logic?  And if people were picking on all the ones you named where is the sexism???
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"By that logic the entire cast would get made fun of for being too old, even the ones playing their age. 

How does that make any sense.

The sexism came from Hollywood always singling out women for the age criticism. The fans were the one making fun of both sexes."
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"> By that logic the entire cast would get made fun of for being too old, even the ones playing their age.
How does that make any sense.

If your standard is Ziering is too old because he is within 3 years of Carteris, that would mean everyone within 3 years of Ziering is also too old, and then everyone within 3 years of them, etc.

> The sexism came from Hollywood always singling out women for the age criticism. The fans were the one making fun of both sexes.

So you just didn’t understand what OP was asking?"
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,I thought they were all too old to e playing high school kids except for Greene & Spelling . I mention the 3 yr age gap because everyone made a  big deal of it. Who cares if Ian  was 3 yes younger than Gabrielle. That makes it ok for them to single her out for ageist jokes.  I understood what the OP  was asking. Did you?
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"You just said to me multiple times that she wasn’t singled out, that 5 members of the cast got made fun of.  OP asked why Ian Ziering never got ageist jokes and you are saying to me he did, but for some reason didn’t say that to OP."
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"I said she got singled out by Hollywood mostly, but I heard through the media at the time  that' the fans were making fun  of most of the cast."
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"It was still really popular, but it had fallen off the discussion table as people were aging out of it there were plenty of other TV shows doing similar things to discuss"
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"Nah, by the end the ratings were about half what they were, and most of the original popular characters were gone, and the show just petered out, and it wasn't a show people talked about much.  Young Adult shows tend to have a window where there viewers will age out after awhile.

Although, of course, modern TV shows would kill for the ratings 90210 had when it was cancelled."
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,Not as popular as its peak but it still had a very loyal following.  For a lot of people it aired during their high school years so sticking with it all the way was like closing that chapter of their lives.
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,Growing up I think most of the older kids stopped talking about it by 95-96 at the latest.
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"It probably should’ve ended after they graduated college, but it was popular enough to keep going.  2000 was when the WB was really starting to peak and Fox was losing the attention of the young audience.  Something people might forget is that BH90210 was cranking out 32 episodes/season for most of its run, which is absolutely crazy looking back."
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"Only the series finale, and that was just because Donna and David were getting married.

In the later years, Shannon was gone.... Luke was gone... Its light was dimmed."
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"nope, it peaked around season five I think, then it began its downward trajectory as us teens started to find other interests"
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"The ratings had dropped significantly, ranking 82nd of 94 network shows. The network kept it on as long as they could. By the final season, only Jennie Garth, Ian Ziering, Brian Austin Green, and Tori Spelling remained from the original cast. They had long since left high school and many new characters had come and gone by that point, as had spin-off Melrose Place."
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,No.
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,[deleted]
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"I was in high school when it started.  It was pretty relevant.   Later?  Nah.  They started to look way too old and it was weird.   I was supposed to be their age but they looked 10+ years older.  Those actors are all born in the 60s or maybe 71 and were really pushing it to begin with.

Edit:  1964, 1966, 1969, 1971, 1972.  They were old."
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,it was one of those shows people were surprised was still on as that had stopped watching years before
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,I was in high school during the beginning seasons and it was the talk of the school each week.  But as I graduated high school and went to college many of the fans and my friends went on to watching Melrose Place.
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"The show's original focus was on the Walsh family but by the end of the series, there wasn't a single Walsh left."
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"It was huge when the gang was in high school. After that, people didn’t seem to care about it as much. When it was on the air, I watched it until about half way through season 6. Then I stopped watching because it got dumb. It wasn’t until I was an adult that I finally watched the series in full."
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,Luke came back for the final two seasons.
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,Luke perry too
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,not the first or last show with actors old enough to be high school teachers playing high school students
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"My favorite was The OC. Blended humor and drama well, good stories too.

Least eh, never got into Dawsons Creek"
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"The OC had self awareness so you could enjoy the soap opera drama and laugh at it at the same time. Plus it had comic book references and a ton of great music and even performances like Modest Mouse.

Oh and Sandy Cohen may be the greatest dad ever on screen. Yogolatesss."
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"OTH was my favorite. Really enjoyed the sports focus (primarily in the first four seasons) and the character evolutions of Nathan, Brooke, and Dan. Great music as well.

The OC had fantastic music and a great cast, but the train wreck that was Season 3 really prevents me from considering that my favorite. It was almost a relief when Marissa was finally killed off. Taylor Townsend was a breath of fresh air, though.

Gossip Girl was an incredible mix of music (same music expert as The OC), fashion, and the high life. The East Coast version of the OC. Dorota should have been Gossip Girl. ;)

Dawson’s Creek episodes tend to drag more than the aforementioned shows, but it’s still an enjoyable show. Pacey/Joey forever."
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"Though Gossip Girl is my favorite, I love how Degrassi followed the kids from 7th grade all the way to graduating college. It felt like growing up with them. I can’t think of any other (teen) show that had a cast stick with it as long as that one. Specifically talking about the characters of Emma and Manny."
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"The O.C. has Rachel Bilson.  None of those other shows can say that.

At the time I liked Dawson's Creek too."
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"My favorite was Everwood, though I also enjoyed the first half of One Tree Hill. I was sort of digging Netflix's Degrassi revival but it has since been canceled."
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"Just started The O.C for the first time ever, and I'm absolutely loving it so far, favourite would be Degrassi can't go wrong with a classic"
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,Happy Days
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,I loved 90210!
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"Teen Wolf was fun for the first two/three seasons. Campy high school melodrama, werewolf fights, and a season long arc, what's not to love? Eventually, it started to drag. I made half way through Season 5 and just never got back into it."
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"As child of the 90’s who was a teenager in the early 00’ the holy trinity was The OC, One Tree Hill and Gossip Girl. Although that latter one didn’t have as much heart as the first two it was still fun to a point especially being set in NYC.

Dawson Creek lacked self awareness and those kids talked like English PHDs.

BH90210 was before my time so I never personally connected to it."
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"I love One Tree Hill despite the fact that it's not even remotely realistic. I grew up watching BH90210 with my mom, which is what started my unhealthy obsession with Luke perry. He's the whole reason I even started watching Riverdale. I know Dawson's Creek gets a lot of flack but I can't help it... I like it too, but I can not stand Dawson. He is so damn whiney and entitled. The show could have done without him. I think Gossip Girl has to be the worst. It started out well enough, and I like Chuck and Blair together but the ending pretty much ruined the entire show for me."
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,Degrassi Junior High / Degrassi High
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"It's Degrassi Jr High for me. We used to watch it in middle school health class in the 80s.

Erika having an abortion, Shane jumping off a bridge high on acid, Wheels getting molested, those old ones had it all."
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"Big fan of coming of age stories, so teen dramas often fit the bill as well, my favorites tend to be British and/or supernaturally inclined

Skins (first generation only)

My Mad Fat Diary

Misfits

The End of The F'n World

I am Not Okay With This

Stranger Things

Buffy

&#x200B;

not a big fan of most of the bigger american stuff, they tend to fall into the worst tropes, unless it has a supernatural angle, then it is too much for me to resist."
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"It was remarkable how much of a smash hit The OC was when it came out. Everyone talks about 90s nostalgia, but the early 00s were such a time of a certain kind of carefree you don’t see anymore. The show was about rich people in Southern California, and the show somehow managed to make that compelling."
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"Gossip Girl was my favorite because it was New York and it was an escapist rich fantasy for me. I don't think any of them were really similar to my high school experience but that's probably because I was more of an ""extra"" during high school rather than the main character.  The worst would have to go to either Riverdale or Pretty Little Liars. Then again, Gossip Girl isn't that much better."
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"At the time of their airing, I preferred One Tree Hill. That and The OC were the two big teen dramas of my high school years and most of the people in my school flocked to OTH because it was filmed in Wilmington and we were roughly 70 miles away, so it was really cool seeing places we recognized on TV. 

I think I stopped watching that during college because it got too ridiculous. I think the last episode I actually watched on live tv was the one where the service Golden Retriever ate Dan's heart transplant off of the hospital floor in front of him. 

After that I actually started watching The OC on dvd because my brother had them and I was bored over the summer. I actually ended up liking that a lot more even though it was also ridiculous, but not quite as much as OTH. Both had fantastic soundtracks though, I still listen to them a lot. I might actually have to do a re-watch of at least the first season of OTH and the first two of The OC. 

I also really enjoyed Everwood, which is by far the superior quality show out of all of them. But, I've never considered that as a teen drama (even though it was) since it had much more than just the teen angst. Plus, I was in middle school when that was on and for some reason I really associate teen dramas as such if they were airing during my actual high school years. I watched it faithfully every Monday night and was super bummed when they decided to un-cancel 7th Heaven in favor of renewing Everwood."
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,South of Nowhere was an underrated tv show IMO. It dealt with so many relatable themes.
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"**Favorite Teen drama - Smallville** - it was over the top and cheesy, but it had a great soundtrack and Lex was cool. 

**Closest to depicting the average teen experience** - tbh, none were close. 

**The absolute worst -Dawson's Creek** - they all looked a lot older than what they were supposed to be, they talked liked well educated late 20-early 30 somethings on a caffeine buzz, and they were **so** melodramatic. Dawson was a whiny flake. Joey complained about the dumbest shit - she complained about never finding love.......and she was 16. Pacey was an ass - he slept with engaged and married women. Jen was angry without a cause. 

**The one no one seems to mention anymore - Felicity** - they were technically teens. Its a weird show, made by JJ Abrams and the guy who is now making the new Batman show........and it was about a ""nerdy"" stalker who followed a guy she didn't know across the country to attend college in NYC. She was ""quirky"" as she talked to her mentor/friend via tape recorder. The guy she stalked (Ben) had anger issues and seemingly pretty dumb (how did he get acceptance to college?). They all had some weird older friend (Sean) whose business was coming up with stupid ideas.....its never clear how he made money or afforded that huge apartment in NYC or why he hung out with college kids. The most interesting character (Julie) left the show early. And in the end Felicity's whole journey seemingly ended up where she started - she decided to become an artist in college, and did that for the entire series.......until the last few episodes when she suddenly switched to becoming a doctor."
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,Happy Days?
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"Gossip Girl was my favorite of them - the first few seasons really lived up to the marketing campaign they had going.

That being said, it got pretty bad after a while and I generally think all teen dramas should end or reshuffle the cast after 2-3 years. Skins (British version obviously) did it right in that regard."
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,I feel as though these types of shows have been superseded by genre shows like Riverdale and The Vampire Diaries.
The Celebrity Plastic Surgeons of Beverly Hills,"Let’s add the hot mess that is the always iconic Riverdale. 

Daddikins, darkness, Archie fought a bear. Welcome to Riverdale."
Under Arrest,"Westworld, not my kind 😒"
Under Arrest,I’ve tried to get into the leftovers several times. It’s just too depressing for me!
Under Arrest,Rick and Morty. I just really don't get it.
Under Arrest,Mr. Robot. It's one of my ex-boyfriends favorite shows so I really wanted to love it and we generally had similar taste in television but for some reason I couldn't get into it. I pushed through the entire first season and appreciated the story and could acknowledge that it was good television but had no desire to continue watching. I think part of the problem is that I found the dialogue to be kind of cringey.
Under Arrest,"Euphoria. I watched “Kids"" when it came out in the 90s and it’s the same thing."
Under Arrest,"Bojack Horseman. I wish I liked it. I absolutely love the cast and the subject matter interests me, but it just doesn't click. Boo. I feel like I am missing out."
Under Arrest,"Shameless (US), watched the first season and a half, seemed like the show didn't know what it was supposed to be. We're we supposed to root for any of the characters? William H. Macy's character was the only one I could get behind, he's a piece a shit, we're laughing at him, hoping whatever scheme he gets himself into will fail miserably. But the show wanted to focus on the kids, who I didn't like or care about"
Under Arrest,"Schitt's Creek.
Heard so many positive things about it, including from a friend who loved it.
Watched the first 6-7 episodes of Season 1. Couldn’t get into it. The characters were so irredeemable. Same reason I stopped watching Succession.
Yet I love Always Sunny in Philadelphia and Rick & Morty. Two other shows with irredeemable characters."
Under Arrest,I got like four or five episodes into Atlanta before I just gave up.
Under Arrest,Mad Men. I found it very boring
Under Arrest,Game of Thrones
Under Arrest,[removed]
Under Arrest,Ozark -  I have tried watching it twice and have failed both times. I watched most of the 1st season and just didn’t see the appeal. It was slow paced and the characters were annoying.
Under Arrest,Breaking Bad
Under Arrest,"I Think You Should Leave With Tim Robinson. I watched the entire first season, but it just didn't click with me at all."
Under Arrest,Big Bang Theory
Under Arrest,The Wire. Tried countless times to get into it but just couldn't
Under Arrest,"For me right now, Abbot Elementary School. It's ok as a ""put it as a background noise"", but I absolutely don't understand why it's praised as much as it is and why it is nominated in so many award shows. It's a very average sitcom."
Under Arrest,I love comedies. I love satire. I still don't get the fuss over Larry Sanders and Curb Your Enthusiasm.
Under Arrest,"Succession. We're watching a hoard of monsters damaging each other, where the audience has no hope for good outcomes. It feels like there's no comment worth making on this tier of society - we all know they're awful, and from moment one it felt like joylessly beating a dead horse."
Under Arrest,The Americans. I tried on three different occasions but I just could not get into it.
Under Arrest,"The Sopranos, gave it a legit shot but lost interest after what felt lie the 400th dream sequence."
Under Arrest,"Legion: I love Noah Hawley and will probably give it another shot at some poin,t but the first season too often felt weird for weird's sake."
Under Arrest,The walking dead. After multiple attempts I just couldn’t get into watching it.
Under Arrest,"Season 4 of Attack of Titan. It seems to be the most popular season of an extremely popular show, but I just don't get it. I liked the show just fine for the first two seasons, but then it slowly went downhill and with S4 I just literally lost all interest."
Under Arrest,"This seems like a weird one for me, because on paper it has absolutely everything I want in a sci-fi show, but: The Expanse. I couldn't even tell you what it was that I had a problem with. I watched the whole first season and a couple episodes of the second season, but for whatever reason it just never clicked with me."
Under Arrest,"Is Yellowstone a critically acclaimed show?

I've been trying to get into it, but I just can't. None of the characters are interesting enough to keep me watching. I think I'm on episode 5 now and it's a drag tbh.

The same with Peaky Blinders. I think I've only made it through season 1 and just can't bring myself to continue. I really wanted to get to Tom Hardy's introduction..."
Under Arrest,"Law and Order: Organized Crime. How is this franchise still a thing? I like SVU but even then it should have been canceled ages ago. I was happy to see Stabler back but I don’t care for the drawn out plotlines of OC.

The Office: I did try a few seasons (especially because I live near Scranton and people are still obsessed with it) but found it unfunny more often than not."
Under Arrest,"Will I get kicked out of Reddit for saying Rick and Morty?

It's just way too over the top."
Under Arrest,"Fleabag. I tried, I really did…"
Under Arrest,White Lotus. Why were the teen girls rude to the mom at the pool? I didn’t understand why the awkward brother was supposed to sleep in the kitchen in the condo. I couldn’t figure out how grounded/ungrounded the show’s reality was supposed to be. I didn’t “get it” and now I’m on the pop culture sideline missing out.
Under Arrest,Dark. I watched 3 episodes and couldn't understand what was going on so I decided I'm probably not smart enough to watch this show and gave up.
Under Arrest,Stranger Things. I thought it was a cheap nostalgia  trap.
Under Arrest,Arrested Development
Under Arrest,The Wire. Didn’t have a clue what was going on.
Under Arrest,"Stranger Things. Damn it, I've tried...and tried to like it. I've seen most of the first season and it just didn't grab me. I wasn't drawn in, I never got invested in the characters, I just couldn't make myself LIKE it. And yes, all my friends are disappointed in me for it."
Under Arrest,The Sopranos.  I just found it so depressing.  I couldn't get through more than a couple episodes.
Under Arrest,White Lotus
Under Arrest,"Breaking Bad

I tried but I kept falling asleep. Nothing about the story was particularly appealing to me. I didn't identify with the main character at all."
Under Arrest,Six feet under. 😬
Under Arrest,"Deadwood, I didn't hate it but I never really got into it watching it with my wife"
Under Arrest,"I tried watching ""The White Lotus."" I finished the first episode, and it just didn't resonate with me at all. For a character driven show, I just didn't care for any of them."
Under Arrest,The White Lotus. Watched a couple episodes. Quit after that. Every character is unlikable and boring. I was shocked to learn it won a bunch of awards.
Under Arrest,[deleted]
Under Arrest,Succession. I find it so boring.
Under Arrest,"i'm not gonna list shows like breaking bad or better call soul because those aren't even my type of shows, so i wouldn't have bothered watching them regardless of them being popular or not.

but shows like grace and frankie, the office, parks and rec. people seem to constantly rave about those shows and i just don't get it, they're not funny"
Under Arrest,"White Lotus. 

It was so highly recommended and my fiancée and I were really excited to watch it. Normally we’re able to give things a chance to pick up, but after the first three episodes we still couldn’t understand the point. It didn’t seem like much was happening or even building up and at least for those first episodes, I couldn’t really find a character I liked all that much. 

Keep hearing great things but am thinking it’s just not for us."
Under Arrest,"Succession. Tried when it premiere and only watch 1 episode. So many keep saying it is good.

So a few weeks ago I tried again. This time I got to S2 E3 and then I had so much other stuff to watch I still did not continue. Still do not quite understand the praise and I do like Rich family politics, for example Righteous gemstone. 

Andor, never get past E4 and I am a star wars fan. 

The Expanse. Did not get past E1 and I love Battlestar Galactica, both old and new."
Under Arrest,"Everything in my dna says I should love game of thrones 

Can’t get past the first episode"
Under Arrest,"Hard ditto on The Leftovers and I’ll add Six Feet Under.

Watching privileged people constantly shooting themselves in the foot gets old quick. The series finale doesn’t have the same impact when you’re not emotionally invested in the characters, either."
Under Arrest,"Dark. I enjoyed the initial mystery, but it just started to get very convoluted to the point where watching it fee like a chore, rather than entertainment."
Under Arrest,"True detective, any season. Self indulgent dialogue with glacier plot progression."
Under Arrest,It'd be easier to list the critically acclaimed shows I like. I hate most of the hyped stuff these says.
Under Arrest,"Got, Ozarks, breaking bad."
Under Arrest,"Honestly, for all the praise and acclaim it's getting Abbott Elementary is not that good. It's really dry, predictable, over-done... not a fan. It's not terrible terrible but it's just, meh. Like ok. Didn't deserve an Emmy, and all the praise it's getting, that's for sure. 3/10"
Under Arrest,"Moment I saw the title I was going to say the Leftovers as well. I heard so many good things about it and really wanted to enjoy it but could only sit through like two-three episodes before I bailed. I didn't care for any of the characters, felt like everyone acted really weirdly and, idk if this'll make sense, but I felt like it thought it was more clever than it actually was"
Under Arrest,You. It got old fast
Under Arrest,Seinfeld
Under Arrest,"Dark. I manage to watch almost all of S1 but couldn't keep going. No, I wasn't having problems following the plot, I understood everything perfectly, my real problem might be that I had very high expectations because of the internet constantly praising it that when I finally got into it I was disappointed, I might give it another shot some day but for now I thought it was very underwhelming and kinda boring."
Under Arrest,"Breaking Bad - I couldn't get into this show at all. I didn't like the characters, the premise or the execution. It may have improved after I stopped watching but I'll never know since I have no desire to revisit it.

The Good Place - I hate watched the whole thing a while back. Repetitive, unfunny and full of annoying characters. I only have myself to blame for not ending the torture earlier."
Under Arrest,The Boys on Amazon Prime. Awful people doing awful things for no good reason. And so much gratuitous gore and violence.
Under Arrest,Seinfeld and Frasier.
Under Arrest,"Game of Thrones and Peaky Blinders. I still think that most of the actors were pretty good and I sometimes watched some parts with my bf; some storylines were actually kinda neat, but just not enough to watch multiple seasons of either."
Under Arrest,Atlanta
Under Arrest,Friends
Under Arrest,"Was going to answer the leftovers before I clicked on the post. It's all well and good to have a big mystery as the setting event for a character study and it doesn't have to solved to work in that respect, but the characters are all boring and unlikeable, so it doesn't even do that well. It definitely thinks it is more clever than it actually is as well. Watched an entire season of that show waiting for it to get good."
Under Arrest,"The Good Place. I hated every single character. And I really gave it a shot, I watched 3 seasons and hated every minute, lmao. I kept thinking it had to get better. It did not."
Under Arrest,"totally unrelated but the americans, the leftovers, succession, six feet under"
Under Arrest,The Sopranos
Under Arrest,Y’all are missing out on so much good TV because you’re not hooked by like episode 3. Gotta give things more of a chance than that
Under Arrest,The same. I dont understand whats the leftover is about. Just a good made hbo show without a plot.
Under Arrest,"Breaking bad. No one is redeemable, like they want you to loathe all the characters. Got a season and change in and bailed. I have heard i may like Better Call Saul better…"
Under Arrest,"Succession. Forced myself to watch the first nine episodes thinking, based on the hype, that it would get better. It never did. None of the characters are likable. And before someone chimes in with ""that's the point!"" - I don't care. Just because it's intentional doesn't mean it's entertaining. I'm glad other people liked it but I just thought it was terrible.

Also Hannibal."
Under Arrest,"As a huge fan of bobs burgers:

Archer...

I managed to giggle at more than a few scenes in honesty, but I just couldn't keep my attention on the show consistently and found myself bored more than not.

It's been a couple years since I tried to watch it, maybe I'll try again soon.

I really love HJ Benjamin as a voice actor though..."
Under Arrest,"Game of Thrones. Five minutes into the first episode I see a dude’s head chopped off and I’m all, “Ok. I get it.”"
Under Arrest,This Is Us
Under Arrest,I absolutely loathe Big Bang Theory
Under Arrest,"Breaking bad. 
I tried watching the first two episodes. 
Just not my cup of tea"
Under Arrest,"Riverdale,  Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, Game of Thrones, Doctor Who, Grey's Anatomy"
Under Arrest,[deleted]
Under Arrest,Back in the 90's everybody was into Friends and I never understood the hype around it.
Under Arrest,"I tried watching American Horror Story, and it left a bad taste in my mouth. None of the characters acted like real people and there was nothing scary going on."
Under Arrest,[deleted]
Under Arrest,"Game of Thrones - I don't enjoy treachery, treason, double crossing, threats, and macho posturing.  I can tolerate it for a two hour movie but not for a 50 or 60 hour series."
Under Arrest,Schitt’s Creek was awful. Mad Men as well
Under Arrest,House of the Dragon. A show so boring and empty some girl wearing a green dress is seen as a major moment.
Under Arrest,"The White Lotus, goddamnit that was such a pain to go through the 2 episodes I managed to stick with it"
Under Arrest,Community
Under Arrest,NBCs Thursday night comedies of the 2010s.
Under Arrest,"**Lost**

I’ve sat down and watched the first episode 3 times now, and yet to even start episode two. I just haven’t got it in me,  I don’t know why. 

I love Abrams work, I especially love Fringe, but Lost is just… *Lost* to me."
Under Arrest,Witcher.  I got two episodes in and felt nothing in moments I was clearly expected to feel something.
Under Arrest,"The Boys. There are a number of reasons why I *should* love it, but I could never stomach more than the first few episodes."
Under Arrest,"Friends. Nothing clicked for me. Not to mention I'm bad with faces, so I can't tell the male leads apart."
Under Arrest,"Only a season under my belt granted but the consensus *is* that it's good TV so I feel safe in saying Lost (*For me*) just isn't very good. Don't like using overrated, who am I to say people are ""rating it too highly"", whatever that means, just because I didn't like it. But I'm not seeing it, it felt beyond standard and soapy. IT Crowd for a comedy. It's weird because I think Father Ted for example is one of the funniest shows I've ever seen, but I ended up inwardly pleading for more Richmond screentime because it was about the only time I found the show amusing. 

Here's one I changed my mind on as a silver lining: Despite loving Lynch's movies I felt very mixed on Twin Peaks at first. But The Return being perhaps the best revival of all time gave me a new lease on it. I still think that's better given the straight drama primarily with the teens falls flat in the original and the show is best when it's light and comedic or terrifying and strange, but those elements really are done well and I should pay attention to what works over what doesn't."
Under Arrest,"It’s Always Sunny. 

Everything about that show is exactly my type of thing. It’s right up my alley but for some reason I just can’t click with it."
Under Arrest,Better call Saul
Under Arrest,Mad Men.
Under Arrest,"Game of Thrones, Lost"
Under Arrest,Peaky Blinders. So fucking boring.
Under Arrest,What shows do you actually like? Every show mentioned in here you agree you don’t like. I think The Leftovers is the greatest show ever and have no clue what you mean by corny music.
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,HBO to Naughty Dog: “ima need you to make a third game or we’ll write our own part three”
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,But did you know that diarrhea is hereditary?
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,Roughly 20% growth episode on episode is insane. These numbers are insane
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,Execs everywhere now combing over every video game ever
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,I’ve been loving this show so much. I’m so glad someone who actually cares for the source material is making this show.
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,should hopefully keep steady til final.
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,"How do the ratings compare between Friday and Sunday nights in the US? I know there are games on other channels on Sunday, but aren't a lot of people out on a Friday night?"
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,"Crazy thing about well made shows: people watch them. 

Together we can stop shitty entertainment, but we need to work together on this people"
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,"Said it the the second week, I'll say it again

Season finale will have HOTD finale numbers, 10+M."
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,Well it helps that the show is really good. Not many shows live up to the hype this had. As a Halo fan I gave up on the show. I’m sure the relative loyalty of the source is retaining fans.
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,Aw the IMDB review bombing is working real well
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,[deleted]
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,"The more I enjoy this great show, the sadder I feel about how they absolutely butchered the Witcher and the Wheel of Time..."
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,This show is absolutely killing it!
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,"i have not been a hype man for this show at all and i gotta say it's the best videogame adaptation that i know of. typical HBO quality in regards to everything. every episode has been solid and last week's was phenomenal and reminded me of what the walking dead could have been if it was on HBO.

if they push this to two or three seasons by adapting the second game i can totally see it becoming an all-timer for the network. the people making this show know what they're doing."
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,"recipe to success is very simple

\- simple story

\- complex characters"
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,Have they mentioned whether season 1 is the full game? Because already episode 5…meaning only 4 hours left of story which blows my mind.
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,"**It's the behemoth that keeps on growing:**

>Episode 4 of *THE LAST OF US* delivered another series high Sunday night, with 7.5 million viewers across HBO Max and linear telecasts. Viewership was up 17% from Episode 3 last Sunday and 60% above the series debut night in January. Viewing is based on Nielsen and first party data. The series has grown its audience each Sunday night with the release of new episodes."
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,cant stop the pedro train
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,Season 2 is going to be off the hook.
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,Not that surprising consider this is its first week without NFL playoffs.
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,"I'm one of the people who helped it grow this weekend.  We hadn't checked it out yet, but I kept hearing so much good feedback about the 3rd episode that I finally decided to check the show out.  My wife and I watched the first episode Friday night and were instantly hooked.  What a well written, directed and acted show so far.

The 3rd episode was a masterpiece, imo.  I've never been so emotionally invested in a pair of one-off characters before.  My wife had tears in her eyes for half the episode.  Not going to elaborate to avoid spoilers.  

Only 4 episodes so far, but no clunkers and no filler.  If it keeps up this pace, it will be my favorite new show since The Expanse."
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,"Oh, so you mean all the right wing backlash because episode three had some gay dudes in it amounted to nothing?

Shocker.

These people might be loud assholes, but they’re the minority and they’re slowly being relegated to the sad pages of history."
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,A truly impressive video game to TV series adaptation so far. They deviate from the source material when it makes for a better story and I'm here for it
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,"You know what?  Good for everyone involved.  When people make a good product to tell a good story everybody wins.  I'm looking forward to the season closing out so I can watch it all in one go and I'll do the same in the second season, too."
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,"I love how terminally online bigots said it would drop like crazy after the third episode and then this happens. Like even I expected a slight drop, but it didn't come. This is absolutely insane."
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,Surely this can’t be true. A bunch of people online told me that HBO pushing their woke agenda in Ep. 3 was going to kill the show??
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,maybe an unpopular opinion but i felt Ep. 4 was the best one so far. only wish it was longer. great character development in this one and still some cool action scenes
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,This is easily one of the best shows I’ve ever seen.
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,"The creative talent behind this show is off the chain. Craig Mazin has done a tremendous job adapting the source material and building upon an already incredible story. The casting across the board has been A+. The decision to have Peter Hoar direct Ep.3 was a stroke of genius, with his previous work on It's a Sin making total sense. Just goes to show what can happen when talented people are passionate about a project and given the means to see their vision come about."
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,"And this is in spite of half of Canadians being left unable to watch it for a couple of hours because our telecom company, bell, is garbage."
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,Praise Druckmann. The man is just on a roll every week with the amazing episodes
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,Dad jokes delivered!
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,"It's amazing what can be achieved when they create a show that is faithful to the spirit of the source material, rather than trying to make wholesale changes in an almost condescending fashion. No one cares about a particular writer or directors idea for how to reimagine a beloved IP just for the sake of making it their own. The audience want the IP. They want what makes that series great.

I don't want an Assassin's Creed movie where the dude is jumping around in some virtual room for example instead of going into the animus as you do in every single game. What the fuck was that even? They completely missed what mattered"
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,I have been doing my part to get as many people into it as possible haha
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,"Pedro Pascal seems like a magnet to drawing viewers. GoT, Mandalorian, Last of Us he’s doing great"
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,This almost guarantees a third last of us game and probably a 3rd season of the show also.
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,Good show
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,They can easily stretch part 2 into 2 seasons
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,"Everyone and their mother is on this.

Which is great, it's a good story and they're doing a good job since they care.

Thing is that the game is cinematic on its own, and I'm glad new people are exposed to it (which was definitely one of the goals) but don't forget, It isn't totally new. So, I'm glad the adaptation is good but the story existed in the last 10 years at this point.

I guess this main stream we-discovered-something-amazing all of a sudden, kinda bugs me, I dunno."
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,But but but woke broke or w/e!?
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,I think ep4 was pretty mild compared to ep3. So I wonder if that surge will continue.
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,"Last episode was okay, first three were huge."
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,"It's so good. Not to harp on that dead horse velma, but when the wife and I decided to catch up on last of us..we had to get through three velma promotions to find it in the search bar. They're really advertising that sucker hard in front of last of us"
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,"While this news is exciting, the last episode was the least entertaining so far."
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,I must be the only person who felt that the show is severely overrated.
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,I don’t remember the last time there was so much hype surrounding a show. I’m trying to wait until the seasons over to binge it but it’s getting harder each week!
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,So tripping over the fact I watched the new episode with my mom of all people because apparently she is really into it. Pretty cool how its even pulling in people who have no frame of reference of the source material who are just loving it.
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,"Crazy how if you make a good show, people will watch it."
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,"Three seasons would be good, please dont drag it out forever like the walking dead"
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,"I'm curious if the show is also driving sales/downloads of the game. I think it's one of the ps plus classics they're giving away. 

Though it's been out for so long and in the video game world people have been raving about it since release, so I don't even know how big any untapped market could be."
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,"hopefully this sparks tv shows of other games. 

outlast, a good resident evil series, the evil within, amnesia, dying light, bio shock, horizon zero dawn, fallout, dead island, assassins creed. 

there is such a wealth of quality tv show content that could be made from existing video game universes"
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,Oh boy I can't wait for the David episode
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,It’s almost like good quality and slow releases build audience.
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,I'm surprised that I like it since I can't stand anything zombie.
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,"shows the benefit of streaming, can watch the service instead of having to have cable"
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,Sony must be happy.
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,E3 hit me right in the feels
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,Some would say it is growing like a fungus.
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,It was pretty good.
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,I’d be one too if hbo max app wasn’t crap
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,"Bruh i hope season two goes with the longer episodes every time, the shorter ones leave me wanting more but ep 1 n 3 really felt like complete episodes"
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,The show is really great!
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,I’m trying to get into it but im also still catching up on walking dead and I don’t think I have the capacity for both.
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,New gay demo is like “this ain’t what I signed up for”
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,Netflix would have cancelled it by now.
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,They need an Xbox version. Don’t hate me
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,I never played TLOU but am familiar with the concept and story line. Because of this show I'm watching a radbrad walk through and rewatched the last 3 episodes this week. Such a great show. Completely hooked.
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,"I'm liking this series so far, and it's really doing the games justice from a drama standpoint, but I can firmly say now I prefer the way the game tells this story.  That ambush scene was pretty disappointing compared to the way it played out the game."
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,"Still haven't seen one thing on this show that hasn't been done so many times before.  Character, plot, world, every single beat has been done so many times already.  Doesn't feel like there's any reason for the show to exist."
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,This just does not happen. Even HOT which was a hit for HBO didn't do it . It was decreasing week after week ever since the second episod premiered. Word of mouth is what selling this show.
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,"For those of you who haven't played the game, you can watch this playthrough of it once the show is over, (or can watch along as the show progresses). It will give you the gameplay experience and the close to a commentary from the creators/makers/performers of the game. Also helps in understanding the difference between the game and the show. Even for people who have this might give you a very good insight.

The playthrough is by Nolan North (performance actor for Nathan Drake of Uncharted, a generally bad gamer but funny person), assisted by Troy Baker (who plays Joel from the game) and more or less each episode will feature the actor who plays an important role in it.

Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,"When I first heard about this show I just thought oh no another Walking Dead, but I'm happy I started watching it, the first 4 episodes have been great but I hope they don't drag it out too long just to keep the show running. Quality of Quanity is better."
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,This is spreading hugely by word of mouth in my office at work.
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,The latest episode wasn’t anything special.
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,"The show is definitely doing the game justice. If season one ends where the first game does though, that’s probably where I’ll jump off. I’m not a fan of any of what they did in the second game. That whole narrative direction can get f’ed."
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,"It's a good show, I'm enjoying it....but I don't get the insane amount of hype surrounding it. It's good, but not the best thing I've ever seen, by a long shot."
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,"""Go Woke... ~~go broke~~ eeer get a larger audience"""
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,This show is so astroturfed.
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,Episode 5 is about to tank hard since they are (temporarily) moving it to Friday due to the Super Bowl.
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,"7.5 million viewers? If this were Netflix it would have been canceled 15 minutes into the first episode hahaha

/s so the Netflix love brigade does not kill me"
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,Where is the Metal Gear Solid series?
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,It’s too damn good.
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,"Honestly so far I have loved the show and it has easily passed my favourite shows, I just wasn't very fond of this weeks episode, sometimes we need slower episodes yes, but it didn't feel as good as the first 3 episodes."
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,Love to see it. This story was well written for the game and they have translated it so well to the screen. I hope we keep seeing growth as more episodes come out and I can’t wait to see the conversations that happens with the last episode and Joel’s choices.
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,Is this legit good? I've never played the game before but love to immerse myself in a well told story.
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,In episode 4 why didn't they just drive up the hill and cross the road and around the tunnel?
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,"So far this show hasn’t really been anything new, it’s not really a breath of fresh air. It’s hbo so the casting & acting is always elite. So far after 4 episodes I’d give it around a 7.3/10"
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,"sure it is, the publicity it's getting is also not normal"
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,"Uh, so it went woke but didn't go broke"
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,See what happens when you take the tome to show respect to the ip you’re adapting? It gets positive results. Take notes Velma 📝
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,"I thought that episode 3 last week was really good, but I am happy that it looks like they are back on track with the game's story"
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,Wow. I wonder what next week's headlines will be?
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,It’s mostly hype. It’s already becoming the worst of the walking dead. An hour show where nothing really happens.
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,Boring
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,I might be having a contrarian view out here. But i just don't understand what is the hype all about? This is one of the most disengaging big shows in recent times i have seen
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,So glad to know that episode three still did very well despite the homophobic review bombs
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,Could you imagine if Sony didn’t drop the ball on uncharted and try to cash cow that movie. That series could have been just as killer.
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,I cried when I finished game one.
Lupin the Third Mine Fujiko to iu onna,ima still wait till its all out
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"I don't suppose you could add a brief few sentences/words selling us on the series and why they're worth a watch and what makes them special? To me, I just see a laundry list of titles and genres honestly. 

Knowing the animation studio and year released is pretty much meaningless for knowing the quality of character development and plot depth."

Aaand you have great taste! Guess I'm gonna need to take recommendations off the rest of this list."

I was confused for a second there, then realized thats the English name for Kekkai Sensen."
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"Konosuba definitely should be on here for it's hilarious subversion, wherein everyone seems nice but are terrible people"
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,My Hero Academia is also really excellent.
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"I think you can also add Megalo Box to this list. While the ending wasn't as good, rest of the show was still great, and might actually suit most of the audience here. The old school animation and design, etc. "
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"Next time I would include Animes that would appeal to Western Taste. Most of these will not be appealing for the general audience. 

Some good animes for the Western Taste (2010s only):

One-Punch Man (Action/Comedy. An overpowered dude that is a hero for fun).


My Hero Academica (Action/Coming of Age story. A weak powerless boy gets the most powerful superpower in the world and his tale to master this power without breaking everything in his body using it.)


Psycho Pass (Thriller/Crime. Dystopian Future where police kills everyone who has a hint of mental instability)

Parasyte (Thriller/Horror. Dude gets infected by an alien parasite but the infection doesn't go as planned.)

Edit: Forgot to add that these all have English Dubs. Most of the list above do not.

Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"Gundam: Iron Blooded Orphans
Is a great one, its serious, the animation looks great, it does get dark because it deals with children piloting the mechs"
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"First, thank you putting this list together and trying to offer more exposure to an entire medium/format/genre (Japanese animation) that is, imo, underappreciated in the west. Now, on to a few thoughts/opinions:

When people actually ask for recommendations, it's best not to overwhelm them with options else they might feel overwhelmed and give up. If they get a response of ""Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, Death Note"" then they already have ~100 hours of watching ahead of them and those are totally fine options. 

There's a lot of comedy and slice of life on this list. While more variety sounds better on paper, I don't think those genres work as well as others with a language/culture barrier. They're usually more character focused and thus body language, dialog, inflection, dialect, translation, nuance, delivery, inside jokes, locality, animation style, etc. become more important. The usual Cowboy Bebop recommendations are generally more serious, conceptual, sci-fi, psychological, seinen, action, mystery -type series that show off what ""adult"" animation is capable of which result in more ""wow!"" experiences (and western media ""borrowing"" from them). The unfortunate ""anime stigma"" in the west is that anime is perverted and characters look/act like 12yo children (which westerners already have in the form of youth-targeted cartoons). So, while I personally really enjoy something like Kill La Kill, I don't think the over-the-top action, ridiculous plot, and easily misinterpreted sexualization would be a good starting point/leave a good first impression for the uninitiated. 

This list is great for those who have already watched most of the popular recommendations for westerners and want to branch out a bit more. That said, new fans should keep in mind that they'll probably dislike 95% of all anime produced. I've watched 300+ series and I wouldn't go anywhere near some of the stuff on this list. And that's OK; it's common with most hobbies/interests. Find what you like, look for more, have fun with it, share your experiences!

For reference, my favorite TV (top 10, random order):

* Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul
* Game of Thrones
* Westworld
* Black Mirror
* Lost
* The Wire
* Battlestar Galactica
* Utopia

Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"I was kinda hoping you would list [Uchuu Kyoudai](https://myanimelist.net/anime/12431/Uchuu_Kyoudai ) or Space Brothers in English.  Pretty good slice of life/sci fi about becoming an Astronaut.   Here is the [trailer with English sub for it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciS3fDqT1Vw )

Another series maybe not considered in the past decade is [Hajime No Ippo](https://myanimelist.net/anime/263/Hajime_no_Ippo ) even though the 3rd season (Hajime No Ippo: Rising) came out in 2013/2014.  Its a great sport/slice of life/comedy series."
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,Needs more Jojo
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"i like cowboy bebop, ghost in the shell, FMA, samurai champloo

basically anime that does not rely on anime troupes and tells a great story, what would you recommend from this decade?

edit: action oriented is a plus"
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,I'd like to throw a shout for Terror in Resonance too. Great show
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"Barakamon and Girls' Last Tour are two of my absolute favorite shows, and I'm pretty happy to see them make the list. Sora no Woto is up there too.

Those three are all slice-of-life type shows, a genre that can be pretty hit or miss, but these three do a great job of building a world (or a town, as in Barakamon) and making you keep watching because you're interested in that world, and the characters, even if there's no overreaching plot trying to tie everything together. They aren't necessarily exciting, but they're thoroughly enjoyable. And sometimes you just need a nice calm show like that."
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,Kind of a weird post. I'd expect at least a sorry description with each show. A genre doesn't really cut it.
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"**Sora no Woto** is surprisingly good. Definitely not what I expected. It's part slice of life, part post-apocalypse, and also an anti-war story. And the music is fantastic. Occasionally feels like **Kino's Journey**, but somwhat less bleak. 

***
**Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu** is a slow burn, but is an exceptionally good period drama set in the post-postwar era where the Japanese economy was beginning to pick up again. One of the popular forms of entertainment was a style of traditonal comic storytelling called Rakugo. In an era where not many had televisions yet, they were often broadcast on radio. 

A recently released convict approaches one of the masters of this artform to become his disciple after having only heard his radio broadcasts in prison. Drama ensues. Lots of dialogue as you may expect. **Joshiraku** is a much less serious take on Rakugo, if you like terrible puns and Japanese cultural references you won't understand, this is for you. 

***
**Natsume's Book of Friends** is really one of the most heartbreaking yet heartwarming series I've ever seen. Main character is the only person who can see the denizens of the spirit world, resulting in him being ostracised by almost every human he meets due to his reaction to heir presence, but returning to his grandmother's hometown changes that, for better or worse. Partly episodic, but with some overarching plot. For another contemporary fantasy series that's kind of similar, try **The Ancient Magus' Bride**. **Mushishi** is also excellent and has a similar spirit detective vibe, but much more serious. "
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,Didn't see Steins Gate on here..... Better than 90% 0f the things listed 
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"My Hero Academia and Assassination Classroom are noticeably not present :o  
I personally fuckin loved AC, I know it's not everyone's cup of tea, but I found it wholesome and touching"
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,Madoka magica ! 
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"I’m not a huge anime fan. But I watched Erased recently... good lord that’s a fantastic show. Cool plot, good characters, good mystery. Plays on a fantasy I think a lot of people have at least once in their life. And there’s only one season. They got in, told their story, and got out."
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"Thank you so much, OP, for this! I haven't watched much of anime since my college days, and I have lost track of what's what. Thank you for the recommendations, definitely going to save this post."
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"You're Lie In April, imo, is also a must watch."
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,Awh no your lie about in April 
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,This is actually a really decent list
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,You need to add Hunter x Hunter 2011 to this list

Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"Mfw I've seen all of these. I just want to be a fresh weeb again :'(
"
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"Thank you for making this. I have a hard time keeping up with all the awesome anime coming out. I can barely keep up with all the western shows that are out. Just finishing up breaking bad.

I can recommend darling in the franxx."
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"If you are looking for slow burn anime's that don't have your typical Japanese pervy tropes, watch Mushishi and Monster. Masterpieces imo."
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"Blood Blockade Battlefront, Mob Psycho, and Made in Abyss are all in my top 10 anime. Very solid shows. "
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"What do you guys recommend as good mindfuck mystery type ones?

in the vein of Mirrai Nikki, Madoka Magica, Shinsekai yori"
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"My anime background is just the classics and most well known (DragonBall, Naruto, Bleach). Right now my only base for anime is Netflix. I've watched Attack on Titan, Tokyo Ghoul, Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, Sinbad, Death Note and One Punch Man, and currently I started watching Sword Art Online. 

Do you recommend it? Based on my viewing history and the Netflix catalogue what would you recommend I watch next?"
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,I would say you’re missing Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure. Besides being awesome it’s a cultural touchstone in Anime that is constantly referenced and parodied. I would argue it’s a must watch show
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"\>K-On!  


My. Fucking. Man. The best taste."
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"Devilman crybaby is also a good anime, gory , but good."
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,Add in wotakoi: love is hard for an otaku. It's a really good romance comedy that deals with adults instead of the regular HS ones
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,No love for Welcome to the N.H.K.?
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"I'm someone who haven't watched a lot of anime since about 2008 or so, so I'll check out some of these, thanks. 

That said, I feel like the medium has definitely changed a lot since that time. So many shows now have either very strange animation styles (Kill la Kill, Made in Abyss, Devilman Crybaby...) or these strange formulaic stock characters everywhere (at least I don't remember people talking about tsunderes and moes and I don't know what back in the day). I'm sure there's a lot of good stuff once you get past these things, but in most cases nowadays I don't get further than some weirdass synopsis before I sigh and re-watch Black Lagoon or Claymore instead. And I'm someone who, despite not immersing myself into the anime/""weabo"" culture, has after all read and watched quite a lot of manga and anime in my time, and someone who likes 'weird' stuff Evangelion or Gantz.

I think that's the reason why Attack on Titan has been such a hit here in the West, despite imho not being that good of a show (it seems to go for repeated 'shocks' over telling an engaging story). It has a pretty 'realistic' and good looking animation style, characters that for the most part look rather normal, and though the premise is a bit strange it's very straight-forward once it gets going."
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"Recently saw Made in Abyss because a lot of people have been raving about it.

The main characters are a girl of 14, and a robot that looks like a boy of about the same age.

I would like it a lot more, if there were not shit like recurring ""jokes"" where people look down the robot boys pants and exclaim that he has a penis. 

Like often when people were recommending it, I'd see em specify that it was not for children, and I kinda assumed that was because of horror elements or something. Like god dammit Japan."
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"Ummm...My Hero Academia?

It's an amazing shonen series with much better pacing, animation and characters than a lot of its contemporaries."
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"Another one I’d absolutely recommend if you’re looking for a more light hearted/comedic take on anime is “The Devil is a Part Timer”. 

Really funny, great story and quick watch. Premise is pretty simple, Devil comes back to earth and tries to take over the world...by working in fast food. 

If I’m not mistaken it’s still on Netflix, highly highly recommend."
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,Parastye -the maxim- should 100% be on this list. 
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"I'm gonna use this thread to mention that, yes, One Piece has over 800 episodes, but it is probably the most pure fun that you can find while still managing to be epic, emotional and engaging. "
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"Your lie in april. 

Shokugeki no soma 

Nanatsu no taizai"
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,I'll martyr myself and list Tokyo Ghoul. I guess it's become pretty 'normie' but i still really enjoyed it. Also The Lost Village was a pretty neat short one.
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,I recognized so few animes in that list. Feel like you're missing a TON.
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"Damn. When you realize all of the super popular anime you liked as a kid aren’t part of this decade lol 

Old. "
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,Does crunchyroll or funimation offer offline/download & play yet? That's been my biggest obstacle to consuming anime.
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,Black Clover?
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,.
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,I would recommend Made in Abyss. Only one season and it's already one of my favorites.
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,Beast Player Erin (Kemono no Sōja) is a really good one that I never hear anyone mention.
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"Pretty good list, though I'd add Higurashi (the official stuff, essentially seasons 1 and 2.) for how damn good it was it combining the slice of life with horror, especially the more psychological aspects. Umineko is different, but good just somewhat odd at times and feels better to read than merely watch. 
"
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"Baki 2018. Absolutely brutal fighting. If you are squeamish do not watch. It is metal as hell though, I love it.


I could probably recommend some others but I'll leave it at that."
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,[deleted]
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"Don't forget to request to get new seasons of your favorite anime:

https://help.netflix.com/en/titlerequest"
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"I've only ever watched one anime in my adult life and that's Attack on Titan. I really enjoyed it but I'm fine not watching anything else. I have some personal hang ups about anime being ""for kids"", even the one tailored for mature audiences. "
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"Not only are these shows that fall out of the ""Same 10 anime"" thing. They're all shows that I can see actually getting people into anime. Shows like FMA:B and Death Note are shows that feel detached enough for people to think ""I'm not too sure about anime, but Fullmetal Alchemist is pretty good"" instead of ""hey maybe I like anime"". All of these shows (at least the ones I've seen) are both great and feel like anime. Good list.


I also want to boost March Comes in Like a Lion to anyone reading this. It's one of my favorite shows. It follows a 17 year old depressed professional Shogi player who just recently started living on his own. Over the course of the series you watch him open up to people and form a familiar relationship that he's never really had in his life. You don't need to know anything about Shogi to understand the show."
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"I'd like to think that Shouwa Genjou Rakugo Shinju is the pinnacle of anime in recent years. THE series that towers above the rest. It's not my favourite series for sure, but it comes incredibly close to perfection in so many ways. I doubt I'd recommend it to someone new to anime, but there's no excuse for anyone who calls themselves an avid fan of anime to not watch Rakugo. 

And then there's Ping Pong... The things I would give to see another series of this caliber. I'm so glad to see it on your list."
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,All are pretty good except Yuru Camp and Flip Flappers
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"Kobayashi's Dragon Maid is probably the first new-ish anime I've fully watched in years, since Bodacious Space Pirates and Jormungand. It's poignant, cute, a little... creepy... but still heartily recommended."
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"I was never an Anime fan.  I remember enjoying Ninja Scroll back in the 90's, but that's about it.  Then one day 'Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress' popped up on Amazon Prime, and I clicked on it, because there was nothing else to watch.  Loved it.  As soon as I finished it, I wanted to see even more.  Attack on Titan was a recommendation I've heard over and over, so I started watching it next.  It was even better than the Iron Fortress.  The animation, the soundtrack, the story - they were all just perfect, and I couldn't wait for more.

While waiting for the next season, I was eager to see all the other great anime shows I've been missing out on.  But here's where the disappointment came.  I would check dozens of the top recommended shows, and they simply weren't my cup of tea.  Either the animation was looking like something made in the 80's, or the story was just meh.  I could barely watch one episode, before giving up in the search of the next Attack on Titan. 

It all made sense, when I found out both Attack on Titan, and Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress are made by the same studio.  I have yet to find any other anime show that comes close to those two.  And this is not me shitting on other shows.  I'm sure they're great, but they just don't do it for me.  There's just something about AoT or KotIF, whether it's the awesome visuals, or soundtrack, that put them in a league of their own."
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"No sword art online season 1?

What's the point?


Jk (though I do like SAO)

Great list op thanks for sharing"
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"Maybe doesn't *technically* count, but 48% of Gintama (and potentially more, maybe, hopefully) has come after your cutoff date, and imo Gintama is a legendary anime. Action/comedy, has survived multiple hiatuses, and has reportedly been more profitable than Bleach or Naruto in Western countries, made even more incredible due to its lack of an English dub or mainstream viewing channel (such as Cartoon Network's Toonami). Insane amounts of fun, and I'm incredibly sad to be seeing it go."
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,[deleted]
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"Totally expected, but still dissapointed that there's no Yu-Gi-Oh. :p  
Just fits well with my personal taste.  
  
My favorite beyond that though is the old anime Ranma ½. Although the manga has better plots and characterization, love the animation, voices and music. :D"
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"Look at you making a worthless list that doesn't include whether there is a dub, which makes it awful, and by extension you awful."
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"Oh! I can do a brief rundown of all of them. Give me a few minutes and I'll be back with a few words about each.  


EDIT: OKAY! Here we go.

**Barakamon:** brash young calligrapher gets exiled to the boonies to find himself

**Blood Blockade Battlefront:** secret society of supers fight weird monsters in wacky New York

**Cells at Work:** Osmosis Jones but with a cute redhead as the lead instead of Chris Rock

**Chihayafuru:** Sports show about a poetry card game. Cooler than it sounds.

**Death Parade:** Bar in purgatory hosts games to judge souls’ fates

**The Eccentric Family:** An eccentric family of shapeshifters go about their lives

**Erased:** Time travel murder mystery where the time travel isn’t that big of a deal. Tearjerker.

**Flip Flappers:** I literally cannot describe it beyond “two magical girls and trippy world”

**Flying Witch:** Extremely relaxing show about a witch training in the countryside

**Girls’ Last Tour:** Two girls journey across a harsh post apocalyptic wasteland. Philosophy?

**Haikyuu:** Hot guys play volleyball. Character development.

**Hyouka:** Bored high schoolers solve boring mysteries. Show is anything but boring.

**K-On:** Cute high school girls play in a band and eat cake. Super comfy.

**Katanagatari:** Finding swords? Weird art style. Weirder dialogue.

**Kids on the Slope:** Realistic jazz coming of age in the 60s. Great music.

**Kill la Kill:** Skimpy lingerie battles at fascist high school. Way better than it sounds.

**Kyousogiga:** Similarly trippy, often confusing show about multidimensional family. Fantastic.

**Land of the Lustrous:** One of the few 3D CGI anime worth your time. About gem people, but not the Steven Universe kind.

**Little Witch Academia:** Harry Potter.

**Love, Chuunibyou, and Other Delusions:** Cute middle schoolers do things? Haven’t seen it.

**Lupin III:** Classic, classy thief steals riches and hearts. Got Miyazaki his start.

**Made in Abyss:** Don’t go exploring the big scary hole, kids. Don’t.\\

**March comes in like a Lion:** Drama about a chess prodigy and his relationships. One of the best. 

**Mawaru Penguindrum:** Brothers and penguins(?) try to help their sister. Haven’t seen it.

**Miss Kobayashi:** Fun, funny show about a woman who adopts a bunch of dragon people into her life

**Mob Psycho 100:** Cool, trippy, great action show about a kid with super psychic powers

**Monthly Girls’ Nozaki Kun:** High school girl’s crush on romance manga artist goes unnoticed; she becomes his assistant in this wacky, hilarious comedy about romance.

**My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU:** Catcher in the Rye if it were anime and there were three Holdens. Very good.

**Mushishi:** Cool-ass spirit detective does spirit detective shit

**Nagi no Asukara:** Very pretty show about water people(?) Haven’t seen it.

**Natsume’s Book of Friends:** Arguably the closest you’ll get to a Ghibli TV show. Guy has spirit friends.

**Nichijou:** Wacky sketch comedy about wacky insane people. Very good.

**Noragami:** Haven’t seen it …. a fallen god is trying to get back on his feet(?)

**Ore Monogatari:** Gentle giant falls in love with pint sized classmate. Adorable as fuck.

**Ping Pong the Animation:** Guys play ping pong, learn about themselves. Looks wacky. Is fantastic.

**A Place Further than the Universe:** Girls go to Antarctica. Sweet and touching show.

**Polar Bear Cafe:** Polar bears and other animals run a cafe (?) Haven’t seen it.

**Shinsekai Yori:** WORLDBUILDING. New generation of humans trying to figure out about themselves(?)

**Shirobako:** An anime show about making anime shows. It’s incredible, heartwarming and educational.

**Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu:** Stand up comedy but it’s sit-down comedy and it’s very old fashioned. Character drama about artists in a dying medium in the 60s, 70s, 80s, and beyond. Slow burn that’s easily one of the best shows of the last few years, anime or no.

**So Ra No Wo To:** Girls in a small brigade run an army corps of musicians. Also they have a tank? There’s more to it but I can’t remember.

**Sound Euphonium:** High school concert band, and all the character drama and shenanigans that go with it. Very good.

**Space Dandy:** About a dandy guy in space. Lots of sexual humor. From the guy who made Cowboy Bebop. 

**Tamako Market:** Girl living in a market district has fun shenanigans with friends. Warm and comfy. The talking bird grows on you. Oh, also there’s a dark-skinned prince who shows up.

**Tanaka kun is Always Restless:** haven’t seen this one -- it’s about a guy who’s always lazy. But supposedly it’s very good.

**Tatami Galaxy:** Very fast dialogue, weird visuals. About a guy figuring out his life in college. Once you get the hang of it, it’s very entertaining and relatable.

**Tsuki ga Kirei:** Adorable show about middle schoolers’ first love.

**Tsuritama:** Haven’t seen it. IIRC there’s a guy who’s like a mermaid? Comedy, I think.

**Usagi Drop:** Relaxing, sweet show about a bachelor who takes in his grandfather’s six year old daughter from an affair. 

**Violet Evergarden:** Gorgeous show about PTSD and a young woman who becomes a letter writer in a semi 1930s world. Don’t go in expecting an action show. 

**Yona of the Dawn:** Semi-historical action adventure about a princess and her crew who go rogue.

**Yuru Camp:** Comfy show about high schoolers camping. Will make you want to camp."
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,[deleted]
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"Nichijou, Ping Pong the Animation, Sound! Euphonium, Kyousougiga, and A Place Further than the Universe are my next biggest recommendations.

Also, I actually almost didn't include Noragami, as I had some problems with the 1st season, but damn was Noragami Aragoto amazing. It's everything I love about battle shounen (a genre I'm not really a fan of) but without the filler. Too bad we'll never get a 3rd season."
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"Haha yeah i decided to use english names unless it's so uncommon. I've seen a fair amount of people online refer to kekkai sensen by the english name, so i went with that. In contrast, I've literally never heard anyone call Nagi no Asukara by the english name: A Lull in the Sea."
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"Agreed. One could make an argument that it's the anime equivalent to It's Always Sunny. 

Not me obvious, but someone else could."
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"Watched it but didn't find it quite as funny as others. Then again, I actually like Isekai as a genre (I know some dismiss it) and would probably have recommended Overlord at least. Honorable mentions to Re:Zero, Death March, and even Knights & Magic IMO though I know that last one is held up by many as an example of what is wrong with Isekai shows. "
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"It's so popular I feel the OP decided it didn't need another shout out.

But yeah, it's a pretty good show."
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"It just annoys me how none of the heroes ever die.

Kills the suspense everytime they battle these villains who are more experienced and powerful than them."
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,Watching that show only makes me pine for OPM that much more. 
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,I feel it's just a copy of Naruto. 
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,How does it compare in tone/style etc to Hajime no Ippo? Definitely loving the idea of another boxing anime.
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"Oh right, I should get around to watching that."
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"Parasyte is really good, Imagine Japanese Peter Parker turned into venom before he ever became spider-man, and takes the responsibility to make sure to the best of his ability that humans and alien body snatchers are able to co exist secretly without everyone dying. 

"
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,I dunno those first two are the sort of over-recommended shows that the OP was trying to avoid. 
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"> Next time I would include Animes that would appeal to Western Taste

Baccano!"
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,Psycho Pass season one is AMAZING
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,Pretty sure OP was going for non-generic picks.
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"OPM, MHA and Psycho Pass are such cliche recommendations. They're good but defeat the whole purpose of this list. 

This whole ""Western Taste"" nonsense is so exaggerated "
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"-	imo One Punch Man wore its premise thin pretty quickly
-	I guess I kinda liked My Hero Academia, but that's about it.
-	Psycho Pass sits just right outside my list because of the disappointing 2nd season.
-	I have to give it to you for Parasyte tho. Great show that I somehow forgot while making this list. Not sure which one it would replace tho (probably Kill la Kill or Tanaka-kun is Always Listless)"
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,I'd throw in Berserk and Hunter x Hunter and then call it a day.
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"Do they get all emo and decide to defeat their enemies through power of love/friendship/telepathy/whatever?

Because I am watching Gundam Unicorn and it's abysmal. Especially since I watched Gundam 8th MS Team, Thunderbolt and Origins before this one and those seemed way superior even though Unicorn is supposed to be some hot stuff.

I mean, where did all that emo/telepathy stuff come from all of a sudden?  

"
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"My taste overlaps with you quite a bit on live action. I couldn't get into Black Lagoon or Gurren Lagann, but I'll try to give Ergo Proxy, Steins;Gate, Psycho-Pass, and Ghost in the Shell a shot.

Thanks!"
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,This show was hilarious
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,I will never forgive Gainax for what they did in the finale. God fucking damn it. I'm pissed years later.
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"Damnit how did i forget about this show? If I had to replace a show on my list with Space Brothers, it'd probably be Kill la Kill or Death Parade."
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,Agreed. Every anime fan needs more Jojo!
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"Since you've seem Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo, the logical next step is to see Space Dandy made by the same director. Where Cowboy Bebop was jazz and Samurai Champloo was hip hop, Space Dandy is disco/funk. It's also a lot weirder than the other two, but in a good way."
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"My main recs would be Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu and Ping Pong the Animation. You could also maybe try Death Parade, Erased, Katanagatari, Natsume's Book of Friends, Shinsekai Yori, and The Tatami Galaxy."
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"It's from the 90s but it basically takes the cake when it comes to throwing anime tropes on their head: Neon Genesis Evangelion.  Giant robots fighting giant... ""monsters"" plus depression."
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"A little late but I would recommend these. parasyte, banana fish, Durarara, psycho pass, and dororo which is airing me but is very good."
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,"Watch kids on the slope, same person who did bebop Anh champloo"
Monthly Girls Nozaki Kun,Agreed. One of the best shows I’ve seen tbh.

He arranges for his sister Margot to get in a car accident and has the doctors remove her womb so she can't have children. Then, later he reveals he prepared a surrogate for her and it's a large pig with a human fetus inside that's stillborn. One of the darkest and most ""what the fuck"" things I've seen done to someone."

Gets another child so wrecked that they need to be hospitalized, at which point Bojack dumps them in front of a hospital. Is routinely awful to all of his friends. Strangles his girlfriend in a drugged stupor, resulting in her having PTSD and ruining her career. Abandons his friend when it looks like that friendship might be a liability (because the friend has just been outed as gay, and Bojack is unwilling to publically show support).Those are just the things I can think of offhand!

Tadas Do-It-All House extra,"Game of Thrones takes like, the top ten spots. Couple examples. 

1. Stannis Baratheon murdering his only child because of a religious cult…for nothing

2. Ramsey Bolton…doing anything really. But the torture of Theon and the Arrow game stand out.

The B-plot is him staying with Luanne and Lucky while they see it as an opportunity to practice being parents.

Seems like an usually cruel decision considering Bobby and Cotton were pretty close with one another. And Bobby *should* be more than old enough to handle the subject."
Tadas Do-It-All House extra,"On Shameless, Debbie raping her boyfriend and lying about BC to have a baby was peak worst character in a parade of worst characters."
Tadas Do-It-All House extra,"Maybe not such a biggie, but Peggy Hill sabotaging Lucky in King of the Hill. She purposefully teaches him wrong answers when he comes to her for help to get his GED so that he can properly propose to Luanne. While I could understand her turning him away, setting him up to fail when he is trying to improve himself for Luanne is despicable. He’s the only love interest she’s had that shows her respect, adores her, and protects her. Maybe he’s not the perfect man that Peggy would want to marry her niece, but it’s just another example of her reaching into someone’s life because she thinks she knows best."

She was mostly only eating/killing out of necessity for her and her son. He orphaned that child and I don’t remember if he comes home to find the body or not. Sam finds out eventually and in season 8ish Sam justifies killing Dean’s vampire friend (who he worked with to survive in purgatory) to even the score morally or something. 

Was personally upset with Dean’s character for a while after seeing that episode."

Tadas Do-It-All House extra,"Hannah from Dark is one of my most hated characters in TV

EDIT: I realize now that I didn’t even answer OPs question as they were asking specifically as to what was the worst thing a character has done 

The worst thing Hannah has done is exist. She is an awful friend, wife, mother. She is cruel and uncaring for cruel and uncaring sake. I’m not going to go into it more than that since 1899 has caused a resurgence in Dark and I don’t want to spoil anything, but you quickly realize that Hannah is an awful person and it just gets worse from there.

Tadas Do-It-All House extra,Go watch Attack on Titan.
Tadas Do-It-All House extra,"Orange is the New Black…the flashback scene where Carol and Barb drown their sister Debbie…that’s what got me to quit watching. It was well acted and haunting, but it was just too dark for my comfort level after that. On the same show, Piper getting branded on the hot stove was also too dark but I can’t remember the names of the characters involved besides her at this point.

SVU has had a lot of perps, but William Lewis and Henry Messner (the child psychopath) stand out to me as two of the worst. Lewis just for all he did to Olivia while holding her hostage and Henry for drowning a dog and hurting his sister, then killing his family except her when he got out of the psych facility. Again, great acting by both Pablo Schrieber (who played Lewis and does creep really well in OITNB as well) and Ethan Cutkosky (Henry) but just pure evil and too dark for me to watch.

Lastly, when Abby is relapsing on ER and she not only shows up at work visibly drunk, she also drives drunk with her kid in the car and is neglecting him in other ways, and everyone around her acts like it is no big deal. It’s so painful how a bunch of doctors and nurses didn’t call CPS or otherwise protected her from discipline, and the one coworker who did try to call her out was made out to be the villain. Especially since Abby was super quick to rat out Carter several years prior when he was putting patients at risk."

GOD TONGUE,">And Rip seriously thinks he is the good guy

Does he? I seem to remember him CONSTANTLY saying that he is not a good man. Did I miss something?"
GOD TONGUE,It’s a prime time soap opera
GOD TONGUE,"This show is a non-cowboy’s idea of what it’s like to be a cowboy, told through the genre of soap opera. Nothing at all about it is authentic to real rural western life."
GOD TONGUE,I watched a couple episodes and decided it wasn't for me. It's one of my grandma's favorite shows though and I did really enjoy 1883.
GOD TONGUE,"I'm Canadian, not even close to being a ""republican"" in politics or morality. 

But my wife and I enjoy this shoe and it's related shows...including Tulsa King.

It's TV. Sometimes simplistic drama, with pretty aesthetics is all you need.

But I'm only speaking for myself, and Yellowstone et al, is a nice wind down show.

Not everything is a pulitizer or Emmy winner, and that's ok"
GOD TONGUE,It took me half an hour to realise there wasn't going to be any volcanoes in episode 1. I am not a smart man.
GOD TONGUE,Sons of anarchy with horses.
GOD TONGUE,I never understood why people watch TV/movies they despise so passionately.  Why do you put yourself through the torture?
GOD TONGUE,"I don’t think cowboy wet dream, more like fake macho masculinity ideal wet dream"
GOD TONGUE,"My father was a true cowboy- he grew up on a ranch riding horses and working cattle all through his childhood.

He can barely make it through a show with all the exaggerated events and falsities."
GOD TONGUE,"Wait, aren't they supposed to be unlikable? I pretty much unlike every main character, they are despicable and contradict themselves in their own ways but that's the point no? Anyway I love the show."
GOD TONGUE,"Ok, so let’s hear more about Jamie actually being John Dutton’s son.  What are you basing that off of?  Did I miss something?"
GOD TONGUE,I’ve thought about watching the spin-off with Harrison Ford. Is it any good?
GOD TONGUE,"I'm not a cowboy and I love this show, it's awesome.  The flawed yet relatable characters are the best part."
GOD TONGUE,You’re overthinking it man haha. It’s a guilty pleasure of a show where you can get shot in one episode and get into a fist fight the next. It doesn’t make sense and really doesn’t need to. It’s got all the shit you’ve mentioned along with good scenery and cinematography.
GOD TONGUE,Yellowstone is lifestyle porn.
GOD TONGUE,Clearly you know zero cowboys. Most of them hate the show. You’re thinking of rich people who like to pretend they’re cowboys.
GOD TONGUE,"To the people that say: ""Have you seen Yellowstone? No, OMG ITZ so freaking good. Its the best TV show ever.""  - I CANNOT UNDERSTAND! (I will forever question their logic)

However, its a very MID tier show that is entertaining."
GOD TONGUE,Haha I bet you’re fun at parties.
GOD TONGUE,Just living in Montana I hate this show more than anything.
GOD TONGUE,"As someone in the horse industry, I really like what this show has done for interest in the cutting and cowhorse events. More interest, more people competing, more money to win...it's really a good thing.

I don't really care to watch it for anything other than the horses."
GOD TONGUE,"The show was watchable to me.  Wasn’t expecting anything life changing   The thing I find funny is the most hated people are Californians who come in and buy land while the Star, Costner, is a liberal
Californian that lives on a ranch he bought in Colorado."
GOD TONGUE,"The cheese of the show is what makes it fun and watchable, otherwise, any direction towards realism would make the show extremely boring because ranching typically don’t involve murder, shootouts, and political intrigue.

All the characters are terrible human beings, pretty much in line with shows like Seinfeld, It’s Always Sunny, or Sopranos. They’re all terrible human beings that you can’t help but root for.

If I had to guess what makes the show popular, is that it’s just fun escapism—the idea of this last frontier that’s devoid of urban problems can really resonate with anyone. There’s no need for woke-ism when the show established that most of the characters are terrible human beings. I’m not a gun-toting conservative, but I still watch the show and enjoy it for what it is, and I think the show runners are self-aware and understand this."
GOD TONGUE,"Yellowstone is a show about a family of murderous thugs, who operate an anti-corporatist, eco-terrorist, organized crime ring. 

Republicans seem to think of them as the heroes of the story mostly because they wear cowboy hats and ride horses.

I enjoy the show but it’s definitely slid from something I look forward to each week into a guilty pleasure soap experience."
GOD TONGUE,It’s Sons of Anarchy for horse girls
GOD TONGUE,Rip is hot AF.
GOD TONGUE,"The show is fantastic. I mean I cannot imagine watching 5 seasons of a show and typing out a 8 paragraph review of the most watched cable TV show only for the entire review to be shitting all over it. 

Really makes me wonder what is on the air right now that the OP thinks is good TV."
GOD TONGUE,The fact that you had to write a novel just to say you “hate” a TV show means it has you interested in more ways than one… 🤷🏻‍♂️
GOD TONGUE,I feel like it’s cowboys if it was the mafia because these people aren’t good people from what I’ve seen at all
GOD TONGUE,"Nothing about native Americans living in the Yellowstone area after a hundred years of white man telling us they didn’t, love white representstion"
GOD TONGUE,Tried watching the pilot episode and made it through...barely. I was laughing at how one dimensional and terrible the characters were by the end of that single episode. I could not even imagine trying to sit through a season. How this show is lauded by anyone is beyond me.
GOD TONGUE,1882 was good. Yellowstone seems like am expensive soap opera
GOD TONGUE,"They tried to make a southerner/midwestern godfather but failed to kill the main character (Kevin Costner) because he’s too popular of an actor. If they killed him off at the end of season 1 it would have been a perfect set up to a shit show power grab by everyone. But I’m guessing it was network interference that stopped that. 

It’s a real shame because I watched a few episodes with my grandfather and enjoyed it, but now Ive actually taken the time to watch it and it’s so repetitive I couldn’t finish it."
GOD TONGUE,It’s Game of Thrones: Montana.
GOD TONGUE,It's 'Sons of Anarchy' with horses... Just enjoy it for what it is... Have a feeling it won't end well for most of them
GOD TONGUE,"As I've mentioned previously, I really enjoy the actual cowboyin that went on in previous seasons, especially with Jimmy. But newer season are hot garbage in writing and the acting, besides a few members, seems like it's just trying to ruin the show. It's basically just turned Dallas with guns. Ryan Bingham stays the best part of the show."
GOD TONGUE,I don’t think many *actual* cowboys (or rural folks in general) really like the show. I know for a fact that the people in the region it portrays range from extreme dislike to a casual eye roll - but not any that I’m aware of like the show.
GOD TONGUE,"Jamie is not Alexa Carrington. If they'd set him up as a bad guy once for whatever reason, and let him take a fall, knocked him down a few pegs and let him redeem himself in whatever way, it'd be better than whatever this is. What gets me is that Jamie shouldn't be as stupid as he's written. And didn't he get back with the mother of his child? I guess not.

I'm also wondering after all these generations, why there aren't more Duttons out there. Let one of them come and be a villain... for a half season or so.

I saw 1883 first, and I enjoyed it, and I have hopes for 1923."
GOD TONGUE,"Wyomingite here, and I can’t name a single real cowboy I know that watches that shit, or name one thing on that show that reflects western/ranching life out here other than maybe roping and bunk house shit."
GOD TONGUE,"It’s literally Sons of Anarchy on horses. Not that I have a problem with either show, but the similarities between them are pretty obvious. I mean same writer and all. He just traded the cut in for a brand and Harleys for hoses. Still both are great dramas and I enjoy them, but they are a lot alike."
GOD TONGUE,"Personally prefer 1883.

There’s a reason why Yellowstone is very popular though. It appeals to two very distinct and extremes:

A) second amendment gun loving doomsday seekers

B) tech bros from the east and west coast that dream of one day having a ranch"
GOD TONGUE,"The show, and spinoffs, is creator Taylor Sheridan living out his cowboy fantasies...to the point that he took his Yellowstone paycheck and purchased the 6666 Ranch, where he's setting yet another spinoff. 

Guy is living his cowboy dream, and we're all watching it and paying for it"
GOD TONGUE,Sounds about as well written as Sons of Anarchy to me.
GOD TONGUE,"EDIT: A commenter said its inauthentic to real western life so its for people unfamiliar with it. I grew up with cowboy relatives so that might be it.

I kept hearing it's the most- watched show so I watched a few episodes last month. I'm not into  westerns, and I so far dislike every character. It doesn't seem very different from Sons of Anarchy and so on, it just has pretty scenery. At least that was my impression. Don't feel like continuing it."
GOD TONGUE,"I bailed on this show because of how weirdly it treated Jamie. In season 1 he was ok then in season 2 they made him a pathetic sniveling mess who was scared of Beth. In season 1, Jamie and Beth’s relationship was fun and Jamie was allowed to tell Beth to fuck off.

Then I hear he is adopted and I have seen fans of that show use it as an excuse for why he is the bad guy and “not really family”. Adopted kids are still family wtf?

Anyways, justice for Jamie."
GOD TONGUE,"YouTube has been feeding me clips of the show for a few weeks now, and I know my brother and grandpa who are both right leaning love the show.  

From the little I've seen which is probably about 10 clips, it looks like this is a manufactured power fantasy for rural states, that rugged individualist, pull yourself up by your bootstrap but don't you dare infringe on me and what I have ideals of the once wild west. It's unrealistic, but not more so than Friends being able to afford those apartments in NYC. 

For me it gives me a hero I don't want, it wants me to look up to Costner and his rough crew for being 'hard working' but a lot of this comes across as the TV patting someone else on the back for not living near a major city. Often people are right because they win a fight, I saw a 'good guy with a gun' scene which would have gotten innocent people shot in real life, and I've seen grandstanding several times about the softness of everyone else vs. how they are. 

But I know people love it so I assume they watch The West Wing with the same uneasy feeling I do watching Yellowstone."
GOD TONGUE,"Couldn't agree more with this review, most overhyped show of the decade"
GOD TONGUE,"I really, really, REALLY tried with this show and the prequels, but something about the story just felt off.  I really struggled to get invested in any of the characters.  Eventually abandoned it for other shows, just wasn’t for me, but clearly it works for others."
GOD TONGUE,"Hot take: you just like hating popular thing to make yourself feel superior. Your criticism is incredibly superficial and shows you did not spend much time actually considering the show. 

A lot of Republicans got brought to the show by their hip, liberal relatives, only to be outraged by a lot of the show’s content."
GOD TONGUE,"Essentially it’s Sopranos for those who have “Live, Laugh, Love” on their wall in their home."
GOD TONGUE,Don’t you know Kayce was in the military from the first episode? It goes downhill the more over the top it gets though.
GOD TONGUE,It’s a soap opera for your maga aunt and uncle. It’s a platter to serve truck commercials on. It’s Costner doing what he does best…act badly. It’s pure schlock.
GOD TONGUE,It's a show for people who want simple melodrama on a ranch. It's soap opera quality with a budget for people who don't want to think about what they are watching. There's no nuance in any character.
GOD TONGUE,"It's become ""hip"" to hate Yellowstone on this sub, that's when you know a show has reached true mainstream popularity"
GOD TONGUE,"The show is incredible, you’re just wrong.

How can you say Beth is unsympathetic when her dying mother told her she was weak before her last breath and her brother caused her infertility without her consent?

Rips character, and yearning for approval of a father that will never be blood son is a great starting point for a character.

And your saying a western gets a little sappy sometimes when love interests are involved… YOU DONT SAY 🙄

Taylor Sheridan is the modern day western writer and anything he touches is at *least* good, but IMO great."
GOD TONGUE,"Couldn’t get through half of season one. Loved 1883 and so far 1923. 
Edit to change date because I’m a pinecone. Lol."
GOD TONGUE,"I started watching this show last week, and finally caught up last night.  I think it's a really good show although some of the story is far-fetched."
GOD TONGUE,I call it “Sopranos with Saddles”.
GOD TONGUE,"I find the writing of Yellowstone dreadful. Watched first two series hoping it would come good. Binged 1883 in the summer, loved it. Almost unbelievable the same guy wrote both lol"
GOD TONGUE,Does it confuse anyone else that Beth drives a Bentley? A pretentious British sports car and not an American muscle car or truck.
GOD TONGUE,I finished season one already.  It's a bit like a country Boardwalk Empire
GOD TONGUE,I just want the family to lose everything.   Rainwater seems alright so if the Native Americans end up with the land I wouldn’t mind.   Otherwise let anyone but this family keep ownership of the ranch land.
GOD TONGUE,"show is hilarious, I just can't understand how anyone can take it seriously. Maybe you Americans do since you practically live in a movie, but it's probably the same for you when you watch something like Downton Abbey (which is, it had to be said, total fantasyland even for us)"
GOD TONGUE,"This is not a western or cowboy genre. Its a soap opera with a country aesthetic. And any other show everyone would be tripping over themselves to praise the dark tone and morally grey characters like in Breaking Bad or Peaky Blinders or Walking Dead or GOT, but because people (mostly redditors) have the mistaken idea that this is somehow a right leaning wet dream they suddenly dont like it.

Turns out most normal people like morally grey people no matter the lens. These characters are anti-heroes. Did you get similarly mad at the Sopranos?

Your dislike is noted, the rest is a thinky veiled attack against your perceived political enemies.

I do feel like watching some Cowboy or Chanbara cinema right nos though, so thanks for that"
GOD TONGUE,"I know no one likes Beth, but hear me out. When Monica was accused of stealing because she was American Indian and calls Beth. She was eager to bust that store to shit. I’ve been accused of stealing because of the way I look and I wish I had a Beth to call. I had my purse poured out and was patted down. It was humiliating. Yeah, I would have called her, no question."
GOD TONGUE,"Recently watched season 5 episode 1, and just the amount of ""Us vs them,"" and some of the heavy right wing style dialogue from the Duttons really kinda killed it for me. "" Go back to your own state you fucking babies,"""
GOD TONGUE,"Yeah, it's a great show."
GOD TONGUE,It's Grey's Anatomy with cowboy hats.
GOD TONGUE,"Its Dynasty rip-off for conservative white republican where white billionare killing people, branding people as cattle and doing what ever he wants, while crying about canceling him (governor) on land his grand grand father promised to give back to Native Americans in 1883 series.

there is also Beth will plot armor bigger than Yellowstone itself"
GOD TONGUE,So it's for Republicans
GOD TONGUE,It’s a little bit r/conservative + a lot r/iamverybadass
GOD TONGUE,"It’s republican rage porn. And to top it off, it’s written by liberals. It’s what liberals think republicans want to see: stuff/people they hate getting what they deserve. I work in construction in a major city and all my republican co-workers loved Yellowstone because they all saw themselves as the people who work on the ranch. Well, I actually am from a rural part of the mountains in Colorado and I can relate to Kevin Costumer’s character resenting the disconnected city people coming up and treating his land like it’s theirs. I had to inform my republican co-workers that they were more like the bikers from California than the country people they idolize."
GOD TONGUE,"Amen, I’ll not say the show is complete trash but I have been saying for a while now it’s overrated. You’re exactly right about the writing being weak. There’s a sequence where the Monica chick gets put into a coma, by a stray punch, from a junior high kid. Then Kayce and the little kid start a fight in the damn hospital waiting room with nurses doing their job!?!?!? I seriously felt like I was watching Days of our Lives. Good stuff OP."
GOD TONGUE,dang bro idk why you got downvoted so much for giving a tv show a chance
GOD TONGUE,I don't think you know that much about cowboys.
GOD TONGUE,I love this show because its mere popularity pisses some people off. LOL
GOD TONGUE,It's funny how liberals complain about everything if a show doesn't fit into their worldview.  Just move the fuck on and watch Drag Queens or whatever piques your interest
GOD TONGUE,"We get it, you don't like the political views the show's protagonist has. Stop making posts about it. The majority of the website already agrees with you.

If I made a post about how the show sucks because it's ""STRONK WOMAN! - The show"" you'd probably bend over backwards to defend it. Every 'faction' is headed by a mastermind woman while the men are either bumbling morons or oblivious to anything outside of their own small bubble."
GOD TONGUE,"Is this considered that new genre named this year, the dad show ?"
GOD TONGUE,1883 is good though.
GOD TONGUE,Sounds like it’s not a show for you.
GOD TONGUE,"Too much cowboy life this season, the show needs to spend more time on the plot."
GOD TONGUE,"I didn’t like the show much after a few episodes. So I stopped watching it. It was a crazy idea, but it worked."
GOD TONGUE,"Beth and Jamie are terrible characters, especially after the ""clinic"" storyline which reeks of forced writing to basically eliminate any shades of gray to both characters. The writers Arya Starked Beth to the point where she is totally uninteresting now. 

Great cast, beautifully shot, awful writing. First 2 seasons were solid, but bad since. It's shocking to hear people compare this show to like The Sopranos. If you want a great Western show/miniseries, you'd do better with Godless or Hatfields and McCoys."
GOD TONGUE,I couldn’t get into it. It’s basically Melrose Place on a horse.
GOD TONGUE,"I tried to give this show a chance just to have some filler TV, but there was so much violence towards animals in the first couple episodes i had to stop. from the first episode opening with Kevin Costner having to put down a horse to the injured dog crawling away from a house explosion (that’s when i tapped out), it was just not something i was able to enjoy.

edit: lmao yeah fuck me 👍"
GOD TONGUE,I'd imagine most cowboys think it's really lame
GOD TONGUE,"Honestly, If you think everyone who watches this show and views it the same way you do, then I have some bad news for you. My dad watches it and almost all the positive messaging people are echoing in here is lost on him. He think all the main characters are ""good guys"" and even worse, now he thinks California=bad. He's not politically savvy so he before this, he didn't even know that as a republican you are supposed to hate California.

To anyone saying there isn't that much political messaging in the show is just being willfully ignorant to the fact. >!Right now John Dutton is the Governor of the state so of course were going to have politics in every episode.!< Not all the political messaging leans right but try to be aware that not everyone see's that messaging the same"
GOD TONGUE,"It's the West Wing for conservatives. Old white men going around being righteous and right.  The native Americans are villains, the biker gangs are from California, every real estate person is evil and wants to tear down half of Montana and turn it into mini malls.  Every woman is tough talking hottie who just wants to be snuggled by a cowboy.  Liberals are either outright villains or need saving by the common sense cowboys.  A lot like the Walking Dead - right wing fantasy camp."
GOD TONGUE,Lol I always say that the Duttons are a shit family.
GOD TONGUE,I like to tell people it’s “R rated Dallas”
GOD TONGUE,It's just so TACKY I've tried to watch the first episode and I could feel a maga hat just growing out of my head
GOD TONGUE,Yeah the part wear they humiliate the hippie chick over and over again is very cringe. Cowboys wet dream is a good analogy
GOD TONGUE,So iTs FoR  rEpUbLiCaNs RiGhT? The retarded left don't know anything else to say...
GOD TONGUE,Knew some people raving about yellowstone. Watched two episodes. Terrible. Now when someone I meet talks favorably of the show....
GOD TONGUE,"I just started watching the show…

And now I just stopped. Lol 😂 ruined it for myself."
GOD TONGUE,That whole show is aimed at the MAGA crowd. A dumb show for dumb people.
GOD TONGUE,It’s almost like you’ve never seen a tv show before.
GOD TONGUE,"cowboy.
Nope, doesn’t auto-capitalize. So why do you?"
Immortal Classic,"I appreciate that perspective, but not only did she lie and cheat, she also put many lives in danger. she willfully deceived everyone and then took steps to cover it up with NDAs... she INTENDED to hurt people and when she knew it was happening, she didn't stop. 

there are people who are driven and motivated and who will stop at nothing. Elizabeth Holmes crossed a line that went beyond this. she will likely deserve more than the punishment they give her.

she's done so much harm."
Immortal Classic,"I was inspired by The Dropout as well. But not by the lunatic wannabe Lady Jobs. It’s good to know even in a deep dark dog eat dog world that is the Silicon Valley, people like Erica Cheung exist. These are the real life heroes who deserve to be celebrated."
Immortal Classic,"I agree Amanda Seyfried was amazing in this, as was Naveen Andrews. However as for Elizabeth Holmes, it was clear she was in over her head. She had a great idea but the science was never there to back her idea. Then there was a deliberate attempt to hide their failures while giving people inaccurate test information. Then they used aggressive lawyers to protect themselves. It was reckless. I hope she goes to prison."
Immortal Classic,">On many different occasions, I could have been Elizabeth Holmes. 

Really? I ""invented"" a time machine when I was a kid. I ""invented"" a flying car when I was in High School. The difference is I knew they were fantasy and couldn't be built and certainly shouldn't have been sold as a working device.

One of the professors she was dealing with early on told her that what she was proposing was against the laws of physics and biology. She was claiming that they could detect a disease in a drop of blood that couldn't hold enough of the enzyme to be detected in a volume that small. Didn't stop her from claiming it as true though. The person who told her this got bounced of course.

I agree, she was naive and then was in over her head, but there were many stop signs on the way that she blew past and then she actively went after the people that tried to warn her before they had to blow the whistle."
Immortal Classic,"I don’t mean to be rude or an asshole, but it’s just not that “ easy … to fall into the mess she made.” She worked incredibly hard and misled and intentionally hurt dozens (hundreds) of people just to get this off the ground. 

What I’m getting at is that it is quite troubling to me that you watch this or read about this and think it was an easy mistake to make. The woman is a sociopath. She doesn’t give a fuck about anyone other than herself. You’re not meant to see yourself in this story. It’s frightening if you do.

But yeah, Amanda Seyfried was fantastic, as usual."
Immortal Classic,"I haven't watched the show, but followed Theranos and of course well aware of it and read the book.

If anyone identifies with Elizabeth Holmes, you're either insane or just wrong and projecting something that isn't there."
Immortal Classic,"Well:  
She wasn't manipulated by Balwani  
All she had was ""an idea"", and the fatuous notion she could fake it till she made it  
But the idea was crap

She's a manipulative sociopath; I have no sympathy for her"
Immortal Classic,"> She epitomizes many of the same drive and emotions of those of us who are at the same time awkward misfits, but also intelligent with driving ambitions. 

she came from a wealthy family, sort of decent looking, had the prestigious education, and white - she was no awkward misfit 

she had all the advantages in life 

>a fool who let Sunny Balwani manipulate her.

please, she was no innocent lamb 

she was a liar and a thief 

this narrative that she was some misfit misguided person who was sadly manipulated by the evil brown guy is just dumb......and a little racist"
Immortal Classic,"Sorry, she was a fraud plain and simple. She didn't do anything brave except swindle people out of money and give sick people false hope."
Immortal Classic,">  But honestly I could not help but identify with Elizabeth Holmes. Part of that has to do with Amanda Seyfried's amazing acting job, but it's more than that. Elizabeth Holmes is significant for her failure. She epitomizes many of the same drive and emotions of those of us who are at the same time awkward misfits, but also intelligent with driving ambitions. She is the classic anti-hero - the dark horse - the one who will do what no one else has done by sheer will. Isn't this what Hollywood has always promised us?

Elizabeth Holmes was a full of shit con man who thought she could ignore 200+ years of scientific research.

She was not manipulated by Sunny Balwani by any stretch of the imagination. She was a grifter and he was her partner in crime. 

>  I know what it's like to try and build something something great, and struggle with it.

She wasn't building anything great. She had a fantasy and then she used her unconventional looks (in the context of Silicone Valley) and created persona to sell it to a bunch of venture capitalist."
Immortal Classic,I found it difficult to muster any sympathy for a narcissistic sociopath… a momentary ethical lapse is in no way comparable to the hoax that she perpetrated.
Immortal Classic,"I've been watching Seyfried on late night talk shows for many years and I see much of her quirky, goofy personality in her portrayal of Holmes. This is kind of a problem because Elizabeth Holmes isn't nearly as likable as the character Seyfried is giving us."
Immortal Classic,"People are shitting on you but I get you. It's a dark, compelling story and there are aspects to her story that are relatable, that's part of what makes it so interesting. Strictly from a story perspective it's a great morality tale about a somewhat normal, relatable person who made some really bad choices and went *way* off the fuckin rails. Part of the fun of media is exploring darker themes on screen in a safe dramatized setting. I think what you got out of the show is what the writers intended."
Immortal Classic,"The trifecta is fun, I'm waiting on wecrashed but almost done - superpumped, wecrashed, the dropout."
Immortal Classic,"This is exactly why I didn’t like The Dropout. I think we ought to stop humanising/glamorising people like her as anti-heroes. Not everyone deserves our sympathy. Not when there are so many, many, many unsung heroes in our midst who’ll probably never see even a tweet written about them"
Immortal Classic,"so basically, con men are anti heroes only if female. God forbid a woman portrayed as a piece of shit these days"
Immortal Classic,If this is a comment section to praise Elizabeth Holmes despite her moral failures. I must admit she seemed to possess the fortitude and determination to make things happen. For a sophomore dropout high school graduate that says a lot about her courage and discipline. When I think about where my ambitions were around her age you can see that having a rich parents and well connected lifestyle and a good childhood education can bring you all the confidence in the world.
Immortal Classic,"Did she have a great idea though? She had the crudest sketch of a possible idea. It was more of a ""wish"" than a credible concept. Everything that followed was built on lies, hubris, selfishness and a lack of concern for other people."
Immortal Classic,Don’t forget sexist - part of agency is not being able to hide behind men when things go south.
Immortal Classic,"> Did she have a great idea though?

She had a great idea in the same way I have a great idea for a warp drive.

I know the end results needed, the vaguest of sense of the basic physics required, and nothing else in the middle."
Immortal Classic,"I think a lot of us that have blood tests regularly wish the process was easier. That’s why her chief scientist stood behind her for so long. I wish they could test multiple things from a single drop whereas sometimes they draw 5 large tubes of blood. However in speaking to various phlebotomists over the years, the draw site has to be clean which is why they don’t draw from your hands and they take more in order to test again. The science doesn’t support using a tiny drop for multiple tests. It was stupid and reckless to dilute the sample then test on a regular Siemens machine."
Immortal Classic,"Yeah as a fan I hope your right this is all leading to something, but honestly I have to admit I'm not as confident as you their is a big plan.

But honestly I'm just losing faith in Chinbnall. He's got miles under his belt and written some good episodes for the show in the past. But to his overall plans I'm less confident.

I recently discovered that when he brought the Silurians back he originally wanted to reveal that they had always looked his new redesign and that in all their previous appearances they had just been wearing costumes.

Now I might be biased as I don't like the redesign, but to me that sounds an utterly terrible. Even getting past the fact that is kind of a smack in the face to what is a generally beloved part of the shows history, why on earth would they deliberately go around dressed up to look more inhuman even when alone with their own kind?

Considering the parallels this creates to his Timeless Child idea now their is no one to reign him in.

Plus if his big plan is to have her get one real big take down against the Time Lords, it would probably work better if he didn't just suddenly kill them off again before we got a chance to be introduced to them again?

So yeah I hope your right. I hope this is building somewhere. Heck it might be interesting to go against the previous seasons argument that the doctor had to much of a god complex and that she really should do more.

But I'm not holding my breath."
Immortal Classic,"Sorry, but I just don't have as much as confidence as you do in Chris Chibnall's writing. I honestly just think Chris Chibnall's idea of 'The Doctor' is to be a really nice and completely innocent person and that's why so many villains don't get completely defeated, can't have a really nice person killing people. 

Unfortunately, a lot of the times, he completely fumbles it when you have the Doctor basically saying ""Killing is bad, sticking them in a container to rot for an eternity is the answer!"" (from Series 11 finale) or ""Killing is bad, letting something slowly die from agonizing pain is much better!"" (from Arachnids in the UK).

 If you do a Donald Trump parody, and the Donald Trump character comes out as more morally right over the Doctor, you've spectacularly fumbled something. If it were deliberate, one of the companions should've said 'You've fucked this up big time Doc' or 'How dare you let him just saunter off like that'"
Immortal Classic,"If you have to explain in a very long post why isn't the series a pile of shit, than the series is probably a pile of shit."
Immortal Classic, Chinball created a pile of shit.
Immortal Classic,"
>I recently discovered that when he brought the Silurians back he originally wanted to reveal that they had always looked his new redesign and that in all their previous appearances they had just been wearing costumes.

Recently? Did you not watch The Hungry Earth where 11 takes off Elia's MASK. Like that's a direct allusion to that and one I remember hearing and allways liking. It's the equivalent of war paint or 6's coat. 

Rory: The Doctor's idea. 
River: Of course. His rules of engagement: float like a butterfly, sting like a bee. 
Rory:Look ridiculous.
River: Have you tried heels?

And as for the Time Lord takedown, I did say that my 5th piece is allways missing. I just know The Master and the Doctor are both Ux and that the theme of the story is responsibility. That little bit in between is why I'm not Chris Chibnall. 

I was reading something a while ago about how [Chibnall fucked up producing Camelot long ago and learned failure creates better than success.](https://rts.org.uk/article/chris-chibnall-man-who-reinvented-cliffhanger)

>""Very early in my career,” says Chibnall, “someone told me that you learn more from a failure than you do from a success. And then I lived out that phrase for a year in Los Angeles. I learned that I would not work that way again or be put in that situation again.” The essential lesson was: “You either have to be in total control of a show or working with people who share your vision and will work with you to achieve it. Also, never work with 13 executive producers.

“Camelot was the classic case of too many cooks. It wasn’t a harmonious set-up and I think that does manifest itself on screen.

“I had a fantastic cast but you have to be free to tell the story you want to tell in the way that you want to tell it. What ended up on screen was not what I wanted and so it is a blemish on my CV.”"

Immortal Classic,">Recently? Did you not watch The Hungry Earth where 11 takes off Elia's MASK. Like that's a direct allusion to that and one I remember hearing and allways liking. It's the equivalent of war paint or 6's coat. 

Never knew that was the source of it. Thought it was just a way of trying to say ""look their not really monsters, they look more like you"" (which is pretty much my big problem with the redesign, they look to human. All the surprise of discovering the seven foot lizard thing with three eyes is actually an intelligent, soulful race doesn't exist anymore).

Look you want to advocate for them wearing masks into battle, sure go for it you want to associate them with ancient war societies. But the idea they spent all their time in all their previous appearances wearing large impractical costumes that look nothing like they really are, even when alone with each other...no that just leaves to many questions for me to swallow.

>And as for the Time Lord takedown, I did say that my 5th piece is allways missing. I just know The Master and the Doctor are both Ux and that the theme of the story is responsibility. That little bit in between is why I'm not Chris Chibnall. 

Well I hope your right.

Huh I didn't even know he was involved in Camelot. That's all fine and valid, but to be honest it doesn't really make me anymore confident."
Immortal Classic,[removed]
Immortal Classic,"I get it. It's okay. Life sucks for us all right now.

There is hope though. 

Allways hope."
Immortal Classic,"Well I wouldn't go that far. I mean I'm still overall enjoying the show. I have no plans to stop watching. Really the biggest concern I have is the next showrunner (or possibly this one) will end up retconning all the changes cause they were deemed to unpopular.

But yeah your right, their is always hope."
Immortal Classic,"Impossible to retcon ANY canon in Doctor Who because someone can allways come along and change it.

That change is the fun part. Embracing the differences to understand them.

May that give you hope."
Immortal Classic,"Oh I love the change, its the only reason this show has lasted as long as it is.

On the other hand it has a history of ditching ideas that went down poorly."
Immortal Classic,"I think ""Escape Clause"" is about death, but that it's mainly about mankind's arrogance. 

It even says so in the intro that this guy thinks the world just can't go on without him, and then he thinks he's got that deal with the devil all figured out ... but best laid plans of mice and men.

I love two episodes where the devil is played perfectly, and Escape Clause is one of them."
Seven Deadly Sins,I thought the show was a fun time overall. Experience says that the perv character traits are .just part of anime. You move past or you skip the show I guess
Seven Deadly Sins,"I was shocked people found it entertaining. The rapey stuff is whatever, honestly that's just anime in general. Tons of animes feature dudes doing things that would be considered harassment or assault in real life, that's just a side effect of the genre. 

But like, it's the most generic, uninteresting, bland, pointless, and poorly written anime I think I've ever watched in my entire life. The art style is mediocre, the character design is awful, the plot is a disaster, the characters are flat and boring and all fit into very stereotypical archetypes. 

I'm flabbergasted it isnt a laughingstock of the Anime industry. Its atrocious."
Seven Deadly Sins,"I'm still reading the manga mainly because I just have to know how it ends. I thought it started off well but don't really think anything after the first season was as good, outside of a couple of cool moments"
Seven Deadly Sins,Yeah its like that the whole wway. If you like anime where dudes just fight it's not bad. I liked it and the stories ok.
Seven Deadly Sins,"If you actually care, I recommend Nuxtaku videos on Seven Deadly Sins on YouTube.

It's a fun anime that gets deeper in S2."
Seven Deadly Sins,Generic and boring and every season it gets worse. Manga is a dumpster fire that was suppose to end like a year ago.
Seven Deadly Sins,The one thing I love about the manga is how strong each character is at the start of it and then they just keep getting stronger and stronger. 
Seven Deadly Sins,"Looks like the exact brand of cliched shonen crap that I tend to adore, guess I'll watch it"
Seven Deadly Sins,So did Netflix buy this or did they pay to produce it?
Seven Deadly Sins,"LOL Attack on Titan + Full Metal Alchemist.

Nice job, Netflix algorithm."
Seven Deadly Sins,when is this out on netflix?
Seven Deadly Sins,But didn't we already have a show called that in Netflix?
Seven Deadly Sins,"The fuck is this weeaboo shit, Netflix? A little more Daredevil and House of Cards, a little less animated shows for children who forgot to grow up. Please and thank you. "
Seven Deadly Sins,It is so much better than that though.
Seven Deadly Sins,"Well, the show is based on a pretty great manga. The manga is original as well. It's one of the better shonen's out there."
Seven Deadly Sins,"I've seen all three, it's nothing like the two you mentioned. Much much lighter and humorous and the story isn't even remotely close."
Seven Deadly Sins,What? It doesn't seem like a mix of those if that's what you're implying...
Seven Deadly Sins,"If it works it works. I haven't seen Full Metal Alchemist, but hear good things and Attack on Titan is great."
Seven Deadly Sins,"This ""weeaboo shit"" exists because a profitable number of people like it. Sorry that some people have different tastes than you. Plus, if you think that someone is automatically a manchild for liking animated shows, maybe you aren't that mature either."
Seven Deadly Sins,"You realize this isn't stopping House of Cards, Daredevil, or any other live action Netflix shows to be produced, right?"
Seven Deadly Sins,Why?
Seven Deadly Sins,Netflix about to take a bit out that crunchy roll.
Seven Deadly Sins,They are all from Japan I suppose.
Seven Deadly Sins,"Watch it. Full Metal Alchemist is my favorite anime.

But they also have a group of characters that are based on the seven deadly sins that are identified by their tattoos."
Seven Deadly Sins,Kongou Bancho is fucking awesome too
Seven Deadly Sins,Cause it is better then a generic shonen crap show?
Seven Deadly Sins,"Sadly, because at least crunchy roll releases shit a week old for free..."
Seven Deadly Sins,"The shows, yes.  The characters and universe within the show? No, all drastically different."
Seven Deadly Sins,"Did some quick searching and it looks like what's on Netflix is just a 4 episode miniseries that leads up to season 2. Season 2 hasn't come out in Japan yet either.

https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/5ul17j/all_seven_deadly_sins_season_2/"
Seven Deadly Sins,"I was upset, too. I don't know if there will be more to season two, but they haven't introduced Escanor or The Ten Commandments yet. So if there's no more to season two, there has to be a season three at some point. I also think Meliodas in the first episode told Elizabeth that the Seven Deadly Sins isn't complete yet (hinting to Escanor)."
Seven Deadly Sins,[deleted]
Seven Deadly Sins,That's what I was thinking too. I just don't want to wait another year for a new season to come out with just those 4 episodes to hold me over.
Seven Deadly Sins,I hope so. Do you think they'll be able to dub that fast?
Seven Deadly Sins,Same... if I have to wait another year I will get soooo angry....
Seven Deadly Sins,"Maybe the episodes are made and the dubbing is done already, I honestly don't know though, we'll have to wait and see.
"
Seven Deadly Sins,"It's not season 2. It's a 4 part mini-series titled ""Signs of Holy War"".

Seven Deadly Sins,"Scripted reality crap, with the hacky spurlock, and implying that ""sins"" are a thing... ."
Seven Deadly Sins,"I heard about the Heart Attack Grill but didn't know about all that stuff behind the owner and the message; The topics don't seem to be too mind blowing, sort of mini-documentaries-for-TV. I think it'd be perfect if there were only exactly 7 episodes too"
Seven Deadly Sins,"I cannot believe there are people left in the industry that give Spurlock money and time on TV. He is not funny,amusing, or even interesting at this point. The word documentary should be used speciously as pertaining to his work. "
Seven Deadly Sins,Didn't care for X Files but loved the haunting theme.
Seven Deadly Sins,"I think The Newsroom showcases most of Aaron Sorkin's biggest flaws and my personal annoyances, but the theme song is very well done and inspiring."
Seven Deadly Sins,"Peaky Blinders theme is a banger

Actual show is...sub-par"
Seven Deadly Sins,The Walking Dead
Seven Deadly Sins,"""Hawaii Five-0"" probably followed by ""Mission: Impossible""."
Seven Deadly Sins,"I've never watched an episode of Sanford & Son, but I love the theme."
Seven Deadly Sins,Hands down .  The Barney Miller theme
Seven Deadly Sins,"Patriot season 2, Sure Shot by Beastie Boys"
Seven Deadly Sins,Pretty Little Liars theme song is so catchy to the point that it’s on my spotify playlist but I can’t stand the show
Seven Deadly Sins,Star Trek: Enterprise
Seven Deadly Sins,Walker Texas Ranger
Seven Deadly Sins,"This is going waaaaay back; ""The Fall Guy"""
Seven Deadly Sins,"I've never watched an episode of American Horror Story, but I've seen the opening themes a bunch of times. Really cool and atmospheric."
Seven Deadly Sins,IT'S  BEEN A LONG ROAD
Seven Deadly Sins,Shame you didn’t give each episode a rating 
Seven Deadly Sins,Go outside
Seven Deadly Sins,"I watched 53 tv shows last year here they are

The Office

*maybe this could serve as a suggestion for shows*"
Seven Deadly Sins,"So you posted a list? OK, I guess. Who cares? "
Seven Deadly Sins,And no Fargo? Come on man 
Seven Deadly Sins,Use trakt.tv dude
Seven Deadly Sins,Cool! What Doctor Who episodes did you watch?
Seven Deadly Sins,Why didn’t you watch season 3 of Better Call Saul? That’s literally the best season
Seven Deadly Sins,"Yes. What's the point of this other than to say ""look how little of a social life I have. I can knock out show a week""! "
Seven Deadly Sins,Damn boy
Seven Deadly Sins,"You and I could definitely watch low profile TV shows together. Ink Master *and* Trixie/Katya! Cool.

Curious how the Trakt totals work -- did you watch the entire Honeymoon Special three separate times, or did it take you three tries to finish?"
Seven Deadly Sins,yeah for some reason this didn't come out as a list. it looks really poor. 
Seven Deadly Sins,thanks.
Seven Deadly Sins,"Maybe it’s just me, but having so many 9/10 and 10/10 shows doesn’t really make sense as a rating system for helping others with suggestions.. Plus you rated nothing as a 6/10 or below. I don’t think everything has to be a Bell Curve or anything, but there has to be some separation/distinction."
Seven Deadly Sins,Idk it was just fun keeping track of it all.
Seven Deadly Sins,I've seen the first 2 seasons.
Seven Deadly Sins,really? OK then I'll watch it. I wasn't really that into the first 2 seasons. I loved BB though.
Seven Deadly Sins,"thanks, for the full list and to browse more my data, go here: https://trakt.tv/users/philrivers/history/shows/added?days=365&start_at=2017-06-23"
Seven Deadly Sins,"Honeymoon special on Netflix is split into three parts so I used the tv show data that listed it in three parts instead of the movie entry as one 90minute piece.  
  
"
Seven Deadly Sins,Love ink master. Some amazing art is.made on that show. 
Seven Deadly Sins,"Well, I thought it was telling.  I try only to watch good series.  Theres so much content out there that I dont commit my time watching a whole season if it's a 6.  You can compare simply!  By taking a show you've seen and looking at how I thought about it and what shows here I watched and the type.  Imo I thought I was helping someone who would be looking for a good series to watch.  For e.g. community is listed s1-3 10/10 seas4-6 7/10 that's helpful imo.  Thanks for the feedback I'm sorry it didnt help you."
Seven Deadly Sins,what did you use for tracking?
Seven Deadly Sins,Season 3 is great. 
Seven Deadly Sins,Yeah each season gets better and better. They just released the season 4 promo today and it looks intense 
Seven Deadly Sins,"I guess I feel that if the worst show you watch is a 7/10, then the scale is broken. But on a more subjective note, I’ve seen 10-15 shows on your list and would give a few a 5 or 6 and none a 10. I would really only give 3 or 4 shows ever made a 10. But hey, this is all very much a matter of opinion. "
Seven Deadly Sins,"I think you're putting too much time into what I offered as suggestions.  All opinions are subjective, my reply was to offer help not to try to change the system of ratings.  I'm just a earthling nothing special.  "
Seven Deadly Sins,Gluttony is up first. Strangely enough this teaser just makes me wish I was eating cheesy rice right now.
Seven Deadly Sins,"I still prefer Hill House, but MM is a close second. Just getting into Midnight Club now and really enjoying it. He’s toned down the monologues which I really appreciate, I know some people liked them but they started to wear on me.

Mike Flanagan is the best thing to happen to the horror genre in a long long time. I love his work."
Seven Deadly Sins,"I liked it a lot. Mainly due to Hamish Linklater who made his monologues sound spontaneous.

But I have to say there was one episode where Zach Gifford and Katie Siegel give monologues about death to each other and omg I could have sworn time actually stopped. It seemed to go on for a thousand years.

Gifford wasn't too bad as he at least has a very gentle style of talking (though it was quite boring still) - but Siegel literally sounded like she was reading it off cue cards and just droned on and on in a monotone. Lost the will to live.

But I loved Linklater. Oh and there was another character, Bev. She was AMAZING.

Edit: Oh and as someone who was raised Catholic, boy did it get it right. It was SO familiar. And TV usually gets it pretty wrong. It was obvious it was written by someone who had attended a lot of Mass."
Seven Deadly Sins,I liked it. Not so much horror as much as supernatural tale IMO.
Seven Deadly Sins,"Really good. Growing up, I knew a women *exactly* like Bev."
Seven Deadly Sins,"It was good one and overlooked by many.  Reminded me a lot of The Leftovers.  If you liked that show, probably would like this one. Has anyone watched the new Flanagan show? The Midnight Club? Haven’t seen it yet but was a little disappointed that seems like its a teen show."
Seven Deadly Sins,TSDR. Needs more words and tortured metaphors.
Seven Deadly Sins,Someone’s trash is another's treasure. I enjoyed it.
Seven Deadly Sins,Show is so good. Only thing bogging it down are the 20 minute monologues where a character basically says nothing.
Seven Deadly Sins,"I agree 100%

I was riveted from start to finish.

And I loved the monologues."
Seven Deadly Sins,I feel like I am the only person who really didn’t like this series. There were so many unnecessary monologues and I didn’t care about any of the characters. Even when something unfortunate happened to someone I just didn’t care. Even the ending which was disturbing to say the least I just wasn’t ever creeped out or scared. Idk it didn’t give me the same feels and scare combo as hill house and bly manor. Even the midnight club had me invested in all the characters. This one was a miss for me.
Seven Deadly Sins,"It’s pretty slow.  I thought it was ok.  


No idea why this sub likes it so much, his previous two were far better"
Seven Deadly Sins,It was watchable as long as we skipped through the endless monologuing. It was 6/10 at best.
Seven Deadly Sins,"It seems, every few weeks, we get a post like this. And I just don’t get it. You have to assume everyone on that island is a fucking moron for that show to work. And if you have to assume stupidity for the story to work, it isn’t good."
Seven Deadly Sins,"I loved it, but I don't like horror. I tried his other series but they were too spooky for me. I was also raised Catholic which I think helped it for me."

The Brave Yoshihiko,"I am so glad I did a Bab 5 rewatch in the last year... the Streaming version of Bab 5 is actually the best possible way to watch the show (it restored some aspect ratio shenanigans that they did on the DVD and syndicated versions of the show)... its a real sting to see it leave the platform.  


It bugs me so much that the're are people who actually applaud what Zaslav has been doing at WB. He has always been bad for consumers and entertainment, and he is once again using his brown thumb to crash what was once a very promising streamer, and destabilizing the whole streaming industry."
The Brave Yoshihiko,"I loved how they upscaled B5 and corrected the aspect ratio to the 4:3 version instead of my blurred shit DVDs (which i still loved with all my heart despite the problems).

I hope this doesn't mean it'll disappear from my iTunes library because i paid for that with money."
The Brave Yoshihiko,This is so confusing. Wasn't Babylon 5's remaster done by HBO? Why would they completely remaster it only to take it down?
The Brave Yoshihiko,"James Gunn: Y'know, I think we'll take some inspiration for future DC films from the DCAU, which is almost universally beloved.

Zaslav: And YOINK!"
The Brave Yoshihiko,"The rumor, IIRC, is that some of the DC stuff will be licensed to whatever service (probably Amazon) gets the Batman: Caped Crusader animated series being done by Bruce Timm and JJ Abrams. 

The others? Who the fuck knows. Probably will be put exclusively on some free-but-there-are-ads service so that they can get some money from them (the ability to totally write stuff off for tax purposes in exchange for never showing it only applies to projects done in the last X years and the decision can only be made in the first X months after an acquisition, so Zaslav can't go and ditch Person of Interest and Babylon 5 forever like he did Batgirl) until somebody decides otherwise sometime in the future.


Still, fuck Zaslav."
The Brave Yoshihiko,Person of Interest is such a good show and I’m sad to see it go.
The Brave Yoshihiko,They’re trying to build a new DC universe and at the same time remove one of the best things DC has ever done.. so dumb
The Brave Yoshihiko,So honestly what IS on HBO at this stage??
The Brave Yoshihiko,Goodbye hbo. I kept it around for DC stuff.
The Brave Yoshihiko,HBOMax going from a high end mall store to Dollar Tree level in a year. What's funny is the right wing culture warriors who think Zaslav is doing all this to fight woke Hollywood instead of just being an incompetent cheapskate.
The Brave Yoshihiko,I’m just canceling HBO Max.
The Brave Yoshihiko,"Person of Interest is on Amazon Freevee. You can watch with ads already.

Source: watched Leverage: Redemption and it was recommended to watch next. Way too few people know that Leverage is back with new episodes."
The Brave Yoshihiko,"Zaslav is such a typical fucking suit. He doesn’t understand that A LOT OF ADULTS really enjoy animation, and that DC Animation is one of the few things keeping the properties relevant after the recent live-action films have been/are so divisive. HBO Max was a great, centralized place to watch all things DC, but apparently animation is “just for kiddos” and REAL adults watch reality TV on repeat. Needless to say, I will NOT be picking up a subscription once I stop getting it for free from AT&T."
The Brave Yoshihiko,Brave and the Bold is my favorite cartoon ever
The Brave Yoshihiko,What a shitload of fuck.
The Brave Yoshihiko,I could have been watching Babylon 5 this whole time!?
The Brave Yoshihiko,Babylon 5 is literally the reason I did a year of HBO in November this irks me.
The Brave Yoshihiko,This is like the Sci Fi channel all over again.
The Brave Yoshihiko,Zaslav should just go ahead and change the name to HBO Min!
The Brave Yoshihiko,That’s it AppleTV+ is going to be the new HBO.
The Brave Yoshihiko,If it wasn’t for doom patrol I would drop hbo max
The Brave Yoshihiko,"
It was the year of fire,
The year of destruction,
The year they took back what was ours.

It was the end of history.
It was the year everything changed.

The year is  2023.  The place, HBO Max."
The Brave Yoshihiko,I fucking hate this company.
The Brave Yoshihiko,What the fuck
The Brave Yoshihiko,Babylon 5 is my favorite show growing up. I still have the dvds at least.
The Brave Yoshihiko,"For anyone who runs out of time to rewatch B5, I can recommend this pair of videos:

[Part 1](https://youtu.be/-FfKOubWE14)

[Part 2](https://youtu.be/bI5Vy1t6EM8)

It’s a thorough recap / review with the key behind the scenes info, and includes Crusade and the one-offs.  I stumbled across it last night and watched it straight through for the 3+ hours.   Felt like I had done another full rewatch in a single evening!"
The Brave Yoshihiko,"We happened to watch Bab5 and PoI and are now trying to get through Fringe before they try to dump that too. These shows should be feathers in their caps, not disposable.

Also, to hell with Freevee. If it's not on Prime, it's dead to me."
The Brave Yoshihiko,Babylon 5 is allegedly getting a reboot on The CW.
The Brave Yoshihiko,I don't know why everyone and their mothers aren't dropping HBO Max...
The Brave Yoshihiko,Yo ho ho it is then.
The Brave Yoshihiko,"damn, where is POI moving to?"
The Brave Yoshihiko,Going to rewatch Babylon 5 and quit HBO Max after Jan 25. Until next season of HOD in 2024
The Brave Yoshihiko,"Since DCAU and other DC related shows were my main reason for keeping the HBO Max service, I guess Zaslev just saved me a couple bucks per month. Its strange to see a streaming big go from really decent to not that great in a year."
The Brave Yoshihiko,"Man, it feels odd that they are targeting 3 shows I was litterally in the middle of watching"
The Brave Yoshihiko,I don’t even have HBO Max but I don’t understand the point of removing things you own and have exclusive rights to.
The Brave Yoshihiko,"What in the everloving fuck?  Stop it Zaslav, it's not funny or cute, stop it."
The Brave Yoshihiko,I genuinely don't get how JL is leaving. They own the rights to the show right?
The Brave Yoshihiko,Fuck zaslav. Taking away dcau is just low.
The Brave Yoshihiko,Justice league cartoon or the live action movie?
The Brave Yoshihiko,"As far as I can tell, there is no content on HBOMax."
The Brave Yoshihiko,"Jeez, feels like they’re removing all animated DC properties from the platform. That sucks."
The Brave Yoshihiko,What are the chances of Netflix picking up JL and JLU?
The Brave Yoshihiko,They are ruining the app by reducing the back catalog. When will the madness end?
The Brave Yoshihiko,"Great, now I have to rush through my rewatch of POI.."
The Brave Yoshihiko,PERSON OF INTEREST YOU'LL ALWAYS BE FAMOUS
The Brave Yoshihiko,But those are my sleeping cartoons
The Brave Yoshihiko,"Pirate Justice League/Unlimited

I'm tired of waiting for it on any of Canada's streaming services

I'll have to look elsewhere."
The Brave Yoshihiko,"Guess I'm going to finally force myself to watch BB5. I like the characters and world building, but I'm not a fan of the aesthetics and their handling of space stuff in general. I don't mind the computer graphics (though it's pretty bad), but there's more fabric than I like to see in my SCI-FI. I'm more of a BSG/Starship Troopers military-style design fan. Lots of exposed metal and such."
The Brave Yoshihiko,"Welp, guess we're adding to the loot list

Yar-Har"
The Brave Yoshihiko,Not JL/JLU leaving hbo max next month when I was thinking of doing a rewatch soon.
The Brave Yoshihiko,Sonofa...I throw on Justice League and JLU all the time.
The Brave Yoshihiko,And as much as we have been waiting for Babylon 5 to even become first available on HBO Max 🙁
The Brave Yoshihiko,Weird how they managed to make AT&T look good. RIP HBO
The Brave Yoshihiko,TIL Person of Interest was on HBO Max
The Brave Yoshihiko,They sure are making me want to stay as a subscriber by gutting the platform of the content I I came for in the first place! Incredible strategy. All so this gargling dipshit executive can get another private jet to fly around with his entourage in and do drugs. Fuck the consumers except for the brainwashed masses that watch the horrible reality shows he produces. Sad fate for what such a good service.
The Brave Yoshihiko,"Fucking hell shit, just when I think I've found a solid place to watch *Babylon 5*, it gets dumped again.  I chased it to HBO Max from Amazon Prime.  Did someone else pick it up, or do I need to go a-sailing for it again?  Getting sick of this constant content-juggling bullcrap."
The Brave Yoshihiko,And you'll just bet they won't ever release that version to BluRay.
The Brave Yoshihiko,I didn’t even know Brave and the Bold was on there. I gotta watch that real fast before they axe it. The Music Meister episode alone is worth the cost of admission.
The Brave Yoshihiko,"BWAHAHAHAHAHA 

HBO Max has been losing so much money it could kill WBD.  It was such a money loser that AT&T had to dump it.

Businesses need to make money simple as that.

I love the cognitive dissonance of people they complain that employers should pay more in one breath then complain the products they sell cost more with the next."
The Brave Yoshihiko,I'm still upset at Netter for what they did to B5's masters...
The Brave Yoshihiko,It was super cool.
The Brave Yoshihiko,Download your iTunes purchases and store them on at least one computer drive. You never know when a studio will yank that stuff from the cloud.
The Brave Yoshihiko,Somehow I think Zaslav will still keep the part where you have to pay for every individual episode/season on iTunes... rather than be able to stream it all without further payments on HBOMax.
The Brave Yoshihiko,"I'm sorry about your heart problems, I hope things get better"
The Brave Yoshihiko,"I own the seasons on Prime, they don't seem bad quality at all, are the DVDs that bad?"
The Brave Yoshihiko,"It shouldn't. It seems that streming contracts are 2 or 3 years, so after something comes to a platform a good chance is it will leave in 2 years. Babylon 5 was also streaming only in handful of countries  - sometimes on Amazon, or on their FreeTV, or some other streamer, and in Latin America it came to HBP Max recently. 

Meanwhile you can buy digital versions on Amazon and iTunes almost anywhere in the world"
The Brave Yoshihiko,"Their last owners paid to remaster it, but the cheapskate new owners decide to just throw it away."
The Brave Yoshihiko,They'll likely license it to another service for cash
The Brave Yoshihiko,"No, apparently HBO and Warner Brothers are separate companies. So US HBO got rights for B5 for a couple of years, now it's leaving. I suspect it will end up on a new free with commercials service"
The Brave Yoshihiko,POI is on paramount plus in canada i think. I cannot see it anywhere because i dont have PP because I don't want to pay for PP because it's not saturday night
The Brave Yoshihiko,"Seriously, now I have to rewatch it again before it goes"
The Brave Yoshihiko,I liked it a lot but have trouble seeing it the same way after learning more about the actor that played Reese
The Brave Yoshihiko,It's on Amazon prime
The Brave Yoshihiko,Right after James Gunn said that going forward they should look to the quality of the DCAU and Young Justice for inspiration.
The Brave Yoshihiko,"Anything currently airing . It seems like they are going to move every property that isn't currently airing to a *nonexistent* free ad supported streaming service that I guess they are hosting. Other than that it will exist, there is literally no information about it or a time line to it's existence. So discovery is just tossing all modern, non airing warner shows off the internet pretty much permanently to save money. 

And I'm pretty sure that bullshit is going to backfire on them, and I don't mean in a ""no one will want to work with them way"", I mean in a ""get sued for a structured plan to deprive people of residuals"" way. 

I have no idea for what purpose discovery plans to keep hbomax running if they won't have any shows not actively running. They'd be as well off shutting it down immediately, only running their non on demand cable channel, and immediately auctioning off every piece of content to other streamers."
The Brave Yoshihiko,"The Last of Us soon enough, Succession, The Sopranos, Boardwalk Empire, Rome, Barry, The White Lotus, The Righteous Gemstones, Eastbound and Down etc etc"
The Brave Yoshihiko,House of the Dragon in 2024.
The Brave Yoshihiko,"Seriously.

#THAT MOTHERFUCKER ZASLAV REMOVING ANYTHING FROM THE DCAU... *that's* where I draw the line.

Fucking cancelling my subscription. While streaming is quicker, I knew it was smart to still hold onto all the BluRay sets."
The Brave Yoshihiko,I’m sure this is only the beginning of them pulling DC stuff. Doubt Titans and Doom Patrol will last long.
The Brave Yoshihiko,Honestly none of these are HBO shows
The Brave Yoshihiko,Incompetent but also another rightwing asshole.
The Brave Yoshihiko,[deleted]
The Brave Yoshihiko,"Thanks! I've edited the post to include the Freevee information.

I **love** *Leverage: Redemption*. I'm enjoying the hell out of the second season and hope they get a third.  Kate Rorick has done a fantastic job maintaining the tone of the original show (granted, she has Dean Devlin, Chris Downey, and John Rogers helping her. :)

BTW, Dean Devlin's also on Jonathan Glassner's new show for SyFy, [***The Ark***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OR-B70h_r1c), so the *Stargate SG-1* team rides again..."
The Brave Yoshihiko,I just started watching it with my two year old today and it is indeed great.
The Brave Yoshihiko,It was way better than it had any right to be.  I remember the internet getting pretty upset about it when it was announced because it was going to be aimed more at children.
The Brave Yoshihiko,"Since Jan. 26, 2021. Yup."
The Brave Yoshihiko,They got me with the annual subscription
The Brave Yoshihiko,Really? I mean I like the DC shows and I don’t like that they’ll be leaving but they’re still easily the best streaming service imo. So much great content.
The Brave Yoshihiko,Well the show is over in a month so...
The Brave Yoshihiko,"If you go to Zaslav’dum, you will die!"
The Brave Yoshihiko,"Poor Zaslav, people are always rude with Zaslav."
The Brave Yoshihiko,"Considering the CW has been sold, that reboot is as good as dead."
The Brave Yoshihiko,I'd be shocked if that was still happening.
The Brave Yoshihiko,"With who? Most of the actors are dead! Man, what a great show."
The Brave Yoshihiko,It's dead Jim
The Brave Yoshihiko,"Dropping stuff from the DCAU is heinous, but tbf, HBO Max has a lot of great stuff. I love old movies, so TCM is awesome to have. Additionally, all the classic HBO shows like Sopranos, Band of Brothers, The Wire, and even stuff like Entourage, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Game of Thrones and Rome are some of the best TV content ever made. Plus they have The West Wing and Friends, and the Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings movies.

IMO, probably the top streaming service."
The Brave Yoshihiko,"I’m locked in a bit because of the annual plan, and unfortunately *I* don’t get any insurance payment or write off by dropping it early"
The Brave Yoshihiko,Legit is the final straw for me. Tired of dealing with this shit.
The Brave Yoshihiko,[Freevee](https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B01F4L45XW).
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,To be honest it looks to me like it's going to be one of those examples of shows that is going to repeat itself every time you come back from a commercial break and really drag out the handful of content you have to show. Having said that I will give it a go. Best of luck to you.
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,"Short information film on our [fauna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNEeq5qGh8I) directed at visitors to our wide, slightly poisonous, brown land."
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,[deleted]
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,Why are most of the crocs shown freshwater crocs? Those guys are kinda chill
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,How's it feel to contribute to five future Cracked articles?
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,"[Serious] Show looks great. I am from the US. Where is it going to air, only Australia or will we get it over here? Looks really interesting and I would definitely watch it and my 9 yo son would love it as he wants to grow up and become an ""Animal Scientist"" as he puts it."
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,I can actually say that its not. Every episode pumps through the infomation and its actually interesting. 
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,Haha you'll have to watch and find out
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,Kinda being the key word here
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,"Oh awesome thanks mate! It will air in the US, it will be on Nat Geo in early August. As I have more airing details I'll flick you a message!"
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,Will be sure to keep an eye out for it.  Keep up the good work and thanks again.  Will be sure to mention it to friends and family also.  
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,"Hey mate! An update on this, The firs Episode has aired in Australia.
Its on Nat Geo Wild every Tuesday night at 7:30pm 
Sorry for the late reply just remembered about this."
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,Wow ! Thanks a bunch. Was wondering about that lately and tried to look for it on Nat Geo Website a couple of weeks ago to no avail. I *REALLY* appreciate you thing of me and remembering to contact me. You are what makes Reddit great !!!
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,"Oh well thanks heaps!
Let me know what you think about the show, love to hear some feedback"
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,"Having a hard time finding it in the channel listings, including the dates and times you listed. Does not seem to be on ???"
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,"My squad leader at Fort Drum went to Ranger school; their last phase of training was in Florida.   The episode that Steve teaches the Army guys about snakes, my squad leader was there.   One thing that I enjoyed hearing my SL say was, ""once the cameras were off, Steve was the same guy.""  What we saw on TV, was Steve Irwin."
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,"I think the appeal of Crocodile Hunter was seeing Steve get up close to dangerous animals and remain in striking distance while talking to the camera, creating tension. You knew in the back of your mind that it was prerecorded and they wouldn't air anything disastrous but there was always the chance he would get bit by something, and frequently did. The psychology is probably similar to a horror movie, and he used it to teach us about wildlife and ecology."
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,> It's the Irwins (plus Bindi's boyfriend)
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,"Chandler swinging out of his league here, good for him"
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,I'll watch if they get the zaboomafoo guys for an appearance 
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,Chandler Powell looks kinda like Steve.
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,Finally I can watch Animal Planet again for the first time since Irwin's death.
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,Well I'm interested 🤷‍♂️
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,I was at their zoo about a month ago. It’s a little weird how much the family is used in the promotional materials around the zoo. It’s really obvious they are trying to make them into personalities and it’s a little uncomfortable. 
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,"Robert Irwin is like the main character whose story begins with the tragic death of his mentor figure and who sets out to put things right, but in this case about five billion times more wholesome. 

All we need now is a second David Attenborough and the world of awesome nature television television can rest easy for another 50 years. "
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,I’ve missed Animal Planet. Also- Used to have a crush on Bindi when I was little watching her fathers show. She’s still looking fine after all these years. 
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,I hope the[John Oliver Koala Chlamydia Ward](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgRurZ5gdSw) makes an appearance.
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,"I hope this show avoids being reality trash and can focus on the animals at least.

"
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,This is going to be great. Both his kids are so much like him and have the same spirit.
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,"If they do this right it will stay focused on the animals and the zoo and the Irwin’s daily interactions with them. If they do this wrong they’ll slowly move the focus to the family and their day to day non-zoo lives and their relationships and personal drama around season 2-3.

Don’t fuck this up, Animal Planet."
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,I see so much Steve in Robert's face.
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,"I recently started following the whole family on Twitter. They seem like wonderful people. Scrolling through my Twitter timeline is typically a constant stream of gloom and doom and bad hot takes. Now, it's punctuated by nice pictures of animals being rehabilitated and reminders that people can be good if they try.

I miss Steve Irwin but I am very happy that his legacy is alive and well."
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,Damn Bindi is gorgeous!
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,"Grew up with Chandler, crazy to see "
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,Very excited in seeing how his kids take over
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,Let’s clone Stevo bring him back the planet needs him 
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,They grew into bloody supermodels .
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,"I'm not sure if Miss Irwin's boyfriend dodged the most *terrifying* introduction to her dad, or the most *awesome*."
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,Put on Netflix! 
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,Bindi would get it.
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,it premieres on my birthday. Best present ever
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,Bindi is pretty dang hot.
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,Can't wait for this to come to the UK.
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,"I'll probably watch just because I miss Steve. I hope it's great. I really want to see them succeed, especially after such loss."
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,"All I can say is, what took so long. "
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,"I'm excited. For some reason, I've been feeling really nostalgic for Steve's old show lately, so this is coming at the perfect time for me."
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,Wholesome
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,"His son is a spot on image of his father, in manners and also looks, he has the same enthusiasm for animals just like his father had and i hope this show will do good."
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,I want to see a show with Steve Irwin's uncle and aunt.
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,Already 10x better than the Kardashians.
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,"'Crikey! It's the Irwins' is honestly not australian enough. It should be 'Crikey! It's the fucken Irwins, cunt!'

"
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,"Oh I miss Steve! His son Bob seems so much like him, such contagious enthusiasm for animals. "
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,Mmm Bindi
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,yo his daughter is hot
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,There's going to be a lot of dudes tuning in just for those Bindi curves and thick body.
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,Featuring Bindy's sweet fuckin rack. 
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,Gonna be at the edge of my seat when the stingray episode airs. 
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,Begun the clone wars have.
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,Wholesome! <3
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,I really wish them the best. I was devastated when Steve died. He was such a genuinely good guy who loved his life and his work. They just seem like the most wholesome family ever. Robert appears to have the charisma and energy of his father. I hope they do well.
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,This is what I need in my life. I miss watching Steve on TV. Still watch clips and old episodes on YouTube. 
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,So happy to just see some programming with good hearted people!
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,Cool. Should mean another round of talk show appearances. I always enjoy them when they show up on those.
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,"Anyone cringe at the title?  I mean, they're celebrities, rightfully so, and there's nothing wrong with using that status to get more viewers.    But I worry that their celebrity will get overplayed and burn them out from the work they really love to do, and that we love to watch them do.  Especially since the kids have already been celebrities their whole lives."
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,"It's weird, but Steve Irwin and The Crocodile Hunter were never really on my radar, yet I see so much love for him everytime he's mentioned on here. Pretty sure I was in the age range at some point (it was on from when I was 12 to 23), and while I'm familiar with him and the show, I don't think I've ever seen an episode. Was it mostly directed at kids younger than 12, or was I just an oblivious child?"
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,"As a girl in kindergarten, there was a reptile day or something, and I was one of the few who chose to have a giant snake put on my shoulders.

(Conditional: if this is the chosen advertising picture,) I don't like that the women have the smallest or no reptile.

We know these women have done much more, but this picture cuts masculinity and femininity down the middle.     

Edit: word"
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,Ummm who's this fucking Chandler guy???
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,thank you God
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,Crikey! Robert Irwin is the spitting image of his Dad!
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,And yet another show that’s not about the animals but is just a reality show. 
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,So thiiiiiis is why I kept seeing the Irwin family all over Reddit. Ads have gotten really crazy in the year 2018
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,Steve Irwin reboot. Is there anything executives won't ruin?
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,I hope Bindi has a nip slip 
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia," My squad leader at Fort Drum went to Ranger school; their last phase of training was in Florida. The episode that Steve teaches the Army guys about snakes, my squad leader was there. One thing that I enjoyed hearing my SL say was, ""once the cameras were off, Steve was the same guy."" What we saw on TV, was Steve Irwin. "
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,They spoke to talkradio about following on in Steve's footsteps. They're such an incredible famliy [https://youtu.be/HikS6vAGxHM](https://youtu.be/HikS6vAGxHM)
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,[removed]
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,This man is my hero 
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,No.
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,"
... but not stingrays.

Never stingrays."
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,I would love to see a show about sting rays 
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,"Suddenly the surge of pictures of the Irwins all over Reddit seems a lot less wholesome, given the timing of this announcement. Marketing in action.

(Edit: Oh dear, I've upset the marketing department.)"
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,Bindi turned into a piece of ass. 
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,"Anytime The Irwin's come up, I like to post this:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8-mITnnvVc "
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,[removed]
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,"I think we're going to need a bigger sting ray.

&#x200B;

Sorry 

&#x200B;

But I'll watch this to see how it is. I loved Steve and his original show."
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,[removed]
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,So they have 1200 dogs with jobs at the zoo? Because literally the only animal on Animal Planet is dogs doing shit.
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,This is a bad name for what could be great.. TV is fucked. 
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,I miss Bob’s bob. 
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,You would be surprised how rare that is.. Having worked in TV I've watched some very swift 180's going off and on camera. 
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,"If you watch the TV pilot you can see that in the beginning he was kinda awkward with cameras around (and so stilted with his narration) but I think as it went on he realised that there was nothing to be afraid of and all his silly aussie-isms are what made people love him so much.

I personally believe Terri had a lot of influence in Steve becoming the on camera personality he was. She seemed to already be leaps and bounds ahead of him in that realm. And her being a yank is probably part of the reason the show did so well in the US, it was this crazy aussie stereotype of a man but then his wife was someone the American viewers identified with and related to."
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,"They will be successful if they all just be themselves, and not a parody of Steve or try to act like Steve. Yes, I recognize they are his kids, but they shouldn't be acting like him with his mannerisms or exaggerations. Steve was Steve."
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,Aye I used to live in Fort Drum.
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,"It also helped that he had the most charisma of anyone I’ve ever seen. This was a man who genuinely, truly loved what he was doing. 
https://youtu.be/pdpUNs_KckI"
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,"That was some of it, but it was still a great and appealing show when he wasn't dealing with dangerous wildlife. Steve could sell an ant as some awe inspiring beast."
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,"He wore Ray-Ban sunglasses to avoid be blinded by spitting cobras. Even at 11, I was like dude get some goggles. "
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,"Damn...I didn't grow up with Steve Irwin and now I just watched a [whole 'Oprah' episode with him, his wife and his daughter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKvT6-OgnlM)"
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,Even if it was prerecorded hearing a grown man say shit repeatedly as a boa latches to his arm as a 10 year old it was the coolest thing on TV.
72 Dangerous Animals: Australia,The appeal for me was that I should listen to what he is saying so I don’t get eaten next week

I think the appeal of Crocodile Hunter was seeing Steve get up close to dangerous animals and remain in striking distance while talking to the camera, creating tension.

Although that's how he died, so it doesn't make much sense to do that again, does it?"
Still Game,This is obviously written by an American but just so you know location wise its based in Maryhill which is known outside even Glasgow for its depravity and shiteness.
Still Game,It’s also a spin-off from the sketch show chewin’ the fat if you haven’t seen it
Still Game,"""BACK AFF YA SPOOKY BITCH"""
Still Game,"On my 3rd re-watch. I love shows that have good banter between characters. I really love when they are ripping on each other. If anyone knows of any other shows that have the same feel, I would love some recommendations."
Still Game,This is usually on repeat at my house (not by me). I just can’t stand the laugh track.
Still Game,Watch the first six series and then stop. Series 7-9 is the worst drop in quality a TV show has ever gone through and I'm not being hyperbolic at all.
Still Game,They are deff worse but there are a few gems. The last two episodes are magic.
Still Game,Lol Mrs Browns Boys is the absolute worst
Still Game,"Haha. Mrs Brown Boys is a travesty of TV. That that show even gets commissioned is a crime against good comedy. 

Some ones I have not seen mentioned:

Black Books, Father Ted, 8 Out 10 Cats Does Countdown, The League of Gentlemen, Brass Eye, The Day Today, The Thick of It, Red Dwarf, Spaced, The Mighty Boosh, Bottom, Friday Night Dinner, Men Behaving Badly, Some Mothers Do Have Em, Peter Kays Phoenix Nights, Only Fools & Horses.

Those should keep British comedy fans busy for a while."
Still Game,Peep show is available on prime. No need for the addon
Still Game,"Really? Mrs. Brown's Boys? Really?

And don't get me started on Still game!

Neither should be in the same sentence as Peep Show."
Still Game,Any other really well known Brit comedies you want to mention? Fleabag? IT crowd? Inbetweeners? Fawlty Towers?
Still Game,"I've found some of Mrs browns boys on YouTube, clips anyway, if you want an introduction. The one with the pine air freshener hut my funny one just right and death by laughter was a near miss...."
Still Game,"Still Game is very good, but if you're not Scottish you will need subtitles"
Still Game,"Ain't seen the first two but Peep Show is flat out hilarious. Would strongly recommend. 

[Johnson in Quarantine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Paw-EKCw_3o)"
Still Game,"Yes! I love those shows. Can't wait for season 8 of Still Game to come to USA. It's on YouTube, but not the same as on Netflix. I use subtitles for sure. My mom lived in Glasgow. It brings back good memories for her and I love the characters.  Watch Chewin' the Fat also.  Still Game is a spinoff of that show. 
I've never seen Mrs. Brown's Boys, but I'll check it out.  Thanks for suggestion!"
Still Game,"Everyone hates on Mrs Browns Boys but I'm not ashamed to say that those early seasons made me laugh till I ugly cried. 

The first time I saw her get trapped in the Christmas tree, OMG. I thought I was gonna pass out."
Still Game,"I agree but he did convince a generation of old Irish people to vote for gay marriage, him and Shirley Templebar."
Still Game,"To each their own, I get a kick out of it though. Do you have any recommendations?"
Still Game,Max and Paddy's Road to Nowhere is a good spinoff from Phoenix Nights as well
Still Game,"I don't really get the hate, if it's not your taste that's fine. It's not like I'm throwing The Godfather in the same category as Snakes on a Plane for fuck sake. Everyone just wants to laugh right now, get it how you can."
Still Game,Still game is miles better than peep show but I like peep show also and back.
Still Game,"Inbetweeners is must recommend

Two others that people recommended to me in the past: Fresh Meat, which is a comedy / drama with Simon from Inbetweeners. Show is pretty decent. ""You all are the worst type of racists. Money racists!"" 

Other is Bad Education with Jack Whitehall. That show is flat out hilarious."
Still Game,"I'm just talking about ones I've discovered lately that may not be so well known. IT Crowd is one of my favorite shows ever, and Fawlty Towers is a legend in and of itself like Black Adder."
Still Game,My parents love Chewin' the Fat as well so I'll need to check it out! Apparently Reddit isn't a fan of Mrs Brown's Boy's but give it a shot because if you like it you'll find yourself belly laughing.
Still Game,"Blackadder.

Start with season 2."
Still Game,"""Our country"" is very good, some older ones I love a re""My Family"" and ""Coupling"" also ""Friday Night Dinner"" is worth a watch"
Still Game,You might enjoy some of the older ones in the Comedy section of r/oldbritishtelly
Still Game,Bad Education. Good call. I'd also add Crashing.
Still Game,I'm not sure. Isn't Peep Show older than IT Crowd?
Still Game,I'm almost positive it is but IT Crowd was on Netflix years ago. And what are you not sure about? There's nothing nefarious going on I'm just chucking out recommendations if you're into British shows like I am.
Still Game,Everyone in Scotland. You should check out Chewin' the Fat on Netflix. It's written by the same guys and Still Game originated as a sketch-about a bunch of old guys in a pub singing dirty songs-on that show.
Still Game,"My husband and I watched it and loved it. We were so excited when the newest season came on Netflix and binged it in one night.  Our friends all think we are crazy for watching our ""weird Scottish show"""
Still Game,"I've seen it, and I was originally in the same boat as you. Found it, loved it, but no one to talk to about it. The new series showing currently on BBC1 isn't as good as the others though, unfortunately."
Still Game,"Lol non scots getting still game it ran in England with subtitles XD

Have a look at Rab c Nesbit for a culture shock "
Still Game,Not available in Latin America Netflix
Still Game,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTsvLjAzozE
Still Game,Burnistoun is another good one on netflix by some of the writers of still game
Still Game,"And if you like that, check out Limmy's Show. Also on Netflix and another Scottish sketch show. A little darker than Chewin' The Flat, but also very funny."
Still Game,Here's an example sketch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIQg1ZP3lqE
Still Game,"Oh fab,  cheers for the tip! "
Still Game,"If you have a VPN, the long awaited Series 7 has finally started in the UK, you can find the first four episodes on BBC iPlayer right now"
Still Game,"Just a wonderful, low budget BBC Scotland comedy. Did not expect it! "
Still Game,It took me and episode to start understanding them! 
Still Game,I'm afraid this is not something I had looked into
Still Game,I actually prefer the look of this one
Still Game,Greetings traveller.
Still Game,"""Oh here they come. You're puttin' the beef on Jack""

""Aye thats right. Everytime I shag your wife she makes me a sandwich"". "
Still Game,"From Ireland, I have so much love for it.
I was introduced to it in 2010. It's a comfort watch type of show. If you haven't seen them, check out the new season that was released earlier this year. "
Still Game,"I discovered it on Netflix and have since seen the show from start to finish (plus the holiday specials) three times already. So yeah, there's definitely some love from me :) 

Looking forward to the next series!"
Still Game,"This is one of the shows I remember VIVIDLY from childhood (I'm Scottish and was raised there, living in London now) and my god it holds up so well. It is hilarious, I'm so glad it's available in other countries!"
Still Game,"[New season coming out later this year as well.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-39290585)

Probably due out October/early November, the same as last year."
Still Game,Laugh track. No.
Still Game,"I'm still working my through, just started season 4. I agree with you, one of my overall favorite things about the show is that you really get a sense that all the characters genuinely care about each other, even if the bicker they're never nasty, and at the end of the day, they have each other's back. Especially compared to other newer sitcoms which can often resort to mean-spiritedness for laughs. "
Still Game,"Ah nice, haven't seen the holiday specials yet!"
Still Game,"Yup, it has a laugh track."
Still Game,"They're on YouTube, along with series 7 (which hasn't hit U.S. Netflix yet). "
Still Game,Still Game was amazing!
Still Game,I'd never heard of it until it popped up on US Netflix a few months ago. Great show!
Still Game,[deleted]
Still Game,"They did a live show a few years back, and, apparently, a new series just started airing, and then they're going to do another live show. All the main actors on the show wore make-up to look much older than they were, so I guess there was always the option to keep it going. 

Just looked, and the new series started a couple nights ago. I'm going to watch the first episode and see how it stacks up."
Still Game,"It would be easy to be derisive, but I'm feeling closer to pity. What's it like living in a world where everything from Seinfeld to Blackadder to Fawlty Towers, and even Monty Python's Flying Circus, is all just so much trash?"
Still Game,[deleted]
Still Game,Your troll game is weak.

Still Game,"What are you doing commenting on /r/television then, if you have literally no opinion worth sharing? Especially if by your own admission you don't watch much television...some life you've got there. I guess you are right though... shitting on what other people enjoy is a form of alternate entertainment...

Edit: https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=lLMvrMlKLvE"
Still Game,I loved it! I binge watched while I was on vacation and totally neglected all the stuff I had planned to do. 
Still Game,I've never heard of it. It's got a 9.1 on IMDB as well. I'll definitely check it out.
Still Game,Ughhhhh why do shows still have laugh tracks. Tried watching the first episode but the laugh track is killing it for me.
Still Game,"I'm surprised it's not more well known. It really is a very rounded, developed show. Lots of laughs but it hits you in the feelies too! 
"
Still Game,We'll hopefully you'll keep watching. Once you get familiar with each recurring character it really gets good.
Still Game,The episodes with the phone calls to their children 😢
Still Game,"Luckily it's very popular here in Scotland, pretty much everyone I know has seen at least an episode of it and it was quite a big deal when the cast announced they were reuniting. They've had a few stage shows as well that I've heard are good but I've not had the pleasure to attend."
Still Game,Yeah I'll definitely watch a bit more. I just hate Laugh Tracks but can get used to them after a while. I just prefer it without.
Still Game,Anyone know what he died from? Poor Pete
Still Game,Maybe the problem is that some producers don't even try to adapt.
Still Game,Because for some reason it is impossible for them to actually attempt to adapt the games stories instead of just dressing up some shitty failed script with a few references so they can claim it is an adaptation of a video game...
Still Game,"That's not a fair title. The show had the same name as the game, and then it was an after school special / teen drama 

They did not attempt to adapt the game, at all."
Still Game,"The problem here was they DIDN'T adapt the video games ..they went off book and lost a large portion of the baked in fan base....bad idea. 
If you want something like this to work the least you need to do is keep the baked in fans...worry about getting new fans should be secondary."
Still Game,It's crazy that the best two video game movies are Sonic The Hedgehog and Detective Pikachu.
Still Game,"Just make a miniseries and set it inside a scary mansion over the course of one night.

Don't make new characters, just use the source material lads."
Still Game,"Stop hiring cringe writers and producers that give zero fucks about the original concept.

Then you'd have had a better show.

The production value and acting was all there but the story was just....yikes.

And what's hilarious is resident evil has some serious out of left field situations so if they had just toned it down a little it would have been right at home."
Still Game,"Castlevania worked fine. People generally like the Sonic films. The Pokemon anime and movies have mostly had staying power. 

It just depends on what you are adapting"
Still Game,"This is nothing to do with adapting. I feel people just want to use a franchise's skin to sell whatever script idea they have and are shocked when fans of the original critique it as being far flung from the source material.


They should just make the show they want, and not market it as some other franchise as its clearly creating false expectations and bad will"
Still Game,Hollywood needs to stop putting their own “spin” on things. Either do it right or fuck off.
Still Game,That’s because they don’t really care about adapting these games. They just want to use the name to make money.
Still Game,"They struggle because they want to at this point. Resident Evil is a great example of how self imposed stupid ideas ruin things. It was less a show based on Resident Evil than a completely different bad project that stuck RE bits on randomly. Even the last movie did a better job despite sucking for other reasons.


Meanwhile, Sonic the Hedgehog of all things gets it right. Yeah the human characters are superfluous and the first ones buddy road trip plot was odd, but it got the spirit of the thing right. It was a fun time! Same with Detective Pikachu. 

Just stick with what worked in the game, minimize additions unless absolutely necessary, and accept the fact that NOT EVERY GAME NEEDS AN ADAPTATION."
Still Game,"They keep missing the point and making generic genre media with a franchise name slapped on it.

Telling stories that star characters we don't care about that were made just for whatever it is.

They keep trying to make something ""different"" to the point it becomes unrecognizable aside from a very shallow surface level representation of what it was.

I hear a lot of argument that people don't want to see the same thing they saw in that other thing that they took the name from, but honestly, yeah, they kind of do. It's exactly what they want.

They want the same story told with Hollywood level special effects and production values. Following the main protagonist and showing them a version that isn't really possible in a game due to technical limitations.

The most alteration they might want is a side story that exists between games. Also likely following the protagonist of said game without disrupting the continuity of the game itself. Still basically ""the game but on screen"" but an original story that exists in that world and bridges some gap.

We almost never get that and instead get something that is just wearing the franchise and name to create generic genre media without really being that thing.

For example, Resident Evil is never apocalyptic, but every live action RE adaption has been exactly that. The heroes contain the spread and survive it in the games. The events are local and not world ending.

Instead we just end up with generic zombie post apocalypse trash that use a couple of monsters from the games and a few side characters with the same name as characters from the games.

The same thing happened with Doom. Instead of a demon slaughtering last survivor space marine saving humanity from a gateway to hell, we get a boring sci-fi horror thing about a nonsense virus.

The recent Mortal Kombat movie followed some nobody fanfiction self insert who had no business being there as the main character. It wasn't the actor's fault and he did a fine job, but no one wanted that character getting in the way of what audiences actually wanted to see.

It wouldn't be difficult to fix these problems with these kinds of adaptions, but Hollywood is weirdly dense regarding it and always seems to learn the wrong lessons."
Still Game,Yea let's just forget about arcane shall we? like that didnt happen
Still Game,"like many others said, on most cases, including this specific one, it’s more that film producers don’t even put in an honest attempt at a proper adaptation"
Still Game,"Because they are NOT adapting them.  They are making their own garbage show that has nothing to do with the source material outside of it having the same brand name and a few characters that have the same name.  Outside of that, it has no relation to it.  I would love to see a faithful adaption of a popular IP, but I think that is impossible for current Hollywood, that would require getting real talent and not hiring people who just happened to have connections to the industry."
Still Game,"Here’s the thing, it’s not the fact that video games struggle in a movie format. It’s pompous directors who want THEIR vision to reflect in an already established universe. They can easily adapt from the dozen books that RE has but they would rather come up with a non-canon scenario and treat the property lesser since it’s “just a video game”."
Still Game,We all know why resident evil got canceled. Glad that it did.
Still Game,Its not that hard. First step: play the games.
Still Game,"I watched the full thing. 


There is so.. so.. so much wrong with it. Especially if it’s meant to take place after the games. And I could literally rant for days over all the problems it has and how unfaithful it was to the source material. 

It’s like they googled resident evil… grabbed some of the main names and just slapped them in there. Didn’t even bother to look the characters up. 

And Jade and Billie? Even if this wasn’t an unfaithful resident evil shit show and it was called anything else but a zombie show? Yeah, no. Those two will go down as two of my least favorite protagonists. Everything that goes wrong is 100% on them, but they never are held accountable or learn. And their “fuck you daaaaddddd” to “Wesker” was the most edgy and undeserved parental hate I’ve ever seen. The dude was a super father working 16+ hour shifts every god damn day by actual gun point as a single father to support them and gave them everything they ever wanted and more. 

And we never even learn why they hate him, they do from episode 1 and treat him like absolute garbage despite him always being loving and courteous to them and always placing them first. He’s never did a single thing to deserve it. The kicker? Single super dad is rapidly dying of super aids, and he’s still supporting them. But oh no he needs their blood to not die instantly from super aids? Absolutely irredeemable. Fuck you daaaaaad im going to destroy the world and blame everyone else!!! Oh, and can’t forget that Billie is literally meant to get to get teen girls involved because she’s literally designed off Billie Eilish… Jesus so lazy. 

Also, Wesker would *never* clone himself. He is narcissism incarnate. He would only clone himself if he planned on transferring his own mind into it or as experiments to test new strains on his body but they would be mindless shells. And if he did make clones just to be his scientists he would have planted Las Plagas in them or taking contingencies to always keep them in line. There is no way he’d create being as ambitious and scheming as himself without taking precautions. But the fact they claim he made clones at all to introduce Wish Foundation Blade is an insult to Wesker. No one can be as perfect as Wesker, in Weskers mind. He would never make a being of equal intelligence, charisma, and strength as himself. He would kill it immediately for his own world supremacy. 

Just… ugh. So.. so disappointed on so many levels with this. It’s insulting to actual resident evil fans: they didn’t even try to be faithful they just threw a dart at the board and picked names randomly from it. T virus has been obsolete in the lore since like 2009. Not to mention Umbrella dissolved in 2003 and Neo Umbrella set the world aflame in 2011. But yeah sure Umbrella is still a thing and the world is fine. 

Lastly, Lance Reddicks performance carried the good spots it did have. The problem though is he didn’t play Wesker. And no not because he’s Black and I’m the ultimate racist, like people keep regurgitating. Wesker is not an exceptionally loving and caring super father who takes orders from anyone, even as a clone. Actual Wesker wouldn’t want to raise a family and be a whipping bitch boy for Evelyn. Wesker would have turned Evelyn into a puppet or outright killed her if she ever tried to threaten him. And I’m aware his clones aren’t “him.” And each one is flawed. 

However The writing direction for Wesker was not at all in line with actual Wesker, even if I love Bert with all my heart as he was the best thing in the show. He did not play Wesker. He played a super loving single dad. And it’s a shame he couldn’t actually act as actual Wesker outside of that brief 2 minute Make-A-Wish Blade cameo. It’s criminal how hard he carried the show and the character they had him as wasn’t even written properly. It’s like they tried to apply the Kratos treatment to Wesker but without actually showing the progression. 

Okay I need to stop. I hate this show. I’m glad it got canceled and people didn’t tell Netflix this is acceptable. It’s not. I’ve already edited this 4 times to rant more over it and I could still go on."
Still Game,*Because they ignore and don't value the source material
Still Game,"""We're adapting [thing]!""

""Have you seen/played/read [source/inspiration]?""

""no, now get me the writer of Mall Blart Paulmart 2"""
Still Game,"The problem with adapting video games to TV/Movies is that these directors all try to change so much of the source material so they can feel like they are making something of their own. 

It's like they don't realize that fans of these series don't want to see something different.  They want to see stuff that is mostly true to the source material.  

That's one of the biggest reasons why the RE movie franchise was so lackluster.  Alice wasn't even a character in the games, let alone did any of the characters in the games have any special powers.  Combine that with the fact that in any movie where there were video game characters (Jill in RE2, Claire in RE3, etc) they were all made out to be weak/helpless for the most part.  Nowhere near their video game counterparts. 

And to top of all off, this RE Netflix series was about.... family?!?!  TF?!  Is this the Fast & Furious franchise now?"
Still Game,"It's not difficult. Really. The only thing they have to do is RESPECT the source material and FOLLOW CLOSELY the plot of the game you want to adapt.

And that also is valid for other adaptations, like books. Examples: Harry Potter, NICE. Eragon, Artemis Fowl, BAD."
Still Game,Really feels they go away from the actually storyline and everything in the game when they should be following these things closely . So many good games out there they can have success if they actually follow the damn games .
Dinotrux,Did they figure out the oak island curse on “History” channel?
Dinotrux,">“We also request that Netflix develop a policy that balances such false narratives with the presentation of scientific documentaries and accurate reporting.”

Yeah, good luck with that you guys."
Dinotrux,"Yeah, Good luck with that.

The head of Netflix unscripted productions is Graham Hancock's son, Sean Hancock."
Dinotrux,"The series introduced me to quite a few fascinating historical sites like gobekli and karahan tepi . Gigantia in malta too. I had no idea  those sites existed , so the show was good for that , with everything else taken as a pinch of salt for how light on evidence it really was ."
Dinotrux,"I watched part of the series and, as typical for this type of series:-

* Start with a 'what if xyz happened'
* A few seconds later 'there was high probability of xyz happening'
* Then for the rest of the segment 'xyz happening' is treated as a fact.

The other annoying presumption is that an early stone age/agrarian society was incapable of advancing without being taught by a more advanced civilization.

Science advanced by people questioning existing theories, they postulate a theory that explains an observation and provide empirical data to support their theory.  Just saying this part of a temple is underwater, therefore it must have been built prior to, or during the last ice age without also showing that the land level has not changed in the last 12,000 years is dishonest."
Dinotrux,"Honestly there are elements of Hancock’s argument that make sense and have had evidence come out in its favor. The Younger Dryas impact being the biggest one. I wish he would stick to the actual facts that have come out in support of his hypothesis and just leave the Atlantis thing alone. Quoting the story of Solon talking to the Egyptians about the fall of an advanced civilization is fine to show the cultural memory of the the younger dryas impact and it’s effects. But leave it at that, no need to be all Atlantis is real. The finding of Gobekli Tepi moving back the timeline for how early humans developed agricultural and architectural society is also great. He has a point about modern people taking the stories of ancient people a little more seriously. We didn’t think Troy was real either until a fool like Heinrich Schliemann decided to buck all of the academic community and look for it. I just wish Hancock would focus more on the new evidence that these ancient cultures existed and less on the his own personal beliefs on what this possible lost culture was like. The last point I agree with Graham on is the fact that archeologists need to dig deeper in the Americas to see if there was pre-Clovis civilization. The Clovis first hypothesis never sat right with me, even in grade school. It just seemed like the archeologist just decided to stop looking because they believe the land bridge is the only way or time humans could have crossed to America. I always thought who cares what you think, keep digging and see what you actually find."
Dinotrux,I watched the series and found it interesting. He does raise some interesting points but his theories are based on assumption upon assumption. Anyone of them being incorrect brings his theories crashing down like a house of cards.
Dinotrux,"Discovery channel had my 5th graders convinced mermaids exist. 

I think we are slowly devolving. A huge slice of the population can no longer tell fiction from fact."
Dinotrux,The claims of a dogmatic archeological conspiracy against his ideas is so absurd when you look at all the major discoveries that have been made over the last 20-30 years. Archeology has accepted many major timeline busting discoveries when there was sufficient evidence to do so.
Dinotrux,"I didn't feel like Graham was claiming he had a myriad of evidence to support much of his theories. It felt like he was simply stating his case and openly theorising an alternative history with the little evidence presented to us as the audience.

I felt like he did a great job connecting all of these various sites using old mythical stories and with great conviction.

If there is clear unequivocal evidence to counter everything he discusses on the show it should be easy to dismantle...."
Dinotrux,"*""Aliens Used the Pyramids as Landing Pads""*  
- Dr Daniel Jackson"
Dinotrux,"I enjoyed the show and I felt it brought up some interesting ideas. Having said that, everytime Graham said the words ""so called experts"" I cringed a little."
Dinotrux,"Thank goodness. The utter crap that is being passed off as ""archaeology"" lately [I'm talking directly to YOU, so-called ""History"" Channel] should be on the Psychic Friends Network, rather than presented as any sort of serious discussion of fact. 

Between the ""Ancient Astronauts,"" secret government experiments with our alien friends and of course sage advice from our dead relatives in the ghostly world, American televised history and science programs are better suited for Saturday morning kids' programming."
Dinotrux,"I watched it with an opened mind, and actually still am opened minded"
Dinotrux,I get why people criticize Hancock. What I don't get is why academics are so offended by the idea that humans created civilization a bit sooner than thought. I don't think anyone serious is suggesting it's like Stargate Atlantis. humans 12-14k years ago were plenty smart and capable.
Dinotrux,Wtf is a mainstream archaeologist? LOL
Dinotrux,"I watched the first episode, I didn't see the guy claiming aliens or super duper tech dynasties, I saw a guy saying they need to get their shit together and stop gatekeeping.

does it get crazy or something later?"
Dinotrux,Netflix: “no”
Dinotrux,Hancock is to to Archeology as Giorgio A. Tsoukalos is to Astrophysics and Astronomy.
Dinotrux,"He brags about not being a scientist and instead being a reporter. What is he reporting? It was an entertaining series and there is obviously more to uncover, but he didn't seem very credible to me. My dude is super butthurt against ""archaeologists"" for calling him out on his failure to even grasp the scientific method."
Dinotrux,"The further you dig down, the older the material gets. Who'd have thought?!"
Dinotrux,"I don't understand why Hancock has to speculate on a connection between his sites. The sites themselves, very interesting, clearly a lot to work on. And there are clearly some assumptions which should be rethought. But most of the sites could be explained by local innovations, local genius Da Vincis. There doesn't need to be a global civilization."
Dinotrux,"I felt like I was watching propaganda. He had such a hate-on for archaeologists, it was a bit ridiculous."
Dinotrux,Ancient Astronaut Theorists were unavailable for comment.
Dinotrux,"What I fail to understand is what Hancock thinks ""big archaeology"" is trying to suppress, and why?

Surely if anyone found an ancient super civilisation they'd become one of the most famous archaeologists in the world and it'd make them rich beyond their wildest dreams, let alone the incredible insight into human development.

It boggles the mind."
Dinotrux,">“Why is there no evidence for this Ice Age civilization when we have plentiful evidence for hunter-gatherers all over the world at this time?” Dibble asked. “The truth is in the trash.” Every living being leaves something behind, but no refuse at all has turned up from Atlantis. “You’re going to clean up all your trash and vaporize it?”

&#x200B;

I'm not trying to equate Hancock to a particle physicist.. but you have to admit, they're probably the last people you think of when talking about the Pyramids.

&#x200B;

found something we didn't know about.

**Particle physicists discover mysterious structure in Great Pyramid – here’s how they did it**

https://theconversation.com/particle-physicists-discover-mysterious-structure-in-great-pyramid-heres-how-they-did-it-86783

The technology works by tracking particles called muons. They are very similar to electrons – having the same charge and a quantum property called spin – but are 207 times heavier. This difference in mass is quite important as it turns out it determines how these particles interact when hitting matter.

&#x200B;

what will we find when ""LiDAR"" can see 500 feet underground/underwater?

""archaeologists thought they were done"" now they need a bunch of new ones - because someone brought a done.

&#x200B;

**Archaeologists Have Discovered 500 Previously Unknown Mesoamerican Sites in Mexico Hidden in** ***Plain Sight*** **Using Laser Technology**  
**LiDAR continues to yield fresh archaeological discoveries.**

[https://news.artnet.com/art-world/lidar-technology-identifies-500-mesoamerican-sites-2026460](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/lidar-technology-identifies-500-mesoamerican-sites-2026460)

Using laser pulses tied to a GPS system, LiDAR took topographical readings to create a three-dimensional map of a 30,000-square-mile area around eastern Tabasco. When archaeologists analyzed the data, they found evidence of 478 sites that would have been part of precolonial settlements between about 1400 B.C. and 1000 A.D., reports Gizmodo.  


And, across the world, a long-running LiDAR research project in Cambodia recently helped determine that the ancient city of Angkor Wat, the world’s largest religious monument, once supported a population of up to 900,000 people.  


archaeologists were ""wrong"" and they didn't have to dig too far to figure this one out.

&#x200B;

**Ancient Footprints Suggest Humans Lived In The Americas Earlier Than Once Thought**

[https://www.npr.org/2021/09/24/1040381802/ancient-footprints-new-mexico-white-sands-humans](https://www.npr.org/2021/09/24/1040381802/ancient-footprints-new-mexico-white-sands-humans)

They concluded that the footprints were made between 21,000 and 23,000 years ago. The date would place human habitation in the Americas during the Last Glacial Maximum and at least 5,000 years earlier than widely accepted evidence has yet suggested.  


I don't think we're at the limit of ""high tech archaeology""

&#x200B;

I'm not saying ET gave us printouts for the pyramids..  but I suspect archaeologists will have to rethink a lot of things in the future."
Dinotrux,It’s really weird how salty people are about this series.
Dinotrux,"I watch the whole thing…..all it is about a the great flood. That’s it, but he doesn’t go into it tho. It’s really boring. I’ve seen really good films and shows on the great flood done really well….But 80% of the time it him stroking his own ego. most of the time he is speaking about how no one but him is taking anything of this seriously. With snippets of myths that he gets completely wrong."
Dinotrux,"If you are getting your information from Netflix series you are an idiot. 

Shit like this especially on Netflix should be treated as entertainment and nothing else"
Dinotrux,I read the description on Netflix and instantly knew it was bs
Dinotrux,"I haven’t watched this, but would it make for good ideas for a D&D or Shadowrun campaign? It sounds like it would."
Dinotrux,"Netflix should commission an archaeologist to make a show which counters Hancock's view. The problem with these types of documentaries is that experts are never given the opportunity to debunk them so we only ever get one side of the narrative. Topics like Ancient Egypt are a nightmare for people like myself, who know little about the topic,  as it's so hard to distinguish conspiracy from the accepted historical view."
Dinotrux,"I knew nothing about the guy and the history and archaeology when I watched this show. I just saw it's been promoted on my Netflix so I gave it a shot. Within 15 minutes I felt something was off. It triggered my bullshit meter like mad. I think it's the way they set up the premise, the way the guy talked about it and the overemphasis on the consensus being wrong while dangling the ""evidence"" always slightly out of view. So I just googled the guy and found all his crackpot theories.

It's always like this. Instead of ""hey guys we found out this cool thing"" it's more ""those others guys were WRONG!""."
Dinotrux,"Was this that show that had like snippets of Joe Rogan and some random dude that wasn't even an Archaeologist and all he kept saying was ""Archaeologists hate me""? If so I stopped after the first episode because it was so bad."
Dinotrux,"Ok, Just use ""fiction"" to describe ""the woman king"" too."
Dinotrux,"is it another ""indigenous folks had to have alien contact, no way they made all this the usual way"" shit ala history channel?"
Dinotrux,"Oh yeah.

Remember the sacred cow of Clovis first?"
Dinotrux,I think if people watch a show called unfounded and still believe it throwing a fiction tag on it won't work.
Dinotrux,"I was excited when this popped into my feed.  ""Sweet Netflix is promoting a docuseries on ancient civilizations.  I bet with their production budgets this is going to be great.""  Then the preview starts and it's that quack Hancock ranting about ""mainstream"" archeology.  I wouldnt hate this shit so  much if there were more actual history and archeology docs out there, but it seems like the ancient aliens, Graham Hancock stuff is way more prevalent."
Dinotrux,"Every single time this guy refers to actual archeologists, he says ""so called experts"".   Dude is not an archeologist.  He is a journalist who like archeology and is selling a story he made up by filling in gaps in what we know with ""what if?!""."
Dinotrux,"The pseudo-scientists have opinions which, to the ill-informed, seem like rational explanations. Sadly, many people are ill-informed these days."
Dinotrux,"It’s obvious drivel. Like hilariously obvious that it’s complete pseudoscience and bullshit. But fun bullshit! 

Are people treating this as real facts?"
Dinotrux,Cabinet of Curiosities has more scientific merit
Dinotrux,What’s wrong with asking questions about our current knowledge and beliefs?? 200 years ago germ theory was seen as a mad man’s beliefs. The world should always be asking questions and challenging current beliefs otherwise how do we progress forward? Instead of saying his shows dangerous and misinformation bring the facts out to show him wrong. Educate us. Being told this is the fact and nothing can change it with out explaining why is not knowledge it’s just obedience. It’s fun to learn and see all the different theories and rebuttals.
Dinotrux,"Guy who touts Atlantis as real, tells everyone that professional archaeologists are incompetent and dishonest. Now there's a little bit of push back from the professionals he's been defaming for decades and of course it's all part of the conspiracy to silence him. 

But fear not; no doubt he'll be able to use it in his next internationally published book (or tv series), and the internet will praise him for how brave he is, while continuing to swallow his speculations uncritically."
Dinotrux,"Joe Rogan shows up on the screen: first red flag.

Challenging views are not presented, just general accusations of ""they don't want to investigate"": second red flag.

Straight up lying about Quetzalcoatl's story to make it fit with his theory: bye."
Dinotrux,But Joe Rogan thinks he’s a genius. /s
Dinotrux,Sounds to me like those docuseries are just historical fictions.
Dinotrux,"Objectively, the doc is boring and lacks personality. Hancock is great radio but terrible tv. The first episode was cool how they used GPR and showed some science, but by the end of ep 2 I found my brain screaming “Alright already, we get it!” Just didn’t feel coherent quickly enough to pull me in. 

Don’t think I’ll finish it, but it’s intriguing to consider his ideas."
Dinotrux,"Lol, it reminds me of the fake Discovery Channel documentaries about mermaids and megalodon that people believed were real. 😂"
Dinotrux,"The hypocrisy of people praising a show like Farha on Netflix, calling it well rounded media for offering an alternate perspective and then bashing this show for showing an alternate perspective is everything wrong with people today."
Dinotrux,"Watched this series a while ago. While there was a lot of conjecture, there were enough sites of interest that had apparently been written off by academia that merit further investigation, like the other detected sites beneath the hill at Gobekli Tepe and the Indonesian pyramid chambers.

I know it's probably just a question of available funding and where it can practically be allocated, but academia seems to be resistant to allocating funding where there's a perceived high likelihood of nothing coming as a result, not even limited to Archaeology as a field. There's enough compelling information at these other sites to merit at least an excavation crew, or maybe some more powerful survey equipment."
Dinotrux,Graham Hancock is such a hack but he talks with confidence like he knows what he's talking about and makes a lot of vague references to actual events to smoke screen his shitty theories. I hate when Rogan has him on his show because so many people believe his unfounded bullshit.
Dinotrux,"Unfortunately, it hardly matters.

Edit, all I meant is a fiction tag on this shit won't matter to the people who think they are watching a documentary. They are still going to regurgitate this nonsense as fact to whoever will listen and the masses get dumbed down just  a little bit more."
Dinotrux,"Why is everyone in the scientific community so rabid about this series? Instead of trying to get it off the air they could release something in a similar format explaining why he was incorrect.

Healthy debate *should* be the backbone of modern science."
Dinotrux,There's no evidence of god or Jesus either
Dinotrux,"Since making a murderer, I consider all of Netflix's documentaries as fiction."
Dinotrux,"I don't recall ppl losing their minds when Leonard Nimoy did the series ""In Search Of...""."
Dinotrux,"TBH that series is a waste of time, making claims and not providing actual proof. 
I’m still open to all possibilities if substantially sourced but the way that he presents it with those cold dead eyes, nah."
Dinotrux,Dude is just asking questions. Not sure why they want to shut him down.
Dinotrux,Archeology shows have been mostly bullshit for years now. Why is this one getting all the heat but shit like ancient aliens been on history channel for decades?
Dinotrux,"The problem with people like Graham Hancock is their kind of racist lunatics. They can't believe that none white people could create anything before white people did. So it was either aliens, or some lost precursor civilization. Yes I am lumping Graham Hancock in with the ancient alien types. Their ideas are basically the same."
Dinotrux,Fucking pussies
Dinotrux,"This is laughably idealistic but I am here for all the reaction and overreaction from real archeologists. The documentary literally calls them liars but this isn’t new. These ancient alien or Atlantis nut jobs like Eric von Daniken has been spewing hate on real archeologists since 80s and they have maintain dignified silence for too long.  But in 2022 where narratives are largely driven by social media clicks rather than reputed people with academic backgrounds, they need to call out this beautifully photographed shit show with ginormous production value and disinformation.

If Netflix can add fiction disclaimer on their most popular show (The crown) that often boasts of being thoroughly researched then they can mostly certainly do it for this one. Alas, these archeologists don’t have the same pull as Judi dench the Oscar winning monarchist."
Dinotrux,"All these people are doing is playing directly into his hand when he says again and again that the official archaeology establishment wants to take down these ideas. As for Graham and with most of life, you have to look at things with an open mind and consider possibilities you may not have before. If there’s something wrong with that then there’s something wrong with science itself, and everyone needs to remember the point of our inquiry.  Is Graham wrong about some stuff? Absolutely.  Is accepted science wrong about some stuff. Absolutely.  The best and most supported ideas will ultimately prevail.  Period.  I understand that the Internet speeds up the dissemination of wrong ideas, but there is a lean towards censoring naysayers lately which is unscientific to its core.  If you think the man‘s theories are wrong, then make a better show explaining your position.  Working title “We’ve Discovered Everything Already, How Dare You Sir.”"
Dinotrux,"This reminds me of that awful joke, ""Next time you go to a bookstore, ask why the Bible isn't in the fiction section."" Fiction is a genre, not a catch-all for anything that's not accurate."
Dinotrux,I find it very interesting that this was posted by a bot account that advertises content from other streaming services. This and the recent Amazon Prime claim that it dethroned netflix is making me laugh at these attempts to skew views and subs.
Dinotrux,"Someone should tell these scientists about the Streisand effect, and that they actually should’ve just ignore this show instead of bringing attention to it and making the conspiracy theorists say “see, they’re trying to censor this so IT MUST BE TRUE!”"
Dinotrux,Archaeologists are making this docuseries famous by giving it so much press lol. Ignore it and no one will care or remember it
Dinotrux,It's kind of becoming a repetitive pattern of people associated with the Joe rogan Podcast doing a lot of pseudo whatever thing
Dinotrux,"Netflix with yet another flimsy tv show dressed up as a documentary?

Who'd have thought.

Honestly, their documentary options are a disgrace. I prefer to call them dramamentaries."
Dinotrux,"I just finished watching it. He bases a lot of his theories on ancient myths. The only interesting thing he really mentions, is that a lot of the ancient civilizations had a bearded savior coming to bring improvements to their civilization. He is making the assumption that’s it’s either the same person/being, or at the very least from the same civilization. That’s where it’s stops being interesting, and goes into more sci-fi. At least in the show he speaks why the other archeologists shoot down his theories, because his theory is based on Atlantis."
Dinotrux,mainstream academia is on the verge!
Dinotrux,Ancient apocalypse opens with a scene from Joe rogan. That’s all the label I needed.
Dinotrux,[deleted]
Dinotrux,I watched a few episodes but this show is work of pure fantasy.  Was cringe if you’re not a conspiracy nut.
Dinotrux,just another reason why netflix is now just the new history channel. they used to have some credibility in the documentary dept. now netflix is hot garbage.
Dinotrux,"As they should.

This isn't some goofy website that you can tell peddles lies, it's a known entertainment company putting a show out that confuses idiots into thinking it's real and scientific, like the morons I argued with on a conspiracy site years ago who said ""mermaids are real, it was on every front page in England when they caught footage of them!"".

Except, no it wasn't because that was part of a made-up show about fictional creatures on The Discovery Channel."
Dinotrux,These people are so dumb. Why are so many scientists anti-science?
Dinotrux,The early appearance of Joe Rogan was enough for me to peace out.
Dinotrux,So many butthurt archaeologists in this thread
Dinotrux,Why are they so upset about humanity possibly being more advanced in the ice age? Whats the big deal bitches?
Dinotrux,[deleted]
Dinotrux,"I don't understand all the fuss with this guy. He just lives in the realm of speculation. I think someone like Von Daniken was much worse. I watched the show and he never claims that he's doing science. On the other hand his whole butthurt stance against academia is quite annoying: dude, present your work and stop it with the witch hunt syndrome. If your work has any value it will stand the test of time.

So the way I see it, they are just doing him a favor.

It was an interesting watch if you take it as what it is, speculation. As I said, the thing that bothered me the most was that attitude of ""I'm right and everyone's against me"". That and Joe Rogan. Like, wtf."
Dinotrux,"I love how mad ""scientists"" get when someone questions their conclusions. We're talking about rocks, and ancient civilizations, yet one guy offering a different hypothesis of our history is being treated like he murdered these people's parents."
Dinotrux,So many Netflix docs are of dubious accuracy.  It's really quite shocking.
Dinotrux,I watched it thinking it was a mockumentary/found footage movie wondering what the pay-off would be. Towards the end I realized that this was a legit documentary and I had been fooled.
Dinotrux,Anyone else think this was a snooze fest?
Dinotrux,"Sean Hancock, director of unscripted originals at Netflix (also just happens to be Graham Hancock’s son)

“No.”"
Dinotrux,"I’m surprised by the hate for this series. I watched it and don’t recall being told that Graham’s interpretation was right and everyone else’s was wrong. What I heard was Graham suggesting that maybe things happened differently than what our current timeline suggests. In a field like archaeology very little is spelled out. Most sites don’t contain writing. So it is all open to interpretation based on the physical evidence.

I am not saying I agree with Hancock. But I am not opposed to someone questioning our current interpretation. 

Basically he talks smack about archaeologists and historians. Suggesting they are stuck in their ways and ignoring sites that don’t fit the narrative. This is what I think is their problem with the piece.

Archaeology and History are not Hard Science. The results of one’s work are not conclusive, not testable in the same way as other fields. You can bring in another archaeologist to see if they agree with the interpretation, but it is still just an interpretation. I love archaeology and history and am not knocking it. But to me Ancient Apocalypse is just another interpretation, and not something to be afraid of."
Dinotrux,Graham Hancock's child is a programming director at Netflix by the way.
Dinotrux,"Uh, technically it's not fiction. It's false, but it's presented as true by a true believer. The same is true of myths and religious texts--they're not classified as fiction in the library. 

Perhaps a disclaimer would be good. ""This program contains speculative claims that are not supported by current archeology. Netflix makes no claims of the veracity of the contents of this program."""
Dinotrux,"I got like five minutes into this as something in the background and my bullshit meter almost shattered. Like, it's a little fun, but the talk track about intellectual suppression by Big Dig is nauseating."
Dinotrux,"This kind of shit content just feels so disrespectful to real scientists. I get that it’s fun or whatever, but grow up. I guarantee you that people have staked their careers in the past on actually proving this kind of shit in a rigorous way, and they have failed. You can’t just speculate shit and insult real rigor and pretend it’s scientific because “the experts don’t want you to know.” I assure you, the experts would want you to know! They wouldn’t shut up about it if there was a 10% chance any of this bullshit were true!"
Dinotrux,"I just watched the 3rd or 4th episode where he says something about how he’s a “pseudo scientist” just as a dolphin is a “pseudo fish”. Uhhm what? A dolphin is not a fish, it is a mammal."
Dinotrux,"I started reading his books over 20 years ago. He seemed to have legit arguments. And little by little evidence FROM MAINSTREAM archeology has proven him right. I’m not saying he is %100 right. He even called all this backlash. I’m not easily swayed either. However, this series was done completely wrong (so far. I’m only on the sixth episode) in so many ways. His theories actually make sense."
Dinotrux,I watched the show and even though I don’t agree with a lot he does make some interesting points.  Which I believe should be researched more and should not be considered fiction until proven otherwise.  I mean people use to think it was a fact the world was flat.  Fortunately others didn’t believe that and continued asking the right questions.
Dinotrux,I am actively trying to hear out archeologists defence against Graham Hancock's work. Can someone help?
Dinotrux,Has there always been so many crazy conspiracy theorists? I swear I don’t remember this many crazies 10 years ago
Dinotrux,Of course they want to. They don't want any of this information to be remotely possible because we would have to rewrite history. I think alot of what is pointed out and identified atleast needs investigation.
Larva,"I meant 2018, not 2008"
Larva,Why was this show so forgettable? I didn’t hate it just an Honest question
Larva,Dude you had me fucked up for a second lol
Larva,i swear i was looking at 2008 for a good minute thinking it's beeen THAT long???
Larva,Was going to say I thought I was on top of shit when I saw it
Larva,Man for a second there I was like how did I lose a decade of my life?
Larva,"It was the opposite of forgettable for me, so I can't answer that question."

Monty Pythons Fliegender Zirkus,"Literally the first Monty Python sketch I ever saw. Just the absurdity of it all caught my interest and I've been a fan ever since.

One thing I've always loved about their sketches were their segways. To start off in a Barber Shop to the ""end"" with a psuedo 4th wall breaking bit about the sketch was just masterful."

Monty Pythons Fliegender Zirkus,Should it seem unusual and taboo for a man to crossdress and look for sexual action in bars? Discuss.

Monty Pythons Fliegender Zirkus,[segues]
Monty Pythons Fliegender Zirkus,Me too! I think I used to run around in the 4th grade signing this song in the house. Probably the day my Dad stopped liking me

Monty Pythons Fliegender Zirkus,"That's a bad example. If there wasn't a laugh track, they wouldn't insert pauses for the laugh track."
Monty Pythons Fliegender Zirkus,I actually kind of like it better this way.
Monty Pythons Fliegender Zirkus,"I'm pretty sure that if you had the same actors with the same or a similar script not pausing for the laugh track, the scene might still work."
Monty Pythons Fliegender Zirkus,"The difference being that back in the day of Monty Python, the shows didn't *need* the hooting of a studio audience to let the home audience know that something was supposed to be funny."
Monty Pythons Fliegender Zirkus,"""I wish I'd been a girly, just like my dear papa!""

As a trans woman who's father killed himself out of the pain of being a trans woman in denial, it kind of hits a bit close to home.  Crossdressers don't wish they were girls, unless they are in fact girls.

The song isn't inherently hateful, but the fact its supposed to be a comedy when its about a deadly serious issue is something I take offense to.  Like, oh here's someone grappling with who they are and in denial about it, haha how embarrassing.  The humor comes entirely from the mocking of who the singer is."
Monty Pythons Fliegender Zirkus,"Nah, I have ears and a brain. Monty Python is nothing but yelling random shit and people thinking it’s brilliant because it’s in a British accent."

Monty Pythons Fliegender Zirkus,"That wasn't the point of doing it back in the day. Most of these people were improve comedians and stage actors that are used to working with an audience to get a feel for the timing and feed off that energy. The youtube generation is used to working without an audience, so it seems weird to have to need one."
Monty Pythons Fliegender Zirkus,What sketch comedy do you enjoy?
Monty Pythons Fliegender Zirkus,"What did you think of it in 1970 when it was, you know, new?"

Monty Pythons Fliegender Zirkus,The funny kind.
Monty Pythons Fliegender Zirkus,"As also a bonafide trans person, the song itself isn't inherently bad, it's the ridicule that's thrown towards the lumberjack by the real-world audience."
Monty Pythons Fliegender Zirkus,What a thought provoking response. Really adds to the conversation.
Monty Pythons Fliegender Zirkus,More thought provoking than shitty Monty Python humor.
Monty Pythons Fliegender Zirkus,"Hey, /u/kevonicus... Why don't you sit on my face, and tell me that you love me."

Monty Pythons Fliegender Zirkus,"More thought provoking than jokes about Proust, Schopenhauer?"
Monty Pythons Fliegender Zirkus,Is that a Monty Python quote? Someone always tries to use a quote and it just ends up proving how unfunny Monty Python is. Lol
Monty Pythons Fliegender Zirkus,"Oh shut up, you silly bitch. It's just a bit of fun."
Monty Pythons Fliegender Zirkus,Sounds like a shitty Monty Python attempt at comedy.

Those Who Kill,">I'm the one you never see, in the dead of night,
Peeking in your window, staying out of sight,
GO to bed, lock the door, don't look in the mirror,
What if I was right behind you,

>I'm the knocking at your door, when you're all alone,
I'm the scratching zombie claw, in your twilight zone,
Cut your throat, catch your breath, blood run like a river,
Last thing you see before your death,
Smiling like a killer.

This show looks so cool. "
Those Who Kill,This seems to basically be hannibal without hannibal himself.. don't have any good expectations for this
Those Who Kill,"Yep, to me this is just yet another cop/detective show."
Those Who Kill,"Damn, I was just waiting for the third episode before giving the show a chance."
Those Who Kill,"This show smacks of terrible decision making.


People like procedural TV so lets make procedural TV, oh but that long form TV show with over-reaching arcs is hot right now too, so lets dedicate the last 5 mins of each episode to the plot arc.

Worst of both worlds."

Those Who Kill,I watched the first episode online. I had never heard of it til I ran across it on a website. It was pretty good...atleast I thought...maybe it was because I was at work and was bored and needed to kill time. Ill know more when I watch the 2nd (& last episode) 
Those Who Kill,"All 10 episodes of *Those Who Kill* will be broadcast on the Lifetime Movie Network starting today, 3/30."

Basically the writers have lots of great ideas for upcoming seasons and great ideas don't grow on trees so they want to re-use those ideas in other  shows in the future. By revealing the planned story those ideas becomes unusable in other projects. They would be giving them away for nothing."
Those Who Kill,My name is Earl just ended on a goddamn cliffhanger. I will never know who Earl Jr's dad is and that pisses me off!
Those Who Kill,"If they know. But a lot of shows would be like ""Well if we had 3 more months in the writer's room I could tell you."""
Those Who Kill,Pushin Daisies
Those Who Kill,Definitely. After Netflix canceled The Midnight Club Mike Flanagan made a detailed post about how season 2 would have played out. More showrunners should do that.
Those Who Kill,Never give good ideas away for free
Those Who Kill,"All the writers: ""Then a giant meteor hit and everyone died."""
Those Who Kill,They kinda did that for Last Man on Earth
Those Who Kill,"Archive 81 was based on a podcast, and while Netflix made some significant story changes, there are two additional seasons to the podcast if you want to explore further.

That being said: seasons 2 and 3 get pretty weird."
Those Who Kill,Santa Clarita diet. ended a season on a massive cliffhanger and it didn't get renewed
Those Who Kill,"Back in the days, some network TV writers used to do that once their shows get cancelled by the networks. Sometime they gave quick outline of the aborted season, other time they go into more details.

Those Who Kill,the society writers need to do this purely so I can know who that girls baby daddy is
Those Who Kill,"trying to make that bread, can't be giving away recipes"
Those Who Kill,Mike Flanagan did this for Midnight Club. It was great. Answered all my questions and then some. He truly is a showrunner for the people.
Those Who Kill,Maybe they should write stories that don't take multiple seasons to tell. Have no problem with short series as long as they are resolved.
Those Who Kill,Not a great idea imo. First seasons of shows can be quite experimental and the writers might not know how the show is going to end. I think HIMYM was one of the rare ones where the writers had an idea of how they wanted to end the story and altered it as the seasons progressed but kept their ultimate ending intact (which backfired as a result).
Those Who Kill,"The network wants the show to be on air for as long as possible, therefore sometimes not even the writer can know how the show will end, Especially when it comes to shows where one ""mystery"" is stacked on top of another with every season."
Those Who Kill,"That only works for shows where there was a planned outline of a plot to begin with.  A lot of times there's a lot of smoke and mirrors where they act *as if* it's just the audience that's in the dark about the answer to big questions being raised early in the story.  Often, in reality the writers have no clue yet either and will make up an answer in a later episode when the need arises.  I call it the ""Lost problem"", as in what made Lost a terrible show that I bailed on pretty early.  Why I don't like it is that the audience is tricked into thinking that intelligent piecing together of clues will make the story fit and it's ""their fault"" if they get surprised by not seeing ""how it all fits together"".  The truth is it never did all fit together.  The explanation for the clues was invented after the ""clues"" were dropped."
Those Who Kill,Spoiler alert: television is made up as they go.  They are laying down the tracks right in front of the train.
Those Who Kill,"Theyd have to know for sure, their original plan may no longer work after making the show for a little, and they would need to not want to incorporate those plans into future works."
Those Who Kill,This was done for The Lost World. The script was made available online.
Those Who Kill,"Some of them do that.

My favorite example that did release their next season plans was The Unit."
Those Who Kill,">I loved the Netflix shows Archive 81

Couldn't you just listen to the podcast in this instance?"
Those Who Kill,"Depending on the original deal/contract, the writers may not actually own the IP, so may not legally be allowed to."
Those Who Kill,"The show runner of Carnivale put out a blog or something outlining the seasons that never got made. 

A real shame it got canceled."
Those Who Kill,"That’s certainly one reason

I’m sure there’s also legal stuff and contracts involved that may prevent it"
Those Who Kill,">great ideas don't grow on trees so they want to re-use those ideas in other shows in the future.

Anyone that's run a tabletop RPG knows this. You don't meet up after the end of a campaign to spill the beans on 'what ifs', you store those away to use later."
Those Who Kill,That actually makes perfect sense. They could use the same premise but swap out characters or retrofit it for something else
Those Who Kill,"Same goes for video games.

Zelda Wind Waker had a bunch of stuff that either got cut or couldn’t make the game due to time constraints so they just recycled the ideas in later games"
Those Who Kill,"Greg Garcia did an AMA and shared the show ending:

> We never really got the chance to fully figure it out but the talk in the writers room was that Earl Jr’s Dad was going to be someone famous. Like Dave Chappelle or Lil John. Someone that came to town on tour and Joy slept with. But when we got canceled we never got the chance to figure it out. I was worried about doing a cliffhanger but I asked NBC if it was safe to do one at the end of the season and they told me it was. I guess it wasn’t.
> 
> I had always had an ending to Earl and I’m sorry I didn’t get the chance to see it happen. You’ve got a show about a guy with a list so not seeing him finish it is a bummer. But the truth is, he wasn’t ever going to finish the list. The basic idea of the ending was that while he was stuck on a really hard list item he was going to start to get frustrated that he was never going to finish it. Then he runs into someone who had a list of their own and Earl was on it. They needed to make up for something bad they had done to Earl. He asks them where they got the idea of making a list and they tell him that someone came to them with a list and that person got the idea from someone else. Earl eventually realizes that his list started a chain reaction of people with list and that he’s finally put more good into the world than bad. So at that point he was going to tear up his list and go live his life. Walk into the sunset a free man. With good karma.


Also for anyone that likes My Name is Earl, check out Sprung. It's available to watch for free on Freevee. It's also made by Greg Garcia and has a similar vibe to Earl."
Those Who Kill,"Heres a snippet from the creator.

""Garcia later revealed the planned ending for the series would have found Earl stuck and frustrated with a difficult item on his list - only to encounter someone he'd made amends with previously. They were inspired to make their own list after meeting Earl, who realizes he has done some good in the world. Earl then tears up his list, content that his karma has been restored."""
Those Who Kill,My younger brother binged that entire series on Disney+ and has asked me when the next season is coming out. The same with *Final Space* on Netflix. I haven’t the heart to tell him.
Those Who Kill,"Agreed. It’s also kind of like “Coach who was fired in week 4 tells all about how the season was supposed to end in a Super Bowl victory.” Even writers of cancelled shows must know that their plot ideas, even the ones 100% fleshed-out, can’t all come to pass for any number of reasons they can’t necessarily control."
Those Who Kill,"And they've teased us for 14 years now with ""oh we're making a comic to continue it"" or ""oh we're making a stage play/musical to continue it"" and it never happens."
Those Who Kill,"Damn, this thread has now taught me The Midnight Club and Archive 81 were both canceled. 

.........I should leave this thread. Lol."
Those Who Kill,"> The Midnight ~~Club~~ **Mass**

Fixed :)

But now I think that someone should write a version of The Breakfast Club with vampires. ;)

Edit: oh well, from the comment below *there is* a show called Midnight Club from the same author of Midnight Mass. He really likes midnights, huh?"
Those Who Kill,Not the ending I expected for Friends
Those Who Kill,"MAN WHAT , DO TELL OR SEND LINK"
Those Who Kill,Momma?  <End of Series>  Fuck you Netflix.
Those Who Kill,This is the one that hurts me the most but also I blame the creators more than Netflix. They ended every season on a cliffhanger this was bound to happen.
Those Who Kill,"Oof, disappointing to hear. That's been on my ""may be worth checking out"" list for a while, but pretty much entirely due to Olyphant. Both the premise and Berrymore have kept me from starting. It ending on cliffhanger may be enough for me to finally abandon it."
Those Who Kill,could you link that??
Those Who Kill,"I think writers frequently don't know what the ending is.  they may have a general idea, but not a fleshed out story."
Those Who Kill,"> I’m sure there’s also legal stuff and contracts involved that may prevent it

Quite. Usually the production company/studio/whatever will retain the rights to the setting and story. Meaning even if the creator wanted to continue telling the story through, say, a novel or other format, they couldn't legally do so without the permission of the production company, even though it was their story to begin with."
Those Who Kill,Thank you for this! This give me some closure the Earl would have ended up happy with life and who he had become.
Those Who Kill,"Also Raising Hope by Greg Garcia, another amazing show.

They even have a mini My Name is Earl reunion in it."
Those Who Kill,Thank you for this! This give me some closure the Earl would have ended up happy with life and who he had become.
Those Who Kill,Final Space was a tough one because they've literally wiped it from everything. It did peak in season 1.
Those Who Kill,"If they end up making a broadway musical I will go into the city and see it, doesn't matter the cost"
Those Who Kill,"Actually Midnight Mass, and Midnight Club, are two different shows. Mass was always a single season, Club was meant to have a season 2"
Those Who Kill,"No, it was *The Midnight Club* — Flanagan had two different Netflix series with ‘Midnight’ in the title — *Midnight Mass*, a vampire miniseries (never meant to have a second season) based on [the fictional book the main character of his film *Hush* was writing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cDBiqNIJVw) — and *The Midnight Club*, a series adapting the novels of Christopher Pike (the author, not the *Star Trek* character)."
Those Who Kill,Thought it was a mash up of Midnight Diner & Fight Club
Those Who Kill,"Young justice said he has no plans for an ending, just writing as he gets seasons.
If it isn't renewed,  it will eventually end on a cliffhsnger."
Those Who Kill,"it's very funny and the gore/practical effects are really fun! but there's a lot of Berrymore flavor to it, if you don't like her vibe you'll probably not enjoy the show. Olyphant is a delightful kind but often intimidated husband in the show, I've heard that he is more known for his roles where he's an action man, take charge kinda thing, in SCD he's much more your average guy grasping to adapt to this wild situation he has very little control over. imo it was a great show, making the ending even more upsetting"
Those Who Kill,"https://collider.com/midnight-club-season-2-plot-mike-flanagan-comments/

Here you go!"
Those Who Kill,"Seems to vary among different TV shows, tbh. 

It does seem like a recognition of Lost's issues has led more showrunners to plot out their entire story in advance, at least for those kinds of shows with a lot of mystery elements involved in them."
Those Who Kill,"Haha, I knew only about Mass!"
Those Who Kill,"Like most, I love Olyphant from Justified and Deadwood. Less action man and more world-weary stoic for the most part, but I get what you're saying. It seemed like Barrymore was the focus, good to know that's the case.

Appreciate the info!"
Those Who Kill,"It was fascinating hearing Vince Gilligan talk about Breaking Bad.  It was such a thoughtful cohesive story, but they added and removed tons of stuff (from their original plan) and really built it as they went."
Those Who Kill,"It's hard and may be a fool's errand to have more than a general idea of where the show is going. Babylon 5 famously had a 5 season plan from the start, and while the result was a great show, the saying ""man plans, God laughs"" comes to mind. They had to make *big* changes along the way because:

* A starring alien character played by a female actor was meant to appear as male and be referred to as male for *seasons* and then undergo a gender transformation. But they were unable to settle on makeup and voice altering that would make her performance convincingly male, so they abandoned that idea after entering production. 
* Spoilers for the first two seasons: >!The actor who played the main character suffered from a debilitating mental illness, so they had to create a new main character to begin season 2.!<
* A major side character's actor wanted to leave, so they had to abruptly write her off (it was *really* abrupt) and give the arc planned for her character to another character.
* They were told season four would be their last, so they rushed to get the planned story of both season four and five out in one season's worth of episodes. 
* Then at the last minute, they got a season 5 renewal, so they held off the final episode and pulled some season 5 stories out of their butts and then put the final episode they'd filmed for season 4 at the end of season 5."
Those Who Kill,"Tbh I'd be surprised if things didn't change and evolve naturally over time, even for a show that was planned out entirely from the very beginning. 

What doesn't seem to work well is throwing out mystery boxes without having any kind of plan for what the eventual reveal is supposed to be. 

Tbh, this seems to be more of a concern for shows that heavily feature a central mystery (often of a sci-fi or paranormal nature). Currently running examples I can think of would include Yellowjackets, From, and Servant. That kind of show really needs to keep a handle on its loose threads, mysterious elements, and eventual reveals, or things can fall apart."
Those Who Kill,"Breaking Bad didn’t have a plot outline so much as a plot direction, which is why I think it did so well. They could be as flexible as they needed to be with where the show went and it still felt like it was all part of the same story because they were continuously pushing Walt’s character in the direction that provided the main thrust of the series."
Those Who Kill,"I'll preface by saying I like the show but I don't love it.

What seems to have been the hardest thing for this show is the balance between the main story of Joel/Ellie with the stories of other characters.

Sometimes they've made choices like in the Bill and Ted episode that I think worked really well for the story of that episode and sometimes they've made the choice to be more vague and it's worked for those episodes.

Where I am left though at this point is though is that I don't fully care about the Joel and Ellie story or characters because so much of the show has been spent servicing other characters that then are gone the next episode. It almost feels like a story about who these two meet along there way but that isn't fully satisfying either since you don't really get into those other characters. I'm sure that in the game this all works because you literally are Joel and you are spending hours as him, but it hasn't worked in the show to me.

So where I'm left is liking a lot of the show; the acting, the directing, the production of it all, but not fully invested in the story or the characters."
Those Who Kill,"I think the structure was a bit flawed. I know....how heavily praised episode 3 was, but for me, it was a bad narrative choice to have the 3rd episode of a new show focus on 2 characters that end up dead by the end of the episode.

Also, just not a fan of how certain storylines were introduced and set up. We're kinda just thrown into situations with characters we've never seen before, who are hunting for characters we've never even met. I get Sam and Henry are from the game and fans of the game will get who they are....But it was just weird narratively to meet Kathleen's group, who we don't know, who are then searching for characters we also don't know.

I know people will accuse this as being filler or taking away from Joel and Ellie, but we got nearly a whole episode dedicated to two characters that died...I think there was maybe a way of more organically planting Kathleen's group and the Sam/Henry stuff into the show, that doesn't feel like it just comes out of nowhere."
Those Who Kill,"Ellie annoys me. Also, since OP asked I'm just going to say it. Needs more action."
Those Who Kill,"I'm not into zombies or post-apocalypse stuff at all, so I just watch and think about things I'm into instead. Has worked out pretty well for me."
Those Who Kill,"I like the show.  I liked the games more.  My problem is there's not enough Joel and Ellie.  And maybe their chemistry isn't at the level the game's actors achieved.  It's hard to say because there's not as much time with just the two of them in the show as in the game.  My favorite parts of the game was just spending time with the two of them and their chemistry and it hasn't delivered on those fronts, 67% of the way through the season."
Those Who Kill,I would be enjoying it more if Station Eleven hadn't come first and raised the bar for prestige post-apocalyptic television impossibly high.
Masha en de beer,wonder what the viewership for Argentina vs Saudi Arabia will look like... especially for the last 40 minutes. lol even i had to tune in.
Masha en de beer,"Not surprised. I know so many people (I live in germany) that always watched world cup but wont this year. Even I who rarely watches any sport would have watched a few games at least but this year, nope."
Masha en de beer,I just wish any of this would poke a hole in FIFA's balloon but it's filled with money and not air so they don't care.
Masha en de beer,"Nice, but the damage has already been done. Cup has been bought by Qatar, TV rights sold, and teams attended.

In these times where democracy is under pressure and we should stand together against dictator states, FIFA just doesn't give a shit."
Masha en de beer,How is it in other countries? Hope it'll help against FIFA.
Masha en de beer,This has been the worst world cup I have experienced. There is an awful atmosphere throughout that can't be shaked.
Masha en de beer,"Was the England vs Belgium thing because it was the 3rd place match? A lot of people don't care about them, and many don't think they should even exist. There were two England-Belgium matches in that WC and neither had high stakes. The first was also a dead rubber since both teams had already qualified."
Masha en de beer,"> the ratings are in and it's a disaster 

You need more information and a larger sample size than just one day of games to make that kind of claim, especially if you're trying to suggest it extends out to the entire tournament. It's premature"

Masha en de beer,so when are u posting germany's debut ratings? doesnt fit the narrative?

Masha en de beer,"It's not really a fair comparison since the last World Cup was in the summer, where more people have time off and are watching the games compared to right now where most are working. And besides that, I doubt these figures include online viewership. Not sure how it is in Germany, but in the Netherlands the national broadcaster (NOS) provides free online streams specifically for matches, which are outside of the regular streams that are accounted for in the viewership data."
Masha en de beer,"In Europe, that game started around 11am. 11am on a weekday is not a great time for good ratings in general. Add a rather unappealing match-up and it's not a formula for success."
Masha en de beer,[deleted]
Masha en de beer,"> wonder what the viewership for Argentina vs Saudi Arabia will look like...

Just checked, hadn't realized this was one of 16 games that are only shown on ""Magenta TV"". So there are no ratings. 

The other games:

* France - Australia; 4.96 million, 18.4% (competed with an episode of legal drama ""Die Kanzlei"" which had 5.05 million viewers but a lower share due to its shorter runtime).

* Mexico - Poland; 4.14 million, 23,7%

* Danmark - Tunisia; 2.69 million, 26.9%"

Masha en de beer,"I really enjoy watching the game, but I won't watch a moment of the World Cup. Sad, but like you said, it would be an awful atmosphere and I don't want to be part of it."
Masha en de beer,The third place match had 52.3%.
Masha en de beer,"Streaming is part of the German TV ratings since 2016. And since the streams from the official channels are pretty good, I doubt that many people use other channels."
Masha en de beer,">Also how many people would be watching at bars or fan areas

Guessing not many even with early bar hours? Today's Argentina/Saudi match started at 5am ET/New York time"
Masha en de beer,"This was my thought, I have streamed every game and every bar in the area is advertising that they'll be showing the games. Seems like a nothingburger to me."
Masha en de beer,"I watch my team to support my team, no need to whip your back in front of the gods of activism. Yes, Qatar was a godawful choice, but my country has my sword until I die"
Masha en de beer,Why? It's a failed case if sports washing m everyone knows what Qatar is like now and they've lying if they said they did before they got the world cup. Anyone boycotting is just cutting their nose to spite their face.
Masha en de beer,Some people enjoy political speeches.
Masha en de beer,"It does fit ""the narrative"", though: https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/z3fjh8/dwdl_in_germany_only_just_over_9_million_viewers/

My comment about that is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/z3fjh8/dwdl_in_germany_only_just_over_9_million_viewers/ixlm2ag/

The other games were on par with those in this post. I don't have the feeling it would be appreciated to do too many posts about that in this sub. The prime time game against Spain on Sunday will surely be interesting, though."
Masha en de beer,"> It's not really a fair comparison since the last World Cup was in the summer, where more people have time off and are watching the games compared to right now where most are working.

That's not an excuse at all for the low relative shares, though. Also, no excuse for the games that start at 8pm. Plus, there are no outdoor viewing events, that had viewerships in the millions in 2018.

> And besides that, I doubt these figures include online viewership. Not sure how it is in Germany,

Masha en de beer,"That game started before the NFL games began, and was during the fractured time slot where there are a number of NFL games on at the same time. It wouldn't surprise me if it outdrew a few of the NFL games by themselves, because those games were only shown in select markets, but it certainly didn't come close to the combined ratings of the NFL games Sunday afternoon."
Masha en de beer,"I wonder if the time of year is a factor in that, I bet it plays some bit into it.


I feel I'm watching an event that is a second away from imploding."
Masha en de beer,"The atmosphere _inside_ the stadia certainly isn't _bad_ but it has been different in an interesting way, and varying from match to match. Qatar wasn't the best choice but its geographical location seems to have created more balanced audiences.

I mean, you guys could be talking about the atmosphere hanging over the tournament generally, but that's pretty nebulous."

Masha en de beer,Let's revisit those German ratings when Germany actually plays.
Masha en de beer,"So this Tatort, is it akin to a German Line of Duty? What makes it so popular?"
Masha en de beer,"Germany has, you know, a significant population of Russians, and a similar culture generally, i wouldn't say Russia's opening match last time is that comparable to today's or that this means anything"
Masha en de beer,Over capitalism of football is been frustrating. tip of an iceberg is Qatar but there’s been brewing stuff for years with corruption and trying to squeeze more profits out of games with moving and increasing fixtures to point where players getting more injured and fans getting ripped off. Not forgetting homophobia and other human rights issues here too that’s been brewing with not just hosting events but power and dodgy sponsors at league level. Qatar has been all these football scandals at the same time and at a peak that’s hard to ignore. All we’re missing is a doping scandal to complete the set
Masha en de beer,I know most the US won't watch it anyway but if you can boycott this shit.
Masha en de beer,[deleted]
Masha en de beer,"maybe four years ago Tatort wasn't on. Also, hot damn, that show still going?"
Masha en de beer,"Yeah, it will be interesting. Naturally it will be way higher, but seeing that Germany's games had shares of more than 80% at all the previous World Cups, even 60% would be a disaster for the associations as well as the sponsors.

Edit: /u/NestroyAM, numbers are in, the share was 59.7%."
Masha en de beer,"Not at all. The show has been on for 52 years, so imo by now it's mostly nostalgia and tradition.
Some people go to church on Sunday mornings, but everyone watches Tatort Sunday night. For me it scratches the same itch as Columbo, if Columbo was a multitude of different detectives in different German speaking regions..."
Masha en de beer,"That's true. Still, opening matches are usually a bigger deal, and in 2018, matches like Japan vs Senegal and Nigeria vs Iceland had way more viewers. Also, the game had ~250,000 viewers more than Morocco vs Iran in 2018 (17pm on a Friday), but the latter was also watched by an additional 1.7 million people at public viewing events while there was no public viewing for the Qatar match."
Masha en de beer,"also, OP can go find ratings in south america, lets see if it fits the narrative people are trying to push in this website.."
Masha en de beer,"Unless you have one of those Nielsen boxes, no one will ever know."
Masha en de beer,"Sure. Every vote counts. It may not make a huge difference, but if enough tune out, sponsors won’t be so willing to sign up at the same rate next time.

Put it another way. Tuning it will definitely have zero positive effect. Tuning out may."

Finnish numbers seem not to be too different (2018 350k, 2022 415k). Though 2018 stats are for the whole thing including studio and opening show, while '22 is just for the game."
Masha en de beer,That is the most beautiful description I've ever heard! Gonna use that from now on :-)
Masha en de beer,"What do you mean? it's just 1217 (+13) 90min episodes, a little binging and you'll be caught up in no time /s  
That said all the cases are self-contained and some locations have only a handful of episodes. My gran and her friends in the pensioners' club usually binge a few location specific episodes before they go on a trip to one of the cities.  
That also said I promise you won't miss anything if you don't check out Tatort."
Masha en de beer,"The episodes are usually not connected, though most detectives have an overarching backstory that sometimes is developed in episodes. Even if such development occurs, it takes a back seat to the main whodunit. So no problem to jump in. Different cities have different detectives and styles, though it could and probably should be more varied. Many Tatorts are fun, but formulaic. Notable exception is the Wiesbaden Tatort, which is experimental and really fresh. People dig the humor of the Münster Tatort. I wish I could give you more on the other cities, but I usually only watch the Wiesbaden ones. But so anyway the point is: no worries, jump right in :)"
Masha en de beer,"Nah, the episodes are standalone. New teams are also introduced pretty often, and only some of them have something akin to an arch. There are also huge differences between the episodes of each team, with some having more of a comedy approach, some being thrillers and some being action films (like the Till Schweiger ones back in the day), and depending of the popularity of each team / city, the ratings are different (the one in question was from Dresden, which is on the air since 2016 with now 14 episodes)."
Masha en de beer,"Just wanted to add that Tatort is not for old people only, there are a few public viewing events in bars and stuff. I usually also watch the austrian episodes for patriotic reasons. There is a team from Switzerland too."
Masha en de beer,"Okay I've jumped in at episode 750 on Youtube and like the retro title sequence: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ub8JnX0U-cE&t=79s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ub8JnX0U-cE&t=79s)

This cold open is interesting with its time jumps and tonal jumps but what's this... the accents are a bit hard to follow. What vernacular is this? I'm going to have a hard time working out the mystery if I can't make out all the words.

Wait... are these characters speaking German?! I don't speak that! 

THANKS A LOT."
Masha en de beer,"I only watched one Tatort in my life, which i believe was a Wiesbaden one - ""Im Schmerz geboren"". That was just as you said - pretty experimental and surprisingly good. Not at all what i expected (even though many people at the time recommended it to me).

That was back in 2014 though and i have yet to see my second Tatort. But still, i remember it fondly.

Edited for clarity"
Masha en de beer,"oh I didn't mean to imply that! Sorry, Tatort really is for everyone. My entire family watches it. I just meant that those lucky enough to have the time and resources to make both regular sightseeing trips all around Germany as well as go on binging sprees sometimes combine the two because apart from interesting cases you also get to see nice landmarks of different cities."
Masha en de beer,Is it better than Inspector Rex?
Masha en de beer,Who would have thought that a German tv series is in German?
Masha en de beer,"That’s indeed a Wiesbaden one, and coincidentally my favourite Tatort also! Close second favorite is „Wer bin ich?“, and „Murot und das Murmeltier“ comes in at third. All of these are Wiesbaden. I will not spoil them for you other than to say they’re very good fun to watch also :)"
Masha en de beer,"Really? I personally feel like everyone I know my included who is younger watched Tatort with their parents. Its either a family or a boomer thing, but I would never catch a episode alone."
Masha en de beer,I have to admit I never watched it
Masha en de beer,"The two leads have great chemistry, it's gorgeous to look at, but that confession scene near the end is what really elevates it. I wasn't expecting that kind of performance from Grey Worm."
Masha en de beer,I absolutely loved this. One of my favorite pilots this year. Jacob Anderson is amazing as Louis and that church scene with him was so good. I love the changes to Louis character because. Some book fans may be mad at me but Louis in the books was not an interesting character to me so I appreciate the changes. They enter woven race really well into the story and it adds an interesting dynamic to Louis and Lestat.
Masha en de beer,"I popped this on after randomly seeing it on a pirated site and wow, it's actually an incredible intro for the season and the writers/showrunners must be huge fans of Anne rice's work. 0 expectations since I thought nothing would be better than the movie and I'm used to my favorite books getting awful adaptions, but I'm sold."
Masha en de beer,"The ""Immortal Universe"" branding at the beginning gave me Dark Universe flashbacks, but unlike Mummy this was actually pretty good. Want to see where this goes from here."
Masha en de beer,Absolutely did not expect how awesome that was.
Masha en de beer,"I was skeptical of some of the changes they were making to the series - shifting time periods significantly. But they felt earned by the end of the episode, and thematically linked to the story.

The episode was a little slow at times but it picked up significantly about halfway through. And in a way that slow initial pace helped make the end of the episode feel even better - things ramped up significantly.

Loved that it wasn't afraid to have some horror.

Overall I was totally won over by the end of the episode. Looking forward for the rest. I've been wanting a strong adaptation of these novels for a while so I hope it succeeds."
Masha en de beer,Wow; having been a fan of the book and the original movie-This is a rare instance in which the remake was better than original.
Masha en de beer,I didn’t have an opinion one way or another about this show when I heard it was coming out. Saw first 2 eps yesterday and was pleasantly surprised at how it reeled me in. I think they were thoughtful in casting and making sure there was chemistry between the 2 leads. I loved Bogosian as the journalist. For now I’m in!!!
Masha en de beer,"Never interacted with this franchise before and was not planning on watching this, but glowing reviews have piqued my interest I guess. What's the closest show you would compare this to?"
Masha en de beer,"I went into this thinking it would be jank but boy was that first episode amazing. 

Beautiful, poetic dialogue and straight-up great acting and direction.

The ways in which they portrayed Lestat as being effortlessly powerful were also fantastic.

I'm scared of watching the second one. What if it sucks?"
Masha en de beer,The first episode blew me away. I was a bit hesitant to watch since I've loved the books since high school but I absolutely loved this. I hope it remains this good throughout.
Masha en de beer,"I was kinda skeptical because the movie and the books have a special place in my heart since it was my childhood, but i am also pleasantly suprised. The only thing i dislike is the age of Claudia, but we still haven't met her, so maybe my opinion will change."
Masha en de beer,"I was very dubious about it.  I've read the books and of course seen the movie more than once.  This was a surprisingly solid first episode.  The chemistry between Lestat and Louis is excellent, both actors strong.  I'm hoping for some new elements to the classic."
Masha en de beer,"never read the books/watched the movie, watched this just for Sam Reid and the great reviews and damn it lived up to both. i'm in for the season baby"
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"> The problems were myriad from the start. **After Mark Patch (a veteran visual-effects technician with a long list of credits including Tenet, 2016’s Ghostbusters, and Starz’s American Gods) was offered a short-term position working on VFX for a Marvel series on Disney+, he says the studio balked at paying him his going rate — demanding to first see a pay stub from his work on Tenet proving his market value, then undershooting Patch’s quote by several hundred dollars a week**. Then came the nondisclosure instructions he says were issued by Marvel’s VFX and postproduction president Victoria Alonso and staff VFX producer Jen Underdahl in a telephone meeting, requiring that Patch keep his employment at the company a secret and avoid any social-media posts that might indicate he was affiliated with a Marvel Cinematic Universe project. “I was like, ‘Okay, I can’t even tell my family where I am?’” he recalls. “What is this — the Manhattan Project?!”

> Then there was the job itself. **While an average feature-length superhero or sci-fi movie might have 1,600 visual effects, he says this ten-hour show** (which he cannot specifically name per a nondisclosure agreement he signed) **would require around 3,000 VFX shots to be completed on a much shorter timeline. Nonetheless, feature-quality work was expected**, which could include anything from replacing actors’ faces to rendering entire CG sequences from scratch. **Confronted with the prospect of what he was told would be 18-hour days, seven days a week, for three months straight, Patch walked away from the contract. “They said, ‘Okay, well, do you want a job on our next show?’ And I said, ‘No.’”** (Marvel Studios declined to comment on Patch’s story and declined to make Alonso and Underdahl available to speak.)

> **Talk to any VFX artist or tech working in modern Hollywood and certain complaints come up over and over: the punishing deadlines, grueling work hours, too few workers charged with too much work, underpayment and systematic “pixel-fucking” — an industry phrase used to describe the behavior of nitpicking clients who lack the VFX knowledge to communicate their needs.** Ben Speight, an organizer at the Animation Guild and the VFX-IATSE, a rapidly growing wing of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (of which Patch is a member) that first formed in 2012, says the industry has grown “exponentially” since the late ’90s and early 2000s, when it consisted of several hundred visual-effects workers. According to the effects and gaming directory site Studio Hog, there are now 582 visual-effects houses worldwide and somewhere between 31,000 and 117,000 workers plying their trade at any given time. **VFX industry watchdogs estimate that across TV and film, there is currently about three times the amount of work as there are visual-effects professionals to execute it.**"
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,VFX artists absolutely need to be unionized. The rest of the film industry has strong unions and they need to be included 100%
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"Good. These artists deserve a union who will, frankly, hold incessant release schedule to ransom to get them acceptable working conditions. Feige et al are obsessed with the progression and growth and don’t give a shit how they get there as long as something else gets set up on the way."
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"""Animation is expensive, time consuming and needs specialized skills"", said the Animator. 

""Aaaaaaarrrrgh"", screamed the Hollywood exec, ""how dare you confront me with reality, I've spent years developing a drug habit to avoid that!"""
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"Disney shows are looking like shit these days, because they are asking too much of VFX artists in a short amount of time. 

The quality is seriously all over the place. Sometimes it looks great, other times it looks like Black Widow (oh man that movie's VFX were awful, maybe the worst I've seen in a Marvel movie). If I were a VFX artist, I'd walk away too. Disney needs to treat these people better, pay them better, and give them more time. When Disney gets into crank-a-bunch-of-projects-out mode the final product usually looks awful."
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"With the current boom-era going with Television and the focus in both movie and film on VFX, how is it that VFX houses are not able to receive a premium for their work simply based on negotiation? I don’t see how a Marvel or Disney production could be effectively made right now without VFX so why aren’t VFX folks more in command of their pay? Generally this is the effect of a market so something else has to be missing."
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"Since Fiege is the head of Marvel, this is his fault. They should be able to afford to pay these people what they are due.

*my bad Fiege This appears to be Victoria Alonso's fault, but you are also somewhat responsible."
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"Well that sucks. I formerly worked in that industry (I do similar work in games,  now). They’ve been trying to form that union for a while now (it was being discussed in 2009/10 at the latest). 

“Back in my day,” there were similar issues, but that level of abuse was only associated with specific studios.  You learned to avoid them (some of them were run by absolute scum). But none were as big as Marvel, and there were other options. 

Gotta say, I was in the Animation Guild for a bit, and they had absolutely no teeth. Hope the VFX version does a little better!"
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"I want to add that I hope, along with artists, that VFX Production Coordinators and Managers get allowed into a union as well just like some on set production positions are.

I’ve worked as a VFX coord close to six years now for a lot of shows, and we pull just as much hours if not more as artists, as we usually have to stay even later to deliver for clients if we work vendor side OR we’re pulling stupid hours awaiting those deliveries at night or waking up at the crack of Dawn to set up reviews the next days for dailies in the AM. This is especially brutal during pilots. And we don’t get paid nearly as much as artists do.

We’re suffering from this nonsense too. Please don’t forget about us."
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,Maybe they will let the Catering Dept unionize next. As it stands only one of usually 5 team members are allowed to be teamsters. They force the other 4 to work 14-18 hour shifts with under 8 hours of turn around.
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"It seems to me that one repeating issue with these stories is the nature of the contract between the movie company and the VFX company - fixed price with a seemly unlimited scope for changes.

The idea of being able to do this with any other form of work seems unreal.  Imagine you're watching a house being built and the client goes to the building company with a list of alterations.  The builder isn't going to do that stuff for free.  Without incentives and disincentives to planning their work properly, the movie studios will keep abusing VFX houses."
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"I used to dismiss vfx work as simple stuff till I stumbled upon the corridor crew channel. Gave me real insight of how much work goes in. 

Big companies don't respect workers and its why unions are important"
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"It's past time for VFX artists to unionize, studios have treated them like slaves for years now (remember what happened with *Life of Pi*?), demanding top notch work to for peanuts and faster than possible. Modern blockbusters would straight up die without VFX yet their job is terribly undervalued."
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"I wonder if they could negotiate to join SAG-AFTRA.  This seems like a pretty easy marriage, you have creatives being put over the barrel by studios the same way actors have previously been abused.  SAG-AFTRA has dealt with this from production crew up to writers, they negotiate with the same people.  Etc"
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"Curious: why are these companies allowed to treat the artists so poorly?  Is there a glut of them and so if they don't like the working conditions they can be easily replaced?  I didn't think that was the case.

Is it just that too many artists have allowed themselves to be walked over for too long, making exploitation the norm similar to how you sometimes see in the IT industry with people expected to be on call 24/7/365?"
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"It's about time someone in the VFX biz told Marvel Studios to fuck off. Whatever you think about their movies, the demands they place on vendors are unreasonable."
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,Sounds like Armor Wars.
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"As a Marvel fan for 35 years, I absolutely endorse better pay and conditions for the people that bring me the content I enjoy.

I'd much rather there be no more MCU than there be these shitty conditions Disney keeps imposing on their employees/contractors."
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,Im sorry but blame ring of power all you want but the vfx were flawless. And that's because anazon hired enough studio to get it done. Disney is scaling the size of projects but not the amount of studio working on it.
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,Good. The VFX people have too much on their plate. I may enjoy marvel movies but I don't want people behind the scenes getting overworked for this.
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"Marvel Studios is that hot girl in high school that everyone wants to fuck but in reality she's very shallow, will cost you a ton of time and money and there are probably more rewarding things to do than be with her."
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,I work in film. There's gonna be Patch patches worn on sets soon. We're rather droll so it'll probably just be a black patch that says Mark Patch in white block letters. Maybe even just Patch. The producers will pretend they can't see them.
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"This is the problem in both tv/movies and game development; the time frames have shrunk insanely, along with the budgets, because ""time is money""  and they have to keep pumping out new material to sell every year."
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"So, that Marvel show has to have been She-Hulk right? For half the runtime it had (at least) one full CG character and you could tell that the VFX artists didn't have the time to make it look good in a lot of the shots."
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,How haven't the VFX artists not go on strike by now? These working conditions are ludicrous.
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,">“With the right strategy led by VFX workers themselves,” says Speight, “in the next year, there could be an opportunity for a group to move forward, be successful, and establish their first union.”

**U N I ON S** 

**S H O U L D** 

**B E** 

**E V E R Y W H E R E**"
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"We want more, but will pay you less…."
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"I’ll believe it when it happens. Over covid Artists and TD’s had ALL the power. And despite a ton of talk nothing happened. Hell in some places they straight up CAN’T unionise because certain companies playing politics rather than paying fairly. (Search up the hobbit laws for a wide ride)

Fuck you Warner cunts."
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"that is what greed does to you. 

i recently saw a documentary kingdom of dreams. and they use creative people to booster their own money, no care for their health as long as they deliver on the deadlines, while these company owners made billions of dollars. it is a disgusting world. same for VFX guys. they love their work so much, they shorten their lives because of it and the people in power know it. so they profit from them."
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,They will just outsource even more than they already do.
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,this is not new and it is happening on all  visual tech industry for decades
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"Curious to see the struggles of VFX artists and how similar they are to IT developers, and IT personnel in general. It seems that there is a generalised lack of respect for people who work with computers, from both management and customers."
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,They need it done in 2 weeks so they can shelve it for 3 years. Hurry up!
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"Yea... disney ruining Stan Lee's company reputation..

Can't say I didn't see this one coming."
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,Fuck Marvel. White trash company.
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,It’s almost like Disney is a terrible company. Who would have thought that.
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"Oh man what are they doing.

It honestly seems like they are cashing Marvel out at this point which I didn't think was going to happen under Fiege"
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,This is dogshit from Marvel i hope Kevin Feige gets ousted soon what a prick
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"Someone mentioned an expression the other day.
""Marvel sees it takes 9 months for a woman to conceive and give birth.
Let's hire 9 women and get a baby in 1 month"""
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"Unions are great, yes to unions, but in this case didn't the free market do its job? The potential employer was shitty, the potential employee refused the work. Happens all the time in every industry."
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"Dude offered job, it’s too much for him, dude says no. Big deal?"
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"What is this ludicrous parody illustration accompanying the article that describes nothing about visual effects. Also I’m suspicious of people saying de-aging on a marvel film has more clout than in a Scorsese film. Everyone knows marvel is cheesy AF. If this is real, then it just emphasizes that the industry needs to rid itself of the fanboy mentality.

Edit: too many fanboys in the thread downvoting who evidently have no industry experience. I say this to the workers on current marvel films: How the fuck did you get to the point where you think there is prestige doing Victoria Alonzo’s bidding. Grow the fuck up and tell them to go fuck themselves."
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,Greenmans savin u right now bro
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"Not that I don’t want VFX artists to be treated fairly, but the moment they unionize all of their jobs will be outsourced overseas for much less money than they are currently makingZ

Edit:  why are people downvoting this? I’m not saying I want that to happen. I’m saying it *will* happen. VFX jobs are already being outsourced. It’ll just get worse with unionization."
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,this sound similar to the peewee herman netflix movie.
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"Much like animation, there will always be humans willing to do it for less"
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,Good luck. This is exactly what Information Tech when through when overheating in the early 2000’s. Studio response?…replace them with smart mexicans from india. Same thing will happen here.
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"I'm tired of seeing VFX people being burned out of the industry, or firms collapsing despite getting paid because they're not getting paid enough to deal with the OT.

Marvel and Disney in general fucking suck for this from what I've been hearing. they'll film some actors in a greenscreen, then demand to do and redo and redo things until they figure out what angle they wanted, or in some cases, have alternate scenes like they are completely ass-unable to storyboard BEFORE filming their movies so it's a Choose Your Own Adventure basically until enough coked up executives agree it'll get max return on investment"
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,As someone who works in VFX this all sounds super accurate. And it’s actually frame fucking… usually it doesn’t get down to the pixel.
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"18 hours a day, 7 days a week, it’s amazing he didn’t want to take that enticing deal."

Signing away your rights to talk to your family just to work on some dumbass Marvel superhero show called The Paper Cutter and it's about a guy who can use paper to cut people as a superpower."
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"The studios are just going to keep doing it until all the effects houses are unionized, or at least a significant majority of them. And they can't go overseas with this stuff, the studios want immediate back-and-forth, and video chat doesn't cut it for that."
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"If a prospective client ever asked to see pay stubs from a previous client to prove my rate to them, that would be an immediate dismissal of ever working with that client again. Absurdity."
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"VFX is definitely slammed, so not surprising. Post administration is also trying to unionize nationally. 

Capitalists just take everything they can, and then some. Only way to combat the entrenched wealthy is to organize."

Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,I saw an article yesterday that said Marvel pays 20% below the industry standard for VFX
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,Aren't these guys highly skilled and sought after specialists? Why are they accepting shit jobs?
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"We’ve heard of VFX artists being exploited for a long time now. I’m surprised they haven’t managed to set and enforce their most important demands for working conditions and pay. 

I imagine if a significant portion of artists refuse to work for what a studio is offering, then what is the studio gonna do? Getting worse artists isn’t a great idea because the audience doesn’t react kindly to bad/cheap visuals. Paying some non-unionized artists would probably be very expensive because they could choose other projects to work on. 

I realize that when working in that field, by yourself you’re just one guy and don’t have any power. But collectively they would have a lot of leverage"
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"I’m 90 percent anti union having managed one at one point and even I’m pro union in this situation. 7 days, 16-18 hrs? , impossible deadline, unfair pay - that’s idiotic for an employer to demand and they should be punished as such. The vfx workers largest obstacle is that there is 3x more work than workers which means Disney can be like “whatever, we’ll find a mofo that will do it”  which there always is. But the customer gets an ass product in the end."
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"> Disney shows are looking like shit these days

the biggest problem is that it all looks and feels the same, there is no difference if I watch Dr. Strange MoM or Hawkeye"
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"Honestly: there was nothing wrong with Black Widow's VFX. There are shots which could be better, but they're all perfectly serviceable. VFX doesn't necessarily make or break most films *provided the audience is invested in the film*.

Black Widow's problem is the story the VFX tells makes no fucking sense at all. It's like someone got a brief for ""animate these Marvel superhero movie scenes"" and then was later told ""drop in this Scarlett Johansson 3D scan and send me the renders"".

The best VFX in the world won't make *Black Widow*'s effects look *good*, because narratively it all reads as nonsense based on what we know about the character and her capabilities."
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"I loved the writing and acting on She Hulk, but the CGI was so distracting. I was kinda wishing the whole time that they had just painted Tatiana Maslany green and put her on a stool. :P"

You haven’t seen Ghost Rider, have you?"
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,The same has been happening to Disney animators for decades. The Mouse is a cruel taskmaster.
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"It's so self-defeating, too. I know they're trying to goose earnings numbers and capture the superhero zeitgeist, but they've totally oversaturated the genre and burned a bunch of people out. 

Avengers Endgame was the perfect time to slow it down, go for quality, and find a new reason for existing. Instead they hit the gas and pumped out a ton of hit-or-miss stuff that increasingly demands you watch *everything* to understand it. I've tuned out."
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,The boom is very much over now. See HBO and Netflix cancelling stuff after they've ordered it.
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"Its the same as video games: making movie magic is a dream for a lot of people so taking a stand probably just gets you replaced. 

A union is what they need because like video games the company can make bank and still have the artists work crazy hours for profit that doesn't reach them. 

But forming a union is hard, a bunch of people have to risk their livelihoods on it and have to have enough of an impact to not just be replaced, like would any of us notice if 5 of the 20+ VFX firms listed in the back end of a movie credits roll changed?"
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"It seems from the article that Kevin Feige is very involved in the VFX approval process as well.
 

> Patch — who most recently worked as an associate visual-effects producer on the Jordan Peele horror-comedy Nope — **says he was surprised to discover that Alonso and Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige insisted on personally approving shots that require visual-effects work.** “You wake up, and the first review would be set for 7:30 on a Sunday, because you’re dealing with Kevin’s schedule, you’re dealing with vendors all over the world: London, Bangalore, Australia, China,” he says. “Then everyone has to adjust based on the needs of whoever’s reviewing the shot: the director, the showrunner, the producers. **Everybody’s giving their opinion, and sometimes they’re giving multiple notes on the same frames. You’re like, ‘What direction do I go with this?’” (Marvel declined to comment on Feige’s involvement.** An insider close to the company, however, says that Feige does not approve every VFX shot.)"
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,You mean Marvel?  The company that provided a “hot meal” to the crew at a press junket that consisted of half a 12” subway sandwich and water?  And no seconds?  For a movie that made hundreds of millions?  That Marvel?

One of our tech artists was in charge of lighting the VFX shots for Return of the King. He went on to go work at ILM on the Star Wars prequels, before going to DreamWorks as one of their CG supervisors for _years_.

Then one day he decided he was sick of it and went into gamedev. It was so wild hearing the stories he told and the projects he worked on."
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,[deleted]
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"Aren't games kind of shitty too in terms of crunch, work conditions and pay?"
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,So you prefer working in the gaming industry? How is the time/money in comparison?
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"Typically the catering crew arrives 4 hours before ""crew call"" and stays 2-4 hours after 2nd meal is served. If the filming crew wraps early for the day, let's say an hour or two after second meal. The catering crew still has to be back to serve breakfast in less than 8 hours. Falling asleep at the wheel driving a box truck or refrigerated catering truck is a common occurrence in the film industry. The major production house side step this by hiring catering as a vendor and not having to pay or abide by union rules/ wages."
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"And let me tell you, it's far far far more complex than what corridor crew channel is portraying."
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"It would be IATSE along with everyone else that isn't considered Above the Line (Actors, writers, directors)"
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,Wouldn't the Animation Guild be a more natural fit?
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"It’s a few different angles: vfx is a desirable industry and many people are willing to work for peanuts just to get into it so they are easily replaceable and expected to do it for the passion.  Second, many studios see a marvel contract as gold and will undercut a bid to get it.  Third, it’s a small industry and where I am (Vancouver) threat to unionize is sort of an instant black listing.  Studios also do shitty things like pay weekly rates instead of hourly because they know all the crazy hours required and they often underscope how long a shot will take.  It goes on and on…"
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"Seems like the natural fit in American Capitalism, every company tries to undercut each other, offering more work for less money. 
A lot of the other groups involved in making films are strongly unionised, so getting a VFX one up and running should be a huge priority for them."
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,💯
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,Armor wars got turned into a movie.
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,Could be Echo.  Wasn’t Echo delayed?  Perhaps the delay could be a result of trouble with VFX.
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,Loki is my guess. Because of who this guy is
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,How's that gonna work with Tony dead? It was his story.
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,“10-hour” could only apply to Daredevil.
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,I mean the dumb thing is they don't even have to rush. They can take their sweet time making content and people will consume it like crazy. Avatar 2 came out after a decade and a half and people still flocked to watch it
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,"it helps that Amazon don't have the insane release schedule that Disney now has. I hope if the VFX people do get strong unions, we start to see this bubble burst and come down to one or two marvel projects a year 

or - better yet - not rely on CGI for everything, especially the shows 

like, what if they actually had to be creative about telling these stories? cos it seems like right now they're burning out a whole industry for... shareholders"
Arn: The Knight Templar: The Complete Series,I'd also assume that like when they took over The Expanse they provided the VFX houses free access to AWS for rendering. That's a massive time saver for production.
Shameless (U.S.),Both William H Macey and Emmy Rossum are amazing.
Shameless (U.S.),"My younger brother (who lives in Belize) sent me a text literally 5 minutes ago asking if I watched the show. He lives in the jungle and has a friend who lives in town tape it and deliver it to him. He will be watching the finale episode tonight and asked me not to tell him anything. He doesn't get excited about much, so while the characters may make questionable choices and you have to suspend disbelief in many scenarios, they are undeniably captivating and entertaining."
Shameless (U.S.),"That scene with Carl and Frank in the hospital... something in my eyes, man. "
Shameless (U.S.),ok I will watch it.
Shameless (U.S.),"Shameless is one of my favorite shows. What made me originally fall in love with the show was the fact that they are all terrible people, yet I like every single one of the Gallaghers. The finale was incredibly sad."
Shameless (U.S.),I watched the UK version and loved it (downloaded).  I haven't watched the US version yet.
Shameless (U.S.),"I loved Shameless, but I really didn't enjoy much of this past season.  I don't know if I'll keep up with it very much longer."
Shameless (U.S.),"I honestly gave it a go, but I could find no character to relate with or cheer for.  They are basically a family of dirtbags.  

It has its comedic moments, but when the storyline turns toward the sentimental, I cannot feel the empathy required to connect with any of these criminals."
Shameless (U.S.),Emmy Rossum. Tits. That is all.
Shameless (U.S.),I will most likely not continue to watch this show because after three seasons nothing has changed really. I've lost interest.
Shameless (U.S.),"I guess it's different for everyone. Yes, they're dirtbags, but it's hard to hate them.

Do you mind telling me what season or episode you made it to? If you haven't passed the first few episodes, than you should try continuing. As with any show, the first episodes are really just to place their ground as a series and I think even Season 2 was better than the first."
Shameless (U.S.),">I cannot feel the empathy required to connect with any of these criminals.

I don't think that's what the show is about. It's more like a character study like Mad Men, but it's about a group of people with more of a gritty and dramatic life. "
Shameless (U.S.),Cheer for Fiona. 
Shameless (U.S.),"My thoughts exactly. It's quite clear which scumbags I'm supposed to be rooting for, and Frank is sometimes a hilarious yet disgusting mess... I just can't get behind any of the underhanded plots the show seems to glorify."
Shameless (U.S.),You just reminded me of the reason I lost interest in this show.
Shameless (U.S.),"SPOILERS AHEAD



[](/s ""What do you mean? Lip is going to MIT, Ian forged his way into the army, Frank is probably dead, Jimmy is MIA, Fiona has a stable job and guardianship over the kids."")

Last nights season finale was great, felt more like a series finale."
Shameless (U.S.),"I made it to episode 4, when Debbie steals the baby.  I only watched half of 4, but I watched 1-3 in their entirety.  

Of all of them I liked the most was probably episode 2, when Frank gets dumped in Canada and they have to go get him back.  Like I said, it has its comedic moments, but I couldn't relate to any of the characters, so I couldn't keep going."
Shameless (U.S.),"If Lip leaves the show or is missing for large parts of the season because he's at MIT...then I don't know if I can continue watching, haha.  He's definitely my favorite character, him and Kevin are both great."
Shameless (U.S.)," [](/s ""Why do you think Frank is dead? The last we see he's walking down the street in his hospital gown. Not sure that points to him being dead, which would be a shock to me. If anything I'm worried about Jimmy."")

"
Shameless (U.S.),"I think the vast majority of the characters are relatable -- Fiona for example is a rock.

The problem I think is that we're conditioned to root for the lead character, particularly if he's being played by William H. Macy.  

You just have to keep reminding yourself that he's at best a sociopath and at worst a murderer.  "
Shameless (U.S.),I can relate to them. You don't have to be poor or a criminal to empathize with their situation(s).
Shameless (U.S.),Kev is such an underrated character. 
Shameless (U.S.),"[](/s ""I'm guess he doesn't have long to live might be the last season we get Frank."")"
Shameless (U.S.),"Couldn't agree more, he makes me laugh more than any other character on the show."
Shameless (U.S.),I am pretty sure that Death Note does not have 11 seasons
Shameless (U.S.),We're back to having tv channels
Shameless (U.S.),"Have all these departures been officially announced?  

 I am glad Halt and Catch Fire and Rectify are not on this list."
Shameless (U.S.),">Paramount+

wtf is this? first time i hear about it"
Shameless (U.S.),This is why used to use VPN for Netflix before then blocked them all. You guys have so many tv shows we don’t here in Scandinavia.
Shameless (U.S.),That’s good to know; just decided to re-watch Nurse Jackie a few days ago only to realize it won’t be on for much longer. Damn it!
Shameless (U.S.),"The appeal to Netflix for me was always that they had a mix of shows I liked to rewatch and a good amount of original content that was largely good. Now they're losing most of the licensed content (a lot of shows I like are already gone) and their track record with original content is mediocre, made worse by their quick axe with shows.

They're becoming the most expendable streaming service to me. The one I don't need to have all the time."
Shameless (U.S.),Good thing I have the internet
Shameless (U.S.),"Damn, I was about to finally watch The West Wing."
Shameless (U.S.),"> High profile

> Friday Night Tykes

What."
Shameless (U.S.),If only this meant we could get The Last Kingdom s3 and s4 on Netflix...
Shameless (U.S.),"I find it interesting the second or first most binged show two years running isn't moving

I guess Netflix won't be going to hell..."
Shameless (U.S.),I've only seen two of these shows. None of the other shows interest me so I guess I am lucky!
Shameless (U.S.),"> Netflix Canada

> Friends (Seasons 1-10) : moving to Crave

> The Office (Seasons 1-9)

> The fresh Prince of bell-air (Seasons 1-6)

Actually, The Office is staying put for now and it is Gossip Girl in fact that's leaving Netflix over here in the North."
Shameless (U.S.),I started Gran Hotel on Wednesday but I don't think I can watch 60+ episodes in the next week!  Hope it moves to Hulu.
Shameless (U.S.),"Yeah what the duck. Unless one season consists of 3-4 episodes

The anime has 37 episodes in total and it's all labeled as one season and there are few live action movies including a western one which failed."
Shameless (U.S.),Not having ads and choosing what to watch is a huge plus though
Shameless (U.S.),"We were never not going to have that. When we complained about cable it wasn’t because they asked us to pay for content we wanted. It’s because they also forced us to pay for content we didn’t want. I was paying thirty bucks a month for four ESPN channels I never ever use. I don’t want that.  I don’t have to pay for that without cable, which is great. But “I’m gonna get all the content in this entire world for 12.99 a month” is kinda unreasonable."
Shameless (U.S.),"Time to buy a 3TB hard drive and work on the only channel that matters, a Plex server"
Shameless (U.S.),"People wanted the ability to just pay for what they watch, right? Well here you go."
Shameless (U.S.),"Except the ""TV channels"" have everything available immediately and you can cancel anytime. Seems like a pretty major difference."
Shameless (U.S.),[deleted]
Shameless (U.S.),"This are all officially announced, but the bad news is what i listed is probably only 1/10 or 1/15 of what will be leaving Netflix soon."
Shameless (U.S.),"For the ones on Netflix France at least, you get a warning when playing them. So that's sure for those. I assume the others are the same"
Shameless (U.S.),"New name for CBS All Access, they're rebranding"
Shameless (U.S.),Some still work like Expressvpn
Shameless (U.S.),I completely agree.  I regularly unsubscribe from Netflix for months at a time to save a few bucks until something I REALLY want to watch starts up.
Shameless (U.S.),For a minute I thought it was a typo for Friday Night Lights!
Shameless (U.S.),"Wait, you don't? Where are you? I thought they carried that everywhere."
Shameless (U.S.),"Damn that sucks man, the last kingdom is awesome. That’s a shitty situation I’d be pretty irritated."
Shameless (U.S.),What show
Shameless (U.S.),You're only obligated to a monthly payment and can cancel anytime which is a huge plus as well. If the streaming services ever change this model that is when we go back to tv channels but without commercials.
Shameless (U.S.),[deleted]
Shameless (U.S.),mine is up to 67tb :)
Shameless (U.S.),"> we don't have a single place to go to get the back catalogues like we used to 

We never had this."
Shameless (U.S.),"Netflix had to start creating their own content because the other networks were already pulling content. They were proactive to the changing market, not the cause of it."
Shameless (U.S.),Dam it’s getting really hard to keep up with all these streaming services
Shameless (U.S.),"Nordics. The Last Kingdom was on SVT (public television) here in Sweden back in 2018, however since then you cant stream it anywhere as SVT only carries the episodes on their streaming site for a few weeks. Its very strange how Netflix hasnt gotten the rights yet"
Shameless (U.S.),Lucifer
Shameless (U.S.),"I get it, we are past the exciting new part of streaming, but I feel like so any people forget how worse cable truly was. This is a great point"
Shameless (U.S.),"The cost is vastly lower and you can cancel whenever you want, jump to another streaming service and watch their content too."
Shameless (U.S.),Need 2 more TB
Shameless (U.S.),"They’re mostly done a bad job of naming themselves, despite fairly obvious choices.

* Disney+ is *fine.* “Disney” possibly would have been better.
* HBO Max. You could say it should be “HBO,” but HBO is a premium brand yet they’re using it as a service name for all Warner Bros.' shows and movies. “Warner Bros.”  or “WB” would have been better, with “HBO” as a tab within that. No need to dilute HBO’s existing cachet.
* CBS All Access should just be CBS. Paramount works fine, but calling it Paramount+ just looks like they’re a wannabe Disney+ (which they are). The Paramount Channel, maybe.
* Peacock is an awful name. Most people don’t know that NBC’s rainbow logo *is* a peacock. Again, just call it “NBC.”
* “Apple TV” is probably the only option they had, since they’ve moved away from “iMovie”-style names and it mostly has TV shows, not movies, but it creates confusion between the streaming service, the physical box you hook up into your TV, and the app that acts as a portal to all (non-Netflix) video."
Shameless (U.S.),"Easier to keep up with it if most of them aren't releasing in my country. Netflix, Prime and Disney and that's about it I guess.

edit: forgot Apple+"
Shameless (U.S.),"Bizarre! Sorry to hear that, though -- I hope they make some changes soon for you all."
Shameless (U.S.),"All that - plus you actually choose to watch what you want, when you want. The ability to watch Fuller House never stops you from watching The Office."
Shameless (U.S.),gimmie a month im on it!
Shameless (U.S.),"The paid service is called AppleTV+ actually. Apple TV is the app that regroups all other services on the tvOS system (which is available on the hardware called...AppleTV). Yeah it's a mess of naming

> HBO Max. You could say it should be “HBO,” but HBO is a premium brand yet they’re using it as a service name for all Warner Bros.' shows and movies. “Warner Bros.” or “WB” would have been better, with “HBO” as a tab within that. No need to dilute HBO’s existing cachet.

That was kind of the idea, profit from the HBO brand awareness in TV for it. But yeah it's dumb because they have stuff like DC, Cartoon Network, CNN, Warner Bros,.. all of those are strong brand in their own right. They should have done something like calling it WarnerMedia (that's literally the new name of the Warner branch inside AT&T) and include ""sections"" for HBO, CN, Warner TV, Warner Bros (movies), DC,...

> Peacock is an awful name. Most people don’t know that NBC’s rainbow logo is a peacock. Again, just call it “NBC.”

It's ridiculous but it's larger than just NBC too, it's the whole Universal catalog too (at least it's the objective)."
Shameless (U.S.),"They’re changing to Paramount+ because outside the US no-one knows what the hell a CBS is, except the people who remember the billboard company or the record label.

Sounds like a painful visit to the toilet."
Shameless (U.S.),"BET+, AMC+, and Discovery+ are fairly well named. Although the discovery service is surprisingly packed"
Shameless (U.S.),Better Disney+ than just Disney. That would just create confusion when talking about about it. We would forever having to say whether we mean Disney the company or Disney the streaming service.
Shameless (U.S.),Nice
Shameless (U.S.),seeing M. Crook (Gareth) - i recommend his heartwarming series Detectorists
Shameless (U.S.),"I’m an American, who saw and loved the British Office before the U.S. Office came out. I was furious with the blatant duplications (some early scenes were almost word-for-word duplications of the British version) and boycotted the U.S. Office for a while. I calmed down when people pointed out that Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant were Executive Producers of the U.S. version, and that the U.S. version had gone in a different creative direction. I finally watched and liked it. 

But holy lord, we Americans sure do love our long romantic arcs. The British Office was much better without all the Jim-and-Pam, Pam-and-Roy, Michael-and-Holly, Michael-and-Jan, Gabe-and-Erin, Andy-and-Erin, Andy-and-Angela, Dwight-and-Angela, Angela-and-the-Senator, Oscar-and-the-Senator, Ryan-and-Kelly, and Darryl-and-Kelly byplay. If the U.S. version had gone much longer, they probably would have exhausted every possible mathematical combination of cast members."
Shameless (U.S.),"I never realized how much I disliked laugh tracks until they were gone.  If your comedy can't survive without telling me when I'm supposed to laugh, then it's not written/acted well enough.  I find it painful to watch a ""studio audience"" sit-com with on-queue laughs, ""woo""s and cheers.  The artificialness stands out more to me now than it did back when they were ubiquitous."
Shameless (U.S.),I love the UK Office but I always think it traces back to I'm Alan Partridge. The dimwitted unlikable protagonist who shouldn't be in any position of authority who would always make you cringe with his stupidity and lack of awareness.
Shameless (U.S.),"Been listening to The Office ladies podcast.  They had Greg Daniels on an episode and he said something pretty funny.  He thought he was a genius putting his writers into the show and then about halfway through Season 3 he walked in the writers room and it had around two people in it because everyone else was on set and he was like ""what have I done"".  Also this is why the show was constantly sidelining Toby, Ryan and Kelly.  If you go back and watch it its so damn obvious.  
  
Also they said the stairs you are constantly seeing in the show don't lead to the front door or the office, they were for the editors and writers.  This fact breaks my brain.  
  
Oh and the corporate offices in new york was a warehouse next door to the shooting location."
Shameless (U.S.),"I don’t think I understand the point of this article. It feels like they are saying helped reinvent TV comedy.

I would say a better description is that many forms of comedy, including this one, already exist. The issue is TV production always wants to clone whatever is the most popular at the time. 

Before the office it was more family style sitcoms.

Then the office came out and it was popular so it became the style of sitcom everyone decided to copy.

So I guess I would say it reinvented comedy in the sense it changed what we consider to be generic."
Shameless (U.S.),I knew it…hehehe

Shameless (U.S.),"He's great as the batshit druid Veran in Britannia, though he's mostly unrecognizable."
Shameless (U.S.),One of my top three shows
Shameless (U.S.),I agree with everything **BUT** Ryan and Kelly were hilarious because their subplots precisely  avoided being about a relationship and they were always arguing about uniting or separating. How Kelly dumped him or made him jealous was a blueprint of every toxic relationship in media after that.
Shameless (U.S.),"My one gripe with the US Office is the over-reliance on office relationships. Yes, it happens. To that extent? Definitely not."
Shameless (U.S.),"Yes, the American version was made with the Merchant and Gervais, that’s how that typically works.  But you also can’t compare the storytelling of a series that lasts just 14 episodes total in comparison to one that ran for 201 episodes.  More episodes to fill = longer story arcs, especially romantic tension."
Shameless (U.S.),"It gets sooooo fucking tiresome doesn't it? 

They just HAVE to inject that in every successful show eh? I came to laugh and couldn't give two shits aobut Jim and Pam's stupid fucking romance. Sorry office fans"
Shameless (U.S.),While never having watched the american version. You just named 17 caracters if i counted correctly and assuming a relationship is only of 2 people and one can never have one with themselves that would make 17x16=272 possible relationships
Shameless (U.S.),I agree with everything **BUT** Ryan and Kelly were hilarious because precisely their subplots avoided being about a relationship and they were always arguing about uniting or separating. How Kelly dumped him or made him jealous was a blueprint of every toxic relationship in media after that.
Shameless (U.S.),Lmaoooo
Shameless (U.S.),"I was annoyed by blatant scene duplications too, most of them don't even make sense in a bigger context. Like in the season they recreated the scene where Michael fake-fires Pam, from scene where David fake-fires Dawn, and that doesn't make sense for the rest of the series because Michael isn't that sadistic, but that is perfectly in David's character.

The biggest issue for me with US Office was that is a cartoon and operates with that logic. The power of the setting comes from making fun of the mundane, which is completely wasted when everything is turned into cartoon logic.

Jim is poor man's Tim. They both represent the straight man character, but the difference is that with Tim his pranks are minor things and very grounded, with Jim they over the top and dominate his character.

Michael is only good because of Steve Carrel's charisma, who seems to ad-lib half the scenes.

They did well to make Dwight different from Gareth, yet I would still prefer Gareth, because his socially awkward interactions are hilarious, while Dwight 's pseudo-Amish traditions just enforces cartoonism."
Shameless (U.S.),"To be fair, there's really about five arcs there - Andy/Erin, Dwight/Angela, Ryan/Kelly, Jim/Pam, and Michael/Holly  - and the others were just complications off of these. Obviously, those are more than enough."
Shameless (U.S.),Lmao what a moron. You realize when they do remakes in another country it is commonly produced by the people that began it? Just like UK Shameless and US Shameless are nearly full copies of each other the first season. Leave it to a redditor to be on their soapbox boycotting something without even half of the information.

Shameless (U.S.),I mean laugh tracks have pretty much been replaced by camera glances/zooms so it's not as different as you'd think.
Shameless (U.S.),"I tend to really enjoy shows that are performed in front of live audiences because it’s almost like filmed theatre, it’s a totally different type of show from a single camera sitcom with no laugh track. But shows that have terrible canned laughter that the cast aren’t reacting to in the moment don’t work for me I agree."
Janet King,I assume it's staffed by americans
Janet King,"They curate a lot of this stuff manually. While they do all major releases they don't do every TV show or album, and they certainly don't include every publication even in the US alone. I'm sure it takes a lot of time and resources to put up what they do already, there probably isn't as big of an audience for international shows.

But you know, you could look at their FAQ or contact them to ask why instead of whining about it in public."
Janet King,"I guess the obvious answer is that it's an American company, staffed by mostly Americans. "
Janet King,"But why? Is it that difficult to add some Canadian, British and Australian critics? The staff of metacritic does not write anything, that's what ""meta"" means: they just harvest opinions of critics from the Internet, pick the best quote and voila. "
Janet King,"Plenty of UK shows have entries on Metacritic, in fact i just tried 5 off the top of my head and they were all there.

Your problem seems to be that you are wondering why some obscure (relatively) Aussie show isn't on there. You just need to look at it's IMDb entry to see why, with only 300 odd votes in two years and only 6 forum threads even the Aussies aren't interested in discussing it online so why would people from other countries?

Aussie shows aren't seen much outside of Australia whereas US shows are seen worldwide, their 319m population compared to Australias 23m doesn't hurt either. More people watching = larger amount of people and sites discussing them online. The only Aussie show i can remember watching in recent years is Wentworth."
Janet King,BoJack Horseman is the reason I'll always remember Margo Martindale's name from now on.
Janet King,Brie is also the voice of Vincent Adultman. 
Janet King,"Ed Helm's character is listed as ""Charlotte's husband"" instead of KYLE AND THE KIDSSSSS!"
Janet King,You listed Kristen Chenowith and Wendie Malick twice. Also it's Weird Al YANKOVIC not Yankovich.

The Thick of It,I could happily watch this show on loop for about a month straight
The Thick of It,"[The ""Quiet Batpeople"" initiative](https://youtu.be/8_AM1W5rHGA) is my favorite bit from the show."
The Thick of It,"May favourite line, ""Somebody get me a bloody Fanta!"", definitely the funniest drink he could ask for at the time."
The Thick of It,The radio episode is IMO one of the best of the series.
The Thick of It,"Shout out to Rebecca Front. Rarely gets the big showy punchlines, but she's been doing a huge amount of heavy lifting in British scripted comedy for decades now. Her capacity to sell anything - from this kind of faintly dented hapless underachievement right up to the most bonkers batshit nonsense Chris Morris has to conjure - with texture and conviction is unparalleled.

You could plug any character she plays right into real life seamlessly, no matter how mad."
The Thick of It,That show got me through a dark time in my life. Love Peter capaldi and the venom in his lines
The Thick of It,We need someone dressed as a pork chop to hound Truss into doing this.
The Thick of It,What’s the bet some pundit will use it when Liz Truss gets the shove?
The Thick of It,Fingers crossed. Nicola at least had a certain pathos to her
The Thick of It,"""I just wanted to say to you by the way of introductory remarks that I'm extremely miffed about today's events and in my quest to try to make you understand the level of my unhappiness, I'm likely to use an awful lot of what we would call 'violent sexual imagery' and I just wanted to check that neither of you would be terribly offended by that."""
The Thick of It,Same guy made Veep. He needs to create a new show    .
The Thick of It,One of the best shows ever. Shame the movie doesn’t quite have the same magic. I wish they would’ve just kept this show going.  It proved that even with major lineup changes it was still fantastic.
The Thick of It,""" She's not on the FUCKING LIST!!!! """
The Thick of It,Slowly getting it UK comedies. Is this as funny as Peep Show? What about Father Ted?
The Thick of It,Loved that show from the thick of it thru in the loop right on to veep. V underrated.
The Thick of It,Nothing will over top the opening scene of the show for me.
The Thick of It,The “I thought I could be Prime Minister” and the staff woman’s incredulous look when responding “You Could?” reminds me of Liz Truss.
The Thick of It,"Nicola Murray was actually likeable and smart, they didn’t predict it exactly."
The Thick of It,"This show is top 10 of all time, not just for UK shows. Entirely shits on Veep, too."
The Thick of It,"I can’t get enough of Malcolm Tucker & the rest of the gang, so I usually re-watch all 4 series, plus the 3 specials & the movie ‘In the Loop’, once a year."
The Thick of It,"This has inspired me to start another rewatch.

Fuckity bye."
The Thick of It,"In the Loop is my go-to ""I need to kill an hour or two but don't know what movie to watch""."
The Thick of It,I really like the first series until I found out one of the stars is a pedophile.
The Thick of It,"I lost it when Malcolm brought flowers to the guy in hospital with the line ""benefit of living close to a black spot"".  Just fucking dark and perfect."

The Thick of It,"Phil and Glenn bonding over who they think the Stig was when everything is turning to chaos around them is one of my favourite bits of that episode, just because it's such a minor thing to be happening but also just so apt for the characters."
The Thick of It,"It's a dark suit and it's only lukewarm, I still win!"
The Thick of It,Best ep for sure
The Thick of It,Greatest episode of uk comedy ever.
The Thick of It,She was also great knowing me knowing you with Alan Partridge
The Thick of It,"I preferred Chris Langham as Hugh Abbot. He was just as funny as Tucker.

But Rebecca Front was a serviceable replacement"
The Thick of It,"The amazing thing about Truss is that I thought Front nailed the ""frumpy mum politician no one likes"" and that no one could top it...

...then, suddenly: Liz Truss."
The Thick of It,"Ha! I posted the clip after reading this ABC article. 

[UK leader Liz Truss goes from triumph to trouble in 6 weeks.](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/uk-leader-liz-truss-triumph-trouble-weeks-91585454)"

Some Tory version of Malcolm's probably saying it to her as we speak."
The Thick of It,He did; Avenue 5 with Hugh Laurie.
The Thick of It,Watch Death of Stalin if you haven't.
The Thick of It,"One of the writers also went on to create Succession, and it shows in the best way."
The Thick of It,"It's very different to both but yes, it's one of the best political satires ever and very funny. The only problem is that reality has overtaken it and the satirical situations that are shown seem only too real and no longer over the top.

&#x200B;

If you like this also watch Brass Eye and The Day Today for earlier satires that Armando Iannucci was involved in, and Veep for a more recent US satire."
The Thick of It,"> UK comedies

> What about Father Ted?

Careful now."
The Thick of It,"I think the top of British comedy are Peep Show, Inbetweeners and the Alan Partridge canon.

Partridge might be one of the greatest comedic characters ever conceived."
The Thick of It,Funnier than both by a mile
The Thick of It,"If you like veep you'll like this.

If you didn't like veep then probably not."
The Thick of It,Probably one of the funniest shows ever. I’ve rewatched it a dozen times over the years.
The Thick of It,The first three seasons were utterly brilliant but that scene is from one of the OK later seasons.
The Thick of It,"Wasn’t that partially the point? That they were a good-enough person at what they did, but were not qualified enough to be above the station they started off in, as they ultimately ended up being?"
The Thick of It,Kind of a shame that the last season they went all in on making her look like a moron and Malcolm hating her when they actually had an interesting relationship in season 3.
The Thick of It,Get into Veep
The Thick of It,"Waitwaitwaitwaitwait

There are 3 specials?!?!?!

I’ve watched that series three times. I had no idea. Before I head to google, any specific info I need to know to find them?"
The Thick of It,This is the way
The Thick of It,MAYBE YOU CAN DOWNLOAD *RICE*!!!
The Thick of It,"Yeah that was a huge bummer. However, whether I watch the series or not doesn’t change what happened, and the creators of the show had nothing to do with it, so I still watch it."
The Thick of It,Wait who?
The Thick of It,"That's under dispute. He claims he was researching for the role of a paedo. It was true that he was going to be playing a paedophile.  Whether his alibi is true, I don't know."

The Thick of It,Strife imitating art.

The Thick of It,"He needs to create a new, new show."
The Thick of It,"David Copperfield was also very good, if tonally different to The Thick of It, In The Loop and Death of Stalin."
The Thick of It,I didn't know that!
The Thick of It,A lot drier than peep show or father ted. I know people who think it’s boring. They are idiots but still.
The Thick of It,"> The only problem is that reality has overtaken it and the satirical situations that are shown seem only too real and no longer over the top.

It's got to the point where real life is almost mirroring the show.

The Thick of It,"> I think the top of British comedy are Peep Show, **Inbetweeners** and the Alan Partridge canon.

One of these things is not like the other. Replace the bolded with a show that's actually funny, please."
The Thick of It,I've been watching Veep but so far (midway through S2) it just feels like there's a Malcolm Tucker sized hole in it.
The Thick of It,Yeaaa Veep and Death of Stalin are his best works... i havent seen David Copperfield
The Thick of It,"The 3 specials were released in 2007, between series 2 & series 3. 
‘The Rise of the Nutters’ & ‘Spinners and Losers’ are hour-long episodes, ‘Opposition Extra’ is about 14 minutes long.  

They might be on BritBox or BBC iPlayer, but not sure."
The Thick of It,"Don’t get me wrong, I still like the show, but I thought he was best character up to that point."
The Thick of It,… doesn’t seem to be under *that* heavy dispute
The Thick of It,Amazing. Loved Veep but it doesn't come close.
The Thick of It,"Yeah, that's why Ianucci stopped writing it and killed the show off."
The Thick of It,Don't forget the Spare Room Tax!
The Thick of It,InBetweeners is very good but not great imo.
The Thick of It,Fresh Meat gets me everytime as my #3.
The Thick of It,"It gets better, series 3 onwards is just an upward spike in quality."
The Thick of It,Americans can't swear. They can't be casual about it.
The Thick of It,Holy shit. You’ve made my day. Thanks!
The Thick of It,I loved the Specials. I think hands down my favourite scences has to be all the scenes in Peter Mannions bathroom.
The Thick of It,"I liked him a lot too. I finished watching the series for the second time and wondered why I never saw him in anything else, so I went to google. Huge disappointment."
The Thick of It,I can't imagine another season of this show still being good
The Thick of It,Yeah - it's just the way things are mirroring real life again now that is starting to get.... interesting!
The Thick of It,Good call
The Thick of It,"True, but there's an equal downwards trend in quality towards the end of the show IMO.  Still a fantastic watch."
The Thick of It,Honestly you are in for a treat. The Nutter specials are some of the best of the entire show!
The Thick of It,My pleasure.
The Thick of It,"Succession is basically a spiritual successor of Thick of it and Veep, in my mind."
The Thick of It,"I'm loving these snippets of The Thick of It being posted on this sub almost on the daily. What was once almost a farce is now an insight into the depravity of the government and how it runs things in real life, amazing."

The Thick of It,"Thanks. He was in Night Manager, really good miniseries"
Horrible Histories,"Disagree - it's of course not the most educational thing *ever*, but the whole point is to focus on gross stuff in history that they don't teach in school. So I think it's a good way for younger kids to get into some other historical stuff.

The actual educational value problem is some of the stuff is just incorrect. For instance they talk about the ""black spot"" pirate code thing, which apparently has zero historical basis and is only featured in Treasure Island and nowhere else. They also treat Richard III like he definitely didn't do anything wrong, which is wrong - the fact is while Tudor propaganda did malign him quite a bit, we have no idea if he's totally innocent or not.  And there's of course some stuff that's wrong just because the show is 10 years old and that happens. 

I haven't gotten to the new troupe episodes yet, but everyone seems to hate them, so I won't disagree with you on that point.

The Historical MasterChef sketches are my favorite underrated ones - I love the skewering of reality shows than the history stuff. 

I think if I was a teacher, this show would be something I'd play at the end of the school week if the kids had been productive and well-behaved. It's fun and like we both said, not the MOST educational thing, but it does have some interesting historical information in it!"
Horrible Histories,They’re funny cos they’re true!
Horrible Histories,Hope next time it's not you
Horrible Histories,"This is how you make good children's television. Honestly funny, and  teaching kids that being smart and actually knowing things can be fun. 

My own kids started getting more interested in the history of places we'd visit on vacation after getting into this show. Especially the weird stories are great fun.

Protip for European parents (or other parents taking their kids on a European vacation): Get them relevant Asterix comics when going on a trip. Funny, smart, and enriches the experience for my kids just as much as it did for me when I was their age. Makes visiting Rome (or any other place the characters visit in the stories) just a bit more magical."
Horrible Histories,I love this song and I've finally found the sing along version!﻿
Horrible Histories,Brilliant. Great kids tv.
Horrible Histories,"Oh, this show is for kids? I was wondering why there wasn't a section on corruption."
Horrible Histories,"Yep, it airs in the afternoons on CBBC, a children's TV channel.

They have more adult jokes in their other show for Sky1, Yonderland."
Horrible Histories,'Your friends are about to find out that NOBODY closes down the woolworths'. 
Horrible Histories,"I liked the first series but feel that the second has stepped up a gear and made it really excellent. Exploring the flashbacks of the ghosts and hitting the emotional beats has worked really well for the show and I hope the BBC know what a great show they've got and bring it back for a third run.

&#x200B;

(The dozens of joke about Fanny in the first ep of series 2 had us giggling like school girls, infantile but wonderful)"
Horrible Histories,"I just finished watching season 2,it's great!"
Horrible Histories,"I think part of the reason Ghosts is so good is because it's so chill. It's not too deep or edgy, it's just a bunch of dead people doing stupid stuff, with a nice bit of character development on the side. It's on the same sort of wavelength as What We Do In The Shadows. Both are very easy to watch and make for a lovely bit of comfort-watching. At least in my opinion. I'm glad it's starting to gain the attention it deserves."
Horrible Histories,DAMN YOUR EYES!
Horrible Histories,Genuinely love every character in this.
Horrible Histories,"Try and watch Yonderland if you can, same group but it's a fantasy show with humans and puppets, think of it as a sitcom version of Labirynth."
Horrible Histories,When I first saw the trailer I thought it'd be a laugh but wasn't expecting how good it was really going to be so I can't wait for season 3!
Horrible Histories,"It’s so good. I binged the first series last year in the first few sleepless weeks after having my second child, and it was so funny and wholesome and heart warming. My favourite ghost changes all the time, but I’m especially fond of the plague crew and the poet. Definitely recommend it to anyone who needs a bit of a lift."
Horrible Histories,"Watched the first episode, and it is a clever premise.  

Interestingly, the writers chose not to have the older ghosts have opinions on modern society, which is fine.  Not everything needs to be edgy.

There could have been some humor with an Archie Bunker type ghost character.  Like I said, I've only watched S1 E1."
Horrible Histories,Thanks for that! I've now seen the first  episodes. Truly awesome - especially the scene with the doctor.
Horrible Histories,"That's so funny, I was just mentioning in the main watch thread how much I enjoyed this show. It's really good, the writing is definitely it's biggest asset."
Horrible Histories,Where can we stream it in US?
Horrible Histories,It's fun.
Horrible Histories,Watched the first episode and don't think I laughed once. Maybe I'm missing something.
Horrible Histories,It's a shame they are only making 6 episodes a series. They could easily make more.
Horrible Histories,"ONLY SIX episodes does NOT a series make!!  
It's a scam a lazy actor is pulling on viewers!!  
I look at series length before I ever watch the first episodes.  
I don't watch any show shorter than 10 episodes."
Horrible Histories,They've been confirmed for a third season and a Christmas special (that's already been filmed) so we're definitely getting some more Ghosts!
Horrible Histories,‘I don’t think I’ll ever get sucked off ‘ had me laughing hard
Horrible Histories,Spot on. Series 2 actually delves into the ghosts' stories and its so much funnier!
Horrible Histories,"This. With a lack of things to watch I found season 1 amusing enough to fill the void, but season 2 has improved so significantly I managed to binge it in barely more than a day."
Horrible Histories,https://youtu.be/WNxy7uNEAzE?t=22
Horrible Histories,"Yonderland was good fun. ""Which is nice."""
Horrible Histories,A fun game is to identify which of the main cast do double duty as plague victims.
Horrible Histories,">Interestingly, the writers chose not to have the older ghosts have opinions on modern society, which is fine. Not everything needs to be edgy.

They do on later episodes. In s2 there's a whole episode of the Victorian lady reacting to a gay wedding, but they play it mosty for laughs ofc"
Horrible Histories,[deleted]
Horrible Histories,[deleted]
Horrible Histories,British shows are usually 6 episodes long and tbh sometimes it's a good thing cause they don't stretch the stories or add filler episodes.
Horrible Histories,12 episodes released so watch both series. You'd struggle to find a British sitcom with more than 6 episodes per series.
Horrible Histories,.... did you drop an /s?
Horrible Histories,Especially as they’re so covered in muck and pustules that they’re virtually unrecognisable!
Horrible Histories,I like that when they do comment on modern society it's usually focusing on something ridiculous like having knees on show.
Horrible Histories,It's hardly my first bbc series and i'm not sue why I'm being downvoted for wanting more episodes. It's a premise that could easily run longer.
Horrible Histories,"Yes, successful British shows aren't as profitable as American shows due to the obvious population difference."
Horrible Histories,Yeah I know. I can still want more can't I?
Horrible Histories,[deleted]
Horrible Histories,Profit isn’t really comparable as things like syndication aren’t really a thing here. The way TV programmes make money is fairly different.
Horrible Histories,Nothing wrong with it. I mean we always think our fave series are too short. But it would be lesser quality I’d think.
Horrible Histories,"But we've had shows like fresh meat, green wing and red dwarf last 8 episodes a series. I know the trope but there are plenty of comedy shows that have longer series."
Horrible Histories,Pretty much every series of Red Dwarf has been 6 episodes tbf
Horrible Histories,Yeah except the two that had 8 episodes. So it is possible and that's all I'm saying.
Horrible Histories,"No, the story is actually quite tight and consistent. No one talked about it until this year is because it was on Epix."
Horrible Histories,"Pennyworth? Do you mean Pennyworth: The Origins of Batman's Butler?

/s"
Horrible Histories,"I've been watching since it first started its so damn brutal. I love all the characters but Bet is the best. 

She's so off the wall hilarious."
Horrible Histories,"It's absolutely *delightful*. Every bit as bugfuck insane as its sibling show, Gotham, but with tighter storytelling and characterization (by which I mean, characters introduced with a great deal of fanfare are, for the most part, *not* just forgotten about in approximately two eps' time). I genuinely don't know how that lunatic Bruno Heller convinced DC to give him his own little corner of their sandbox to play in, and for their part they seem to have forgotten ever having done so, but I hope they never remember to take it away.

Also - and, again, like Gotham - this show looks just *fabulous*, this really terrific hyperstylized Swinging-London-by-way-of-the-Burton-Batfilms aesthetic. Heller knows what he likes, and what he likes is flocked wallpaper and plenty of it."
Horrible Histories,The British Gotham as I like to call it.
Horrible Histories,i think you may be discovering it now because it's an hbo max show now as the first 2 seasons were on epix but i haven't watch season 3 yet but  the shows pretty good in my opinion and i love it
Horrible Histories,"Why aren't people talking about it, seriously? It's a show about Batman's fucking *butler* ffs. I'm sure not many people would be keen to watch a show about young Aunt May or Pa Kent either. 

It's the same answer as for when people used to ask why Andor didn't have as much hype as other Star War's properties. Like, it's a show about a character who already died in a one off side story movie that barely anybody watched compared to the other major Star Wars movies (although imo it was a great movie, haven't seen it since but was a super enjoyable experience in the theater). 

It doesn't matter how good these series may be, when you iterate upon an established IP, the premise is everything. And certain premises just aren't gonna attract as many viewers, initially."
Horrible Histories,"Yep, I feel the same way. I'm not one to post online, but I've been watching it from the beginning and have often wondered why no one was talking about it. Glad you found it and enjoy."
Horrible Histories,I've been wondering the same thing.
Horrible Histories,"I think it’s one of the few DC shows to watch tbh.

The cockney accents and  Paloma Faith probably sway me one way."
Horrible Histories,i’m looking forward to the spin-off: Pennyworth v Pennywise
Horrible Histories,"I watched a bit of the 1st season on epix, then the channel went away on the provider I had then. Started seeing ads that it was on HBOMax now and finally getting caught up. Almost complete with s2."
Horrible Histories,"I may have to give it a chance, since I'm terribly bored with tv now that Andor is over. Main guy looks a bit like an oik but hey, that ain't gonna be enough to avoid it"
Horrible Histories,"I was like ""jesus, another WB Batman cash-grab"" but it's actually not a Batman show, it's a *V for Vendetta* show. It's like this whole mod-fascism thing. Actually not bad."
Horrible Histories,It's not talked about more because season 2 sucked all the life out of the show.
Horrible Histories,"Because it's a fucking stupid origin story about batman's Butler. What a blatant, bottom of the barrel cash grab. Enjoy."
Horrible Histories,Cobra Kai is a good show? I think the acting is Horrible.
Horrible Histories,"For a network that was pretty low in the food chain, Epix had some really well produced shows. Condor is another one of those hidden gems."
Horrible Histories,"At the end it kinda threatens to introduce more goofy comic booky shit in, but pleased to say that in S2 there isn't much of that and it's still very grounded in reality."
Horrible Histories,ME TOO. Just binging my ass off. OMG
Horrible Histories,"I know Alfred is the primary protagonist but it is Martha Kane and Thomas Wayne’s relationship that I am watching for. 

>!I just finished season 2. I know that the show is called pennyworth but it is Emma Paetz and Ben Aldridge scenes that is having me watching each episode.!<

>!I do wish their romance was not that rushed and the writers allow chemistry or chase to build up over times,  but it is understandable that due to the unknown of whether or not they get the green light for another season, they need to cram it in.!<

>!Ps. Martha Kane on top and Thomas Wayne on bottom , 😄 it must be a Wayne guy thing as Batman also falls for a feisty Catwoman.!<"
Horrible Histories,"Yep, the cringiest title change in the history of TV."
Horrible Histories,"Hey, it's also the origin of V"
Horrible Histories,I am so into it
Horrible Histories,"""Steady on!"""
Horrible Histories,Like how people slept on Cobra Kai cause it was on YouTube Red I wanna say? A lot of amazing shows on garbage platforms.
Horrible Histories,I'm not watching it on principle...all the Superheroes DC has and they make a show about Batman's butler...pass.
Horrible Histories,crack it open and be amazed you haven't before now.  come back here and let me know what you think.  this is not a middle schoolers dc show.
Horrible Histories,Season 3 was great.
Horrible Histories,"It's a *hilarious* subtitle. It's absolutely representative of the show's overall, brassy, tongue-in-cheek ethos: *That's right, we made an entire fucking show about the origin of Batman's butler. What are* you *gonna do about it?*"
Horrible Histories,"To be fair, I watched the first episode or two on Epix when they aired and had no idea that Alfie would grow up to be Bruce Wayne's butler Alfred.  

Anyhow, for anybody loving this show, please come join us at /r/Pennyworth -- it got shuttered during COVID but is now back up and running, albeit with very few subscribers so far."
Horrible Histories,So I'm assuming they did that to try and get more viewers?  I didn't even know the show existed until a random Reddit comment.
Horrible Histories,"Yea, it's not horrible."
Horrible Histories,"u/AmeliaMangan u/DMPunk How do you think it works as a prequel series to both *Gotham* and *V for Vendetta*, out of curiosity?"
Horrible Histories,"> A lot of amazing shows on garbage platforms

This happened with *Sorry for Your Loss*, which was wonderful but which also had the drawback of airing on the Facebook TV platform (not even clear to me that this exists anymore). If it had been on a ""real"" channel or platform it would probably have been a great success."
Horrible Histories,cobra kai is a good example because i knew about it before netflix getting the rights but it's true a lot of good shows are on the lesser known platforms and another example i just thought of is you because i was watching that on lifetime before netflix bought the rights
Horrible Histories,"That seems like a bad reason to not watch something.

Other superheroes would require a higher budget, and be more of brand risk if they failed. They would only be given to major networks.

Either way, it's not the fault of the Pennyworth people. Reddit is always complaining about how comic IPs don't take enough risks with less marketable characters, that shouldn't be punished."
Horrible Histories,"I was waiting for it to finish before starting up on it, so will probably start today.  Glad to hear it's an improvement, season two was a chore to get through."
Horrible Histories,"As a prequel to Gotham, it's perfect. As anything to do with V For Vendetta, it's nonsense, and not the good, Gotham kind of nonsense. (I was actually relieved to find out that >!the figure sporting V's attire was actually just some poseur artist who very clearly is not that character!< \- I'm not a fan of DC's continued use of Moore's work against his wishes, so I was quite glad that the use of the mask here amounted to nothing more than a shout-out.)"
Horrible Histories,"> That seems like a bad reason to not watch something.
> 
> 

Good thing I don't care what you think is a good or bad reason. You can watch the adventures of Batman's butler till your heart's content. I'll wait till they actually realize their are other superheroes in the DCU that deserve treatment and a show.

And if you think milking the Batman franchise is taking a risk that's laughable."
Horrible Histories,"I was thinking that was the case, given it was described as a prequel rather than a straight-up adaptation."
Horrible Histories,the santa episode. send the train. just send the train.
Horrible Histories,"Episode 2 is one of the funniest things I've ever seen. The scene where they are in the ""situation room"" trying to figure out what Josh should text the woman he just met.

Michael Hogan is brilliant in that scene. His line delivery was perfect. ""JOSH FROM THE TRAIB??!! What the hell is a traib? She's gonna think we're crazy!"""
Horrible Histories,"I love this show. I’ve seen it all the way through a few times and will just randomly watch the scene where Josh is trying to figure out what to text the woman he met on the train. It elevates my mood every time. Creative, relatable and hilarious."
Horrible Histories,"I like that Man Seeking Woman is only 30 episodes. They didn't over-extend the premise, and the final season manages to subvert expectations in the best way. One of the best comedy shows of the last decade."
Horrible Histories,"I loved this show.

The Hulu series *Dollface* has a similar vibe, but from a female perspective. If you’re looking for something else to scratch that itch, I recommend it.

The first season was good and the second season just came out."
Horrible Histories,All hail Trackanon!
Horrible Histories,"i found the hitler scene. This is actually such a funny idea.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=126lOg2Jkuc&ab\_channel=JaneySprings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=126lOg2Jkuc&ab_channel=JaneySprings)"
Horrible Histories,"Great show, was really disappointed when it ended.

Takes place in Chicago though, not NY. At least in the first season they regularly mention Chicago streets/neighborhoods and portray the trainstop I live near. It's mainly filmed in Toronto however, as a Chicago native I can tell the difference."
Horrible Histories,The painting scene in season 3 is the hardest I've ever laughed at anything.
Horrible Histories,"The scene where Eric Andre is getting yelled at by his gf and ninja dusts her in the face to run away is top 5 hardest I have ever laughed at a show. 

I tried to find the scene on YouTube but couldn’t!"
Jamie: Private School Girl,"Nope...did that about five weeks ago. In another three days, the final episode airs abroad, and hence, I shall be watching it."
Jamie: Private School Girl,"It was okay. Im a big fan of his work, especially Summer Heights High, but Chris Lilley is at his best when he plays multiple roles in one show."
Jamie: Private School Girl,"Summer Heights High is amazing and Ja'mie is easily my favorite character.  That said, I tried watching the first episode of the new show and couldn't' finish.  Thought it was awful."
Jamie: Private School Girl,I never saw Summer Heights High but I did watch Angry Boys and thought that was hilarious. After one episode so far I don't think Ja'mie is all that funny
Jamie: Private School Girl,I've watched the first 5 episodes a few days ago. What day of the week does it come out in Australia? Very funny show.
Jamie: Private School Girl,"Would have preferred 'Island Boy: The Jonah Takalua Story or Sum Shit.'

Edit: Spelling."
Jamie: Private School Girl,Glad to have more Chris Lilley. would have preferred Jonah but may be a little hard with how his story ended.
Jamie: Private School Girl,"Ecstasy! Ecstasy! E - E -E -E Ecstasy.

Mr. G was my favorite. But all his characters were great.

FYI, Reddit: If you haven't seen the series, Summer Heights High is fucking hilarious. I repeat: Fucking brilliantly hilarious."
Jamie: Private School Girl,"Nice, though I would have preferred a little ""Puck you miss!"""
Jamie: Private School Girl,"Hrm. This seems like a pretty safe choice (she's already been in two shows) and a change after Angry Boys (which was kind of disappointing, IMO). But I can't say I'm super excited about it.

I want more Mr G."
Jamie: Private School Girl,She was the worst of the three in Summer Heights High...That said she was an A+ character because that show is fucking brilliant! Can't wait
Jamie: Private School Girl,"Not the character I would've liked him to reprise, but still definitely something I'll be watching."
Jamie: Private School Girl,I'm just so glad Chris Lilley is bringing back characters from Summer Heights High. I LOVE all three characters but don't know if I'll be able to take a whole series based around Ja'mie. still excited to see it though!
Jamie: Private School Girl,"Not thrilled about him returning to Ja'mie, especially considering it seems like it's mostly focused on her, but I'll still watch"
Jamie: Private School Girl,what's the song in the trailer!? 
Jamie: Private School Girl,"Brilliant. Ja'mie is hilarious. ""Povo""

 Then S.Mouse or Gran would've been just as good."
Jamie: Private School Girl,this guy is pretty awful. most of his stuff is fairly consistently unfunny and racist. 
Jamie: Private School Girl,Who is Chris Lilley? Who is Jamie king? What the fuck is summer heights? What the fuck is private school girl?
Jamie: Private School Girl,He's saving that for another day GUARANTEED 
Jamie: Private School Girl,I would have preferred S.mouse. [never forget](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uL8R8k7q4_Q)
Jamie: Private School Girl,"gee, its funny but not as funny as this guy is making out"
Jamie: Private School Girl,"Mr. g!

""I have done lord knows how many shows over the years. I tend to do the more modern or cutting-edge productions, and I write my own stuff, original musicals. I’ve had a fair bit of critical acclaim for that, and this is the show I did last year, Tsunamarama, which was about the tsunami tragedy, set to the music of Bananarama."""
Jamie: Private School Girl,I found Angry Boys transcended comedy into that glorious poignantly-sad zone.
Jamie: Private School Girl,"Yea my least favorite. He does like dressing up as a girl...

I don't think I'll be watching this, even though I'm a big fan. Hate the female characters, besides the Chinese lady in angry boys "
Jamie: Private School Girl,Ah Yeah - Will Sparks
Jamie: Private School Girl,Sweet novelty account bro 
Jamie: Private School Girl,"Nope and nope, please don't try again"
Jamie: Private School Girl,"Um, actually it's pronounced Ja'mie."
Jamie: Private School Girl,Google is your friend.
Jamie: Private School Girl,"Hey Gufgufguf,  are you from Australia? Lilley is a comedic actor. Ja'mie King is one of his alter egos, a young teenage girl with first world problems. Watch 'Summer Heights High' to get a grip on the madness that is Chris Lilley."
Jamie: Private School Girl,"If you live in the states and have HBO, Summer Heights High is on HBO go. It was a very funny show."
Jamie: Private School Girl,"""Get yo dick off my shoulder, get yo dick off my shoulder. Put it away. Put it away."" 

I still sing that to myself"
Jamie: Private School Girl,[And now as dubstep.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtZ-binlXuk)
Jamie: Private School Girl,"No, it's really that funny.

At least, if you have a weird sense of humor like me. YMMV."
Jamie: Private School Girl,"Oh thank god you're here, Grandma's been raped"
Jamie: Private School Girl,The mum was actually meant to be japanese.
Jamie: Private School Girl,That was actually pretty good.
Jamie: Private School Girl,no its really not
Jamie: Private School Girl,Well I'm a dickhead. Been awhile since I watched it
Jamie: Private School Girl,"Just go on with your life, you're not making any headway here "
Jamie: Private School Girl,I don't comment expecting to gain headway
Jamie: Private School Girl,It is genuinely very funny but it can be difficult to watch sometime because Ja'mie is kinda repulsive as a character.
Jamie: Private School Girl,"I went into this show not expecting too much. I love all of Chris Lilley's other shows to death, but a large part of that love was the balance that he struck between characters. If there was one whose storyline you didn't like so much that week, another was likely hilarious. I was worried not only about the fact that this show only focused on one main character, but also that that character was Ja'mie. She's funny but I didn't know how it/she could hold up.  

Four episodes in, and I am absolutely loving it. Still not as much as Lilley's other works, but decently close to. It has been one of my favorite things on this year"
Jamie: Private School Girl,At least episode 4 was a nice change up to the first 3 in terms of how other people started treating her character
Jamie: Private School Girl,FYI: /r/ChrisLilley 
Jamie: Private School Girl,"My favourite Ja'mie line: Seriously, Bec. Quantas is doing some seriously good deals on tickets to China. Why don't you buy one?"
Jamie: Private School Girl,Ja'mie gets a new show?! That's so random!
Jamie: Private School Girl,"Many of you outside of Australia probably don't know this, but 'Summer Heights High' is actually a spin off/follow-up of 'We can be heroes'. It features Ja'mie as well as other original characters. This show has a huge place in my heart as my Uncle directed it and I love bragging about him.

Here is the introduction to Ja'mie in We Can Be Heroes. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVQr1JHRvBU

Also the Mr. G drama teacher character was created by Chris Lilley before We Can Be Heroes in the Sketch Show, The Big Bite. Heres a clip: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye--Z7owZyk . The Big Bite has the greatest Chris Lilley character... Extreme Darren!  Check him out! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xWGcac8qJQ

Jamie: Private School Girl,It would've been better if it was about Jonah Takalua.
Jamie: Private School Girl,And her parents are South African?
Jamie: Private School Girl,"Use to live in the same building as chris in st kilda. Was a bit weird in person but I guess you'd get that when your show is blowing up and everyone is quoting everything from the show, wanting privacy and what not. Would always see him with a hat and sunglasses, no pictures/autograph style, still say hi to him and not get much back. Love his shows though. /random bit of info"
Jamie: Private School Girl,"I fucking love Ja'mie. 

She's the best character ever.

How could I forget Jen Okazaki?!? Of angry boys. 

When tim gets a girlfriend and Jen is in her red sportscar and she calls Tims girlfriend a slut and spits on her from above. Amazing. 


"
Jamie: Private School Girl,"I try telling people I know about Lilley's shows all the time. He's extremely talented. I'm so glad I discovered him after Summer Heights aired on HBO I think? I'd never heard of him before that in the U.S. Recently watched Angry Boys and found it pretty funny as well. I am going to check out the older ""We Can Be Heroes"" soon too. 
"
Jamie: Private School Girl,"Yesss ! so glad he's coming back with something. so strange, I just showed my roommate the first episode of summer heights high ! Although, Ja'mie is like my least favorite character lol. "
Jamie: Private School Girl,"I am really looking forward to it. However, i am curious to see how they address the fact that Jamie has only aged 1 year since 2007, or if they mention Summer Heights High at all."
Jamie: Private School Girl,"FINALLY some love for Chris Lilley on reddit- everyone, *please* watch this show, Chris Lilley's work gives you SO much to talk about!"
Jamie: Private School Girl,Oh build a bridge and get over it you guys
Jamie: Private School Girl,It's way less povvo than I thought it would be.
Jamie: Private School Girl,"Chris Lilley is absolutely hilarious, can't wait for this"
Jamie: Private School Girl,"Just cause I'm rich, doesn't mean I'm a bitch."
Jamie: Private School Girl,"So...I really enjoyed Angry Boys but never watched Summer Heights High. This new show looks hilarious, is it worth it to invest the time in SHH first? Or do you think I would enjoy this one on its own?"
Jamie: Private School Girl,Very Happy about this...But I would have preferred a focus on Jonah!
Jamie: Private School Girl,"Angry boys was the best show on hbo. What happened to it? 

With that said this looks funny as shit"
Jamie: Private School Girl,When will this air in the UK? I'm so excited!
Jamie: Private School Girl,Is this going to air on HBO?
Jamie: Private School Girl,"WTF is this?

Looks like the girl form Hemlock Grove."
Jamie: Private School Girl,"I am incredibly impressed with how perfectly he portrays an Australian high school girl as well as Australians high school in general. You'd think he had just finished high school himself, Ja'mie's mannerisms and the slang he uses is so well written and I am really amazed that he managed to pull it off so well."
Jamie: Private School Girl,"Haha, realized in two seconds it was satire. Is this Australian or British?"
Jamie: Private School Girl,"Eh, was this supposed to be funny or edgy? I wasn't really either."
Jamie: Private School Girl,"this show should be called ""chick with a cock and balls"""
Jamie: Private School Girl,"Sounds like the title of a budget porn movie
"
Jamie: Private School Girl,The last episode of We Can Be Heroes made me cry. Congrats to your uncle. 
Jamie: Private School Girl,Are any of his previous characters going to be in this one aside from Ja'mie?
Jamie: Private School Girl,How big is Chris Lilley in Australia?
Jamie: Private School Girl,"Thanks, 

American looking for this. (Now to see if it's my type of thing)"
Jamie: Private School Girl,[I never touch his dick!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEyObspv4nc)
Jamie: Private School Girl,"It is upsetting how tragic the story ends for him. Like Mr. G gets what he wants (kind of) and Ja'mie just goes back to being a ""private school girl."" But Jonah's story is so sad. His homlife doesn't look good, he has been expelled from another school, and he still can't read well.

Poor guy. I am still not sure if his father really did touch him and he is just so afraid that he confessed to it being a ruse. Would explain his acting out."
Jamie: Private School Girl,"Yeah, considering this is Jamie's third show and Mr g and Jonah have only been in one."
Jamie: Private School Girl,I disagree. I think Jonah's story was wrapped up quite well.
Jamie: Private School Girl,"Sorry Ben, Motherfuka *punchs the fucking ginger kid"
Jamie: Private School Girl,He was rumored to be in this actually. Maybe it'll just be a cameo though. 
Jamie: Private School Girl,Even better if it was about Daniel and Nathan. A show based around those guys would be brilliant. They had all the best laughs in We Can be Heroes and most of the good laughs in Angry Boys.
Jamie: Private School Girl,[deleted]
Jamie: Private School Girl,She are everyfing ~~wat a mens~~ a father kan like to want in a girl.
Jamie: Private School Girl,They were in the previous Lilley shows she was in.
Jamie: Private School Girl,That sucks he won't take time for pictures. Kind of upsets me.
Jamie: Private School Girl,"I was surprised when one of my college friends a year or two back said that EVERYBODY in his HS watched and quoted Summer Heights High when it first came out (2007). Made me jealous that my high school wasn't like that.

Have fun with We Can Be Heroes! Very very solid"
Jamie: Private School Girl,I first saw Summer Heights High too. I haven't really liked his other shows as much as that one. I hope this one is as good as SHH. 
Jamie: Private School Girl,You're such an Asian try-hard.
Jamie: Private School Girl,"I don't think they'll address it? It's a 30-something year-old man playing the role so it's not really necessary to mention (s)he looks older. Plus, it looks like her original group of friends from We Can Be Heroes (2005) won't be in this since they were played by actresses of roughly the correct age. So basically, ignore continuity somewhat :P"
Jamie: Private School Girl,And here i thought this was a show about a transsexual girl...
Jamie: Private School Girl,FYI: /r/ChrisLilley
Jamie: Private School Girl,Finally? I've seen numerous mentions of him on here.
Jamie: Private School Girl,"Yes!

Most people think *SHH* is the better show."
Jamie: Private School Girl,Would love to borrow your deerstalker and magnifying glass sometime.
Jamie: Private School Girl,"Australian, from the same guy who brought you Summer Heights High."
Jamie: Private School Girl,"It's insightful humor, give it a go, you won't regret it. "
Jamie: Private School Girl,"he is quite shy so he doesnt appear out of character much, well ever.. so alot of people dont really know the man behind the character. his characters are very popular though."
Jamie: Private School Girl,Tell them what you do to me!
Jamie: Private School Girl,that's the best idea he can come up with to get out of class
Fawlty Towers,Does Cleese need to pay for another divorce?
Fawlty Towers,Sounds like John needs money.
Fawlty Towers,"You know when would have been a great time to make more Fawlty Towers?  Right after they stopped making Fawlty Towers.

So re: this particular project, I think the trick this time would be not to have him be the manager (as he would have gone out of business ages ago), but a permanent guest who has to be on his best behaviour or he gets thrown out on the street.  Have  one of Manuel's kids running the place, so the only reason Basil gets to stay in the first place is as a favour to dear old dad."
Fawlty Towers,I'm sure it'll be as funny as all of Cleese's other projects of the past decade
Fawlty Towers,"If Cleese on Twitter is anything to go by, this'll be 6 episodes of Basil Fawlty complaining about how everything is too politically correct now"
Fawlty Towers,"A lot of times these things don't work. What is Cleese like 80? He is a genius, but old age gets us all in the end.

The saddest thing I ever saw was the elderly Laugh-In cast at the Emmys trying to do their old routine where they opened up small doors in a groovy wall and spouted one-liners. Went over like a lead balloon.

Life with Lucy was an attempt for a very old Lucielle Ball to have one more sitcom. Sad.

Sometimes you have to have the grace to know when to leave the stage."
Fawlty Towers,"You know studios have gotten so risk averse in their appetite for new writing or production when we're rebooting Fawlty Towers. Fuck me, I like the original, but it died and was buried years ago. Let it rest in peace."
Fawlty Towers,"In other news, duck's off."
Fawlty Towers,"I'm going to bet there will be an episode with Cleese ranting endlessly about cancel culture, since that's all he seems to do now."
Fawlty Towers,"Dang, can't wait till they bring back *Keeping up Appearances*"
Fawlty Towers,Is this the final boss of unnecessary revivals?
Fawlty Towers,"Hehe, Farty Towels."
Fawlty Towers,Why though
Fawlty Towers,Please god no.
Fawlty Towers,"Boy, he must owe those ex-wives a lot more money than I thought for him to be doing this.

I guess if we had one positive, it might help Americans learn how to pronounce ""basil"" properly."
Fawlty Towers,Never thought I'd see this happen. Honestly don't know what to think about it.
Fawlty Towers,I love Fawlty Towers. This is terrible news.
Fawlty Towers,I dunno guys...
Fawlty Towers,Even the thought of this happening is horrible.
Fawlty Towers,"""You couldn't make Fawlty Towers today!"" cried John from the GB News studio, as he signs the contract to make Fawlty Towers today."
Fawlty Towers,I can’t wait for Basil Fawlty to complain about the woke left /s
Fawlty Towers,"Not gonna lie, never thought this would happen. I hope they don't mess it up cause the original is flawless."
Fawlty Towers,"Fuckin' train wreck waiting to happen. 

Maybe they can cross over with Frasier and Night Court and form the ""over-the-hill guys make sitcom reboots no sane person asked for"" club."
Fawlty Towers,"Well, that wasn't on my bingo cards possibly because it's actually a calendar for August of 1997,

He's welcome to try, but I'm pessimistic.  It's hard to catch lightning in a bottle like that twice, especially given that this time he'll probably use a fanny pack^(\*) or something like that.

^(\*I believe that the British English term is, ""bum bag,"" and the British reaction to the American English term is confusion with slight alarm.)"
Fawlty Towers,Que? I know nothing.
Fawlty Towers,"Leave it alone. Christ, come with an original idea ffs"
Fawlty Towers,"If we're going to get a new project from one of the Pythons, can we just get a new Michael Palin travel documentary instead?"
Fawlty Towers,"Isn't Cleese one of those people that keeps banging on about how you could never do Fawlty Towers now without getting ""cancelled""?"
Fawlty Towers,How many episodes in until one of these characters shoehorns in a reference to cancel culture?
Fawlty Towers,"one of my all-time favorites. absolutely hilarious!!!

<edited>"
Fawlty Towers,"I’m sure it’ll be as funny as SNL! That is to say, not funny at all."
Fawlty Towers,"Camilla Cleese who? Never heard of them, cool that they are somehow starring and writing they must be really good. /s"
Fawlty Towers,Isn’t he a Conservative now?
Fawlty Towers,Well lah dee dah.
Fawlty Towers,This is what multiple expensive divorces reduced him to. Sad.
Fawlty Towers,Oh dear
Fawlty Towers,ugh. Ugh...
Fawlty Towers,Oh basil
Fawlty Towers,Just no.  You cannot remake perfection.  Sybil is everything.
Fawlty Towers,This is a terrible idea
Fawlty Towers,"Dan Stevens as Basil, Jamilla Jamil as Sybil, Emilia Clarke as Polly, and Nick Frost as Manuel."
Fawlty Towers,Awesome to see. I just rewatched all of the episodes last month!
Fawlty Towers,wonder if it will be on netflix...
Fawlty Towers,"Piss off, they won’t pull it off again. Different times now."
Fawlty Towers,"I can see the script now, written between stints on GB News ""Don't mention the woke, I mentioned it once but I think I got away with it alright""

Episode plots will no doubt include Basil's hilarious misunderstanding with a trans couple and lots of bellowing at Gen Z."
Fawlty Towers,"I can't wait for the episode where the Major says something horrifically racist and a blue-haired guest at the hotel has a go at him until John Cleese comes in and smacks them round the head with a tea tray then does a 10 minute monologue directly at the camera about ""freedom of speech"" and ""cancel culture""."
Fawlty Towers,"All these people on Reddit piling in to shit on Cleese… And I bet y’all think of yourselves as individuals and free thinkers. If you don’t find the old man funny, don’t watch. Second thread today I’ve been in where people who supposedly don’t care constantly mention they don’t care as they rip on someone they don’t care about."
Fawlty Towers,Hell yeah!
Fawlty Towers,One of my favorite shows of all time
Fawlty Towers,I used to love that show but I feel like this might be just another opportunity for Cleese to whine about cancel culture. I hope its good but I'm skeptical.
Fawlty Towers,Camilla is a painfully unfunny nepotism baby and her dad is a cranky old asshole now. No thanks.
Fawlty Towers,"Cancel culture has really taken it's toll on Cheese then, eh?"
Fawlty Towers,Hells yeah
Fawlty Towers,This is going to miss the mark so hard it’s going to destroy the legacy of Faulty Towers. The old man just hates minorities now and is likely look for an excuse to bitch.
Fawlty Towers,"Fawlty Towers is top 5 favorite sitcoms of all time for me. It only lasted 12 episodes so it didn't reach any point where they ran out of ideas. That's why it's so beloved.

 I still think John Cleese is hilarious (despite his very boomer mentality on comedy today) but I don't really know how they can replicate the genius of the old show with all these old writers. Basil had great physical comedy that I don't know if 80 year old John Cleese could pull off. If they get a good cast and some fresh writers, I can see it working. But with Cleese's stance on comedy, he may not be as welcoming of new ideas."
Fawlty Towers,I feel like Murray Bartlett's Armond belongs somewhere in here.
Fawlty Towers,This could be something special or a total dumpster fire.
Fawlty Towers,So this will be Cleese walking around calling everything woke and being edgy about it. Hard pass.
Fawlty Towers,Nah
Fawlty Towers,John Cleese is going to fuck this up and try to be edgy.
Fawlty Towers,The only thing I've heard from Cleese lately is racist and misogynistic. So I'm not really that excited for this.
Fawlty Towers,Here for all the cynical Sally comments.
Fawlty Towers,I can’t believe the negativity around John Cleese on this sub. The man is a legend in comedy. Enjoy his art while he is still here.
Fawlty Towers,The german scene with comb is the most insane humor nobody else could pull off
Fawlty Towers,"Well, this is certainly very unexpected. I love Fawlty Towers but this is a lot to process. I have faith in Cleese as an actor and writer, but why is he doing this so late? And I wonder if Connie Booth will be involved at all.

Although a couple years back he did reprise Basil in a specsaver commercial, that was pretty funny: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9tSN0178Us"
Fawlty Towers,You had me until John Cleese
Fawlty Towers,Terrible idea. He went from young and triumphant to old and directing his bitterness and bigotry towards whatever the Tory party says is bad
Fawlty Towers,"I can't imagine this will be any good... but that's what everyone here is saying, so I'll switch it up and be positive about it. :)

It's a pretty simple/solid premise. Hotel manager who hates his job (would probably rather see the guests just stop coming so they would stop bothering him), is always being bossed around by his wife, and has to deal with staff that have no clue what they are doing, and an assortment of difficult/odd/quirky guests.

Lots of ways it could go wrong, but if they stick to the original formula, avoid politics, and keep things simple, it could work. 

I think I'd want to see the whole hotel solidly stuck in the past. Not modernized in any way. Refusing to install wifi, rooms with ancient TVs in them, dining options from the 70s. And I don't want it to be about them becoming hip by learning about social media presence or anything like that. Just Fawlty stuck in this never-ending cycle. Maybe it being stuck in the past would make it into a popular boutique hotel, much to his dismay, and bookings would start flooding in from people wanting to gawk at the blast form the past.

Maybe that idea sucks... lol. First thing that came to mind."
Fawlty Towers,"Other great ideas 
-starting a land war in Asia"
Fawlty Towers,that sounds fucking great
Fawlty Towers,###YES!!!
Fawlty Towers,this is going to be so much out of touch boomer cringe
Fawlty Towers,No
Fawlty Towers,"**Prediction**: John Cleese demands jokes about how trans people are bad, is told no by the studio, and leaves the project within a year."
Fawlty Towers,Ooof. I hope they ony do 6 episodes or so. Each episode of the original is perfect.
Fawlty Towers,gonna suck so very much
Fawlty Towers,Reboot everything why not
Fawlty Towers,"We already have a Fawlty Towers reboot, it’s called White Lotus"
Fawlty Towers,would be awesome
Fawlty Towers,"You never know, he might cark it before this abomination gets into production."
Fawlty Towers,Fuck John Cleese and his ugly Fucking face
Fawlty Towers,"Maybe this time they could avoid taking the piss out of Spaniards (although I know there was no malice in the ideation of the character of Manuel, but still)."
Fawlty Towers,Oh wow.
Fawlty Towers,ty waterfowls
Fawlty Towers,And now for something completely different.
Fawlty Towers,Don't talk about the war!
Fawlty Towers,"Oh god no. The original is such a classic, sure it might have been short but I think it was the perfect length. Every episode was funny and unique and because it's short it never got to the point where it's stale. It said everything it needed to say, we don't need filler watering down the series just so John Cleese can pay for his divorces.

Not to mention he hasn't been particularly funny since 1988"
Fawlty Towers,What's the point? Someone is going to talk about the war.
Fawlty Towers,"Without even reading the first paragraph I knew exactly what the premise was going to be.... 
""Old man navigates modern world aka woke culture""

No guesses for which direction the jokes will be thrown at.

I REALLY hope this will be good, but I foresee this being a cynical comedy about a bitter man complaining his views aren't relevant enough."
Fawlty Towers,"Faulty is a total classic and I love watching it from time to time. I would love it if they could create some more that would be as good as the OG but that's just not going to happen. Leave it alone for the love of all that is good!

Ps I'm not looking forward to the Frazer reboot.. another I really love watching."
Fawlty Towers,They should get Murray Bartlett to star!
Fawlty Towers,I can’t stop reading all these comments in John Cleeses voice.
Fawlty Towers,Oh no.
Fawlty Towers,"I hate all his cancel/antiwokey stuff but what i liked best about FT were the plot set ups and the farcelike timing. If he can still manage that level of writing, it'd be great."
Fawlty Towers,"This would have been seriously exciting news 15 or more years ago.  


Now....I'm not so sure"
Fawlty Towers,Not everything needs a revival
Fawlty Towers,Que?
Fawlty Towers,Basaaaawl!
Fawlty Towers,Can I get a reboot for “Are You Being Served?”
Fawlty Towers,"Gods, that was a funny show. I remember himtelling somebody that a woman's laugh sounded like somebodymachine gunning a seal, which it did."
Extras,"Hi. I'll try to answer.

I don't think they always change. On The Original Series there were several actors that were regularly in the background or used for playing small roles. Yes, there were even actors as redshirts that got killed more than once. And there are different types of extras. Most extras come in for a day or two on an episode by episode basis, and will just be put at whatever station that helps make the screen look like it's filled with activity. Sometimes there are a small core group of regular extras that will appear in multiple episodes throughout the season and get paid a little more. I worked a background office worker extra on a TV show for two seasons. On the show Two Broke Girls, some of the regular diner patrons pulled double duty and worked as stand-in's for the main actors during set ups.

Day players (actors with one or more lines) are different. But, like extras, day players are not under a contract, so their appearances are subject to their availability. Basically Trek has always reused actors and does put some effort into trying to retain them, though it's not always possible, and keeping them at the same stations all the time is obviously not a priority."
Extras,The guys in the red shirts who beam down with the landing party are not good candidates for recurring roles.
Extras,"I do background acting on shows and movies. Some tv show directors are very particular about background, like to hand select them and are adamant in the casting calls about ""only fresh faces "" meaning you had not worked on camera on that production.

I think it just helps with authenticity in their mind. In practice, it doesn't make a huge difference to the average viewer."
Extras,"I think the various Star Treks do try to keep some sense of recurring extras. Voyager did this as much as they could due to the premise of the show. TNG tended to stick to a handful of day players for the helm position and various other background crew. DS9 had Morn. Discovery's bridge crew has more or less stayed the same since the beginning, existing in a weird state somewhere between day player and actual cast.

It's also not a fixed crew, other than Voyager and Discovery because of their unique circumstances. Realistically, most of the crew would only serve a few years at most at a single post before being transferred and/or promoted somewhere else."
Extras,"Spock and Riker had the job of creating the work schedules.  If it was ALWAYS the same person at the same console that credibility goes down (like Tom Paris, Harry Kim, and Tuvok on Voyager though they were in a situation where they literally couldn't pick up a new qualified Starfleet officer.)"
Extras,"They keep getting into the teletransporter with Kirk, Spock, and Scotty, which is the Kiss of Death...Nobody can survive that!!"
Extras,"Some of the Star Treks made more of an effort about. Voyager had a few extras who were around pretty much the entire series. Understandably, of course. I remember one guy even had his own wiki entry.

Ultimately as others have pointed out it's often a matter of logistics. Someone won't necessarily be available to do extra work for 6+ months of the year, for seven years. Certainly they wouldn't want to be paid the same for that entire time either."
Extras,Chief O’Brien on NTG started as a nothing part.  He did have a few lines in the first episode but he didn’t even have a name until season two.  While never being a main cast member on NTG would go on to appear in 225 episodes between TNG and DS9.
Extras,"You're not supposed to be looking at the extras.

But some shows don't allow background to do the same show for more than once a season. Some extras have better things to do."
Extras,"Thank for the answer, sheds a little more light on what i asked about. I put too much of star trek stuff into the question i guess, what i am interested in is really only the production side for this question."
Extras,"Well they die mostly. I just meant the other bridge staff or staff in general, sometimes you see a person twice, mostly on the next episode then. But there are never recurring characters that are not on the main staff. (Edit: In Tng there is a nurse that is seen more often, that is actually what i mean, why are there not more of those ""named"" background characters.)

Like a person that is on the bridge now and then, or in the medical station. Those are always new people."
Extras,"I can understand that, as i said in the case of Star Trek those are ships with over a 1000people on board, so it may make sense to always see new people."
Extras,"Voyager is a good example for this as it was one isolated ship in a far away place without any crew transfers.

I still think that there were a lot of new people brought into it for extra roles instead of relying on a small pool of people.

I actually should have brought that up in my original post."
Extras,"There's not a regulation or obligation for upping an extra to a semi-regular extra, or for promoting a day player to a cast member. It's all up to the producers to make those decisions. Colm Meaney is a good example of someone that started out as a day player with an unnamed character that was later given a name and promoted to full cast member. Sometimes it happens like that, but there's no official process for that to happen to every actor."
Extras,How sure are you that they don't do exactly this?  Have you really paid close enough attention to who is in the background of every scene to know for sure that those same people don't show up in the background of other scenes down the road?
Extras,"While I am not an expert on this, my understanding is there are 'background actors' who don't have lines, and 'principal performers' who do.  An actor can remain background even over an extended period of time, so there's no contractual reason to churn them, but there's also probably not that much benefit to trying to ensure some concept of continuity for individuals in roles where it's not essential to the story."
Extras,"Thanks again for staying with what i really asked. Colm Meaney is probably the best example for this. 

Seems it was a pretty obvious question, i just read that the Screen Actors Guild has some pretty strict rules about stuff like that. Just for example who is mentioned in the credits and where etc. Maybe, what i was thinking about, only applies to movies. 

I guess i did overthink this one a bit."
Extras,"No i didn't, it was just something that came to mind when i thought about always seeing new persons that i never saw before. 

But why is that so important instead of the question i asked, if there is some rule or law that prohibits using extras more than a few times without upping them to cast members?"
Extras,"Thanks, that is more in line of what i meant. They just use new extras because no one really cares. I was just wondering about it because i read about some laws that gives more rights (money, insurance, etc.) to people that are continually employed by a specific show in one role."
Extras,"> Warner Bros. plans to rename the service, believing the HBO name turns off many potential subscribers.

blinkingdude.jpg

Huh?

The most prestigious brand in TV ... turns off potential subscribers?

Interesting.  Wonder what that's about."
Extras,"So, they think the HBO name is turning people away, and they are going to go with MAX, which immediately brings the low tier Cinemax to mind.

Makes sense to me!"
Extras,It’s like they hired the CEO from Dollar Tree to start running Nordstrom’s because dollar tree’s business model is “successful”.
Extras,"> Chief Executive Officer David Zaslav is betting the addition of Discovery’s reality programming will increase the number of people who want to pay for the service,

If they thought people were interested in this they wouldn't be offering it for free."
Extras,Yay! omg.. I am soo glad that I get watch every episode of Pig Royalty instead of the golden age of Chuck Jones’ Bug Bunny or Westworld. Whata trade off!  ^/s
Extras,"Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. will add thousands of titles to its flagship streaming service HBO Max — pulling from its library of unscripted lifestyle shows — without raising the price.

The company plans to charge $10 a month for the advertising-supported tier of the new service, which is expected to be named Max, and either $15 or $16 a month for the ad-free version, according to people familiar with the company’s plans. Those are the current prices for HBO Max.

Warner Bros. will also sell a new, higher-priced subscription for about $20 a month, offering better video quality and possibly other features, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing internal deliberations. The company is still working on the plans and it’s possible they’ll change.

Chief Executive Officer David Zaslav is betting the addition of Discovery’s reality programming will increase the number of people who want to pay for the service, which competes with Netflix, Disney+ and Amazon. Warner Bros. plans to rename the service, believing the HBO name turns off many potential subscribers.

Zaslav has been planning a new streaming service since he orchestrated the merger of WarnerMedia, parent of HBO and Warner Bros., with Discovery Communications, which owns several cable networks. Both companies had their own streaming services, HBO Max and Discovery+. The Discovery service will continue to operate.

In total, Warner Bros. Discovery has 96.1 million paying subscribers, most of whom get HBO Max. Zaslav has been critical of the previous regime’s approach to HBO Max, claiming the company spent too much money on programming and didn’t focus on profit. HBO shows receive the most awards of any TV network but it trails Netflix, Disney+ and Amazon by tens of millions of customers. 

Zaslav has reversed many company policies, including selling HBO Max via Amazon.com Inc.’s channel store, a supermarket for streaming services. He also renewed a deal to keep licensing HBO shows to Foxtel in Australia and U-Next in Japan.

Warner Bros. will unveil the plans for its streaming service at a press event in April and plans to introduce the service to the public in the following weeks."
Extras,Still waiting for a streaming deal for AEW
Extras,"No added cost... yet. There will always be a price hike coming, nothing comes for free."
Extras,10 bucks a month for an ad-supported tier?  No thanks.
Extras,"There is a reason HBO Max stop grows when they reach the old HBO sub counts. HBO attract a specific demo, if they want to compete with Disney and Netflix, they need a different brand. And Warner Bros also lost big chunk of their Riverdale demo to Netflix without CW, so again need a name change,"
Extras,No added cost... aside from the price hike that happened like this week?
Extras,Warner Premier. It’s an excellent name that they already own. I’ve been saying this since the beginning
Extras,Why can't Raised by Wolves be one of them?
Extras,"Man, my wife is gonna be thrilled at all the new reality tv"
Extras,HBO has best shows and yet struggles. What explains?
Extras,"If HBO really needs new subscribers, they should add Cathouse, Katie Morgan, and Real Sex"
Extras,"These people have no idea what they’re doing. It’s just throw shit at the wall and see what sticks — if it sticks, they’re geniuses, if it falls, they’re still geniuses and there’s something wrong with the market or consumer.

The influence of big tech on entertainment has been truly dismal."
Extras,Skinamax is back on the menu boys!
Extras,I mean I can’t wait to get a bunch of food network content with no additional cost.
Extras,"I dont want new content, I want to be able to control the resolution manually and get the old shows back and renewed, especially Infinity Train!"
Extras,Hope I still get ad-free for free with my AT&T mobile plan.
Extras,'Velma' is proof HBOMAX doesn't have a clue what people want.
Extras,"You have completly I repeat completly brain dead to think that HBO will affect people's chances of subscribing. They even mention in the article the prestige that HBO has with the amount of award winning and highly praised content and you really think that affects the brand, matter of the fact is the only thing that has kept HBO Max going after all the issues it has had.

If you go with Max only that sounds more like a Nike product than a Streaming Service, maybe they'll ruin the prestige of HBO and that's why they are worried. And also the last thing people want is a price increase and promising better quality is see it to believe it because HBO Max quality hasn't been the best specially still releasing content in 1080p in 2023."
Extras,"Charging $20 to access no ads and HD means I won't likely be renewing.

I wonder what's going to happen to us 12 month holders?"
Extras,... that no-one cares about
Extras,I canceled HBO max right before the recent price increase.
Extras,"So, how do you know if you should also sibsvrobe to discovery?"
Extras,Are these extra shows going to include the ones they axed or wiped out the platform too? I still haven't forgiven them for removing Close Enough.
Extras,All I care is that they make Mythbusters available.
Extras,The streaming grift continues.
Extras,"cant even read the article but

>	Plans include a higher-priced tier with enhanced video quality

enhanced video quality like 1080p? 720p? Up until a few years ago HBO barely produced 4K content and I doubt Discovery has a lot of 4K content either so what will be the major incentive to that tier"
Extras,Sounds to me they're doing the opposite of what they should to attract viewers and keep the current ones.
Extras,The head of HBO thinks that it turns off families because they relate HBO to mature content.
Extras,"This was always a thing. HBO Max was really the WB streaming service and the HBO name caused confusion that turned off younger people and families that hear HBO and think mature content like Sopranos, Oz, Real Sex, GoT.

You want those people to watch to if you are putting Bugs Bunny and DC stuff on there"
Extras,"A large number of people out there associate HBO with adult content and ""boobs"". If you want to go after the Disney+ audience then yeah, a rebrand makes sense."
Extras,"The prestigious thing is a big part of it.

Many of us remember HBO being a *premium* service that was very expensive with very targeted content on top of a very expensive cable package.  It had a similar feel to those super expensive sports programming packages.  There's definitely still a lot of people that hear ""HBO"" and assume it's mostly older cinema at a premium price point and their reaction is ""oh that's not for me"", whereas you hear Hulu or Vimeo or Peacock and expect another variety of content at a competitive price point.

That brand recognition worked when they *were* a premium cable service, but it's not competitive in the current streaming marketplace and doesn't reflect their own library of content.  Usually corporate rebrands are nonsense but this one makes sense."
Extras,Pretty sure that's the writer's opinion? There's no way someone from the company has said that when they've been praising the brand.
Extras,Booooooo. No more name changes. This is like the 4th one now.
Extras,"New exec is an idiot, simple as that. But then so are the majority of reality tv viewers, which is who he caters to."
Extras,The only reason I’m subscribed to Crave in Canada is because of the HBO content.
Extras,">The most prestigious brand in TV

The reality is only people who spend an absurd amount of time online or on Reddit view HBO as the ""most prestigious brand in TV"". For the average person it's just another streaming service, and pretty much the most expendable one at that"
Extras,Seems they think that some people who would be interested in subscribing mostly for the Discovery+ content would be turned off by the HBO name.
Extras,Skinemax is what I think of.
Extras,"HBO shouldn't have been in the name from the start, it only created the confusion between it and HBO Max. Removing HBO from the name actually protects its value as it won't be associated with anything not airing on it. WarnerMedia only used that for brand recognition."
Extras,"If you read more about this, its because they want the platform to go international and outside the US, the HBO name has no meaning. Its just a random assortment of letters. Its the equivalent of “XRL MAX” a new streaming device!”"
Extras,Such an apt metaphor.
Extras,"Actually sort of happened- Nordstrom overpaid for Trunk Club then put the Nordstrom Rack head in charge of it. He basically changed Trunk Club to ""boxes of crap destined for Nordstrom Rack"" and it ultimately folded."
Extras,Well Nordstrom just had to shut down it's Canadian operations...so...
Extras,Hopefully they keep it on some other hub so it doesn't clutter up the place.
Extras,"i mean it's not free, it's part of the HBO max sub."
Extras,Seriously....I have a two and five year old and if it weren't for Sesame Street I'd probably cancel.
Extras,"They're hoping they can increase the value of a subscription enough to tip some people over the edge. That extra value might be worth a small amount in and of itself to some people, but it might be enough to make them bite the bullet and get a subscription."
Extras,if you get something for free - you are the product. they are just hoping for more subscribers
Extras,The Playstation Fan Argument : **ITS NOT FREE!!!!  YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR THE SERVICE!!!!**
Extras,"Don’t worry, they already factored in the cost by getting rid of their quality shows and raising the price in January."
Extras,">Warner Bros. will also sell a new, higher-priced subscription for about $20 a month, offering better video quality and possibly other features

Headline really burying the lede"
Extras,So crowding out good content with a flood of shit
Extras,Well it's good it didn't raise its price considering most current subscribers probably don't want any of this trash.
Extras,Damn I was hoping this article would mention AEW
Extras,Squared Circle is leaking 😂
Extras,I would’ve gotten into AEW if they had their PPVs on HBO Max
Extras,Price was increased 6 days ago.
Extras,"I pay less than that for Disney+, without ads, without resolution bullshit."
Extras,Yarr
Extras,Exactly. A lot of people don’t understand this.
Extras,Their content pipeline is too slow to warrant a full time sub.  I don't give a flying fuck about FOMO so I sub for 1 month a year.
Extras,Bad acquisition. Discovery bought HBO (and Warner Media more broadly) on a fuck ton of leverage
Extras,"I mean HBO does not struggle, HBO Max does. You see the problem?"
Extras,HBO Max is only available in the US and LATAM. Nowhere else.
Extras,It means that they don’t have the best shows. Especially for worldwide customers.
Extras,"Sort of funny they're rumored to be renaming it to Max then, considering that's from the Cinemax arm, which was basically known as the softcore porn network to the point it was nicknamed ""Skinemax"".  Though, obviously, it's a bit more generic of a title that most probably won't make the connection, but certainly amusing if you do."
Extras,"This is true. My master’s thesis required a contract to solve a problem with an actual company. I had to pitch to the execs and everything. So I worked with HBOMac to reduce churn. Theres three groups that have HBOMax - one is those who HATE hbo for the nudity/profanity/etc, but subscribe bc it was free with AT&T. Figuring out  how to communicate that there was more on hbo than GoT (and building better content controls for those who didn’t want to be offered suggestive content on their profiles) was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done. 

I don’t agree with it, but I put in the work by hand and know it’s accurate."
Extras,"Bingo, have had a co-worker had a knee jerk gasp when a different co-worker was telling a story and said ""So I pulled up HBO Max to watch some TV with the kids"" because they thought HBO just had adult drama's and comedies and didn't know that things like Scoby-doo and so on is on it."
Extras,"Yeah I can see that, especially in the context of merging the billion aspects of Discovery+ into the same platform, where Discovery+ is mostly (but not exclusively) family-friendly content."
Extras,"I imagine the best solution would probably be to rename to something Warner related, then. Pretty much exactly the same move as CBS All Access becoming Paramount+ because focus groups showed that young people negatively associated “CBS” with “old people TV” but were neutral to positive on “Paramount” due to associating it with films.

Warner Bros. is well-known as a film studio with output ranging from mature films to Looney Tunes to mature Looney Tunes films. It’s as wide-ranging as you can get.

However…the problem, as usual, is going to be Zaslav. Warner Bros. Discovery is being run almost entirely by the “Discovery” side of the transaction, and I really don’t think that they want to completely overwrite the Discovery brand. So for that reason, and likely because they see the HBO Max brand as well-established, they’re not going to do that, and we’re probably going to see “Max” as the final brand for the combined service."
Extras,The head of DISCOVERY thinks that HBO turns off families because they relate to quality content instead of cheap garbage.
Extras,Ah yes. The streaming home of Sesame Street.
Extras,Taxi cab confessions was lit though
Extras,"If you've been following these ""cost extra"" movie networks that were huge names in the 80s and 90s and 2000s, then you'd know that the ""after dark"" content they once offered went the way of the dinosaur years ago: HBO became HBOmax, Cinemax became all action, [Showtime is merging](https://www.fiercevideo.com/video/paramount-merges-showtime-paramount#:~:text=Paramount%20is%20employing%20a%20similar,as%20%E2%80%9CParamount%2B%20with%20Showtime.%E2%80%9D) with Paramount+, etc.

If you're still into TV porn, [there's one app left that's got you covered](https://channelstore.roku.com/details/2d1bbfe81769cf29e27fdf4e61c40e51/adult-sexy-movies) on Roku.

...the one surviving app after [Roku removed all uncertified porn channels](https://www.protocol.com/entertainment/roku-porn-ban-firetv-chromecast) from its platform last year."
Extras,"I mean I guess I could see how some segments might be turned off by the HBO brand?

Like, it's an *adult* brand and a prestige brand.  I don't mentally associate HBO with kids programming or family-friendly programming at all.

So as they merge the Discovery+ content in (which includes a lot more ""wholesome"" stuff like Animal Planet, The Learning Channel, Food Network, The Dodo, OWN, Magnolia, The Travel Channel, Lifetime, etc.) I could see how they might think there's a mismatch between the people who would want to pay for Discovery+ and the HBO brand?"
Extras,A brand can be really strong and positive and also be limited in it's reach.
Upper Middle Bogan,"Yeah I really enjoyed it. As a Brit I'd actually never heard of The Angels before this show. 

Anybody know if/when it's coming back?"
Upper Middle Bogan,Yeah
Upper Middle Bogan,Yes. It's quite good.
Upper Middle Bogan,"Love it. Need to watch tonight's episode. 

It's called 'Bess of Both Worlds' on American Netflix. "
Upper Middle Bogan,"Absolutely brilliant non-PC show.  An American equivalent is The Detour in terms of having some of the best kid actors/roles on TV.  My 14yo son absolutely loves Oscar.  The beauty of the show is that it is neutral with regard to the different classes, the snobs and the bogans are both taken to task.  And the two eps involving the lost dog and the families origins are beautifully written to bring out the twists (and the tears) at the end.  Our Bess has money problems.  What, she has too much?  Cracks me up every time.  Sadly, I hear that a US OTA network has plans to ruin it with a remake as they did to our beloved Rake."
Upper Middle Bogan,Season three airing in Australia at the moment.
Upper Middle Bogan,Thbe third season is currently airing on ABC now
Upper Middle Bogan,Fucking right on!
Upper Middle Bogan,"It makes sense, the casual audience doesn't know who the character is."
Upper Middle Bogan,So far so good. I was disappointed that episode 2 wasn't out yet. Normally the season's half over by the time I get around to starting them.
Upper Middle Bogan,">These figures come from Samba TV, which measures 3 million SmartTV households stateside as their sampling, which tuned into the streaming series for at least five minutes.

So, it really comes down to how much you trust this metric as an indication of the actual numbers."
Upper Middle Bogan,This is the series that desperately needed a 2 or 3 episode premier.
Upper Middle Bogan,"... Great, the idiots back.

That one line has me hoping for a shit ton more seasons!"
Upper Middle Bogan,"Going into moonknight with little to zero knowledge I feel the hurt of having to wait a week for next episode, it was so great I watched that episode again a day later. Oscar Isaac is incredible"
Upper Middle Bogan,This was probably my favorite start to Disney+ MCU series yet. I can’t wait for more. Loki was great but I have high hopes for this one as well.
Upper Middle Bogan,"The fact is confusing isn’t a bad thing. I like not knowing everything about a show, learning and having to theorise possibilities.

It’s why I loved Legion"
Upper Middle Bogan,"I think Loki is overrated because people love Tom. Hawkeye is a boring super hero to me but his show kept me interested to watch and finish. I ended up really enjoying it. I think I only watched 2 Loki episodes, maybe 3. 

Moon knight is looking like something I’m going to wish had an episode a week all year long. He seems like a really interesting character and it’s made me think about getting into his comics."
Upper Middle Bogan,The first episode was quite good
Upper Middle Bogan,Hawkeye actually ended up being good too
Upper Middle Bogan,Nothing against Renner but didn’t care for his role and character in the mcu. But with Oscar I was sold with him from the first scene in force awakens and was disappointed that he wasn’t a main character there
Upper Middle Bogan,I liked Hawkeye better than Loki personally. Loki just felt all over the place.
Upper Middle Bogan,"I think it’s going to pick up speed. The word of mouth has been great for it, and so far it doesn’t connect to anything else in the MCU, so people can (for once) hop into it without having to know anything about Marvel."
Upper Middle Bogan,"I swear, if this show doesn't have an homage to the ""Dracula, I know you're in here you big fucking nerd, where's my goddamn money!"" meme somewhere, I'm gonna be disappointed."
Upper Middle Bogan,Loki was already a household name. Moon knight is a new character most non comic fans barely know.
Upper Middle Bogan,"Well yeah, Loki is already a well established and interesting character and the show was great from the start whereas Hawkeye was boring AF even with the introduction of crossover characters."
Upper Middle Bogan,"Honestly I’ve never heard of Moon Knight before, but this first episode intrigued me so much I watched it twice.  Literally counting down the hours until the next episode 😭"
Upper Middle Bogan,Man what a great premiere
Upper Middle Bogan,Honestly a damn good show.
Upper Middle Bogan,It felt a little too much like Venom but I’ll keep watching.
Upper Middle Bogan,Loki was top notch.
Upper Middle Bogan,"It was one of the strongest openings for any of the Marvel series.  


Plus I'm glad its weekly, gives me something to look forward to each Wednesday."
Upper Middle Bogan,i actually prefer the pacing of moon knight compared to Loki. Hopefully ep 2 continues strong.
Upper Middle Bogan,"If I already had Disney+, I would watch Moon Knight just because a show where Oscar Isaac plays a schizophrenic superhero sounds neat. 

It’s just not enough to make me go out of my way to pay for a subscription. Loki was enough to make me pay for a subscription but unfortunately, I didn’t end up liking that show. I watched Hawkeye just out of curiosity while I already had a Disney+ subscription and I ended up liking it much more than Loki."
Upper Middle Bogan,"On a slightly unrelated note, I was so excited when COVID started and steaming services started getting announced. I was so exited that shows were just gonna drop instead of having to wait for a weekly release. Then streaming services just became TV2 :("
Upper Middle Bogan,It was good!
Upper Middle Bogan,"I have a group of friends that I've been Social-Distance-Watching various streaming shows including some of the Marvel shows.  Nobody in the group knew who Moonknight was from the comics, we just figured we'd give it a shot.  It probably could have used an Episode 2 simultaneous release because after episode one, one person put it ""I have no idea what's going on..."""
Upper Middle Bogan,I'm tired of the marvel shows feeling like a movie that's been chopped up for episodes. That feeling of emptiness and unfulfillment at the end of each episode has finally turned me off to watching the show as it airs. I will watch it when all episodes are available.
Upper Middle Bogan,Its cool but Im over weekly series just let me binge it
Upper Middle Bogan,It’s excellent.
Upper Middle Bogan,I'm waiting for the full season to come out.
Upper Middle Bogan,I’ve always been a big fan of Moon Knight. I’m glad he’s finally got some mainstream media.
Upper Middle Bogan,"Yeah like i'm going to watch an episodic series when you've only released one episode, times have changed old timers we binge now"
Upper Middle Bogan,Moon Knight is the only one of them I’ve really cared to watch
Upper Middle Bogan,I liked Hawkeye too.
Upper Middle Bogan,"I’ve thought all the Marvel shows have been really entertaining, but some more so than others.  I really liked the first episode of Moon Knight so I hope it stays that way!"
Upper Middle Bogan,So far liking moon knight more than loki and hawk eye
Upper Middle Bogan,I thought it was really good. This is one of the marvel shows where I really wish they would do away with all the little comic relief quips and let it be a little scarier.
Upper Middle Bogan,I don’t plan on watching any of it until all of the episodes are released.
Upper Middle Bogan,The f**k is Hawkeye?                         /s
Upper Middle Bogan,So? They expect to break views each new series/season?
Upper Middle Bogan,I have enjoyed them all.
Upper Middle Bogan,It was amazing and I was really upset when I saw there was no episode 2 yet. Looking forward to this more than any other MCU property right now.
Upper Middle Bogan,"Great writing and acting, crappy special effects."
Upper Middle Bogan,I watched Moon Knight the other day it was pretty interesting.
Upper Middle Bogan,"It makes sense. I kind of enjoyed Hawkeye, but Moon Knight is already to a much better start."
Upper Middle Bogan,"I had no idea who Moon Knight was. Took a chance. Awesome. Watched it twice because, well, I had to. It’s packed."
Upper Middle Bogan,I'm not watching it until its all out.
Upper Middle Bogan,"gave up a bit of the way through episode 2, jeeeeezzzzzzzz

i like the egyptian god stuff, but everything else is terrible"
Upper Middle Bogan,Zero clue what the episode was about lmao
Upper Middle Bogan,That first episode was soooooo good! Can’t wait for the next episode to drop!
Upper Middle Bogan,"I think they did a great job showing how disorienting DID is.

\[Based upon what I've heard from videos of people who suffer from it--not from firsthand experience.\]"
Upper Middle Bogan,sounds about right. Hawkeye honestly doesnt seem that interesting
Upper Middle Bogan,"""Hawkeye"" was definitely better than ""Loki"", yet Loki got a ton more attention. Its a shame really."
Upper Middle Bogan,I’m just gonna say it: Hawkeye was better than Loki overall.
Upper Middle Bogan,Because Loki is best.
Upper Middle Bogan,"I definitely enjoyed it, which is more than I could say about Falcon, Hawkeye, and What if.

Honestly, outside of Loki and Wandavision (which started strong but had an awful ending), these Disney+ shows have been **very** disappointing."
Upper Middle Bogan,His English accent has to go. It’s effn terrible.
Upper Middle Bogan,"the pilot was superb and it has been oscar isaac's best performance ever. if they can keep this up for the season, it could end up being marvel's best series. loki was terrible. hawkeye didnt even look good enough for me to bother."
Upper Middle Bogan,The first episode was confusing for me. I liked Hawkeye more.
Upper Middle Bogan,"Spamming the shit out of Youtube with teaser after teaser does not actually raise my interest in this show, believe it or not. Sure I'll check it out, but I'm not on Youtube to watch only your teasers for a show. Marvel needs to relax."
Upper Middle Bogan,"I watched it, really underwhelmed. 

The main character is really annoying to me. 

The episode dragged on.  Like, okay I get it and I see where it’s going- but just because it’s a TV show doesn’t mean you have to drag the exposition out for an entire episode.  Could have been half as long and covered the same ground.  

Action sequences were childish but not childish- like they were for kids (which I would understand) but too violent for kids.  

The Voice sounds ridiculous.  

Maybe I’m just not the target audience for any of these new Marvel shows.  Loki was a mix between annoying and putting me to sleep, I couldn’t even finish the series. 90% of the jokes are just lame, like I don’t understand how anyone could find them funny.  Usually a sign the jokes aren’t meant for me lol"
Upper Middle Bogan,"I enjoyed it, I'll keep watching for a bit.  Wasn't much a fan of Hawkeye, gave that up about halfway through."
Upper Middle Bogan,I enjoyed Hawkeye more but had hoped for this to rock. Instead it was a jumbled mess that I barely made it through. Sigh……
Upper Middle Bogan,"I’m not watching till I can binge it. You wanna release shit weekly, that’s what you get."
Upper Middle Bogan,"One of the best so far, but not beating Daredevil just yet"
Upper Middle Bogan,Hawkeye was so good. But I’m going the same thing I did for that. Waiting until it’s all out and viewing it over two nights. I’m no longer a fan and have not been for a very very long time of weekly release. I wonder if there are lots of people doing the same as I am
Upper Middle Bogan,Really liked Hawkeye. Not sure about this Moon Knight yet.
Upper Middle Bogan,Hawkeye was the most well produced show out of all of them. Completely underrated
Upper Middle Bogan,I’m still shocked Hawkeye had any viewership.
Upper Middle Bogan,Hawkeye was great. more people should watch it.
Upper Middle Bogan,Well it’s better than Hawkeye but not as good as Loki
Upper Middle Bogan,"I like how MCU went from events to… this.

Not necessarily a bad thing.  MCU is just it’s own genre of entertainment now."
Upper Middle Bogan,Haha Hawkeye sucks
Upper Middle Bogan,It was a really really boring paint by numbers premier episode. I watched it twice just to confirm how boring I found it all. Not saying it can't get better though.
Upper Middle Bogan,"Disney factory at work. 

Same wine in a different bottle"
Upper Middle Bogan,Marvel sucks. They sap all creativity out of film and Hollywood.
Upper Middle Bogan,"Loki was excellent.. hawkeye was good, i enjoyed it. So far the … behind the curtain action in ep one was kind of annoying… ep 2 better be better."
Upper Middle Bogan,"Oscar Isaac is alright, Rami Malek would’ve been perfect"
Upper Middle Bogan,"The show is interesting (horrible CGI) and you needed a good actor for the part, put I still can't get over the fact they wasted Oscar Isaac in this role."
Upper Middle Bogan,"Probably because nobody's had time to watch it yet. Maybe if they released all the episodes at once? I nearly watched it with my girlfriend and we were like, ""yeah no I don't want to wait a week for the next episode if it's good."""
Upper Middle Bogan,"Which is odd, as I rank Loki last out of all these MCU shows (WandaVision ---> Hawkeye ---> Falcon & Winter Soldier ---> Moon Knight (so far, but I have a feeling I'm bumping it up big time) ---> Loki)

I think I only liked the last two episodes of Loki when something actually *happened*. Too much of it felt repetitive being inside the TVA all the time, and personally I still have trouble seeing Loki as redeemable, but whatever."
Upper Middle Bogan,Everything about hawkeye show is utter trash and boring so no wonder moon knight doing better.
Upper Middle Bogan,"The first episode was alright, but I’m kind of getting tired of so many characters being pretty much the same copy and paste as Steven is. It’s always the same; socially awkward, nervous, low social status people who freak out and are supposed to be comedic relief when they really aren’t that funny. 

The same reason I really am not a fan of Spider-Man anymore. Basically since the Avengers a lot of characters got dumbed down."
Upper Middle Bogan,"Nobody cares about moon knight or morbius on screen. The new Marvel phase has been underwhelming and dividing, Spiderman being the exception. But that had Sony involvement and a much bigger built in fanbase. A few years ago the sony logo meant a movie would probably suck. Today the equation has changed, Sony is fun to watch and Marvel is becoming exausting."
Upper Middle Bogan,"This is an internal memo, not news"
Upper Middle Bogan,Aren’t the rest of you sick of superheroes?
Upper Middle Bogan,I can't stand Oscar Isaac after Poe Dameron. And him acting like a Jerry Lewis parody didn't help making me like him more. The show had some good action moments but I still know nothing about this superhero
Upper Middle Bogan,"In fairness I’m a fan of the character for sure, but I’m also a huge Carolina Tarheels fan so I’m saving MK to binge after tonight."
Upper Middle Bogan,I didn’t even know when it was coming out. I saw it a few days later.
Upper Middle Bogan,Solid first episode
Mike Tyson Mysteries,Oh man I miss this show. Hilarious af.
Mike Tyson Mysteries,I can only assume that the natural conclusion to this episode is that they realize that they're in a Judd Apatow movie.
Mike Tyson Mysteries,Such a great show. Anybody know if the full episodes are available somewhere?
Mike Tyson Mysteries,https://www.justwatch.com/us/tv-show/mike-tyson-mysteries
Mike Tyson Mysteries,Thank you!
Mike Tyson Mysteries,I love how quickly it sums up everything
Mike Tyson Mysteries,RIP Norm.
Mike Tyson Mysteries,Love this show. Miss Norm.
Mike Tyson Mysteries,"Holy shit, where as this been my whole recent life?"
Mike Tyson Mysteries,"Damn, I watched the whole thing......might as well watch the entire episode......for like the 5th time. I love this show soooo much."
Mike Tyson Mysteries,One of my favorite Norm performances.
Mike Tyson Mysteries,The man punches a T-Rex. Brutal.
Mike Tyson Mysteries,Check out the episode 'My Favorite Mystery' to learn the history behind each of the opening title sequence clips.
Mike Tyson Mysteries,One of the most random shows to come out and somehow scratch so many weird itches is never expect. Also it's pretty much my only exposure to Norm before the Orville and I love pigeon. Plus fucking Jim rash?
Mike Tyson Mysteries,Such an awesome show but it's not available to watch on any normal streaming platform. It was fairly recently pulled from everything.
Mike Tyson Mysteries,I'm so bummed they didn't continue this show.
Mike Tyson Mysteries,Fight or flight!
Mike Tyson Mysteries,It’s a similar vibe (drawing wise) to those 80’s cartoons Fat Albert and also the Globetrotters cartoon.  Is this an oldish cartoon or it’s just drawn that way?  I’ve never seen It before.
Mike Tyson Mysteries,"If you enjoy *Mike Tyson Mysteries* , please try *Nobodies* . (sadly, no Norm, but an occasional Melissa McCarthy!)"
Mike Tyson Mysteries,None of us have time for bird sex!
Mike Tyson Mysteries,This show was a gem!
Mike Tyson Mysteries,Woah! That's a lot of words.
Mike Tyson Mysteries,I've always been more of a Sylvester & Tweety Mysteries guy myself.
Mike Tyson Mysteries,Time to fly!
Mike Tyson Mysteries,They really came out the starting gate with a bang. You know exactly what you're getting yourself into for the rest of the series
Mike Tyson Mysteries,[But when do we kill all the kids?](https://youtu.be/BTE8Ygf8XJs)
Mike Tyson Mysteries,Adult Swim
Mike Tyson Mysteries,"I envy you, you're about to experience one of the greatest shows ever made for the first time"
Mike Tyson Mysteries,Fight or flight
Mike Tyson Mysteries,It's drawn that way
Mike Tyson Mysteries,That show was able to pack a lot of plot into *mumbles* minutes.
Mike Tyson Mysteries,And hulu
Mike Tyson Mysteries,I miss this show.
Mike Tyson Mysteries,Was dissappointed Yung Hee never got any action. Poor asian Velma.
Mike Tyson Mysteries,Why did they ever cancel this show?
Mike Tyson Mysteries,"for a second I thought scientology had a network.......and was bringing this back, I'd tune in"
Mike Tyson Mysteries,I always find it funny when a christian starts bashing scientology like it's the only crazy religion.
Mike Tyson Mysteries,"Now, I'm really hungry for some KFC.   (Champ - the 11 herbs and spices are mostly salt, pepper and MSG.   Shhhh, it's a secret and a flavor packed punch in he mouth.)"
Mike Tyson Mysteries,"One of the funniest shows. Norm was amazing, but so was the writing."
Mike Tyson Mysteries,“Hey there little boy.”
Mike Tyson Mysteries,"could be multiple reasons. maybe they thought the show was losing steam (it kinda was near the end), they thought 69 episodes was good to end on, etc. could also have been hurt by the fact it's currently only on Hulu when WarnerMedia has been pushing HBO Max so hard. creator has a new show in the works with WB Animation I think.

norm dying also pretty much sealed the fate that the show will never come back"
Mike Tyson Mysteries,"This is one of my favorite Adult Swim shows *ever*, and given their history of canceling great shows for no reason, I’m actually extremely surprised it managed to get 4 full seasons"
Mike Tyson Mysteries,Maybe Mike Tyson just got bored?
Mike Tyson Mysteries,"They did have a channel on direct tv for awhile. They just showed weird self help bullshit though.

Edit: looks like they still have it it’s channel 320 on direct tv. [Here is a livestream of it](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=df-97lhZBi0) it’s weird as shit."
Mike Tyson Mysteries,By the end of the episode they're bashing Christianity just as hard
Mike Tyson Mysteries,Both fit definitions of a cult.
Mike Tyson Mysteries,At least L Ron Hubbard actually existed...
Mike Tyson Mysteries,"I would say the show ran its course, but seeing as shit like ATHF got near 20 seasons I don't know. Adult Swim likes to cancel their best shows (Venture Bros, Metalocalypse)"
Mike Tyson Mysteries,Fact
Mike Tyson Mysteries,That’s just factually incorrect. A cult has to have threat of persecution or harm upon withdrawal.
Mike Tyson Mysteries,"So did Joseph Smith, doesn't make mormonism any less stupid then scientology or any other crazy ass religion"
Mike Tyson Mysteries,Umm…so did Jesus.
Mike Tyson Mysteries,Jesus exists!  Makes some great Tacos too.
Mike Tyson Mysteries,"> ATHF got near 20 seasons

11"
Mike Tyson Mysteries,Aqua Teen was consistently hilarious for all its run though. Also cheap as hell to make.
Mike Tyson Mysteries,Cite your definition of a cult then.
Mike Tyson Mysteries,"Jesus existing has been proven I believe, however the debate is, was Jesus this magical deity or just a dude who had some rather progressive ideas for the time and a rather rabid following. I'm putting my money on the latter."
Mike Tyson Mysteries,No he didn't.
Mike Tyson Mysteries,Excellent lawn care as well.
Mike Tyson Mysteries,I rounded up.
Mike Tyson Mysteries,Yeah don’t be like ‘oh all the good shows are cancelled’ and then throw aqua teen under the bus like it went on when others should’ve instead. ATHF is god tier.
Mike Tyson Mysteries,"The academic consensus is that Jesus was a real rabbi and faith healer who attracted a following and then got executed by the Roman state. There's no ""proof"" he existed, in the sense of physical evidence or primary sources from during his lifetime."
Mike Tyson Mysteries,Definitely the latter. There’s no such thing as magical deities.
Mike Tyson Mysteries,"> Jesus existing has been proven

I almost choked on laughter, Jesus's historicity has definitely *not* been proven in any manner of the term."
Mike Tyson Mysteries,"Not sure if you’re trolling or that ignorant. 

It is widely acknowledged that Jesus was a historical figure. I’m not saying he was anything but a human, but he did exist."
Mike Tyson Mysteries,"Well the consensus is that street preachers were a dime a dozen and Jesus was a common enough name that it's no stretch to imagine one going by that name. **The Life of Brian** is astonishingly accurate on that score. 

Now it probably comes off as pedantic but it is an important distinction to make.

 In all likelihood there's a guy called Steve in Huntsville Alabama who swears blind he can lay hands on people, but that's a long way from getting me a copy of his drivers license.

But the real problem with a historical Jesus is that it bears no fruit when it comes to the question of the *divinity* of Jesus."
Mike Tyson Mysteries,Or so the Russians would have you believe.
Mike Tyson Mysteries,"There is definitely a question about it. Now personally, I think it's entirely possible Jesus or someone like him existed in that time period, but the non-Christian sources of time, Jospheus and Tacitus were roughly a hundred years after his birth and both discussed the real Jesus in the context of ""these Christians believe the messiah was this guy from 70 years ago."" 

Now, how much historical evidence WOULD exist for a poor carpenter is why I don't take that as any kind of a slam dunk, I think in all likelihood he did exist, but it's not as clear cut as you're making it out to be."
Mike Tyson Mysteries,I always think of the fight or flight scene whenever this show pops up.
Mike Tyson Mysteries,Jim Rash as a ghost is so good
Mike Tyson Mysteries,Thought this would be topical
Mike Tyson Mysteries,"Such a great show, multiple watch series"
Mike Tyson Mysteries,This show was pure nonsense in the best way possible.
Mike Tyson Mysteries,"God, how have I never seen this show before? It's hilarious! Adding it to my ""To watch"" list."
Mike Tyson Mysteries,This clip seems super sped up. Is this to dodge automatic copyright detection?
Mike Tyson Mysteries,Space has a plan until it gets punched
Mike Tyson Mysteries,my favorite part was when mike killed baby hitler in his stroller
Mike Tyson Mysteries,It's weird seeing which celebrity rapists get exiled and which ones just keep going along without any repercussions.
Mike Tyson Mysteries,[deleted]
Mike Tyson Mysteries,[deleted]
Mike Tyson Mysteries,Why did this violent convicted rapist get his own cartoon?
Mike Tyson Mysteries,Fight or flight and punching Gary Kasparov are two of the best moments for me.
Mike Tyson Mysteries,Amazing show
Mike Tyson Mysteries,It is definitely sped up 25%
Mike Tyson Mysteries,Tyson went to jail
Mike Tyson Mysteries,"Yeah it's weird situation. I don't blame anyone for not forgiving him, but for whatever it's worth he did serve time and has legitimately seemed to have become a better person.

The one thing I think we all can agree on is that his story is a fascinating one."
Mike Tyson Mysteries,[deleted]
Mike Tyson Mysteries,"the weird thing is how many people come out of the woodwork to defend him.  He's a convicted rapist, convicted domestic abuser, convicted of multiple assaults...but he talks funny, so people still like him."
Mike Tyson Mysteries,Next up: The Roman Polanski Variety Hour!
Mike Tyson Mysteries,Are you saying we should feel bad for laughing at Mike Tyson Mysteries?
Mike Tyson Mysteries,"Yeah that's kind of what going to prison is. The issue with ""cancelled"" people is them escaping consequences. Tyson was arrested, convicted and went to jail.

Edit: If you or anyone else cannot enjoy a comedy involving Mike Tyson for that reason, that's completely valid. No reason you have to think it's funny. But usually when people are seeking someone's job, it's because that's literally the only option for seeing the victimizer suffer a consequence.

There is also a considerable amount of time between Tysons offense and Mike Tyson Mysteries. That can also soften people's feelings."
Mike Tyson Mysteries,Where do you rank the hotel bell scene? Because that is above Fight or Flight for me
Mike Tyson Mysteries,"I mean look man, I do believe eliminating recidivism is an important step our society needs to take, with the demystification of ex-cons being an important part of that. I also think that Mike has turned his life around. However, can you really blame anyone for taking an anti-rapist stance?"
Mike Tyson Mysteries,"He raped a woman. Just calling him an ex con is an extremely passive description. He nonconsensually violated a woman. He is a registered sex offender. You praise him, but I bet if it was a non famous, creepy looking, predator, you'd be singing a different tune.

But Mike played sports real good, so he gets a pass on the rape."
Mike Tyson Mysteries,"> Tyson was arrested, convicted and went to jail.

He didn't just so his time.  He acknowledges the mistakes he made completely turned his life around.  He's now a self-described pacifist who raises pigeons."
Mike Tyson Mysteries,I'm drawing a blank on which scene you're referring to. Refresh my memory.
Mike Tyson Mysteries,"No problem, love to watch it again lol

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPeK_GR9Nhg"
Mike Tyson Mysteries,"Lmao forgot about that scene. Man I gotta do a rewatch, such a hilarious show."
Mike Tyson Mysteries,"noooooooooo, I loved this show it was great"
Mike Tyson Mysteries,I'm disappointed. That show was so much fun.
Young Justice,I hope they give this show more money. I feel like a third of each episode happened in stills last year
Young Justice,Just isn't the same show since season 2 tbh.
Young Justice,*KING SHARK*
Young Justice,"I honestly hate what they're doing this season. It's okay to have mini-arcs centered around specific characters, but you still need some more meatier storylines going on at the same time. I feel like Greg and Brandon are just introducing way too many plots without closing any of the ones they've introduced in the past two seasons and that's honestly insane for a show that always seems like it's a moment away from another cancellation. I'm not sure how much longer I can take the Red Assassin just standing there menacingly next to Ra'as al Ghul or repeated mentions of characters that (seasons 2 and 4 spoilers) >!die, but then the show keeps winking and nudging us that they're actually alive. I can't believe they killed off Connor, gave him some actual finality, and are now bringing him back just a few episodes later despite the fact that Wally is still just looming over everyone's head for the second season in a row when the end of season 3 made it very clear he's not dead either. I just see no realm in which they can pull off successive ""he's not dead"" like that off fluidly.!<"
Young Justice,[removed]
Young Justice,"I kinda lost interest after the end of the second season which I thought was a step down in quality on top of sidelining the characters I'd grown attached to in favor of an expanding cast. Does the show refocus, or otherwise get better? I really liked the Timmverse Justice League, and the first season really gave me those vibes, I just wish they didn't try to do the same thing as JLU and blow up the cast so early."
Young Justice,"Ive been enjoying it , i hope it gets picked up for a new season."
Young Justice,"Season 4 is a great improvement to season 3, loved it so far"
Young Justice,After the third scene was a drop of for me this season has been great so far. The only thing that fell flat for me was parts of the Mars storyline
Young Justice,Link to trailer?
Young Justice,I hope it picks up. I only like the Artemis arc so far. S3 at least had stand out episodes and this one hasn't so far.
Young Justice,"How did no one notice that Beast boy was on serious drugs given how he looked and acted and also the serious amount of drugs all over his bedroom lol especially when his home is surrounded by multiple adult heroes?

Anyway, did we really need to see him high af every episode?"
Young Justice,"Ben Affleck was the bomb in Phantoms, yo"
Young Justice,It's a shame what YJ has become. This season is clearly just 'what's a popular old show we can cheap out on to draw in subscribers.'
Young Justice,This show fell so hard. First it goes on hiatus for years because some media executives threw a tantrum over low toy sales then when they finally bring it back it is so agenda driven that it’s unwatchable.
Young Justice,"This show has the potential of being close to the Justice League Unlimited I used to watch when I was younger 

I hope it gets renewed"
Young Justice,"Yeah, I struggled to get through it due to how cheap it looked this season.  The entire first arc on mars where they are speaking telepathically 99% of the time was also just so obnoxious to me.  I'm sure they saved some money not having to animate lips but yeah I couldn't give two shits about that entire storyline due to how it was delivered."
Young Justice,Greg Weisman said that was to save time. They pay Studio Mir the same amount either way.
Young Justice,"The last two seasons have been nothing more than stills.

This season in particular made me feel like I was watching a goddamn PowerPoint at times"
Young Justice,"Season 4 is at least an improvement over Season 3, which I think was the lowest point of the series with terrible dialogue and a recycled set up of the whole VR / Granny thing, which was a lot like Reach Cola /Reach thing, so much so that I was baffled anyone in that universe wouldn't see it a mile away. But I do agree Season 2 was the height of it so far. The dynamic of the show is just so different and feels very inorganically cobbled together, especially with how they've broken it up into different arcs and jumping around to characters."
Young Justice,"Hasn’t been the same since season 1. Each season has been pretty different from each other, some people don’t like but I think that’s one of the strengths of the show."
Young Justice,Nothing in show has been hinted at for Wally coming back. It's more just fans hoping for so long and the fact that he was killed/faded away after energy blast so people hope Speed Force.
Young Justice,"The introduction of new plots while not moving any previous ones was the primary reason I dropped the show hard.

I dunno if it was the extra episode count or being on streaming/made for binging, but the fact that it was spinning in place for nearly twenty episodes with little actually happening felt like a huge waste of my time."
Young Justice,"The whole overarching plot this season involves time travel, and he completely disappeared.  They assumed he died, but he clearly did not.  Wally is very dead, and will stay dead."
Young Justice,Did you see the mid season finale? >!SB seems to be alive!<
Young Justice,"Yeaaaah, if you didn't like that expanding cast aspect of S2, you dipped at the right time lol.

Season 3 is like that times ten, much to it's determent, to the point where it was basically a DC Universe show rather than YJ.

I haven't watched it yet, but supposedly S4 is a bit more focused and scaled down, with characters and plots split into three separate arcs."
Young Justice,Season 4 doubles down on the season 1 cast. Season 3 is less focused than season 2.
Young Justice,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYSrQlpjso4
Young Justice,"For depressed children on drugs, I go to Euphoria, not this show"
Young Justice,"Weren't they sleeping pills? I don't remember Beast boy being high, but I remember him looking exhausted. Trauma and grief can lead to a lack of sleep."
Young Justice,Agreed that arc was rough for me. If it was interspersed with other storylines I wouldn’t mind as much but like 3 or 4 episodes straight was a lot
Young Justice,"That’s been established how Martians communicate since day one, so no matter what that’s how it was gonna be when we finally saw Mars. Plus I doubt they saved any noticeable amount of money on lip animations. It was the later arcs where they were literally using slideshow animations that were the most jarring IMO."
Young Justice,"Actually greg clarified it doesn't save money it saves time 

Source https://www.reddit.com/r/youngjustice/comments/s88mj8/from_greg_weisman_himself_can_we_all_agree_to/"
Young Justice,"The mouth thing was a time saver, not money. They pay Studio Mir based on number of episodes."
Young Justice,Ahh okay. I hope they were given more time for this half of the season then
Young Justice,I could not give a flying fuck about that new team they were training. Or fire dudes and dead girls relationship. Terra could have been interesting but nope.
Young Justice,"There was literally an episode where Artemis is sent to purgatory to give her final goodbyes to Wally only for it to end with a reveal that it was actually just Miss Martian and Zatanna fucking with her. If that's not an obvious red herring for a ""Wally is actually alive and M'gann/Zatanna's mindfuckery is going to have ramifications"" plot then I don't know what is."
Young Justice,"Yet they pulled back from saying that definitively last season when Artemis’ goodbye was an illusion. If they wanted him to stay dead, why have that?"
Young Justice,"Yes I know, that's what generated this complaint. It's crazy that they're bringing >!Superboy!< back instead of Wally, comparing their two deaths.

Note that I honestly never considered that they weren't gonna bring >!Superboy!< back, simply because they killed him off in what, like the 3rd episode?

But regardless, I just think Wallys death lends itself much more to being reversed than >!Superboy's!< did."
Young Justice,And made on a third of the usual animation budget (because it was airing on the 2nd-string DCUniverse app).
Young Justice,"""Hiding mouths"" is a time honored animation tradition to avoid having to animate them.  Folding hands in front of the mouth, just showing the eyes, etc.  And I know that is how they communicate... doesn't make it any less obnoxious to me or makes me want to sit through it for four episodes.  Considering we had quite a few characters there who COULD talk with their mouths yet didn't made it even more obnoxious.  Slideshows sucked too, but they all contributed to the cheapness of this season."
Young Justice,But time is money
Young Justice,"That's because neither Brion nor Halo felt like actual characters.

The first would act stupid for the sake of plot, the second was just there to show off they're gore."
Young Justice,"That they lied to her can be, but at no point did it say Wally was alive. Just that Zatanna cannot contact the dead. They can still mine it for drama and not bring him back."
Young Justice,>!I think the saving grace for SB is the time travellers that were on the scene.!<
Young Justice,"Greg denies that there any budget cuts, if you're referring to the use of still shots, it was to save time."
Young Justice,Obviously they didn't come out and directly say it but it definitely feels like hint when that could have easily just been wally's ghost
Young Justice,"Yeah, definitely so.

I still think Wallys 'sucked into the speed force' death is a lot easier to come back from. I'm honestly shocked it's lasted as long as it has, never before in the comics, as far as I'm aware, has a 'sucked into the speed force' death been permanent."
Young Justice,"Well he wasn’t sucked into the speed force, he was just too slow to avoid those laser beams and got disintegrated. The head writer for the show is actually on record not caring for or understanding the need for a speed force."
Young Justice,"Isn't the speed force confirmed to exist in young Justice? I thought it was...

Besides, I think it'd be weird if the multiverse exists (confirmed this season) but the speed force didn't. 

But still. Yes, he did technically get disintegrated. But if I remember correctly, they didn't really show it, he just kinda faded away all at once. I still think that's a much easier death to come back from than a >!weakened Superboy getting killed by an Apocalyptic Kryptonite bomb!<.

All they'd have to do to explain Wally coming back is just say the words ""speed force."" and everybody would instantly understand."
Young Justice,"“Confirmed to exist” as in the writer pretty much said “yeah whatever maybe it’s around but nobody in this universe knows about it”. You really don’t need the speed force to go multiversal anyway, Marvel gets by just fine and hell so did DC up until the 90s when Mark Waid came up with it."
Young Justice,"Technically he was shown to vanish in a blinding flash of light, while his molecular structure broke down before that. Not necessarily disintegration.

But we've seen things like zeta beams break down a person's molecular structure on this show."
Young Justice,Consider me whelmed.
Young Justice,I only recently learned that the guy that created this is also the guy that created Gargoyles back in the 90s. Dude is a legit master at action-animation.
Young Justice,That trailer... felt very old fashioned. But at least I didn't have to wait six years between seasons 3 and 4.
Young Justice,"It's not on there for me, at least yet. I guess maybe after Fandome if anything?"
Young Justice,is the focus back on the OG charaters instead of the new team ?
Young Justice,Fuck yeah. Favorite DC show of all time. I was expecting 2022 honestly. So stoked.
Young Justice,"Gar was a real pos in these episodes. I get he's going through stuff, but jfc, every time he opened his mouth I wanted someone to slap the crap out of him."
Young Justice,I. Am. Surprised.
Young Justice,"Ironically, not that much surprise for Latin America. They sent to the press 2 weeks ago the content they would add and Young Justice season 4 was there lol

Everyone thought it was a mistake or so"
Young Justice,"Not renewed (yet?) for Season 5, hope it ends up being renewed."
Young Justice,"What?! Thank you for posting, I would have completely missed this!"
Young Justice,Hello Megan!
Young Justice,"I appreciated the ""Barzz Oom"" Easter egg name"
Young Justice,"I literally do not understand Megan. She changes how she looks and keeps saying how she wants people to see her. However, this is my favorite look for her."
Young Justice,"Ooohhh shit, man if they could just get that Season 1 magic back itd be one my favorite shows"
Young Justice,"Fucking loved the first two episodes.

It's a nice break from the ""main story"" and it's just interesting to see a completely original event."
Young Justice,I hope they drop the social media angle.  Thanks for the notice will watch the epsides.
Young Justice,"Huh, I was expecting and ready for the show to come out on the 21st. 

I guess episode 3 will be the 28th?

No idea about what happens in episodes 1 and 2, but hoping we see Brainiac-5, Lightning Lad and Bouncing Boy with the season 3 tease of the Legion."
Young Justice,"Was the third season any good?

I loved the first two but heard very middling things when the show came back."
Young Justice,Feeling the aster
Young Justice,I should really catch up with this show.
Young Justice,"Waaaay too Mars heavy, IMHO. I’m hoping more things take place on earth very soon and the leave the Martian race wars behind. Still, glad to see the show back!"
Young Justice,"As a fan of the first three seasons I'm really underwhelmed with the first two episodes of season 4. I feel the pacing was too slow and the issue at hand which was an obvious commentary on real life was incredibly ham fisted in the presentation.

Also most of the 2 episodes characters are just straight yelling. Like every scene has someone yelling. I think the dialogue can happen without the need for raised voices unless the situation actually calls for it. It was super annoying."
Young Justice,Wtf Meghan looking her age again? No way thought she was obligated to look like a soccer mom.
Young Justice,It's totally crash? What does that even mean?
Young Justice,It's hard to animate psychic communication without looking lazy and cheap. I want to like it but it's just not for me just like season 3. I don't know who their audience is anymore.
Young Justice,Hello Megan!
Young Justice,"He also created The Spectacular Spider-Man, WITCH and Star Wars: Rebels"
Young Justice,"I miss the Gargoyles :( To bad Disney owns them, thus either never getting more or some bastardized kids version that Disney would make."
Young Justice,And at least it's not another six year time jump between season 3 and 4.
Young Justice,Let’s goooo
Young Justice,Yep.
Young Justice,Have you only seen 1 DC show ever?
Young Justice,"I think once you consider all the factors it makes sense that he was being an ass. Isolated for a month, away from his friends and girlfriend, can't help the Outsiders, and he's constantly being brain blasted without consent which is likely causing stress since the whole VR google incident."
Young Justice,This update is totally crashing the mode.
Young Justice,"Superboy using the the word ""grok"" was also a nice touch."
Young Justice,Season 1 magic?
Young Justice,"[Greg Weisman said next Thursday, weekly after that](https://twitter.com/Greg_Weisman/status/1449476660336619524)"
Young Justice,What?
Young Justice,"It's slang used by the character Impulse (he's from the future). The mode = bad, so crashing it = good."
Young Justice,Young justice fans obviously
Young Justice,IIRC he was only really involved with season 1 of rebels
Young Justice,"He didn't create *W.I.T.C.H.* 

He was story-runner on the second season, as I recall--which dealt with a lot more complex themes than the first season."
Young Justice,I love Rebels. It wasn't as good as Clone Wars but it ended up being a blast. Not surprised he had a hand.  Haven't seen the other two though. I'll have to check it out.
Young Justice,"There are some studios that make good stuff. Ducktales 2017, most Marvel shows, Bad Batch etc. Maybe... just maybe we will get a real revival :("
Young Justice,Uhhh... Gargoyles was originally made by Disney.
Young Justice,They could always make a bastardized live action version too
Young Justice,Didn’t Disney always own them?
Hannibal,"I liked big chunks of it, but could not get into the Graham character."
Hannibal,"Don't worry about it not ending.  The 3rd season ends in a good enough place to where it feels like a complete story.  

As for them not catching on to Hannibal, the story becomes more about if Will **wants** to catch him or not.  Season 2 and 3 get pretty trippy and are built more like a psyco-sexual love story than a detective story.  More Dracula than Jack the Ripper.  I loved it but ymmv."
Hannibal,"*Hannibal* takes place in a very heightened, borderline surrealist version of the real world. Like, yes, the FBI exists and Hannibal is really a psychiatrist who sees patients and the world of the show is semi-grounded, but…

As you know, OP, the show is very interested in these weird, dream-like fantasy spaces that Will, Hannibal, the killers of the week, and some other choice characters inhabit. This is all to say that Hannibal running circles around the FBI is perhaps not realistic, but the show is not very concerned with realism. I mean, the murder tableaus the killers construct are completely insane and essentially impossible for one person to stage, but they are accepted as part of the show’s reality. Also, considering the show’s focus on psychology and mind games, it makes some sense that Hannibal’s smarts and ability to manipulate people make it so that the FBI struggle to touch him. He is extremely good at fooling/seducing/prodding and mentally outmaneuvering others in general.

The show only becomes more dreamlike (while still mapping out cogent plotting, to be fair) from season two onwards, so if that’s not your thing then maybe it’s not for you.

Edit: Also the show is a masterpiece. Somewhat forgot to mention that."
Hannibal,I thought people just watched it for the food porn
Hannibal,You say that but season 2 is one of my favorite seasons of all time.
Hannibal,Forcing yourself to watch something you don't like is always fun and just a smart move in general.
Hannibal,"Season 2 was my favorite season.

The whole thing was a pressure cooker of a time. Just be patient."
Hannibal,S2 is where it really takes off
Hannibal,"I thought the first 2 seasons were amazing. 3 was a chore to get through. If you're not into the characters enough to keep watching things unfold, then sure hang it up now. I will say though season 2 is worth watching especially for Michael Pitt's performance as Mason Verger."
Hannibal,"My problem with Hannibal is that there was NEVER any actual light or comedic moments that made me laugh or even grin. With heavier shows like Dexter or even Chernobyl there were a few genuinely funny moments. With that being said, I loved the performances, and the production team knocked it out of the park. I just wish they had hired one or two funny writers on the team."
Hannibal,Lol the fight being the season 2 cut thing also killed the show for me
Hannibal,"I watched a few episodes during a road trip, always heard rave reviews but honestly the graham character was so uninteresting I just never picked it back up once the trip was over."
Hannibal,"I hate that people in the show act like Hannibal was some sort of a supernatural entity. Just shot him, he's just a man for fucks sake"
Hannibal,[deleted]
Hannibal,"I think that was the whole point as Hannibal is a psychopath, he wanted to see what would happen."
Hannibal,"First season, both Hannibal and will were connected to a bunch of murders...and Will was blamed.

Hannibal's plot armor was ridiculous."
Hannibal,"I had some issues with season 2, but if anything the final episode of season 2 is one of the best hours of television out there"
Hannibal,He’s the reason I watched the show to begin with. Did not disappoint.
Hannibal,"There's quite a lot of black and dry snark an from Hannibal, Chilton, Gideon and sometimes Mason imo Hannibal and Chilton especially. I often found their smug asides, facial expressions and insinuations humorous but I get humour is subjective but the lines are certainly intended to be read that way. It's more a season 2 thing as the case of the week gives way to serialization."
Hannibal,"The second time I watched it I noticed most of the time it was a dark comedy. 

The third time I realised it was a romcom.

Where’s Jack? ^In ^the ^pantry."
Hannibal,"So, you're telling me you did not even smirk when Will said 'Now we're even. Even Steven.""???"
Hannibal,"I think that was pretty intentional, whether it worked for you or not. Bryan Fuller (the showrunner and writer on the show) certainly isn't a humorless guy, and most of his other shows have had pretty strong comedic elements (Wonderfalls, Pushing Daisies, American Gods).

I don't think Hannibal was entirely humorless, but I agree that overall it has a very grim and unsettling tone to it. I think for me the weird stylistic stuff gave it almost a dreamlike quality and kept it from feeling too oppressively dark."
Hannibal,"I thought it had good dark comedy, I thought stuff like Verger saying “oh you gotta write me a prescription for this” during that whole crazy drug trip or Will’s sarcasm made me laugh - also Hannibal had some real smug shit-eating lines 

Funny enough the actual comedic relief - the two dudes doing the autopsies and whatnot - actually annoyed me 😹"
Hannibal,"There is a lot of dark comedy in this show.

Not light moments but there was comedy for certain."
Hannibal,Why should there be? It isn't a comedy show
Hannibal,"Lol, because for some they like the psychological aspect of it. To some it is too grotesque. To some boring, or artistic. It really is not any different than any other series out there that has a following, but others don't like. I'm sure there are plenty that you like, than many don't."
Hannibal,"I don’t know how romantic their relationship is, but it’s the best part of the series in my opinion. They’re the only two people who really know each other."
Hannibal,I don’t know the word for their dynamic but they are definitely like magnetic for each other. And that’s what makes them great. It’s a different kind of wanting.
Hannibal,I feel like I haven't heard Bryan Fuller's name associated with something new for a while now. Is he working on anything that he'll end up abandoning after a year of production?
Hannibal,"It was never queerbaiting, but it also was much more nuanced than just shipping two characters and then waiting for their connection to be confirmed as explicitly romantic.

Will and Hannibal have something far more intimate, and it’s no coincidence that both characters also each possess heightened states of awareness (empathy for Will, smell for Hannibal); they both understand one another so deeply that it makes the moral struggle for Will’s soul at the center of their conflict all the more meaningful. Neither wants to be the other’s enemy, and their intimacy and connection makes it one of the most compelling relationships in any series.

In many ways, they complete one another, but their entire story has a tragic quality of being doomed from the outset, since there’s no place in the world for the kind of existence Hannibal tries to tempt Will with. It’s a tragic romance that makes for one of the best “hero”-villain dynamics ever explored."
Hannibal,"Agreed, there's definitely *intimacy* and a sort of attraction portrayed in the show, but neither are sexual, at least not necessarily. Whether people *feel* baited by reading into it I don't know, but the overarching problem will always be discomfort and sexualization of male intimacy in our culture."
Hannibal,Old TV show and a slow news day
Hannibal,I'm queer and the way unfulfilled homoeroticism in fiction is vilified now is soooo boring
Hannibal,"Could Hannibal daily feel a stab of hunger and be satisfied at the sight of Will? 

Yes. 

But does Will feel the same? 

Probably. 

How can a show that pays off the love story be baiting? Hannibal got what he always wanted for the two of them. Will always knew he must kill Hannibal regardless of what he might have felt or wanted and Hannibal loved Will because Will Graham would do what he must. The wrath of the lamb."
Hannibal,"While queer baiting is an annoying trend in some circles, the idea that any piece of art that gestures at romance but doesn’t explicitly show it is somehow problematic is just so dumb. It’s called “subtlety,” people. *Hannibal* — and that central relationship — is an extremely romantic show. The imagery, the direction, the music, the writing of those characters… it’s all right there for the viewer to parse.

Pretty annoying (and ironic) that there are seemingly tons of people who balk at sex and nudity on TV and *also* people who throw a fit when there isn’t explicit romance between some characters. You can’t win with these losers."
Hannibal,Only thing I’m accusing Hannibal of was have a terrible sound mix.
Hannibal,Queerbaiting is when two guys have an intimate relationship without boning
Hannibal,Indie Wire is an absolute turd of a website. Can we please stop posting their clickbait garbage?
Hannibal,When a shows characters are too complex for idiots to understand:
Hannibal,I bought swampland in Florida but got this article instead.
Hannibal,Honestly if you give a shit about this you need to realign your priorities
Hannibal,"I think explicitly sexualising the dynamic between Will and Hannibal would obfuscate the nature of what characterises their growing intimacy - namely, the pull towards killing and the growingly synchronous way that Will and Hannibal view the ""artistry"" of their violence. It would be a waste of words to argue that there's *nothing* queer about the relationship, as Fuller explicitly frames the queer nature of their relationship in the article:

*“It certainly started out as a non-sexual same-sex couple experiencing a greater intimacy than they’ve ever experienced before. Then being able to transition through that to an intimacy that was qualified as love. Then a physical intimacy between them, where they are both penetrating a man, that is a culmination of their relationship with each other. Then falling into each other’s arms and over a cliff.""*

However, it is *allegorical,* they aren't normative lovers because the relationship doesn't exist along normative lines. Hannibal is drawn because of Will's unique hyperempathic capacity to see the world through the eyes of a killer. He wants to erode Will's inhibitions and completely share his perspective and ""art"" with him - since Will is the only person who will ever be capable of understanding him. Everything else (love, sex, friendship, parenting Abigail) is just set dressing for attaining the end of extending his capacity as a horrifying, predatory force of nature.

I know Fuller states that it ""*became explicitly queer in terms of the conversation about loving each other and where that love was going to take them*"", but this is not love as we know it - it is love as Hannibal knows and experiences it. As they grow closer, it is probable that they will be taken to dark places (e.g. at the table with Bedelia), but the idea that they will have something resembling a normative romantic relationship doesn't square with the forces which bind them together."
Hannibal,Again that weird US obsession with sex-related love and romanticism. Bonds between people are not necessarily that.
Hannibal,"Imagine if he still run Interview With a Vampire lol, by this time Lestate and Louis would have just gotten to the long silent pauses as they sit across a table. 

Lecture would have still beat the shit out Louis but the far they would have gone would be looking at each other's lips.  THE HIGHT OF INTEMANCY!

jk still love ya B.
Idk about the car move but id love another show."
Hannibal,"Stupid shippers be like, ""You are Gay, They are Gay, Everyone is Gay!"""
Hannibal,"man, who gives a shit. Even if that were the case, who cares?"
Hannibal,"I like how this show started out as forensics and ended as a gay relationship where neither man was gay. You can tell they stopped giving a fuck about making something commercial.

Oh, he killed Beverly!"
Hannibal,Whole show is cynical.
Hannibal,"Hasn't every show he's ever worked on had massive issues with this that he keeps just going ""What? Noooo that's a you problem""?"
Hannibal,"It was all kinds of what the kids call ‘queer’, and that’s a much trickier thing to pull off. Even Asexual people can see their own relationships in the deep relationship between the key characters.

Also there’s a lesbian couple who have sex on screen."
Hannibal,😑
Hannibal,"I thought it was pretty clear that it's romantic. The scene where Bedelia tells Will Hannibal is in love with him and asks if Will ""aches"" for Hannibal and we don't see his answer (or maybe he doesnt answer at all, I don't remember) and he's still chasing after him, combined with their ""death"" scene I felt was pretty obvious. I always just thought Hannibal was Will's only exception, so to speak. Hannibal even got them a kid and a honeymoon! Very romantic. Such a shame he had to stab Will and take Bedelia instead last second. 

Jokes aside, Fuller has stated that their relationship was intended to be romantic because it was at first meant to just be obsessive but over time just sort of naturally grew into a romance as well, and they apparently filmed a kiss for the last episode that never made it in. I think he wrote that it always felt incredibly obvious to him, but that he also didn't wanna ""push it into your face"" so to speak, because he was scared of it being considered pandering. 

Instead, it apparently caused some confusion on something that was clear to some people but vague to others. Damn shame in my opinion, and an example of reactionary social media nowadays getting into authors' heads and fucking with their self confidence.

tl;dr theyre in wuv"
Hannibal,"I think a show accurate way of describing it would be that their relationship is the shadow cast by romantic love. The silhouette of love, but filled with an impenetrable darkness. But I would have liked them to kiss at the end. For closure."
Hannibal,Season 2 was so damn good
Hannibal,Admiration. That is the best way I can describe it. Will admires Hannibal's brilliance and Hannibal admired his empathy and problem solving. Amazing writing all around.
Hannibal,"He just recently released a documentary series on Shudder called Queer for Fear: the history of Queer Horror, if that’s anything you’d be interested in. Outside of that I don’t know what the hell he’s up to these days. I think I heard him say in a podcast a while back that he was working on a new adaption of Stephen King’s Christine"
Hannibal,I think we’re all still a little sad about Pushing Daisies.
Hannibal,He’s actually stayed with more projects to their cancellation than he has left projects early. But it’s a closer number than it should be.
Hannibal,"Last major thing I heard he's working on is a remake of Stephen King's *Christine*, which he'll also be directing."
Hannibal,we're all still mourning Pushing Daisies
Hannibal,">but the overarching problem will always be discomfort and sexualization of male intimacy in our culture

We definitely need to get over our discomfort of male intimacy as a culture, but I actually think the first and most important step for that is to completely discard the “no homo” mindset and fully embrace that a deep and intimate relationship with another man will inevitably share a lot of similarities with the relationships of gay men, who are also having a deep and intimate relationship with another man. We need to fully deconstruct our society’s belief that male intimacy is the sole domain of gay dudes and become completely comfortable with embracing our friends in a way where we don’t care whether people think we’re gay or straight. That will also inevitably lead to the realization that the belief in “sexualization of male intimacy” as a problem is itself a product of that same dynamic we just deconstructed."
Hannibal,The article and Fuller very clearly state that the two are falling into a homosexual relationship.
Hannibal,"[That's exactly what Anthony Mackie was complaining about a while ago.](https://www.syfy.com/syfy-wire/anthony-mackie-sam-bucky-friendship-bromance-falcon-winter-soldier)           





Basically, he was frustrated that because Sam and Bucky shared some sensitive moments people just started going “they’re gay” and shipped them. I don’t believe it to be coming from a homophobic place, more of asking a question - why does the fact that a man has sensitive moments with another man make people assume they’re gay with each other? I think it’s ok to ask that question.      




It is pretty much saying “only gay men can be sensitive and if your male character shows sensitivity with another man he must be gay.” People are more complex than that. A man could be effeminate but not gay, or could be a “man’s man” and also be gay. A well-written character should also share that complexity"
Hannibal,">but the overarching problem will always be discomfort and sexualization of male intimacy in our culture.

My perspective is that of a gay woman who in past shows would, for my own entertainment, decide I'm gonna pretend these two characters are together (biggest example that comes to mind is ADA Cabot and detective Olivia Benson in SVU). 

One of the reasons I would read into interactions what is or isn't there is because back in the day there were not a lot of options to see a genuine lesbian relationship on my TV. The level of closeness and intimacy that you see all the time portrayed between a man+woman wasn't something queer audiences got to experience often if at all. So when you'd find a show that portrays a relationship that seems deeper than a typical friendship portrayal, you get a bit excited. And you assign this additional context to the scene. 

So I would say it's not just a discomfort but sometimes a response to something you don't get a lot of but would like to. So when you see hints of it, you latch on. And often what you're reading into the scenes is not what's happening. But then sometimes it feels like it's exactly what they want you to think even if it's not what's happening. Hence the queer baiting label."
Hannibal,This is well said
Hannibal,"The “at least not necessarily” is what makes it queer baiting, or as I like to call it schrodingers gays."
Hannibal,"I don’t know if you’re a fan or know much about what’s going on right now, but fans are petitioning for another season and the director/actors are viewing another season favorably"
Hannibal,"Yeah fr. Everything is labeled 'queerbaiting' nowadays, like personally I love me some homoeroticism over explicitly , it adds layers"
Hannibal,"Killing Eve died when the writers gave in to the fans crying about 'queerbaiting' and made Villanelle and Eve 100% lesbian, one of the coolest parts of the show for me was how complex and imbalanced the two characters' sexualities were. S2 was alright but I gave up after S3E1."
Hannibal,"I’m totally with you. I like some veiled homoerotic tension, it’s when movies put it in to avoid controversy by having explicitly queer characters that it bugs me. The monk and his beefy boy in Rogue One being an example of the bad kind. Disney sucks for this."
Hannibal,The kids don’t understand how difficult it is to get gay content in TV and major films.
Hannibal,"I think that queer baiting is frustrating to see because this kind of ""leave it up to the viewer"" thing **only** seems to happen with same sex relationships. If we saw a similar trend with opposite sex relationships, I'd get it, but as far as I can see, it's not the case. If you have any examples of hetero relationships as a counterpoint, then fair enough.


Queer baiting won't ruin a show for me on its own and I don't need to see characters have sex on screen to confirm the relationship, but it's a trend that has been long outgrown and the current talking point of ""intimate male friendship is misunderstood by fujoshis"" is being applied with broad strokes wherever the phrase queer baiting is mentioned, regardless of merit. I'm just tired of the lack of nuance from both sides.

I can love Hannibal as a show and still wish that we got that kiss scene."
Hannibal,"I actually believe people just like labels in these scenarios. Everything needs to be defined nicely and tied up with a bow. No room for interpretation and that's what's taking the life out of any type of media. 

Allow people the room to put themselves in there instead of restricting access."
Hannibal,"Except it wasn't just ""stupid shippers"" seeing something that wasn't there. When they were shooting the series finale, they literally filmed takes of Will and Hannibal kissing during the final scene and chose to not use them in the final product."
Hannibal,"I don’t necessarily think that Hannibal can love, not in the way normal people do. Will as well, to a lesser extent. They both see a bit of themselves in the other, they can understand each other, and they allow the other to see themselves without their masks on. 

I do think there is a love there, or something that looks like it. The shape but not the full form. But not the traditional romantic love. Which is what I think Fuller was building towards. If it’s love, but not in a way that that’s supposed to be truly understandable to the average viewer."
Hannibal,"> I think he wrote that it always felt incredibly obvious to him, but that he also didn't wanna ""push it into your face"" so to speak

I think he played it perfectly"
Hannibal,This concept of wuv confuses and infuriates us!
Hannibal,Hear me out. Full. Penetration.
Hannibal,[deleted]
Hannibal,"I half wish a Pushing Daisies episode had come out during the height of the zombie TV craze, then at the end Ned wakes up and is like ""i had the worst dream Chuck"""
Hannibal,"I absolutely agree with your take. 

A big part of the problem is the constant quantifier of male friendships a la 'its not a gay thing but they hug a lot'. If we can just get rid of that kind of thinking then ultimately it won't matter whether it is or not. 

And especially right now when more and more people speak out about how lonely they are I think it is important to embrace a dynamic that a lot of men especially only associate with romantic partners."
Hannibal,"people ship characters who in-fiction legit hate each other all the time, it's not about the scene being innocent. Shippers project their own head cannon into the story because to them it's more fun that way, the only problem ends up being when someone doesn't have a healthy separation from the art and they actually get angry about it"
Hannibal,"I don't feel it's male sensitivity per se. Fandoms have been ""shipping"" characters in the same show for awhile now. While some of these ships are due to things in the story, many times it's just 2 characters that a group of that fandom are attracted to.

Sam and Buckey aren't ugly and sure have some fans that think they are good looking. Just being the same show and they probably would have been shipped, even without that scene. Just like how many fans shipped Sam and Dean from Supernatural (who are clearly brothers and not romantically linked)."
Hannibal,"Reminds of Sam and Frodo in the LotR, people can’t see two men show affection for each other without screaming “gayyy”. Although these days it’s less derogatory, but still ignorant."
Hannibal,"The thing I find sad about it is if a man thinks that they’ve clearly never had a meaningful male friendship.

If a woman thinks that they clearly don’t understand good male friendships.

Dread to think of the number of people peddling this narrative that must fall into the above."
Hannibal,"Same with Sam and Frodo. 
Sure, gay representation is important and there should be more of it but not at the cost of being able to show emotional friendships between two men.
Or even men and women actually, the more these things are shown the more they are normalized and we can slowly chip away at certain aspects that lead to unrealistic expectations.

It's why I'm also quite happy with the growing trend in shounen anime that shows more and more platonic friendships between boys&girls with zero romantic tension between them."
Hannibal,"Quote from the article:

> “So many things are twisted and convoluted. There’s so many things that people latch on to with their own devices to make themselves relevant and rational,” Mackie said. “The idea of two guys being friends and loving each other in 2021 is a problem because of the exploitation of homosexuality. It used to be guys can be friends, we can hang out, and it was cool. You would always meet your friends at the bar, you know. You can’t do that anymore, because something as pure and beautiful as homosexuality has been exploited by people who are trying to rationalize themselves. So something that’s always been very important to me is showing a sensitive masculine figure. There’s nothing more masculine than being a superhero and flying around and beating people up. But there’s nothing more sensitive than having emotional conversations and a kindred spirit friendship with someone that you care about and love.”

Honestly kinda a weird and confusing take from him. I also want more sensitive straight guys, but there’s literally nothing remotely problematic about wondering if two sensitive dudes wanna fuck each other. I think he’s really overthinking it here and to be honest he does come across as pretty defensive and a little resentful of anybody that thought they might be gay—but whatever it’s just some random quote and doesn’t really matter much.

Also I can’t speak for everyone, but I personally just thought they might be gay because of that scene where they land on top of each other and also the therapy scene where they intertwine legs—which I personally read as similar to the romantic tropes you might see between a man and a woman. Me thinking they might be gay had nothing to do with their sensitivity or how deep their friendship was, I just genuinely thought the writers might be setting that up by including those tropes.

**Edit: Curious what people disagree with here that is causing them to downvote. Feel free to leave a comment if you wanna have a discussion.**"
Hannibal,"Remembering that they said they shot some kissing takes does put a bit of a wrench in my argument. I should say that a *bigger* problem is the discomfort I talked about, along with a dearth of genuine gay relationships in mainstream media."
Hannibal,You could have said that any time for the last several years
Hannibal,That will never happen because one of the main actors is happy on law & order.
Hannibal,Killing Eve died when Phoebe Waller Bridge was no longer the head writer
Hannibal,"Gotta disagree, not a huge fan but the books actually ended with Eve and Villanelle happily in a relationship. I'm still unsure why the show deviated from the source material as it was really touching. Killing Eve is one of the few shows where I agree with the queerbating angle (speaking as a bisexual woman)."
Hannibal,Agreed!
Hannibal,"Typical ""woke"" morons who think they can bully an out, homosexual cinematic genius into molding his show to an artistically dead propaganda vehicle.  Go back to shipping Batwoman!"
Hannibal,"As I said, I think it’s a legit gripe sometimes, and you’re right about there being few heterosexual examples (Mulder and Scully is the biggest one I can think of). But the way it’s getting thrown around (like so many other buzzwords that people fundamentally misunderstand) is getting a bit ridiculous. And, like, it’s fine that you wanted them to kiss — a lot of people did while still enjoying the show, which was excellent. But when people start suggesting that those characters *should have kissed*, as if the writers behind the show were cruelly and incorrectly depriving the audience of that, that’s where I draw the line. That can lead to toxic fandom in which people are claiming ownership over something they didn’t create and isn’t theirs.

I don’t think the show was ever about explicit interpersonal romance in the traditional sense. In fact, it was about an extremely unique, extremely taboo, very obviously untraditional sort of intimacy between them that I think a ‘climactic’ kiss or some reveal that they’re both bisexual would have dumbed down quite a bit, honestly. But that’s just me. I’d argue that the two of them teaming up to take down Dolarhyde and then jumping (or, Will pushing Hannibal — it’s left a bit ambiguous) off that cliff *is the kiss*, for all intents and purposes. 

Queer-baiting (when it does actually happen) is essentially indebted to the “will they or won’t they” trope of two main characters on a sitcom taking years before they get together. It’s a tried and true device that gets viewers coming back for more and waiting for the eventual hook-up. When it’s being clearly dangled and never given in a context like that, I’m more inclined to call it what it is. Then it becomes part of the bigger issue of media being super chaste with regards to showing gay sex and gay intimacy. That’s finally changing, at least a little bit."
Hannibal,"Absolutely agree, thanks for sharing your point of view."
Hannibal,It’s weird that it comes from the same people who are so vocally against labels and defining people neatly though.
Hannibal,"Eh, he did state that the line ""I see you."" was Hannibal's declaration of love to Will, and I'd argue that being able to wholly see each other is a lot more crucial to romantic love than anything else.

All the murder aside (LOL) I do think Hannibal can love and I think Will is it for him. He clearly shows emotions and care for those he respects or finds interesting, he just views those more as pets or experiments while viewing the rest of the world as livestock. He didn't save Bedelia because he could use her later, he saved her cause he thought she was interesting and wanted to see what she would do, which already put her above the patient who was trying to kill her. Kind of like a fun science project.

The way he's treated Will has from the start been much more a show of devotion than anything. You never see him actually reach out to a ""project"" and go up to them and seek their attention and mutual appreciation like he does with will, he always just goes with the flow and just kind of comes across them willy nilly, but he actually seeks Will out all the time. Hell, the sole reason he manipulated Abigail into being dependent on him was so that she'd be dependent on him and stay so that Will could play house & live his dream of being a dad.

Sure they might not hold hands and buy each other flowers, but I think if you put them as a team in like, a medical series like ER or something, their behavior towards each other would 100% read as love. It's just that the way Hannibal shows love and dedication is by, you know...manipulating traumatized children and putting sculptures made out of dead bodies symbolizing his love for Will in Italian chapels. Which, you do you boo, I guess."
Hannibal,"It’s not love- they both struggle with the idea of losve. It’s *intimacy*.  This desire for intimacy conflicts with both Will’s duty to stop Hannibal and Hannibal’s desire to pursue his passions. Will’s sense of duty and Hannibal’s passion have been unstoppable, immutable, driving forces for their entire existences up until this point. 

This sudden Achilles heel in their entire engine left them both reeling in different ways. Ultimately their mutual need to control the others’ *otherness* if you will, was the schism that blew it all apart. 

Interesting twist on the original works."
Hannibal,"I would describe their relationship more as intimate rather than romantic. Romance implies certain things that relationship is completely devoid of and, as you said, perhaps even things these characters are incapable of.

Not every deep, meaningful and fulfilling relationship needs to be romantic to be so. It's a weird, somewhat fetishistic, and honestly rather reductive lens to view relationships. So no surprise redditors jump on it."
Steins;Gate,I have a really bad feeling about this.
Steins;Gate,"oh no, not again."
Steins;Gate,"There's a heck of alot on steins gate that gets a pass because it's an anime. Not to say that those elements suck, but you have cultural context that doesn't work outside the medium. The OTT wannabe mad scientist, the smirky, innapropreate otaku, the unrelenting cute routine of the friend. These will be cringe as fuck in a western setting, just like it was in death note. 

The core concept is unique, but strip everything else away and it isn't stiensgate, especially considering how the reboot comes into play."
Steins;Gate,This is not the choice of steins;gate.
Steins;Gate,"No.

No. No. No."
Steins;Gate,"Oof boy. That Death Note movie pretty much poisoned, collapsed, and set on fire the well for Anime to Hollywood adaptations. It’s fucking BOLD for them to attempt it again with something like Stein;Gate."
Steins;Gate,"I honestly can't imagine what an actual person would look like trying to go full Houoin Kyouma.

In all honesty I don't really see any way this will be adapted while maintaining the core of the show."
Steins;Gate,"I think the only good western live action adaption of an anime/manga property was Edge of Tomorrow? And that was because it's so far removed from the source material that you have to view it as its own thing.

I love Steins;Gate, and the Sci;ADV franchise is one of my all time favorites. I really hope it's good because otherwise it's going to be really hard for me to watch.

At least seeing how they localize the character names should be amusing. How much do you guys wanna bet that they make ""Mayuri"" into ""Mary""?"
Steins;Gate,"Thinking about the casting. I can assume it won’t be the exact same characters and names, that’s fine since I don’t mind the idea of exploring a story in another culture (which is why I didn’t hate the *idea* of the Death Note film. Execution though-) 

but the two leads will have to be absolutely perfect together. 

I guess I’m also thinking “why Hollywood?” It’s not exactly a story that warrants a budget that only an American studio can provide, I’m sure a Japanese crew could make something pretty neat themselves. Guess we’ll have to wait and see. 

Oh I know she’s a 0 character but I wouldn’t say no to an appearance from Hiyajo Maho (or her Western counterpart), aka best girl of last decade."
Steins;Gate,"It's the most intriguing time travel concept I've ever seen.  Most series go with the ""body and mind being placed in the past"" deal, but Steins;Gate brings fresh ideas to the table in the most unexpected way.  This could be good for the mainstream viewers."
Steins;Gate,"I wonder if they are going to try to incorporate the Japanese culture from Steins;Gate into this or just take the bare bones plot. I just hope they cast Asian actors, but it'll probably still suck in the end."
Steins;Gate,I guess this seems like one you could actually pull off. Definitely the best time travel story I have watched.
Steins;Gate,"Of all the terrible ideas in the history of terrible ideas, this is one of them."
Steins;Gate,I am optimist and hope this tilts more towards Edge of Tomorrow adaptation rather than Death Note adaptation.
Steins;Gate,Oh no.....
Steins;Gate,"Hollywood Studio: We are making a live-action adaption of an anime.

Me: No you're not. This will literally never come out."
Steins;Gate,This one at least has potential. There's no inhuman movements or magic involved. But we know how Death Note turned out so.....
Steins;Gate,"Fuck no...

Although I will say that stiens;gate is one of the more adaptable anime for live action but the level of cringe would be awful if a massive rewrite isn’t done... but that would sort of defeat the point of adapting it"
Steins;Gate,"I'm actually interested in this, heard good things about altered carbon and Steins;Gate isn't really too difficult to adapt to western tv as long as you keep the major overview.

So things like Titor, CERN, IBM, mad scientist angle etc, I don't think the Japanese side of things need to be brought across. 

One thing that's going to be really important is the dialogue, the dub especially feels Sorkin esque with brisk back and forths as characters bounce off of each other throwing in insults wherever they can, and I think for this show to work that needs to be kept.

The big question now is do they keep the Ruka storyline, trans characters are an interesting area to explore but if not handled correctly they can really cause issues.

But on the other hand Death Note should have been ridiculously easy to adapt and that was a travesty, so we'll see, this being announced by 5pb. means the original creative team are heavily involved as we've not even seen an announcement from the western side as of yet. So that could hopefully avoid the issues Death Note had."
Steins;Gate,The only positive is that hopefully the original creators get some money
Steins;Gate,huh... They will probably miss the point but OK whatever.
Steins;Gate,Uh oh
Steins;Gate,anime+live action=doomed
Steins;Gate,DO NOT RUIN IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Steins;Gate,"As a big fan (reason of this account's username) I just want to say: don't do it, please. Stop."
Steins;Gate,[deleted]
Steins;Gate,It will suck. Now let´s get on with our lives.
Steins;Gate,"Fuck, why?  Stop trying to make live action anime.  It never works."
Steins;Gate,"They butchered Altered Carbon,they'll butcher this."
Steins;Gate,"well fuck me... ww3 almost happened, australia up in flames and now this. i hate 2020"
Steins;Gate,Interesting. I've often wondered how this concept might turn out if it were written by people who have possibly spoken to an actual human being before.
Steins;Gate,because it will be terrible.
Steins;Gate,"Hollywood does live action adaptions of popular animated shows because they bank on the existing fanbase to see it, or spread positive word of mouth about it.

If the existing fanbase muddies the waters by slinging so much shit over the idea of a live action movie that their marketing team can't possibly build hype around it, the project will likely be cancelled.

The only saving grace this has is that it's a television series, which means they might have the ability to honestly capture the characters. And it won't be some dumb action movie."
Steins;Gate,"Keep in mind, they've had an SAO series in development since 2016, it's pretty much in development hell. They promised the characters would be Asian in 2018, but nothing from it since."
Steins;Gate,"Some of the major elements of Steins;Gate are Akihabara and Moe. I imagine this adaptation will of course remove those things. I also predict that the gang will be ""diverse"" and ""inclusive""; with Daru the only character played by an asian."
Steins;Gate,They will change the character's personalities like they did in Death Note which will make it worse.
Steins;Gate,"I think a good amount of those aspects could work in live action if toned down a bit, especially since Kurisu kind of acts as a straight man to the insanity of the FGL. But too much of it is tied to already niche and strange aspects/tropes of Japanese culture. I feel like a lot of that would need to be gutted for a western audience. That said, I do think the core of the show is one of the most adaptable (and interesting) in anime, but even then, I don’t see a good adaption ever coming from it, just based on the history of these things"
Steins;Gate,"Most of the characters can be westernized without too much issue, I think.  I don't know what you do about Akihabara/Faris/moe culture in general though, none of that would translate well at all.  You'd almost have to set it somewhere else I think, with Faris's interests being changed accordingly, but that's a pretty major change."
Steins;Gate,"Like it was on Death Note?

They changed everything in Death Note. Light turns into an awkward loser, Misa is in charge of the relationship and I don't even know about L.

Problem with American adaptations is not that the ""weird"" cultural differences don't work, is that they don't keep the original characterization.

Remember when Goku was an awkward high schooler with dating problems?"
Steins;Gate,"Don't forget the miko girl Lukako

I wonder if they'll turn him into a literal shaman girl lol"
Steins;Gate,"Yes because no live action media of any kind featured an over the top mad scientist character. 

Come on, you're exaggerating so much. All the characters can adapt almost 1:1. Okabe can be a OTT mad scientist, Daru can just be a weeb or a comic book nerd, Kurisu can stay basically the same, and Mayuri can also stay mostly the same except saying Tuturu (idk what ""cute routine"" you're referring to).

The only major change that need to be made is the setting. In the source it's Akihabara and time travel gets rid of the otaku culture. idk what the American equivalent to this would be tbh so the writers have some work to do."
Steins;Gate,THIS IS THE WORK OF THE ORGANIZATION.
Steins;Gate,Maybe if they hire some writers/directors who aren't hacks then it could turn out good.
Steins;Gate,It's not like Japan does a good job at it's live action adaptions.
Steins;Gate,"they get knocked down, they get up again   you never going to keep them from trying to milk every last dollar from every property in existence"
Steins;Gate,The Rurouni Kenshin movies have become the gold standard for anime/manga adaptations. But they lend themselves somewhat well to live action because a lot of it can come down to just Samurai battles with a bit of super human abilities mixed in.
Steins;Gate,But Willem Defoe as ryuk tho...
Steins;Gate,">I honestly can't imagine what an actual person would look like trying to go full Houoin Kyouma.

Maybe like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACUpr5GvVsE

Although, it probably helps that he's wearing a mask."
Steins;Gate,"All you need is an actor with good onscreen charisma who can be weird. Also if you establish that he's mostly just playing around for his friends entertainment, and that he only ""kinda"" doing it semi-seriously, he can basically do any insane thing he wants.  It's important that Mayuri and Faris are there at first to enable him to do the act, and that Makise gets very annoyed by it and forces him to act serious.

In fact, you probably want it to be a little too much, because of the dramatic events that happen deeper in the story, especially when he hears from his much more mature (but still playful) future self."
Steins;Gate,I would cast Andrew Scott
Steins;Gate,[Could make it work like this](https://youtu.be/9vl6m9EN_ec)
Steins;Gate,Edge of tomorrow isn’t even a manga adaptation. It’s an adaptation of a book that happens to have a manga adaptation. By the same logic it’s a comic book movie because the book also has a graphic novel adaptation.
Steins;Gate,Alita Battle Angel counts I think
Steins;Gate,I liked Speed Racer.
Steins;Gate,"Even worse... what if they just give her a name like 'Hannah' and that's about it?, oh dear God it's going to be terrible..."
Steins;Gate,"It seems Hollywood does a much better job when they are influenced by the anime, but not necessarily attempting to adapt the anime itself. So many things in anime just don't translate well to live action, and even less so if you put in the cultural differences in Hollywood."
Steins;Gate,">“why Hollywood?”

Let me try answering that with what I think happened...

1. They decided they needed more money still.
2. Someone said ""anime is popular, right?, let's make yet another adaptation!""
3. They took a phone out and googled 'top anime' and opened the first link (MyAnimeList).
4. They saw FMA at the top but thought it was 'too cartoony'.
5. They moved on to number 2, 'Steins;Gate'.

And here we are, ruining yet another one of my favourite shows. This time in fact *my favourite show*. I can't wait to cry watching how they mangled it."
Steins;Gate,"trusting mainstream viewers, lol"
Steins;Gate,"I thought the time travel stuff was pretty cool, a lot of characters were incredibly annoying though, tough to imagine live action making that any better."
Steins;Gate,"I can see them keeping Kurisu as Japanese/American and have the rest be American, as I assume it'll be set in the US."
Steins;Gate,"It's a good time travel story, but a lot of the story is also about a group of students living in Akihabara.  Okabe in particular is a otaku obsessed with mad scientists, and a lot of his personality is built up around otaku culture.  I don't see how they'd pull this off for mainstream Western audiences, as most of his references would fly over their heads."
Steins;Gate,"Yea this really does seem like one that could be pulled off much easier. Half of the first part of the anime has A LOT of downtime/comedy that can be trimmed out. If they focused on Okarin/Mayushi/Christina then it could make for a fantastic time travel drama. It's still a lot to ask to try and put the entire story into a 2ish hour movie and have the same impact though because a lot of what makes the 2nd half of the show so impactful is the first half setting everything up masterfully and I'm not sure there's a way to pull it off. Still, Stein's gate is a top 3 anime for me and I'll absolutely see this"
Steins;Gate,Watch literally any other time travel story
Steins;Gate,[deleted]
Steins;Gate,"> Ruka 

is a different story,  his parents treated him like a girl and forced him into the role while also being gay at the same time

so he believed he must be a girl, because only girls would love guys in his mind at least
so he only wanted to be a girl, so he could justify his love of Okabe.


I doubt Americans can pull it off tbh

they would lose the nuance and sadness of it,  a person who does not believe a man can love another man
so they believe they must be a woman, and want to be so.

plus mainstream audiences and anime is a eh"
Steins;Gate,Altered carbon was trash.
Steins;Gate,"Yes, those things are totally comparable...  \s"
Steins;Gate,And you think *Hollywood* are those people?
Steins;Gate,Hollywood: I've made a huge mistake
Steins;Gate,[deleted]
Steins;Gate,Only a racist would say hollywood makes bad adaptations of foreign source material
Steins;Gate,"they bank on the existing fanbase to see it,  yet they change so much and ruin it"
Steins;Gate,">  I also predict that the gang will be ""diverse"" and ""inclusive""

yup, and remember, kurisu is a redhead... and we know what hollywood loves to fcking do to redhead characters in adaptations :/"
Steins;Gate,"Oliver Roberts and the adventures of his friends in downtown Los Angeles.

Daru is called Dave and is played by James Corden"
Steins;Gate,"Part of what makes the cast so compelling is how uniquely flawed they all are. I don't think any one of them are ""good"" people but it makes what happen to them hurt so much more because of how unfair it is. They weren't great people but they didn't deserve what they got."
Steins;Gate,"I mean the idea of an American death note is a pretty awful idea to begin with and unless Richard spenser becomes president a death note adaptation would always be forces to change its source material. 

No leftist in America would watch a show about a valedictorian jock son of a major city police chief who kills millions of black people with a book."
Steins;Gate,"I agree. You don't have to completely gut the character's quirks, but you might need to soften up the localization of them for a broader audience.

For example Faris. People might not understand what a Moe or Moe Cafe is, but generally people understand theme restaurants and what cosplay is, so having her playfully stay in character at times, and not add her ""meow/nya"" to words randomly, but when it's clear she is trying to be ""cutesy"" would come off better.

I think the biggest hurdle would be Luka/Rukako, because even in the VN/Anime, the culture aspect of it makes it very different than people would understand it. There's also the problem that perhaps the LGBT+ community might take issue since they won't know the context of the character if they never experienced the story. The character very complex, and is often misunderstood.


I can only imagine the minefield that a shitty writer is going to blindly run through to fully capture the character. There is so much they can mess up. A VERY feminine and girly boy (due to a messed up family life), who prefers to be called a boy, but is not Trans, and conflicted by his gay feelings for Okabe. Then, literally experiences life as a girl with world line shifts, which adds that layer to it? Goodluck navigating the nuances of that with a hack hollywood writer."
Steins;Gate,[deleted]
Steins;Gate,[deleted]
Steins;Gate,"I'm not exaggerating, the changes to western characters you mention are cringey. They don't come off well at all. The cute routine is literally what you mentioned, tuturu, which is cringe as fuck. I get that the magority of anime audiences like it, but its too much for me, it's really vapid and idealised. I give it a pass because it's embedded in anime culture, and though I don't like the cute girl routine, I still love anime as a whole. 

What I'm saying is that you just don't see these character tropes in western culture, you see it in cartoons or parody's, but not as a mainstream live action sci-fi/drama."
Steins;Gate,They won't. Western adaptations of Japanese properties almost always force generic Hollywood production to keep it safe for general audiences. Edge of Tomorrow and Alita were weird outliers but both still have that stench of Hollywood. Especially Alita with the stupid sequel obsession ruining the ending.
Steins;Gate,"Do you remember the kid in school who had to go up to the front of the class and do a presentation or book report, and the class knew, the teacher knew, that he didn't read shit and is just making shit up as he went along?

Those people eventually barely pass school, get jobs and need to get work. So they get tossed the ""less sexy"" or ""long shot"" properties to work on, and there they are, with millions on the line, and a interesting property and they skim the story and miss all the nuances and spirit of the story, and we know they didn't read the book."
Steins;Gate,"The problem is that because of the race of the criminals in the US, you would never be able to do a good adaption of Death Note in america. The idea of a perfect non-racist genius athletic son of a police chief using his book to rid the country of crime would never be mad in Hollywood.

Same with most anime, the culture and demographics of the US vs Japan means that any adaptation would have to change so much to make it palatable for mainstream audiences"
Steins;Gate,"Cash grabs, cash grabs everywhere"
Steins;Gate,Chumbawumba soundtrack for the series confirmed.
Steins;Gate,I love that scene
Steins;Gate,"They've rushed and screwed the second half of it, but nevertheless it was decent."
Steins;Gate,"I've actually heard good things about Speed Racer now that I think about it, especially in recent years. I guess it took a while for people to appreciate the ""live action cartoon"" aesthetic that the Wachowskis' were going for."
Steins;Gate,Just don't call Kurisu Christina.
Steins;Gate,"I think this has been in the works for a while and I think it's been instigated on 5pbs side, they've been doing a lot of anniversary projects and this is being marketed as one of them."
Steins;Gate,Mainstream viewers aren’t all too different than anime fans. Don’t overrated yourself.
Steins;Gate,"I have to agree that the downtime/comedy is important to the story. It has a slow first half, but that time establishing and cementing the characters, their world, and their relationships makes the second half so much more powerful and emotional. Once the penny drops halfway through, then the slow storyline suddenly becomes a roaring freight train racing towards a dead end - and I think paring back that first half would lessen the impact of the climax."
Steins;Gate,[deleted]
Steins;Gate,I feel like I watched allmost all of them.
Steins;Gate,Fayris would be an influencer.
Steins;Gate,">Then why adapt this?

Because the central concept of the time travel, how it's used and how it ties in with CERN and Titor is interesting on it's own right without the cultural side of things that the anime leans into.

If you're going to 1:1 it there's absolutely no point, but if you take the central concept you have one of the most interesting takes on time travel there is. Ferris just needs to be Mayuris coworker/manager to give Mayuri a different personality to interact with, it's important to keep her dieing so you need a cast to help endear her to the viewer, they don't need to perform the same roles they did in the original.

There's a lot of people who won't watch Steins;Gate because it's anime, it's a silly mindset but it's not one I'm going to be able to change, but put adapt it to live action on Netflix, even if it's a gutted adaptation at least it translates the concept over the those who won't watch anime.

And when it comes down to it, it doesn't affect the original in any way, that will still be there among my top 5 shows for me to watch whenever I want. It's when they try a live action Haikyuu I'm gonna have to question their sanity."
Steins;Gate,"Not a matter of can. It's a matter of will, and no, we will not."
Steins;Gate,">his parents treated him like a girl and forced him into the role

I never got that angle from the show, is it more prominent in the VN? I always thought he was just naturally more feminine and felt like that's who he should be, the being in love with Okabe seemed like a secondary issue but maybe I'm wrong.

>I doubt Americans can pull it off tbh

That's why I said it can cause issues if not pulled off correctly, it's a do you take the risk of trying to tackle it correctly or do you omit it entirely, I'm sure there's a lot of trans people out there who would appreciate the representation but only if done correctly."
Steins;Gate,">so he believed he must be a girl, because only girls would love guys in his mind at least so he only wanted to be a girl, so he could justify his love of Okabe. I doubt Americans can pull it off tbh

Not to state the obvious, but American culture is different from Japanese culture. Most americans these days don't have the belief that ""a man can't love another man"". If you tried to depict something like that in a story aimed at an american audience, than to americans viewers it would come off as, at best, weird and awkward, and, at worst, offensive. I could definitely see people complaining about that, calling it homophobic.

I know that anime fans want adaptations to be 100% the same, but the fact is, sometimes you need to change certain things to suit a different medium or a different audience. Ruka's character would inevitably be one of those things. You could still have the sadness by simply having Ruka realize that Okabe (or whatever he'll be called in this version) isn't gay, or is in love with someone else."
Steins;Gate,">so he believed he must be a girl, because only girls would love guys in his mind at least so he only wanted to be a girl, so he could justify his love of Okabe.

>I doubt Americans can pull it off tbh

Why? What is it about what you described that makes it uniquely Japanese? Because to me it's pretty clearly an issue of heteronormativity, something Americans can pull off."
Full House,Curious to know who’s going to pay that much for that house. Doesn’t seem worth it?
Full House,housing prices in california are crazy
Full House,">built in 1783

Yeah, no."
Full House,Whatever happened to predictability?
Full House,"> It last sold on October 2, 2020 for $5.4 million, according to its Zillow page. 

And they're trying to flog it for 37 million? HOW RUDE!"
Full House,3 heterosexual men raising 3 girls in the most childless city
Full House,I still remember the story of the person that owns the Breaking Bad house furious because people are constantly taking pictures or throwing pizzas on her roof.  I still don't understand why she wouldn't just lean into it.  Sell pictures for $10 and have a plastic pizza they could throw for $15.
Full House,And having strangers constantly gawking at your home and taking pictures every day? No thanks lol.
Full House,The can list it for whatever they want.  Want to see what it actually sells for.
Full House,The tourist crowding outside and addicts shitting on your steps comes free!
Full House,"I don't think it being in one of the most expensive cities to live in and being featured in the credits of a well known family show, all the homeless,all the crime, & the constant distraction of tourists is worth the 30,480,100 mark up"
Full House,"That's just dumb to sell the house. Turn the insides like it looked like on the show, make it a tourist attraction, use the profits for upkeep."
Full House,There’s a reason that houses in these cities are s overpriced: they’ll sell
Full House,"37 million?! Jesus. If I had 37 million, I wouldn't buy that."
Full House,HGTV might buy it and do another one of those renovation specials where they make the inside look like it did on the TV show. I doubt they’d get the Olsen twins to make an appearance tho.
Full House,It is if it comes with Bob Saget's ghost.
Full House,Even in San Francisco I feel like this would be “worth” like 4 million…they are not even in the right ballpark. Having had the exterior featured on an OK tv show does not seem like a 30+ million dollar selling point.
Full House,"All the people staring at your windows, crowding your door, taking pictures, hard pass."
Full House,"and they're real cheap in Alabama, you get what you pay for"
Full House,Lol they're only off by about 100 years there.
Full House,"Probably built very well, though."
Full House,[deleted]
Full House,It’s pretty predictable that housing prices in the Bay Area are unaffordable.
Full House,"come to think of it, that living arrangement would probably raise some eyebrows nowadays"
Full House,Also the most childless
Full House,and you think that would make you more profit than selling it for 31 mill?
Full House,"I think you’re overestimating the nostalgia factor beyond a very specific 20 year window, and I’m not confident that demographic has the kind of disposable income that makes Full House tourism a priority."
Full House,"Well, it ain't no Graceland."
Full House,The one they did with the Brady Bunch house was beyond perfect.
Full House,How much money do you think those shows pull in????
Full House,Good point. I didn’t even think of that
Full House,The layout on the inside isn't anything like the tv show.
Full House,"They'd have to add an entire floor, though. The attic living space on the show couldn't possibly exist in that building as-is."
Full House,The house is being sold by the creator of Full House precisely because the neighbors wouldn't allow that kind of renovation.
Full House,Just don't bring up 1990.

Full House,"I mean, you're comparing different coasts with radically different histories. I think the oldest surviving house in SF [only dates back to 1850.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abner_Phelps_House)"
Full House,You know when you're lost out there and you're all alone? It feels like that now everywhere you look
Full House,Looks like a huge house. Could fit about 12 people comfortably.
Full House,they might just assume the girls are adopted
Full House,and how could they afford that house?
Full House,obviously not but it also will not sell for anywhere near that asking price
Full House,Who knows but whatever freak willing to pay so much for the nostalgia would probably pay even more if the interior was also identical.
Full House,"Neither was the Brady Bunch house. Yet they built a whole show around making it that way.

https://www.hgtv.com/shows/a-very-brady-renovation"
Full House,Common
Full House,They managed to do it on Dr Who...
Full House,"The fact that you can't renovate it and neighbors don't want it to become a tourist attraction (understandably, mind you) seems like it *really* limits the value of the property.  If you have $37 million to spend on a house in San Fransisco, how appealing is living in the house whose exterior was featured in the credits of a 25 year-old show really going to be?  You could buy something *much* bigger and *much* nicer that'd probably even have higher resale opportunity in the future.

There are obviously people out there with more money than sense, so I wouldn't be horribly surprised if it did sell, but I can't imagine there's a huge market to spend a fortune to have the exterior of your house look like a show from the '90s."
Full House,"No, he sold it in 2020 for $5.4 million."
Full House,"wait, his neighbors can dictate how he renovates the inside of his house? FUCK THAT. im dealing with an HOA now, and all their dumb rules for my front lawn and outside of my house, but eff them if they think they can tell me how i set up the inside of my house (brb, gonna go read all the fine print lmao)"
Full House,Most of the old houses in San Francisco crashed or burned to the ground in 1906.
Full House,"Danger's all around you. Strangers right behind you.

.... Wait"
Full House,Danny hosted a popular TV show
Full House,The thing about the Full House house is that there is way more house than the actual house in the show.
Full House,"The idea that anybody could reasonably think the value has septupled in two years just goes to show how truly bonkers and unmoored from reality housing prices have become 

I'm well aware it won't sell for that much but the idea that it would even list for that much... ludicrous"
Full House,just the local news
Full House,Like the sitcom version of the TARDIS from Doctor Who
Full House,How dare you besmirch the name of [Wake Up San Francisco](https://youtu.be/N4U8QSYpqD4?t=8)!
Full House,"also in real life, I don't think the Winslow's could have afforded their house on Carl's Chicago PD salary, and I don't think their homeowners insurance would cover Urkel's accidents"
Full House,Sorry to whoever has to clean up the vigil outside their home.
Full House,I'm sorry but that's some weird parasocial shit.
Full House,"Jeff Franklin, the creator of Full/Fuller House, bought it a few years ago right before he was fired from the show."
Full House,"It was 2-3 bouquets of flowers, a beer can, and a loaf of white bread…"
Full House,Things are probably gonna be all right for the person rich enough to live in one of the painted ladies.
Full House,They're luckier than whoever has to clean up after the room in Bob's version of The Aristocrats joke.
Full House,"its funny, the name Jeff Franklin just seems very not fitting for him. I did not imagine him to be so douchey and smug looking."
Full House,"How did I not know what a huge piece of shit he is? Just read up a little on him after seeing this comment and just that little bit makes me sick.

Also he looks like a massive tool"
Full House,"The Full House house is on Broderick Street, not one of the Painted Ladies at Alamo Square from the show intro."
Full House,“It’s like spin-art”
Full House,"I'm sure most parents don't think, ""let's pick a super douchey name"" when they're picking baby names."
Full House,One google took me from “how does someone even look smug and douchey?” to “I didn’t know Mickey Rourke had a retarded younger brother” real quick
Full House,"Wait, don’t hold out on us, why?"
Full House,"Oh, my bad."
Full House,Said some really heinous shit about and to women on the set of his shows and commenting about the looks of underage girls. It’s all on his wiki
Full House,[removed]
Full House,"Yeah, I just remember the houses in the intro. Never really watched it."
Full House,A clip show triggered by someone unpacking Danny's old Dust Buster in the garage...
Full House,Just…don’t.
Full House,His death must be avenged!
Full House,Good Night San Francisco
Full House,"he joined walter , comet, and his first wife in heaven 

he was killed by a bad batch of cleaning supolies"
Full House,Just say he moved to Hawaii with his wife. Those kids losing both parents and DJ losing a husband is too grim.
Full House,Knowing the way this cast works this has probably been floated by Dave and John to ABC.
Full House,"Why? No one cared about Fuller House enough to keep it on after 2020, and even though it lasted five seasons, viewership greatly diminished after the first season. Move on, already."
Full House,He's in jail because he got caught paying someone to get a family member into an Ivy league school
Full House,Wait. What. Who wants a spinoff of Full House. I didn't even watch Fuller House.
Full House,I wonder if they will do a mass shooting at a mall. Then try to teach people lessons
Full House,"I mean... ""Those kids"" are in their 40s...  Most people lose both their parents eventually"
Full House,It ended after 2020 on Netflix becouse it was a WB production and WB was ending all their stuff on Netflix.
Full House,so why'd you click on the post?
Full House,They did that on The Yawners...I mean the Conners
Full House,To set the record straight
Full House,my upbringing was more like malcolm but with more drugs and beer
Full House,yeah. that was the point.
Full House,"Malcolm in the Middle IS lower/middle class life in America. Still amazing to watch to this day. And the lessons it taught weren't idealistic, they were practical. 

""If it is that easy to change, why didn't you do it before?"" ""Oh, honey... that will never happen. You'll ALWAYS have to tell us what to do! But each time we'll try to do better."""
Full House,"Roseanne was the response to the Cosby show.  Seing a successful family seems mundane, but if its a minority, it may be valuable to some.  Look at the success of Crazy Rich Asians for contrast."
Full House,"I remember watching ""The Middle"" with my family something like 10 years ago, and by god did it capture us perfectly to an almost unnerving degree. The dysfunction and irritation with each other totally relatable. I'm always surprised the show didn't catch as much mainstream attention as something like Modern Family (which I always found totally unrealistic)"
Full House,"When I was studying in Spain I'd watch the Simpsons with my host family at lunch sometimes. My host mother said ""you realize this is making fun of Americans, right?"" and I said ""no this is Americans, we accept it"""
Full House,"Funny thing is when The Simpsons debuted in 1989 they were meant to be a struggling working class family. Nothing changed about them. But now if you see a family in a three bedroom house with a two car garage (and two cars to go in it) supporting three children on one income, you'd think they were doing really well."
Full House,"Ah, yes. I remember when my dad put on 200lbs so he could work from home and wear a woman's maternity dress. Wait a minute..."
Full House,"I think *Malcolm in the Middle* captures your point better than *Married with Children*. IMHO, *Married* propped up as much unrealistic dysfunction as their predecessors propped up unrealistic function.

Malcolm in the Middle did so many things right -- first among these is abandoning the 3-camera studio set model in favor of a single-camera, cinematography and editing. That move alone made *Malcolm* **feel** ""more real"" in a way that fixed-angle sitcoms couldn't touch, and largely haven't recovered from -- even big successes are hounded by the ""laugh track"" critique, and I know many who categorically cannot stand shows with canned laughter.

IMHO, *Malcolm* opened the door to film-style presentation on television. Other shows had done it, but never anything that could be classified as a sitcom, let alone a wildly successful one. They broke the back of the assumption that any sitcom needed to be a filmed stage-play in order to be taken seriously, and in so doing they brought edited, film-like, licensed-soundtracked sequences into TV mainstream.

The family dynamics were also flexible without being vague. They solidified evolving ideas of family gender dynamics, positioning a strong, stubborn but also vulnerable mother against a somewhat bumbling father who was played in a way that didn't fall into the ""dad's an idiot"" trope that many shows fell into. 

The kids had understandable motivations and were presented as significant, which is another thing sitcoms have screwed up around kids, who sometimes come off as a multi-headed conflict engine with no real character arc."
Episodes,I think nobody is talking about Joel and Tess being together for at least 13 years. That was huge revelation for me. Makes Joel’s loss that much bigger.
Episodes,The most important part of the episode is Joel understanding the message Bill left for him. Joel is now on board with getting Ellie to this lab to find a cure. It’s why he asked her to show him her arm again.
Episodes,From the tension in the piano scene I thought someone was going to die.
Episodes,"The way the episode was directed was fantastic in my opinion. I like that they don't need to show the couple's corpse at all, it was done really well. In the end of the episode when they were zooming out the window I'm going ""pleeease don't show them, we don't need to"" and sure enough they didn't! Great episode."
Episodes,"Once that Max Richter song came on to start off that montage, I was like ""guess this is my cue to cry happy sad tears now"""
Episodes,Nick Offerman should win an Emmy for his performance
Episodes,"This was one of the most moving, but yet not overly dramatic portrayals of love I’ve seen in a long time. It’s inspiring, relatable and just very well done."
Episodes,"While everyone is rightfully praising the actors, I want to shout out to the writer Craig Mazin for fleshing out a side character and gave us this beautiful story. 

Mazin was also responsible for writing Chernobyl, which also had some beautiful writing with amazing character relationships."
Episodes,"I wasn't expecting the direction this episode took at all.

Nick Offerman made me cry.

Everyone can have their own opinion but to me this was art, not filler."
Episodes,"Joel explained how the fungus rapidly spread through tainted food. This shined light on how the elderly neighbor was infected in Episode 1.

Edit: Plus Joel forgot to get a cake from the store, which presumably would have infected his family too."
Episodes,"I'm hearing either, ""Best episode ever made!"" or ""What the hell was that, pointless!""

It wouldn't be interesting if everyone agreed I guess."
Episodes,This episode was perfectly produced. My only complaint was when bill just shooting from the middle of the street with no cover.. bill seem way more intelligent than that from everything else we saw in the episode.
Episodes,"It was well made, told a kind of slice-of-life story about living in the post apocalypse. Well written, well shot, well acted.

I can't rightly think of another episode like it that isn't filled to the brim with various genre tropes like one of them getting inevitably infected."
Episodes,"It was incredible to see Bill’s growth as a person once Frank came into his life. From an angry, closed-off, highly introverted man to someone who became happy, open and loving. His vulnerability in the very beginning of their relationship and Frank’s patience and calming presence was one of the most moving things I have ever witnessed in a television show. The scene where he and Frank giggled over strawberries was truly heartwarming. I genuinely started crying when they revealed that Frank was terminally ill and love that their journey ended together. Nick Offerman should absolutely win an award for his role in this episode. It is some of the best television that has ever been made."
Episodes,I loved this episode. I can forgive a deviation from the source material if the new material is written well and executed well. And this episode did exactly that. Nick Offerman killed it
Episodes,"Nick Offerman laughing at the strawberries was the moment that got me. That laugh of pure, unburdened joy. It was perfectly used."
Episodes,Honestly didn't expect to cry so hard to an episode of The Last of Us about a gay romance of two one shot side characters
Episodes,As a massive fan of the game since day 1 & never usually like something deviating TOO far from an original story... I thought that episode was fucking incredible
Episodes,All this from a video game adaptation. We've come so fucking far.
Episodes,This episode slayed me. Was totally unprepared. Beautiful.
Episodes,"People asked what more a show could do to expand on TLOU and this is exactly it. It’s expanding on the heart of characters trying to survive in a post apocalyptic world.

I genuinely cried, it was amazing"
Episodes,"I've been very happy theyre sticking to the OG story so closely. This is the first major change theyve made and its great. These are side characters I barely even remember existing, so they play a minimal role in the story. Fleshing out their backstory doesnt detract at all. The addition of a well written, well acted side story like this adds immensely though"
Episodes,"No episode of tv has made me cry like that since Not Penny’s Boat, that’s all I’ll say"
Episodes,"I appreciated the nods to Ron Swanson's birthday dinner.

Episodes,"I don’t feel anything very easily. Nick Offerman is one of those actors that I have had this idea of in my head as being a one-trick pony. Boy, was I wrong. This episode had me weeping. I walked away feeling all kinds of stuff I can’t even explain."
Episodes,Ugly crying!
Episodes,"Just finished the episode. As a long time proponent of please stick to the source material I can safely say that this episode was just absolutely fantastic.

Performances are tremendous, it fleshes out the world the characters inhabit, how they’ve changed over the course of time in a world that’s hopeless. 

If you want a 1 for 1 retelling of exactly how the game is, go play it but for me this  is a video game adaptation (key word is adaptation) done exactly right 

I hope both guys get nominated for many awards for their performance."
Episodes,I haven’t been broken like this from a TV episode in a looooong time
Episodes,"> The Last of Us' just made an early claim to ~~one of~~ the best TV episode~~s~~ of 2023

Only been a month, and maybe Succession will give it a run for its money, but so far it's way out in front. One of the best episodes of television I've ever seen.

This show was just like, ""by the way, here's the most beautiful and devastating love story ever squeezed into an hour"" while helping establish a totally authentic post-apocalyptic setting and give leagues of depth and subtext to the stories of Joel and Tess, all in passing."

My biggest complaint before was that it I personally was finding a 1 for 1 recreation slightly uninteresting (feels like a harsh word as I’m still think this is a fantastic tv show), part of me was wishing I was just playing the game instead.

This episode was a brilliant change of pace, a perfect filler episode."
Episodes,It was a good episode for sure.
Episodes,Love the ending shot is through the bedroom window. However it bugs me that it looks like it is a second floor window but their bedroom is on the ground floor for easy access.
Episodes,I think this was the first time I actually cried while watching something incredible performance
Episodes,I think a lot of the criticism of it being a filler episode is from people who lack media literacy. It is really not difficult to see how the story told in the ep fleshes out and contextualises some of the wider themes of the game/show
Episodes,"At the end of that episode I crawled into my boyfriends lap and cried for ages. Best bit of telly I’ve seen in a long time, absolutely amazing writing and performances."
Episodes,"""I like you older. Older means we're still here."""
Episodes,"Well, this is one of my favorite episodes of any show ever.  
  
My *emotions*."
Episodes,I do like that they used a mortal kombat 2 machine instead of the fictional arcade cabinet
Episodes,“I never liked you…but I do respect you.” Straight up Ron Swanson.
Episodes,"I totally recognize that the episode was sad because of the ending, but I couldn’t help but feel happy for Bill & Frank. In all that chaos, they built a great life together. Frank had all those amazing paintings, Bill overcame his grudge against humanity, they grew strawberries!!

How many people get undisturbed time (work, school,  obligations) for over a decade with the person they love?  I was really happy and proud of them for that.

Also, very classy of TV Ellie not to raid Bill’s magazine collection, 😂"
Episodes,"When bill was shooting in the street, it was so dumb tho."
Episodes,"I adored it. Felt like one of those classic artsy post-apocalyptic short stories you might have read in high school. But gay as hell.

I also thought the bedroom scene hit exactly the right notes. Not too schmaltzy, not too lurid, but not shying away from it either. It was sweet. Loved seeing this uber macho prepper guy suddenly trembling like a leaf with how nervous and self-conscious he was."
Episodes,I never got to say goodbye to my best friend and to my dad when they passed away in 2020. I wish I had spent a proper last day with me just like frank and bill were able to do.  I cried so much.
Episodes,"Early yes, but hard to disagree. As someone that loved the games, the whiplash of expectation to such a radically different approach to show determination and tenderness in this world was exceptionally effective. For those that have experienced the game and are even remotely media literate, it was phenomenal. I cried, I laughed, I cried a whole lot more. I told my wife that ""that episode was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time,"" and she agreed. 

For those coming in fresh, it was a remarkable way to show depth and complexity and motivation. Taking an episode to do this in an emotional and beautiful way is no waste. It does the functional story moving that the game did in a completely different way. 

I get people having their own tastes and their own opinions, but it's hard to think about people upset for deviating from this show being a play through. I did that. I experienced it. I let it take me along for the story and experience once, why wouldn't I allow this different medium to do the same?"
Episodes,This is when The Last of Us did World War Z better than World War Z.
Episodes,"Man, this was the episode I was most looking forward to/most worried about. I had conflicting feelings on the Bill/Frank stuff in the game. But holy shit was this just one of the most touching, heartbreaking and beautiful queer love stories I’ve seen.

The game was super progressive for even including an overtly gay character but the game kind of makes Bill’s homosexuality into a joke with the discovery of the gay magazine. Hence my complicated feelings on it. This episode knocked it out of the park. It’s so rare to see gay romance depicted in this way, as an aging couple. I think this has a lot to do with the AIDS pandemic and how we lost a massive percentage of a whole generation but seeing a gay couple be able to grow old together was far more moving than I expected it to be. Phenomenal episode imo."
Episodes,Last time Ive cried this much from a show/movie was Titanic.
Episodes,This episode made me weep like a child
Episodes,"So I can’t find any comments addressing it and I kinda wanna see what you guys think. What exactly is Bills profession before this??? That house is expensive. You can see the Boston skyline in the distance. He has an arsenal that seems like it would cost nearly $50,000 not including ammunition or any of the other doomsday supplies. Maybe his mother left him the house, who knows. My guess is a degree in Engineering. That’s the only way I see someone putting together some town like that. Sure someone could slap some stuff together but realistically would probably end up hurting themselves trying to set all that up."
Episodes,"Everyone go watch Devs, it's the best Nick Offerman role IMO."
Episodes,"This episode actually gave me a stomach ache— I mean besides the blatant sobbing it just made me ache. I also laughed out loud more than once (all Nick Offerman).
That scene with Bill and Frank when they are sitting in their suits quietly exchanging rings BROKE ME."
Episodes,"Holy sweet goddamn that show rocked me.

I don’t think I’ve ever been moved that much by tv or a movie.

Nick Offerman and Murray Bartlett were unbelievable."
Episodes,Best thing I’ve watched this year. Loved it.
Episodes,Throughout the episode I couldn’t place where i had seen the actor who played Frank before. When I found out he was from White Lotus I couldn’t believe it was the same guy. Great actor.
Episodes,"One of the most intense and surprising things I noticed was how Bill and Frank are likely the only couple on earth to have such a picturesque, ‘romantic’ ending. They lived and experienced the joys of the old, pre-infection world like maybe only a handful left on earth could experience.

Everything outside their utopia is an apocalyptic dystopia. Most people die in horrible ways, or in substandard, poverty-like conditions in the QZs. It would likely be hundreds or thousands of years before what they had would once again become at least somewhat common."
Episodes,It made the notebook look like the emoji movie
Episodes,I ugly cried with this episode
Episodes,One of the best Episodes I’ve throughly enjoyed because the World building occurred during this time. I do hope if other seasons are commissioned from this franchise… I’ve seen lots of negativity about this and it’s not been enjoyable to read.
Episodes,"Never played the game. Coming in cold. This is one of the greatest (IMHO) episodes of TV that I’ve ever watched. The writing, the acting, the directing. All perfect. So much tension at he start, then the twist, then the gut wrenching ugly man crying at the end. I need to watch it again but I’m not sure that I can take it right now."
Episodes,"Fuck this episode, I watched it for shroom zombies and instead got my 46 year old straight male heart ripped out from under my guts while cried like I haven’t since I was at least 5, not cool with your fancy writing and excellent acting and directing catching me so hard over what was probably less than 30 minutes. Now we never talk about this ever again"
Episodes,This episode was incredible
Episodes,That damn shutter island/arrival song 😢
Episodes,Watching it! That wink when he’s painting 🥲
Episodes,Did anybody else think Bill would be alive when Joel arrived? I thought it possible that he would fake dying to relieve frank of the guilt of leaving him alone
Episodes,"I played the game in 2020 but forgot who Bill and Frank were lol, so I wasn't expecting the episode to go in that direction. I cried like a baby during their last meal. The score was fantastic as well and probably triggered more emotions. Such a beautiful episode all around."
Episodes,This episode was like a long version of UP's love story. loved it.
Episodes,"This particular episode had it all: acting, writing, story, pathos. It’s one of the best shows I’ve seen in a long time. If the quality stays this high it might be the best series ever."
Episodes,"This episode was so fucking touching I almost cried in front of my folks. I don't like crying in front of people (which is normal), but this brought tears to my eyes."
Episodes,[removed]
Episodes,One of the best shows I’ve seen in a long time.  I suspect the right wingers are going to loose their minds.
Episodes,"What a masterpiece. 

And on episode 3. Going to be hard to compete with that one. Man this is a great show."
Episodes,"All I can say as a straight white cis guy watching a show about zombies, I never expected to be in literal tears at the end of a gay love story. I pretty much just consume TV for entertainment and while I really enjoy some shows I don't really get to emotionally invested. This episode gave me so many of the feels."
Episodes,IMHO the greatest queer love story in television history. I'd totally watch a spin off show of Bill and Frank's domestic adventures in post apocalyptia.
Episodes,"It was definitely the best episode of tv of 2023 so far. A touching tale, both heartwarming and heartbreaking. I hope that the guest stars get remembered come awards season."
Episodes,This show is incredibly good. My family was spellbound and quite pleasantly surprised.
Episodes,This is how you tell good stories. I wonder if the writers of rings of power watched it.
Episodes,That really was so good. I was fucking bawling.
Episodes,I knew Nick Offeman was a great actor but gat dam!
Episodes,This show is HBO caliber in the best possible way.  I don’t even like the genre per se and know nothing of the game but when acting and writing is this good I just pop some popcorn and wait until next week impatiently.
Episodes,They introduced a gay Ron Swanson and then killed him in one episode.  :-(
Episodes,"This was a good ep ill admit. Def carried by the actors. But what bothered me about it, and its been done so many times in other shows is.....Bill, standing there....standing straight up, poppin shots with a BOLT ACTION RIFLE IN THE MIDDLE OF FUCKING NOWHERE. Why...just...why do so many shows do this shit. Im to believe this (probably vet), mega prepper gun ""enthusiast"" has no tactical training at all?! That mf'r would be behind cover, dick in the dirt poppin shots from a comfortable distance at his leisure. Not standing straight up in the middle of the fucking road....god i hate that shit, takes me right out. Murray bartlett was incredible tho so...i guess theres that"
Episodes,Beaujolais Villages.  My family’s go to wine. Never heard anyone ever mention it. I was hooked from then on.  What an awesome episode!  Incredible all around. Well done!
Episodes,"Incredible episode. The Bill story in the game was good, but they really took it to another level here. I'm happy they're sticking to the game in certain areas, but this was an inspired change. We got a fantastic, emotional story that still imparts the same lesson to Joel and let's us feel his pain over Tess through Bill's experience."
Episodes,"Just watched the episode tonight. Brilliant first few minutes when he meets frank. My wife and I were just WAITING for frank to kill him. Especially when he sat down at the piano... 50m later were both crying at the love story. 

Brilliant story telling. Absolutely loving the series so far. LOF is a top 10 game for me so it's especially awesome to see the carry over. My wife whos never had interest can't stop watching either!"
Episodes,This was a powerful episode. It’s the kind of rare and unexpected storytelling that I’ll remember for a long time.
Episodes,Ron would be disappointed.
Episodes,"Every now and then, you are watching TV, and you become aware that what you are seeing is far above the level of quality of most TV. This episode was o e of those times. As it ended, I just sat there, stunned. It has been a LONG time since I've seen anything as good as this episode on TV."
Episodes,Idk I thought it kinda dragged.. I enjoyed the 1st and 2nd episode a lot more
Episodes,Waterworks non stop. Finally a gay love story I can rewatch.
Episodes,I cried. That's it.
Episodes,"I'm sad that they cut Elllies and Joel's scenes with Bill, those are some of the best scenes in the game (including the ""sticky pages"" in the car afterwards.."
Episodes,It was good. I was just disappointed that we didn't get the great back and forth exchanges with Bill and Ellie like in the game.
Episodes,"Maybe an unpopular opinion. First off, I loved the episode. Not saying it wasn’t great. But in the entirety of an hour long episode, in the end Joel and Ellie just get Bill and Frank’s stuff and leave. What’s the point of having that entire backstory and flashback for that?  I’m not criticizing it at all, just a genuine wonder about the screen time spent just to show a small connection to Joel in the past and then him and Ellie just move on."
Episodes,"I get that anyone who criticises the episode will be labelled as homophobic but seriously though, they decided to waste one of only 9 episodes on that? What the fuck."
Episodes,"There was such an absurd amount of hype around this episode...

... and, yea, it lived up to it."
Episodes,"Man the one thing that really pissed me off about this episode was the raid attack. Why the fuck is Bill standing out in the middle of the street with no cover?

So far the series has been good about these sorts of decision making on the characters parts but Bill is made out to be a survivor yet he makes such a stupid mistake.

Also seems odd to me that they would have had in all that time just one raid? It's clear to see that the town has supplies, it is fortified so there definitely would have been other groups who invade. Especially considering it's close proximity to Boston.

Excellent episode otherwise but yea that just didn't sit well with me. Not sure why Joel and Tess would continue going back to the QZ instead of stake out with Bill and Frank and live a comfortable life when it's clearly less stressful and more ideal.

Felt like a place totally disconnected from the horrors of the world. Needed more emphasis on the constant fight for survival like the games really try to hammer into you.

Still, excellent episode that didn't follow the tropes of most media."
Episodes,Well we just decided the song we want to walk down the aisle to this summer. Thanks zombie apocalypse movie!! And thanks Nick and Murray!
Episodes,I'd argue best episodes of TV ever. I like this show a lot more when there's no zombies.
Is This a Zombie?,Pedro is BOOKED AND BUSY lately. All his roles have been iconic too. A truly stellar career.
Is This a Zombie?,If they start this year we might get season two by the end of next year. I hope we don’t have another two year wait for a show.
Is This a Zombie?,[deleted]
Is This a Zombie?,The rumor is they're moving production to Vancouver. Has anyone in the industry heard something similar?
Is This a Zombie?,"a lot of talk from fellow co-workers in the industry that it's coming here in Vancouver, can't wait"
Is This a Zombie?,"The Last of Us, and the Mandolorian basically have the same plot. “Pedro Pascal protects a really weird kid while everyone tries to kill them.”"
Is This a Zombie?,"the last of us 2 video game is very violent...full of hate, they better not hold back."
Is This a Zombie?,"#WARNING SPOILERS IN COMMENTS

I've played the game so im fine, scrolling through reading the comment there are several spoiler stuff, read at your own risk if you don't know the story."
Is This a Zombie?,"Well I guess his character doesn’t die this season…

(I haven’t played the games and have been avoiding spoilers)"
Is This a Zombie?,"Potential S1 spoiler:

>!Would the fact he's talking about shooting the next season be a spoiler for the end of season 1?!<"
Is This a Zombie?,I feel like this title is mildly a spoiler lol
Is This a Zombie?,"I'm curious to see if Season 3 will face a hiatus, as theoretically they would have to wait for the third game to be released."
Is This a Zombie?,[“I just wish that my students would stop making fancams of me.”](https://youtu.be/uX-bJFioAX4)
Is This a Zombie?,"Nothing against you OP, but can we stop sharing and upvoting Collider articles? Their SEO optimisation has made google a chore to use and their articles are all garbage.

Like this headline, star of show says that hit show may start filming next season this year.  I like TLOU but why is this an article?"
Is This a Zombie?,"*HBO starts filming December 31st*  
“We did it, guys!”"
Is This a Zombie?,"I dont know how I will be able to watch the 2nd season. Only played part 2 once and Jesus it was a crazy, good ride but I can't force myself to step in that Rollercoaster again."
Is This a Zombie?,The less time I wait between seasons is good for me.
Is This a Zombie?,Cross promotion with PGA or LIV?
Is This a Zombie?,"Given how Pedro & Bella have nailed Joel & Ellie’s dynamic, it’s going to be so heartbreaking going through that experience from Part 2 adapted on screen"
Is This a Zombie?,I just hope season 2 is longer. Season 1 feels so rushed. An entire chapter covered in 45 minutes to an hour just doesn't feel like certain parts of the story are getting the attention they deserve.
Is This a Zombie?,Fucking spoiler wow
Is This a Zombie?,Spoiler Alert! Guess he didn’t die ?
Is This a Zombie?,I bet it starts in the fall in Alberta and then moves to BC for the Seattle parts. Just a hunch…
Is This a Zombie?,I haven’t watched this show yet but it feels like more and more shows will take very long breaks between seasons but I find it very frustrating as a viewer
Is This a Zombie?,Anybody think the first few episodes were awesome but the last few have not been great? The first 2 episodes I thought this would go down as maybe the best show ever…. I feel like the only episode after the first 2 that was good was when they escaped the city and all the zombies came out of that whole and killed everyone.
Is This a Zombie?,Does anyone wanna tell him?.......
Is This a Zombie?,"any chance there's a cure and it works???

had to stop watching the Walking Dead once i realize it was like Gillian's Island.  they were gonna milk it till forever with no happy ending ever."
Is This a Zombie?,"I'd prefer if season 2 covered the period in between The Last of Us 1 and 2, rather than being a straight adaptation. It would give them a chance to add some original stories and build more lore rather than regurgitating what we already know will happen."
Is This a Zombie?,[removed]
Is This a Zombie?,"Man. There is gonna be some much drama over that season cause conservatives are pathetic. This season got nothing on how ""woke"" s2/3 will be."
Is This a Zombie?,[removed]
Is This a Zombie?,"Well, I guess I know he doesn't die now."
Is This a Zombie?,Please don’t follow the sequels story. It’s just too unbelievable and sad.
Is This a Zombie?,"I just can't picture Ramsey as Ellie in part 2, the energy just isn't there."
Is This a Zombie?,"It’s fine. I know we all wish we could just watch a new episode every week for the end of time, but you can tell the quality of this show takes time. Just the recreating of sets, my god.

Quality over quantity. They could probably bust out a season a year, but it would not be as good."
Is This a Zombie?,"I'm curious to see if the 2nd season will deviate much from the video game, or if it'll stay true to it.

The Last of Us 2 was divisive, to say the very least. I actually want the show to continue to be close to the source material, because I want to see how non-gamers react to the story. If it's anything similar to how the game fans reacted, the resulting salt is going to be something else."
Is This a Zombie?,Honestly I can see how this show ends with Ellie being the last human on earth.
Is This a Zombie?,[removed]
Is This a Zombie?,This series is not that good
Is This a Zombie?,The last episode was very boring
Is This a Zombie?,Between this and mando dude is working non stop. Take a break dude.
Is This a Zombie?,[removed]
Is This a Zombie?,[removed]
Is This a Zombie?,Last of us is fucking boring tbh.
Is This a Zombie?,"Whose gonna break the news to him?

Anyhow.... Bella Ramsey looks too short to play older Ellie no? Am I the only the dude on the planet who foresees any problems in the future here? 

How will she aggressively be taking down giant men towering her & dwarfing her relentlessly like in the game? There's so so much violence in The Last of Us Part II and they will need AT LEAST, 2 seasons minimum to cover it all do it justice.

I really hope they don't try to adapt one of my favorite games just to do it for money but none of the people involved in creating it have interest in doing it justice.

I feel like a reoccurring theme is happening in television, every game adaptation I have absolutely no expectations for *(Arcane)* I end up falling in love with, but the ones I have massive expectations for *(Netflix Resident Evil)* I end up disliking more than any other television."
Is This a Zombie?,So are they recasting Bella Ramsey ?
Is This a Zombie?,That’s a Joel in one
Is This a Zombie?,[removed]
Is This a Zombie?,Golf plot let’s go!!!!
Is This a Zombie?,Thanks for the spoil article.
Is This a Zombie?,I thought he died last episode
Is This a Zombie?,Nice!
Is This a Zombie?,"People who haven’t played the game: omg I can’t wait for season two

People who have played the game: god I hope they wait a few years to age up the actors for season two."
Is This a Zombie?,“They” like the studio or “they” as in Pedro written by a fisherthem?
Is This a Zombie?,">!Come one, can't be that hard for him to schedule like one episode.!< (Game Part Two, potential second season spoiler)"
Is This a Zombie?,Won't they need him for the first episode only?
Is This a Zombie?,Hopefully they get some decent writers for season 2.
Is This a Zombie?,Was there only 5 episodes? ?? Short first season
Is This a Zombie?,racism is bad
Is This a Zombie?,I would assume Sony would like to time it so Lou Part 2 comes out on pc around season 2. Could take awhile for the game if they aren't already working on it
Is This a Zombie?,"No, dammit. 

There’s a six year time jump between the two games. 

They need to slow down and actually let that actors age up and transform a little more. Especially Bella Ramsey. 

Makeup and hair dye can only go so far. 

Unless they’re doing what I really hope and making season two of the show a bridge between the events of the two games, but largely original/expanded in terms of storylines. 

I’d be fine with season 3 actually being the events of the second game."
Is This a Zombie?,Well given the fact mando also wants to shoot this year Pedro may have a issue
Is This a Zombie?,[removed]
Is This a Zombie?,"No they are not, the show is painfully slow and boring, it’s getting canceled."
Is This a Zombie?,[removed]
Is This a Zombie?,"I wonder if they are going recast Bella Ramsey the moment they choose to adapt the second season. Bella was chosen to play a 14 year old and she definitely looks the part, in last episode with Storm she definitely looked like an 18 year old with a 14 year old. So in the second game Ellie is older and its going to look weird if she doesn't age"
Is This a Zombie?,Too much woke agendas
Is This a Zombie?,[deleted]
Is This a Zombie?,Uhhhhhhhhh.......
Is This a Zombie?,Just please dear god don't make it into 8 seasons or some shit like that. I hope they've learned from their mistakes.
Is This a Zombie?,How has this man not collapsed from exhaustion! He is absolutely killing it and is in everything. He must be the hardest working actor right now.
Is This a Zombie?,it'll be really awkward if they run out of things to film before the next game comes out.
Is This a Zombie?,"Yes, I'd love that. Yes"
Is This a Zombie?,If season 2 is the four year gap with Joel and Ellie with some stories pulled from Fractions that maybe leads into winter. Season 3 can be the rest or just all of part 2.
Is This a Zombie?,What season does game two take place in? Summer?
Is This a Zombie?,Please!!!
Is This a Zombie?,"Absolutely love TLOU, but am not looking forward to going through the whole TLOU 2 debate again, and now with a whole new audience"
Is This a Zombie?,They have already setup a bunch of stuff from the 2nd game.
Is This a Zombie?,👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🙌🏽🫶🏽👏🏽  #TeamBella
Is This a Zombie?,So so excited!
Is This a Zombie?,The last of us season 2 episode 1 is gonna be great!!!!
Is This a Zombie?,Anyone know what kind of glasses he’s rocking here ?
Is This a Zombie?,Film now I need episodes weekly forever
Is This a Zombie?,"not watched a single episode yet. is this series actually worthwhile to watch? i hear mixed messages from friends who watch it and have played the games. some really like it, some really dislike it. basically there is no way in between."
Is This a Zombie?,now we need him in a Coen bros movie
Is This a Zombie?,"Yeah. He's the star of two of the biggest TV shows right now, and as of this week those shows are airing concurrently. He has the marketing machines of both Warner Bros. and Disney putting his face and/or voice all over the place.

Pretty insane."
Is This a Zombie?,Minus Wonder Woman 1984… I wish he wouldn’t have done that.
Is This a Zombie?,"going into it, I didn't know he was in ""The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent"".  That movie would not have been the same with anyone else in his role."
Is This a Zombie?,He is truly the Harrison Ford of our time
Is This a Zombie?,Joel will be wearing a mask for most of season 2 to give him a chance.
Is This a Zombie?,"Yeah, you can't keep the *Viper* down unless you drop a *Mountain* on him..."
Is This a Zombie?,[removed]
Is This a Zombie?,Never heard of him til TLoU. Mostly tv shows or what? Too lazy to check his IMDB
Is This a Zombie?,"I love movies, prefer them over series. Somehow Pedro Pascal hasnt been on my radar. Could you recommend some of his best works?"
Is This a Zombie?,Yeah the dude crushes it. Enjoy his work thoroughly.
Is This a Zombie?,"It's ok, he won't need to do much for season 2."
Is This a Zombie?,HBO is good at making people wait for a next season.
Is This a Zombie?,"they shot season 1 over a year. even if they start shooting late this year, with post production, the earliest you'll get season 2 will be 2025."
Is This a Zombie?,"> I hope we don’t have another two year wait for a show.

Honestly, this is killing a looot of interest in shows for me recently.

Edit: Christ, y'all acting like it's been NORMAL to wait years between seasons for shows of high quality. During its best (And less best) seasons, Game of Thrones was released yearly. Deadwood was released yearly. Breaking bad was released yearly. The Sopranos was released Yearly (Except for the weird break in the final season, which was also split for some reason). There are far too many examples that show you DON'T need years between seasons to make high quality content. This shit isn't the norm, but it's happening more and more for not enough of a pay off. Hell, Westworld ALWAYS had an extra year between it and all that proved was the quality went down, while...not really improving enough on anything else to make it worth it."
Is This a Zombie?,"an interesting way to approach it would film some season 2 right away, and minor spoiler... >!wait a couple years since part II mostly happens 4 years later!<"
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,"Not to take away from OP, but a show that only ended recently (2021) Scooby-Doo Guess Who is also a lot of fun.

It’s a different celebrity hanging out with the gang each episode, very different from Mystery Inc, but still fun. Plus it has an Urkel episode."
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,That show is a fantastic take on Scooby Doo. Instead of Velma I would have loved if we got a more adult version of that show. I honestly think an adult Scooby-Doo show in the style of Mystery Incorporated mixed with Riverdale’s campy anachronistic vibe would have been a huge hit.
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,I remember watching some episodes as a teen. I grew up with What's New. The opening song still rocks.
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,"It was cool to see a whole series spanning basically one big mystery they made it really intriging and I was hooked. 

They did long running storylines before, like 13 Ghosts, but not to the extent as they here. The characters were really fleshed out, I remember there being some complaints that they acted out of character, which paid off because they then had character development and character arcs where they became the characters we know and love. Also the side characters were really good, like the cop and the mayor.

Best Scooby Doo show. I recommened it to everyone, especially if they liked Gravity Falls, really similar vibes here"
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,Fred was the best character.
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,This show is so good! Loves the references to horror movies/books and the characters were unique
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,Hotdog Water
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,I just want to add Shaggy and Scooby Doo Get A Clue was great too
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,Best one
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,very good even for this genre
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,"Almost all the scooby doo shows are great despite flaws. Not Velma though. It's garbage for many reasons.

But my problem with recent Scooby stuff is that they insist on having Shaggy and Velma hook up.

If you go back and watch the old shows and movies from the 80's, Shaggy and Dahne have more chemistry together. When Freddy and Velma go off and do their own thing (separately, not with each other), Scooby and Shaggy and get back up from Daphne and her and shaggy relationship starts to develop far more than any of the other combinations of the human characters.

It was great because Freddy + Daphne is so obvious and boring. But in these 80's stories, they actually give Daphne real character traits. She wants to be an investigative reporter/journalist and stuff. Watch 13 Ghosts of Scooby Doo and look at how Daphne and Shaggy look at each other and hug each other stuff. Come on now. They should have kept that dynamic up."
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,I remember not liking the ending for some reason
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,Mindy must be stopped.
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,Probably 2nd Scooby Doo & gang where relationships really matter since the live action (2002 - 04)  ended
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,"Hugely nostalgic show, rewatched recently for the first time since I was 10 or so, holds up very well imo"
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,Does not take away but adds to it! I haven’t checked that one out but will! Thanks for the tip.
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,"The Alex Trebek episode is also worth checking out, fun spin on the Scooby formula."
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,Almost as good as making traps
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,"Definitly not something I would expect from a scooby doo show, but that's probably why I liked it"
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,"The ending is really, really out there and kind of fucked up when you think about the implications of what actually happened.

I really like the show, but the ending doesn't work for me on rewatches."
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,Plus a delightfully unhinged take on Daphne.
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,"I haven’t seen that one, i’ll definitely check it out."
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,What's wrong with it? I thought it was great
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,">!Everyone but the gang dies. Most of them horrible deaths as well. Now the get out of jail free card that the show uses is that they change the past, erasing those events. But I personally hate that story telling trope. Because I don't view it as the happy ending that the shows/movies using it typically try and portray it as. To me, all of those people are wiped from existence. Every character we followed on the show is just permanently gone. They never existed. It feels me with an type of dread I just don't want out of that type of show. I recognize this is just due to how I view that one concept, but I can't overlook it and it bugs me.!<

It was interesting the first time I saw it, I loved the concept of having a large interconnected plot in a Scooby Doo show. Just after seeing for the first time, I don't care for how it ends that much. I do still enjoy the show overall, but I preferred it when the overarching plot was more grounded in the first season."
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,"May he rest in peace.


Wish we could have had seen the direction Mystery Inc was going to go if it was renewed for a 3rd season."
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,"Rip, loved watching TT with my kids"
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,I loved his work and the infectious love he had for the fandom. May he Rest In Peace
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,I had the good fortune to interact with Derek while I was active in the transformers fandom and the world is darker with his passing.
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,"What a tragedy, Rest in Peace Mr Wyatt your creations will remain loved throughout the generations."
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,[deleted]
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,"I feel silly about how Sad I feel for a personI’ve never met. 

I also feel silly admitting how Teen Titans was so influential to me growing up. And I can’t wait to show my newborn daughter when she’s old enough.

Rest easy sir, and thank you."
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,RIP. :(
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,"Transformers Animated was an impressive series, that got surprisingly dark. Occasionally I'll rewatch the series, and man did they have some stylized toys! 

I hope we get another Transformers series in that style soon"
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,"Ben 10 was a part of my childhood man fuck, rest in peace legend"
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,such a shame he died so young
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,"I met him briefly at a Transformers convention in 2015 and he was very kind. I can’t remember if I told him how influential his work was to me, but I hope I did. Rest in peace to one of the greatest character designers the world has ever known."
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,"Holy hell that's tragic. My condolences.

Do they know what the cause of death is? He was 49!"
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,"This guy was the lead character designer?

I never noticed that all these shows had similar designs. I always loved them

Rest in piece, king"
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,He one of the people that transform our lives but we don’t think about. He didn’t save the world but change millions of lives for the better by contributing to our childhood entertainment and helping children become adults. I and probably a lot of people didn’t know his name or face till today. It really makes you wonder about who do we not know that had a huge impact on our lives and who did but didn’t know their impact. So let him rest in piece and thank you Mr. Wyatt
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,What he passed? RIP Ben 10 Omniverse sass favorite of mine
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,[deleted]

Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,"*How Long is Forever?*

Rest in peace."
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,"The character designs for those shows were just something special, especially considering how they incorporated an anime style while still being their own thing."
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,A hero rests his head in paradise today boys. Show your respects
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,"Legend, Derrick J. Wyatt, Dwayne McDuffie Stephen Hillenburg created much of my childhood."
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,Remember the formspringer days. Rip
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,"And I was just looking at some of his art just the other day as well....

Dang, he was honestly one of my favorite character designers out there and a huge inspiration for my own art style and desire to get into cartoons and animation. Had a lot of fun reading his Formspring/Ask.FM Q&As as well when I was a teen. He will be dearly missed."
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,Rest In Peace
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,RIP

Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,"Dude, I love Teen Titans so much.  I never even got to thank him..."
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,"No!!!!

His designs where exceptional!!!"
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,So what you’re saying is that my childhood basically just died? Damn….
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,"Everyone hated on the new teen titans but it’s actually a pretty good show that’s funny as hell. Watch it with my kids.

THE NIGHT BEGINS TO SHINE.

RIP brother."
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,"A piece of our collective childhoods, gone. I wish him all the best, wherever he is. Thanks for the memories."

Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,The guy who fucked up Ben 10
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,[deleted]
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,Whattaguy.   Thank you for your blessings on my family.
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,无稽之谈
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,This guy... he was my childhood :(
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,Loved Mystery Inc. Probably my favorite of all the Scooby Doo series ever.
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,"I like how the show won an Emmy, but still got cancelled.  Was way better written than Scooby Doo was ever expected to be"
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,"I was so disappointed we didn’t get a 3rd season.. the series was one of my favorite .. 

1st fav was Pup named scooby doo"
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,"I must be in the absolutely minority that thinks *Mystery Incorporated* squandered their darker, more focused premise with an endless barrage of forced romantic subplots."
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,I’m so happy to see fans of Mystery Incorporated. This was one of the shows I enjoyed watching on Netflix when it was there.
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,How died ?
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,Actually among S Tier
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,It felt like Season 2 ended on a pretty conclusive note.
Scooby-Doo!: Mystery Incorporated,He designed my childhood too along with those characters....RIP
Dawsons Creek,"Amazing! 

I didn't want to wait for my life to be over before this happened."
Dawsons Creek,I wonder what Dawson thought of The Fablemans.
Dawsons Creek,"All right, the show that made every teenager believe they were the most articulate person in the room finally gets an upgrade."
Dawsons Creek,"More of a “The OC” and “One Tree Hill” kid growing up, probably too young when this show came out"
Dawsons Creek,"This Blu-ray's been coming out since last September. It was originally supposed to ship in December, in time for Christmas. But it got delayed! Glad it's finally about to be here."
Dawsons Creek,"That's great news, I hope more old school shows get bluray releases since streaming services are not reliable"
Dawsons Creek,But is it going to have the original soundtrack or the replacement songs found on the DVDs?
Dawsons Creek,Do people still buy physical media?
Dawsons Creek,What is Blu-Ray?
Dawsons Creek,Orginal aspect ratio and music?
Dawsons Creek,"dammit!  

Great minds think alike, ya beat me by 11 minutes.  I like the cut of your jib, fellow Creeker."
Dawsons Creek,Will potential buyers be yes or will it be sorry?
Dawsons Creek,"Better stay away from ice cream cones, then."
Dawsons Creek,"I don't wanna wait.

Anyway, apparently they did shoot some new extras for it in the meantime, which is rare not only for a Mill Creek release but pretty much any release anymore. So someone put the delay time to good use."
Dawsons Creek,In the other thread they say the replacement songs: https://www.reddit.com/r/dawsonscreek/comments/11sz3p7/dawsons_creek_complete_series_gets_bluray_release/
Dawsons Creek,"Honestly, the corny replacement songs make these corny shows so much better."
Dawsons Creek,Yes
Dawsons Creek,To be honest I tried rewatching the show a few years back. It does not hold up.
Dawsons Creek,Boooo
Dawsons Creek,"And by doing so, they'll still have access to these shows after the streamers pull and vault 'em for a writeoff."
Dawsons Creek,"On a kind of related note, I recently rewatched all of Felicity, and that stood the test of time well for me. It was a  massive nostalgia trip for the late 90s/ early 00s while still holding up on its own."
Dawsons Creek,"It's a real rough watch.  The sentimental connection had me enjoy it back around 2010 or so when I rewatched it.  Like you, I tried again a few years ago with a SO and we did not make it very far."
Dawsons Creek,"I think you had to be a moody, stupid, hormonal teenager to watch that show. 

Really makes me worry about the crew and writer's room..."
Dawsons Creek,"The show with urkel wasn't supposed to be about him.  He was just the weird neighbor kid.  But he was so popular they redid the whole show around him.

Fonzie was so popular they made the show much more about him and wanted to rename it Fonzie's Happy Days."
Dawsons Creek,Orange Is The New Black
Dawsons Creek,"Rob Lowe’s character Sam Seaborn was originally meant to be the main character in The West Wing, not President Bartlet. The pilot was focused on Sam, as was much of the first season."
Dawsons Creek,"Fun Fact: Way back when Doctor Who first aired in the 1963, the Doctor was meant to be sort of the side character (sorta like a Gandalf figure) with the first companions (Ian and Barbara and Susan) being the main characters- in particular Ian was basically the action hero archetype and Barbara the heroine. 


Of course both the viewers and the show seemed rather more drawn to the Doctor instead and things transitioned pretty quickly. 



Another example: Daryl from the Walking Dead maybe?"
Dawsons Creek,B positive is doing that right now.
Dawsons Creek,[deleted]
Dawsons Creek,"Once Seven joined the crew on Voyager, she received significantly more airtime than anyone besides the Doctor and Janeway."
Dawsons Creek,Didn't the walking dead do this? (I gave up on it years ago)
Dawsons Creek,Season 4 of Arrow was basically *Felicity and Friends* with occasional cameos by Green Arrow.
Dawsons Creek,"I dunno if this counts, but South Park. Used to be mostly stories about the kids.  Now its a vehicle for social commentary using whichever characters are best for whatever they are commenting on"
Dawsons Creek,The Flash :(
Dawsons Creek,Ozark did this in the 2nd season. Or was it the 3rd? I forget. It was weird though.
Dawsons Creek,"Fonzie is probably the original example of this. Richie Cunningham was the star of that show when it started, then Fonzie became the real star later on. First Fonzie got popular and they were sort of co-leads, then Richie started becoming more of a B plot character. Then Ron Howard left the show in season 7 and it became the Fonzie show exclusively from then on. It also had 4 full seasons once the main lead left, so it wasn't like that 70's Show where once Foreman left the show squeeked out another season and then ended. Fonzie was popular enough to sustain the show. He's probably the first true breakout character ever"
Dawsons Creek,"The Lee Pace character on Halt and Catch Fire was definitely the lead in the first season. The show thought he was Don Draper and the creative forces correctly realized he absolutely was not. They refocused the entire series to be more about the partnership between two supporting characters and Pace became fourth among the show's four leads. It turned what was a pretty average, B- show into one of the best dramas of the 2010s."
Dawsons Creek,This so called soap opera - Iris West and her friends.
Dawsons Creek,[deleted]
Dawsons Creek,"Midnight Mass shifted from Riley to Erin as Lead and Perspective, storywise."
Dawsons Creek,The CW’s reboot of 90210 switched the main focus from Annie to Naomi from Season 2 onward.
Dawsons Creek,The Wire definitely ditched McNulty in its 4th season. Then he became the MC back in 5.
Dawsons Creek,"Attack on Titan - Sidelined Eren eventhough his scenes are usually the best. >!Sidelined for people outside the walls like Falco, Gabi, Pieck etc...!<

Smallville - Lana for Lois. Can't complain though.

Community - Sidelined Pierce in seasons 2 to 4.

LOST - Sidelined Michael for Ben and the others."
Dawsons Creek,"I feel like that's an unfair claim. I watched the show just over a year ago and it didn't seem to move off from focusing on Dawson like any other teen drama. Maybe a little bit but just to give more of an ensemble focus on Joey and Pacey, which was welcomed."
Dawsons Creek,"It's not exactly the same and it was planned that way, but Sean Bean was billed and acted as the main character of GoT season 1 and then left the show."
Dawsons Creek,I don’t think they “shifted” away from him they kind of show “jens life in college” “pacey life” ect like each episode focuses on another character and what’s going on for them. I agree with you though that Dawson is VERY cringe. and very possessive it’s creepy lol
Dawsons Creek,"> The show with urkel wasn't supposed to be about him...they redid the whole show around him.

[A good Key and Peele sketch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5Zdp1RfoyI) on that."
Dawsons Creek,It was actually a spin-off of Perfect Strangers that was supposed to focus on Harriet.
Dawsons Creek,The show with Urkel…Am I that old now that if we say Family Matters people won’t know what you’re talking about?!
Dawsons Creek,"Thank *gawd*, too.  Piper was awful."
Dawsons Creek,"I feel like it was never Bartlet's show, but a true ensemble."
Dawsons Creek,"Daryl 100%. Dude started as the ""brother of the asshole of the group"" and he ended up being the leader."
Dawsons Creek,So why was the show called Doctor Who if the Doctor wasn't meant to be the main character?
Dawsons Creek,And for good reason.
Dawsons Creek,"Britta went from a very cliche and bland ""smart woman counterpoint to the lead"" to one of the funniest parts of the show in the ""Britta is the worst"" era.

Reversing that in the shows twilight years was part of why it loses so much comedic steam near the end."
Dawsons Creek,There's two good reasons for that.
Dawsons Creek,Yep they wrote off Rick many years ago
Dawsons Creek,"It is different in that the main actor left the show. But up to that point, he was still the focus of the show. On Dawson's Creek, James Van Der Beek stayed with the show until the very end, but from season 3/4 onwards it became more and more centred on Joey, the character played by Katie Holmes. By the end of the series, it could have been called Joey's Creek and despite the original cast remaining intact, she was the only character to appear in all 128 episodes."
Dawsons Creek,"Rick felt sidelined near the end, but he was a part of the final conflict in the show I'm pretty sure."
Dawsons Creek,"Oh god ***Felicity.***

Was there ever a more **obnoxious** moment on TV then killing off the comic's famous love interest *(one of the few consistent and unbreakable examples)* and have her dying words be ""I think you should date the creator's OC, you two are a better match""

Unbelievably annoying."
Dawsons Creek,It's because Trey and Matt feel more related to Randy instead of the kids.
Dawsons Creek,It's the fucking Randy show now and I'm so goddamn over it. 6 episodes a year and they can't come up with a single funny idea that isn't about Randy during the 46 weeks they have off?
Dawsons Creek,"Agree 100% with this. I love South Park seasons 1-15 and even 16-19 are decent.  Season 20 on are just terrible and that's when they made a HUGE shift on the main character to being more about the adults instead of the 4 kids.

It's fine for a few episodes here and there but the show is best when it's the boys doing stupid shit that makes no sense."
Dawsons Creek,"Butters definitely replaced/sidelined Kenny.

Though Id argue they never forgot the kids, they did have to start sharing focus with the adults as the show went on. The creators said that was due to they themselves growing up and identifying more with the adults than the kids."
Dawsons Creek,"It's funny that happened, because I've been catching random episodes of Happy Days and the episodes without Richie are just insufferable. It's especially awful when Richie's bitchy wife is there but for some reason he's not."
Dawsons Creek,Great answer.
Dawsons Creek,"Cameron season 2 was hard to push through.  I felt like the show was trying to spin her terrible behavior in a positive light.  Despite a pretty decent change in behavior Joe was still treated like an asshole, and Gordon was treated like a idiot savant.  It got more evened out the next season, but I wouldn't call season 2 a huge improvement."
Dawsons Creek,ST didn't have a main character
Dawsons Creek,"I mean, Eren wasn't side-lined. His arc was to progress from hopeful recruit to terrorist/villian of the entire series.

Thats just like, **the story**."
Dawsons Creek,"No, I'm so old I couldn't remember the name of the show."
Dawsons Creek,The President was rarely supposed to be seen. They changed it after Martin Sheen auditioned.
Dawsons Creek,"Youre downvoted but yeah. Even if they gave him more attention than originally intended, the name of the show alone shows he was always a main focus."
Dawsons Creek,I don’t watch because of Middleditch even though I love Annaleigh Ashford. What is changing?
Dawsons Creek,"Yes and no.

While I like the new setting and cast, they basically 86'd the Dialysis group and there were actors I like it that group.

Ok, its Briga Heelan, I wish they kept her."
Dawsons Creek,"> It is different in that the main actor left the show. But up to that point, he was still the focus of the show

That’s pretty debatable. Weren’t there, like, entire episodes he didn’t appear in? By the time they were fighting Negan we were following three different communities with at least half a dozen “main characters” in each."
Dawsons Creek,"I defend the increase in Randys role as I get why its happened. Aside from a lot of other things, they do a lot of stories that need an adult character like Randy in order to tell.

Their insistence to keep milking the ""Tregridy Farms"" bit though, I cant defend. They make a lot of jokes about how they know the farm is unpopular, but keep doing it anyway.

Im real sick of plot resolutions being ""Everyone got high and things were fine haha"""
Dawsons Creek,I like Randy tho
Dawsons Creek,"I wonder if it's because when they started they were more childish and drawing on what they were like growing up, and now they're older and identify with Randy more."
Dawsons Creek,"I defend the increase in Randys role as I get why its happened. Aside from a lot of other things, they do a lot of stories that need an adult character like Randy in order to tell.

Their insistence to keep milking the ""Tregridy Farms"" bit though, I cant defend. They make a lot of jokes about how they know the farm is unpopular, but keep doing it anyway.

Im real sick of plot resolutions being ""Everyone got high and things were fine haha"""
Dawsons Creek,Wow I didn’t realize they were doing so few episodes now
Dawsons Creek,"At a certain point, I think it's just a lot easier for Matt and Trey to imagine themselves as 40 years olds than as 8 year olds."
Dawsons Creek,I hated Lori Beth.  He should have hooked up with Laverne and/or Shirley.
Dawsons Creek,Haha fair enough
Dawsons Creek,"Yea I’ve heard that, I just mean from start to finish it’s always felt like an ensemble show. The Pilot even makes it seem like Josh is the protagonist more than Sam since he’s the one in crisis."
Dawsons Creek,"His character's been slowly phased out, and he presumably left on a permanant basis in the season finale."
Dawsons Creek,Thomas Middleditch was accused of sexually harassing/groping multiple women.
Dawsons Creek,"I agree, I've always liked the Randy character, when he was also having those wacky adventures (his baseball episode is one of my favourite episodes), but the whole Tegridy has soured me on the show, and I say this as a long time fan. I can handle it not being focussed on the kida anymore every episode, but the farm thing at this point has run dry, was never that funny to begin with, and it drags down the show.

I don't need continuity in South Park. Plus, they always build up to these situations that are so out there that it's not enjoyable. Randy going on a bender with Mickey Mouse and fucking a pengolin that's the source for Covid? Sorry, but that simply too stupid."
Dawsons Creek,"I like him too, but for three or four seasons now, it's been all about him and I'm over it."
Dawsons Creek,"For sure, that's part of why it's so good. Even when a character is the main character for a season, they're not so focused on that the rest just fall away."
Dawsons Creek,Wasn’t that before season 1?
Dawsons Creek,[deleted]
Dawsons Creek,"I never minded those episodes because they were single episodes, not entire seasons.

Were they the best episodes? No, but it was a break from the boys story.  Now, the episodes about the boys are a break from the episodes about Randy."
Dawsons Creek,I never got into the show but James Van Der Beek is hilarious in Don't Trust the Bitch in Apartment 23.
Dawsons Creek,"Pacey Witter literally changed my life by just doing what he wants all the time while still being a nice guy. Watched the show for his character, and it did not disappoint."
Dawsons Creek,"Hey do you know the ZIP code for Dawson's Creek?

It's 90108, for our lives to be over..."
Dawsons Creek,It’s impressive that it lasted 6 seasons with Dawson being one of the biggest drips and worst main characters in television history. His scenes become unwatchable as the series goes on
Dawsons Creek,Show went massively downhill after season 4 when Dawson went to college and the show became Joey's Creek with occasional Dawson. I actually struggle to think of a show that has continued past a big life transition in the main characters lives and continued to be good.
Dawsons Creek,"I agree as to S1-S4. I find S5 and S6, outside of the series finale, to be unwatchable."
Dawsons Creek,It's going to go downhill pretty soon. The writing definitely got worse as time went on.
Dawsons Creek,As far as I remember they had the first gay kiss on an American series. Growing up as a gay man in a homophobic country that was a big deal for me.
Community,Random aside: I watched THE MARTIAN (2015) last night for the first time and got a kick out of Donald Glover essentially doing his Abed impression in his role.
Community,He’s so good in Mythic Quest! They should give him a cameo in the new always sunny!
Community,Loved Danny’s role of Huey in Ducktales. The show was so well-written. You can literally hear the personalities in the entire cast.
Community,"Gilmore Girls star, Danny Pudi"
Community,"What do you mean broke out?

That was Abed playing Danny Pudi playing Abed playing a background character in Cougar Town 

This article is streets behind"
Community,"Larry, I'm on Ducktales."
Community,Cool cool cool.
Community,He’s so good as brad in mystic quest
Community,I can't wait to see him as the Mechanist in the Avatar Live Action.
Community,I loved his character in Mythic Quest. He was like the anti-Abed.
Community,"Every time i see Danny Pudi in Mythic Quest, it feels like when Troy and Abed tried to be normal"
Community,"Larry, I'm on Ducktales."
Community,"I'll always remember Danny for his other role. I started working at Walgreens in like 2008. I went through the usual corporate training videos with actors playing customers. Walgreens corporate is in Danville, Illinois. So I guess they hire a lot of actors from the Chicago area.

Pudi played a ""disgruntled customer."" I can't remember exactly what the issue was but I remember laughing so hard in the tiny back room by myself because of how random it was. I guess at the time you'll take whatever work you can get. 

I'm here 15 years later as a Community, Mythic Quest and overall Pudi fan. Despite seeing him in several roles I will never forget how he played the nameless angry customer in a Walgreens training video. I think I have a picture saved somewhere in my cloud storage."
Community,"He has a mustache in Somebody I Used To Know, clearly it's set in the half darkest timeline."
Community,Can confirm this
Community,CHICKEN RUUUUUNNNNN!
Community,I still can't believe this is happening
Community,"What other big roles has he had? I know he’s on Mythic Quest, but can you really call it “breaking out” if you’re just talking about 1-2 roles years after Community ended?"
Community,Did he though?
Community,breaking out? everything i've seen him in post community he's essentially the same guy. yes even in mythic quest
Community,He was great in Mythic Quest as a sorta villain
Community,He will always be abed to me
Community,He's going to have a hard time breaking out of Community.  McHale is having the same problem -Animal control is awful.
Community,His treatment of Jeff Daniels in his demonstration scene is legendary.
Community,"Fun fact, the scene where he falls down was a real fall and the other actor is actually trying to check on Donald Glover, and not act. Donald Glover ran with it and kept going. The cameraman also noticeably freezes in position also to check on him, but then got back to panning when Donald Glover popped back up."
Community,I've avoided The Martian because of Matt Damon's role in Interstellar but what you just said will get me to watch it lol
Community,I would love to see him play the straight man around the gang
Community,He basically became Jeff and killed it
Community,I keep wondering if Mythic Quest was already in production when Community ended.  Otherwise Abed saying >!he was leaving to work on a show set in a video game studio!< is a heck of a coincidence.
Community,"There's something quite unnerving about seeing him play such an intensely neurotypical character in that show, it almost feels like an Abed observation of people without autism."
Community,Wow if Abed is in Mythic Quest thats my next watch. I'm already a Sunnyhead and have heard so much in the Always Sunny podcast about why I should watch
Community,"Yes to all the above plus the fact that his role on the show gave us one of my all-time favourite interview clips.

[""Larry, I'm on Ducktales.""](https://youtu.be/76HijAoXi6k)"
Community,"At first I thought it was weird they didn't do a similar thing to the original, but it came out pretty awesome, and gave them more personality"
Community,"I loved him in DuckTales. I'm still mad the third season didn't get to fully commit to the original intention of each season being about a triplet.  
Season 1 - Dewey and his search for his mother  
Season 2 - Louie and his search for purpose  
Season 3 - Huey and his search for balance  

We got 1 and 2, but Huey got short-shifted when they they saw the writing in the wall and shifted to be more about Webby instead. Which is fine, but the few tastes we got of Huey in Season 3 were so good. Huey having to come to terms with his reliance on the Junior Woodchuck Guidebook and not always being the best at things. And then the late season reveal about The Duke of Making a Mess, which was foreshadowed in season 1. Huey is basically like his Uncle Donald regarding temper, but he keeps that in check by forcing himself to be analytical about everything.

Anyway, this is my rant to no one in particular about Huey."
Community,GLOM-TALES!!
Community,This is amazing: https://youtu.be/76HijAoXi6k
Community,"I did too… but I find it concerning. There’s a lot of belief in the ASD community that Huey and Abed are on the spectrum, and both represent great examples. So it’s concerning that two great representations are concentrated with one actor’s portrayal."
Community,Do you mean Cougar Town?
Community,"Yes! 

I watched some of Gilmore girls with my girlfriend we were like holy shit that’s fuxking Danny Pudi!"
Community,"Greek star, Danny Pudi"
Community,"I wouldn’t mind him playing Abed in a Sunny episode (because of the impl.. uh, Raven’s Quest connection). Making Cougar Town, Scrubs, Community and Sunny all in the same universe."
Community,Cool cool.
Community,Hot hot hot hot.
Community,My BF won’t watch the show because he doesn’t like seeing Abed be so evil. Lol.
Community,Wow I would love to see that section of the training lol
Community,He was recently in Somebody I Used To Know with Alison Brie. It was okay but all I could see was Abed and Annie the whole movie
Community,"His IMDB says he’s had 45 roles since the last season of community in 2015..?  But either way, I’m sure it’s hard to move yourself away from being known as the eccentric and well known character everyone knows him as"
Community,Breaking out of the abed box =/= breaking out overall
Community,Absolutely not but reddit will eat up a headline it agrees with
Community,I haven't watched all of Mythic Quest but his character is pretty different than Abed. Like from the jump.
Community,"Ah, I think I've found your problem. You don't have audio or visuals when you watch things. Makes sense."
Community,He does look very similar in all his roles.
Community,"Hey bud, just to let you know, when you watch a tv show you have to be facing the telivision. Its the big screen you pointed the remote at. Next, make sure the tv is making noises. When you are able to see and hear the telivison, it becomes much easier to tell the difference between his characters."
Community,"I was going to say, has he even been in anything else?"
Community,„And you are?“ „Teddy. The director of NASA.“ „Cool“
Community,"Using him as a prop to help the demonstration was fucking hilarious. Made me think of two things: 

1) that’s definitely happened at NASA before in some capacity, big discoveries come with a dose of manic energy

2) it reminded me of a John Mulaney standup bit (check me if I’m wrong, I can’t find it) where he has a buddy that gets people together and chain-smokes through a long-winded explanation about his magnum opus fantasy epic"
Community,"If you look closely, he also steals his pen and swaps it with a different one"
Community,"I avoided it for the exact same reason. It’s now my favourite movie. If I need a serious recovery couch day after a massive blowout like a festival, I’ll put it on as my comfort film. Trust me, do yourself a favour."
Community,"I was concerned that I wouldn't like it because I'm not a fan of Matt Damon, but he absolutely nailed it in The Martian.  The rest of the cast is great too.  It's now one of my favorite movies."
Community,"The Martian is fantastic.

It's one of those movies that just sucks you in right until the end."
Community,Its a great book.  The movie is a pretty good adaption.  Don't like they cut the best part of the book out and changed the ending.  but overall its a very enjoyable novel adaptation.
Community,I watched it in the theaters on my birthday. I made a decision to watch it on my birthday every year.
Community,I still hate TMZ for spoiling the cameo
Community,"Hail Captain Blondbeard, the space pirate!"
Community,"If you can find it, watch the extended version."
Community,I want him to be crickets new friend!
Community,"Shit, you're right!"
Community,Holy shit!
Community,"If I remember correctly, that line was because at that time Dan Harmon was working on a project of a TV show that was ""30 Rock but in a videogame studio"". My guess is he probably wanted to foreshadow/reference it in Community. 
Sadly, it never became a thing. So yeah I think it's just a cool coincidence."
Community,I am 100% convinced that his character in Mythic Quest is just grown up Abed who has learned to adapt by imitating other people he knew.
Community,">intensely neurotypical character in that show

He's a flat out sociopath in that show."
Community,"Uh, did we watch different shows?"
Community,"It's got some rough edges to it but I still found it a lot of fun. The flashback episodes are some of the highlights in each season. 

But Danny is great throughout the series."
Community,"I generally hate/indifferent to actor interviews but I will remember this one until I die.   


Nice socks are definitely a fair answer. :) But I'm not a multimillionaire I guess."
Community,Why is that concerning?
Community,"I think you mean MCU legend, Danny Pudi."
Community,"
>Do you mean ~~Cougar Town~~ Cougarton?


Ftfy"
Community,Woah I think the timeline just became 2% darker
Community,Abed and Annie in theeeeee MOOOVIE!!!
Community,"Oh I really liked the movie! Good romantic comedies are rare and this one hit the mark, IMO. When Pudi and Brie were together I did think it was back to Annie and Abed, but Pudi’s character was so human and grounding that it quickly went away. 

But mostly I just really appreciated the character work that went into the main characters, which felt richer than your typical romcom."
Community,Have you watched mythic quest?
Community,"If you’re gonna generalize a group of over half a billion people, why not just go all the way and say ‘humans will eat up a headline they agree with.”

Seems more like a human problem rather than one exclusive to a single social media site."
Community,You’re in for a treat.  He just keeps growing his character.
Community,He’s essentially the same character as in community in that he manipulates everyone around him like he does in community with the study group. The only difference is mystic quest is he does it for money.
Community,He is playing Evil Abed and you know it...
Community,We should build like an interconnected network of computers where you could just go and get information for things.
Community,"My only issue with that scene, and it's the only thing I can think of when I watch it, is why would the head of NASA have one of those giant, white clunky, cheap looking pens in the top pocket of his clearly expensive suit?"
Community,"> 2) it reminded me of a John Mulaney standup bit (check me if I’m wrong, I can’t find it) where he has a buddy that gets people together and chain-smokes through a long-winded explanation about his magnum opus fantasy epic

Not familiar with the bit, but this sounds like how Tolkien shared LotR with friends. Allegedly the statement, “Oh no. Not another fucking elf,” was uttered."
Community,It was hilarious but I also kind of found it kinda ridiculous and sort of unbelievable in the sense that a NASA head wouldn't need such a highschool level explanation of the basic concepts. Obviously the ultimate aim of it was to explain the concept to audiences but maybe him explaining it to a non space guy would have made more sense just from the POV of the story
Community,"“Fuck it, just put on The Martian” is said in my house frequently."
Community,"Kimmel, is that you?"
Community,"The end sucks though and I'll die on this hill. I wanted to see splashdown and him stepping on grass for the first time in years. Not him rubbing his helmet on another astronauts helmet and then smash cut to him years later teaching a class with a shit ass gag ending where he says ""Any questions?"" and they all raise their hands at the same time. I don't know if I've ever hated a movie ending more."
Community,"To be fair, the book is *explicitly* clear about what would be different if this were a movie! ;)

But yeah, the Iron Man bit was silly in my opinion, and having the commander go out was an unnecessary change. Would have liked to see them retain the original series of events. 

What was the best part of the book in your opinion? Frying pathfinder? It’s been a spell since the last time I watched the film"
Community,The book is fantastic....also check out Project Hail Mary by the same author....also incredible.
Community,[deleted]
Community,"That too much of a coincidence, that is hilarious. Whenever I hear about production of shows and movies it takes sooo much longer than I would have assumed. Nice catch!"
Community,Alternate timeline kinda evil Abed.
Community,"Abed did say he was going to work on a video game at the end of community.

It would be hilarious if community referred to mythic quest as a show that exists that he works on, even funnier if he actually created Brad Bakshi as an alternate personality to succeed outside of college. 

“Abed what have you been up to?”

“Oh I went to prison for securities fraud”

Though I’d be surprised if Apple would allow a crossover like that."
Community,"Yeah, neurotypical /s"
Community,[deleted]
Sarah and Duck,Method directing
Sarah and Duck,"A lot of people in these comments are straight up making things up about what is happening behind the scenes, and not only about this show for some reason."
Sarah and Duck,This seems cruel to do to cast/crew.
Sarah and Duck,"The announcement was so abrupt that it's hard to believe it was planned in advance by Armstrong, even if  he says otherwise. I'm suspecting that some disagreements with HBO will come to light sooner or later."
Sarah and Duck,I mean if they were told before they could be searching other jobs for after the show ended. I would be pissed.
Sarah and Duck,"I wonder if this could wind up being a case like where the Closer became Major Crimes after a change of leads, and nothing else."
Sarah and Duck,Boar on the floor.
Sarah and Duck,"Either the people involved with this show have just been constantly working us, or it seems like one of the more toxic workplaces out there haha. God damn."
Sarah and Duck,Cant make a finale without breaking a few Shivs
Sarah and Duck,Someone pointed out that it's probably not a good sign that the main stars couldn't tell that it was a finale' after reading the script........
Sarah and Duck,There had been rumors before that the show will continue without Cox and it kind of explains why he is happy it's over. It feels like this how Logan would've ended things too.
Sarah and Duck,"I don't understand how anyone can watch season 3 and think ""surely there can be a season 5"", they rehashed so much stuff from season 2, Kendall's depression, his flirting with suicide, they undid so much of season 2 for season 3 to even have a plot and they upped Logan's plot armor to a ridiculous degree. They built up that FBI investigation like it was going to be hell for the company and then it was nothing, it served only as a tease to prolong the season and accomplished absolutely nothing. And the Skarsgaard plot point is nonsense one episode they want to buy his company, the next he can buy them... somehow."
Sarah and Duck,"Hey, I stopped watching mid season-2. But anyway, didn’t realize Hugo was Fisher Stevens, who amongst other roles was the guy from Shirt Circuit."
Sarah and Duck,"On one hand you get to enjoy working on the season without the feeling of dread knowing it's going to end.

On the other hand, this is cruel for those who need to constantly audition for new jobs and could've missed out on a new gig."
Sarah and Duck,The cast should have been notified way before the finale to prepare.  I know I would want to know if my job was ending.
Sarah and Duck,"The only reason I'm against them doing this to actors, is they should be given a heads up so they can start looking for their next jobs. I'm sure she will be fine in the long run, but she's not a household name so it will take some work to get the next big thing."
Sarah and Duck,I can't get past the first part of that finale table read quote without GOT PTSD.
Sarah and Duck,How can you keep successing
Sarah and Duck,"I mean it’s been known for awhile that this is the last season.


Does she not read the news?"
Sarah and Duck,Here is the thing that puzzles me if the cast themselves dont know until the final table read that show wasnt ending it points to me maybe that ending was not really satisfying and deserved
Sarah and Duck,Must be painful to be snookered like that.
Sarah and Duck,She doesn’t watch the show if she thought it needed to continue.
Sarah and Duck,"Um, I knew it before they began filming. It was announced."
Sarah and Duck,At least she's got animal crossing
Sarah and Duck,"Well Sarah, keeping you in the dark kept your performance authentic. It’s a lot easier to act like you have no idea, when you truly have no idea."
Sarah and Duck,I am going to miss that juicy butt to be honest
Sarah and Duck,you’ll live
Sarah and Duck,Why did the post such a terrible photo? The angle and it’s out of focus. They literally picked the worst one they could find. She’s awesome and I’m sure has some high quality ones they coulda used.
Sarah and Duck,TIL:   Succession is a TV show that exists. And Sarah Snook is a n actress that also exists.
Sarah and Duck,"Trust me, I don’t know how they didn’t know! I was in a pivotal scene and I knew it was the end, just being an extra."
Sarah and Duck,Is it just me or do her facial expressions weird anyone else out.  It’s like she’s always actively trying to show different emotions with her eyes than she is with her mouth.
Sarah and Duck,"Is this the ""Snuck a Snook up my snizz"" person?"
Sarah and Duck,Good riddance.
Sarah and Duck,"She’s the worst of the show though so I don’t feel bad, next is the dude that plays connor tbh… dude is mid as heck"
Sarah and Duck,Boohoo. Ffs
Sarah and Duck,So no one else knew either or did they all just decide she will be the one left out?
Sarah and Duck,Nobody mentioned it on set?
Sarah and Duck,Good god that site is cancer on mobile
Sarah and Duck,Emotions aside what if you turned another job down during the season?
Sarah and Duck,Snoo snoo
Sarah and Duck,no more Succession?  who's gonna win all the emmys now?
Sarah and Duck,And a pretty big loss of $$$$$$$ as well
Sarah and Duck,I love her sm
Sarah and Duck,Rooting for you!
Sarah and Duck,What?! It feels like there could be 2 seasons left in it. It was just really heating up (as far as popularity).
Sarah and Duck,so when is the spin off staring sarah snook?
Sarah and Duck,"I mean sure, but also wasn’t this clear right after last season aired that the coming season would be the last? Or was that only my impression and no one else’s?"
Sarah and Duck,"As a fellow Redditor I can provide some insight about what’s happening behind the scenes. 

If we look at her eyes in that random Getty photo the journalist used, we can see that she is sad that she will not earn a million dollar payday next year.

If we move down to her smile we can see that there was a sense of jealousy that her on-screen husband was Mr Darcy. 

If we look at her cheek, we can further understand that the dynamic on set was strictly business."
Sarah and Duck,"reddit loves pushing their narrative. some guy saying ""some people in the witcher writing room didn't care for the source material"" got spun into ""everyone involved in witchers production except for my boyfriend henry cavill hated the source material"""
Sarah and Duck,Haven't been to this sub before?
Sarah and Duck,"Weird phenomenon all over Reddit, first noted it in the videogame subs.  The conversation drifts a million miles away from discussing the actual subject matter and in to circlejerk narratives about business decisions/behind the scenes stuff.  The most popular version of the moment is ""I didn't like adaptation X so I'm going to say that the creators must hate the subject matter and they wanted to tell an original story but just tacked the IP on to it.  They think they're too good for the IP."
Sarah and Duck,90% of the shit said on Reddit is made up.
Sarah and Duck,They may not have known at the beginning of the season.
Sarah and Duck,"Maybe it will be fitting with the character’s narrative arcs. Have them stroll through the show with swagger and the confidence that it’ll go on forever, only to have the rug pulled out at the last moment. 

These characters are detestable and I hope their story has an equally upsetting conclusion for them.

Edit: from the comments, I think many of you underestimate the lengths a director or show runner will go to help coax the desired performance out of their cast."
Sarah and Duck,"Right? Cruel not just from a story standpoint but now their paychecks are going to stop (correct me if I’m wrong, idk how it works getting paid in tv) or not having a new project lined ip"
Sarah and Duck,I’m sure any working actor you asked would not be surprised by this. Pretty standard Hollywood industry BS
Sarah and Duck,This is by far the cruelest act of cruelty I have ever heard of. Humanity is done for.
Sarah and Duck,Is there a GoFundMe somewhere to help alleviate their suffering?
Sarah and Duck,"Armstrong has been indicating that the show would likely end by the fourth season for some time now, IIRC."
Sarah and Duck,Or just a budget thing since HBO is cutting left and right.
Sarah and Duck,Abrupt?  It's been rumored forever.
Sarah and Duck,Yes disagreements because hbo would slaughter their cash cow. What you are saying makes no sense
Sarah and Duck,"> The announcement was so abrupt that it's hard to believe it was planned in advance by Armstrong, even if he says otherwise.

Sounds like you know the truth and nothing will change your mind, then. Must be nice"
Sarah and Duck,Yea I’d be pretty peeved if I was left in the dark and I could of been searching for other roles.
Sarah and Duck,"Reminds me of managers who let go workers and tell them to clean out their desk the same day. In France by law, bosses have to give two weeks notice if they are letting someone go."
Sarah and Duck,Or the Good Wife became the Good Fight
Sarah and Duck,"That's what it feels like to me. I would've thought actors and their agents would be aware of the near future plans of a show, so they could schedule other projects around it."
Sarah and Duck,"“Emotionally, all of us weren’t necessarily ready to be done with the show because we love each other so much,” she said.

How are you getting toxic workplace from this article? Did you even read it?"
Sarah and Duck,Now they have the material to make a Succession style show *about* Succession!
Sarah and Duck,I really don’t think the decision for this to be the last season was planned like people are saying and probably came about due to the fallout of actors Brian Cox and Jeremy Strong
Sarah and Duck,[deleted]
Sarah and Duck,It says she found out at the table read right? So she found out the first time she read the finale script is how I’m reading this
Sarah and Duck,That’s not what the article says though.
Sarah and Duck,"I’m afraid it’s going to end literally where we began with health issues, everyone fighting and nothing changed."
Sarah and Duck,"Yup, honestly I’m concerned that the finale may be rushed and not really feel like a finale at all. 

That’d be beyond disappointing for such a good show, but everything is on the table now with HBO given WBD’s terrible management."
Sarah and Duck,It wouldnt be but that isn't what it said. Maybe read.
Sarah and Duck,What are the odds discovery dropped the ax and made them wrap it up after the merger? I swear I “knew” this was supposed to be a five season show. Didn’t the creator say that back in the beginning?
Sarah and Duck,"The weird thing is the same thing is happening with Barry, it looks like it’s the last season but there’s been no announcement of it being the last season and the cast aren’t allowed to comment on it."
Sarah and Duck,"I mean yes and no. 

It’s building up to something I’m sure they just didn’t realize it was the end end. 

they easily could squeeze one more season of whoever inherits the company and it’s downfall with out Logan."
Sarah and Duck,"Honestly my completely unsubstantiated conjecture is that this season will end with both Logan and Kendall destroying each other / dying as the series resolution. This removes what sound like the two most problematic and volatile personalities behind the scenes, then the show can continue on with other characters in a rebranded show. Possibly Tom/Shiv/Roman/Greg leading the supporting cast. Since for some reason the powers that be talk about spin-offs and the way this show ended abruptly.. it just seems like they’ll finish the show to let everyone out of contract and then renegotiate for a spin-off that is more or less a continuation."
Sarah and Duck,"Half the plots in Succession are sitcom style where they return to the status quo after the plot is resolved. Even though they sell shares, lose power, are the most publicly turbulent company ever, nothing ever really changes for the characters. Logan still seems to control absolutely everything. The one that sticks out to me was with the dick pics thing and how suddenly they put all this pressure on Gerri seemingly to try and force her out, and then next episode it's not brought up, no one seems to have it out for Gerri and no one cares at all."
Sarah and Duck,"Fair point. Even the trailer hints at another rehash of the plot of season 3. Basically the kids actually team up this time. 

Which I enjoy but definitely would have liked to see it play out a season earlier."
Sarah and Duck,Agreed with this. I loved Succession so much but season 3 just ain’t it. They flanderized Logan too with all the swearing for no reason. Nothing really happens all season.
Sarah and Duck,"also if i knew it was the last season maybe i savor it

not rushing home at call time but maybe hanging on set etc"
Sarah and Duck,I mean whatever next move would have been planned. They don't shoot the season back to back they take like 6 month hiatuses or something so if she was going to start a new film franchise or tv show she would have already scheduled that for the hiatus.
Sarah and Duck,And then she cleaned up her trailer because she is totally OCD
Sarah and Duck,Well it definitely points to everything being wrapped up in one episode.
Sarah and Duck,"Um, what pre-filming announcement would you be referring to? Because it was a big deal when the end was announced 2 months ago."
Sarah and Duck,Ditto for both.
Sarah and Duck,Wouldn’t your work as the extra come after the table read
Sarah and Duck,Laughably bad takes here.
Sarah and Duck,Shiv has always been outside the inner circle. Cousin Greg knew…
Sarah and Duck,"Certainly not.

It seemed like last season set up the PATH to the end of the show, but for really popular programs, that’s usually two seasons worth of content. For example, instead of 12 episodes of a final season they’ll do 8/8 split over two final seasons. Such as what Breaking Bad did."
Sarah and Duck,"Uhhh not really, and tbh the lack of final season announcement until last month had me pretty convinced we were getting a fifth season as well."
Sarah and Duck,"I dunno.. rich white people drama, mixed in with nepotism isn’t really that compelling these days. It’s a great show. I hope it ends with a bang, quick and easy."
Sarah and Duck,"yeah, how did I know it was going to be the last season before she did?  They have been telegraphing this as the last season for at least a year"
Sarah and Duck,All I've read prior to that announcement was the plan was always 5 seasons.
Sarah and Duck,"Finally, someone who can *actually* give us some reliable insights."
Sarah and Duck," I look forward to seeing all the clickbait articles on ""SARAH SNOOK JEALOUS OF HUSBAND"""
Sarah and Duck,"Okay, but what about her Phrenology? Can't forget to consider that. ^/s"
World War II in Colour,"It’s incredible the amount of actors they had in the series that was either well known or have become well known over the years. 

The same could be said for the pacific, but with Band of brothers it’s way more."
World War II in Colour,Lt. Spears when he ran back.
World War II in Colour,Ron Livingston was fucking golden
World War II in Colour,My Great Uncle Brad Freeman is the last living enlisted member of the Band of Brothers. [He was just honored by the National WWII Museum](https://usveteransmagazine.com/2022/03/museum-honors-surviving-members-band-brothers/).
World War II in Colour,I think people sleep on how good Donnie Wahlberg was in this.
World War II in Colour,"While Michael Fassbender was definitely in it his role was pretty minimal and he basically disappears after the first episode. I don't think you see him again until episode 7. 

If anything James McAvoy has a much more memorable appearance in his only episode.

Still my favorite miniseries ever. I think only Chernobyl comes close."
World War II in Colour,"Welp, guess I'm rewatching Band of Brothers now."
World War II in Colour,[deleted]
World War II in Colour,"This miniseries more than anything else I’ve watched captures so well that sense of marching through hell, witnessing so much horror and then it’s all over and what now? Sell insurance I guess. 🤷‍♂️ 

What a mindfuck that transition must be."
World War II in Colour,">Following the brigade known as ""The Easy Company""

There is so, so much wrong with that phrase."
World War II in Colour,"I watch Band of Brothers around every Christmas. One of my favorite series, that and The Sopranos."
World War II in Colour,Can’t wait to see if they strike gold again with “master of the air”
World War II in Colour,Awesome series…The Pacific was amazing as well. Generation Kill comes in third for me.
World War II in Colour,David Schwimmer acted his ass off.
World War II in Colour,The saddest scene I may have ever witnessed on TV is when they first find and enter the concentration camp. That has stuck with me like nothing Ive seen. Humans can really fucking suck sometimes.
World War II in Colour,Greatest ww2 movie or show ever made.
World War II in Colour,"""The Easy Company""

How many other people facepalmed over that one?"
World War II in Colour,", but *not* Connor Ratliff."
World War II in Colour,"I end up rewatching it every few years - still holds up, and some of the best TV!"
World War II in Colour,"One of the best pieces of TV ever made.

Watching episode 7 with a surround sound system is incredible."
World War II in Colour,"Greatest 10 episodes of anything in television history, bar none. I can’t believe it’s been over 20 years. I vividly remember my dad having 8 year old me and my brothers stay up and watch it with him when it first premiered"
World War II in Colour,"""The Easy Company""....

&#x200B;

It was ""Easy Company"" as in E Company. Easy being ""E"" in the military phonetic alphabet at the time. It wasn't a nickname.

&#x200B;

...Also, it was a Company. A ""Brigade"" is its own thing.

&#x200B;

**EDIT**: I know it sounds pedantic, but I don't know how you can claim to understand the show in any capacity if you get that basic detail wrong. Like, Easy Company and it's general structure and culture is critical to the show."
World War II in Colour,CURRAHEE!!!!!!
World War II in Colour,This and the pacific were absolutely amazing
World War II in Colour,That show made me take history class seriously.
World War II in Colour,"Just did a Memorial weekend re-watch.

Still shocking how many future great actors were just bit parts in this thing. 

Also *""Bastogne""* is easily one of the best episodes in the history of television."
World War II in Colour,And Steve from American Dad
World War II in Colour,"The greatest miniseries ever IMO. I watch it at least twice a year and it never gets old. The cast was amazing, but my favorite parts are the segments with the men of Easy Company recalling the stories. Now they’re all gone. I would love to see more miniseries like this and am looking forward to Spielberg and Hanks new on ‘Masters Of The Air.’"
World War II in Colour,"""Grandpa were you a hero in the war?"" gets me EVERY TIME."
World War II in Colour,Really an amazing mini-series! Stayed true to the book very well too.
World War II in Colour,"I finally got around to watching Band of Brothers last year... It was an amazing thing to watch, I was kicking myself for waiting so long to watch it.

I followed it up by watching The Pacific right after which I had not seen either.

I still have not seen Saving Private Ryan yet :("
World War II in Colour,Looks like it's time for my yearly rewatch
World War II in Colour,"Hot take: while everyone was great, Donnie Wahlberg had the best performance"
World War II in Colour,Watching this series as a teen definitely played a roll in my decision to go airborne infantry in the army. This series is amazing all around.
World War II in Colour,"Simon Pegg had a longer role than Fassbender. Hell, 99% of the Germans had longer roles than him."
World War II in Colour,I grew up seeing Bill Guarnere and Babe Hefron on my neighborhood. Knew they were vets but had no idea about them until this show. They were really nice guys.
World War II in Colour,"Company. Not a brigade.
Company is approximately ~144 men. A brigade is more like ~2,000-4000 men
I don’t even think we used brigades in world war 2. Still on the regimental system is. 506 Reg 101st Airborne Div"
World War II in Colour,"Ron Livingston- Best know for Office Space.

Who the fuck is rob livingston?"
World War II in Colour,I watched it again on Memorial Day. It’s one of those programs that I can watch over and over again.
World War II in Colour,"I adore both BoB and The Pacific. Still waiting for that third show from these two tho.

During quarantine I read ""With the old breed"" by Eugene Sledge, such a fine read!"
World War II in Colour,Y'all listen to the [excellent HBO podcast](https://www.hbo.com/band-of-brothers/podcast) if you haven't.  Fascinating listen.
World War II in Colour,How did the title get it wrong and refer to the company as a brigage when they also refer to it as a company in the title?
World War II in Colour,"The Bastogne episode that focuses on the medic is one of my favorite episodes of TV ever, it’s so well done."
World War II in Colour,"Saying this features Michael Fassbender is like saying it features James McAvoy or Jimmy Fallon...I mean yeah, it does but they're barely in it."
World War II in Colour,"20 years ago, wtf. Man I am getting old."
World War II in Colour,"Best thing on tv then, best thing on tv now."
World War II in Colour,"Watched it at Xmas, usually do sometime every year. Still a fantastic show and a massive achievement in its scale and how good the characters are. Think I might wait a year or two before watching it again though to keep it feeling fresh, The Pacific as well"
World War II in Colour,Lots of great moments to choose from but Lt Speirs running through the Germans in Foy to get a message to another company and then running back will always be my favorite.
World War II in Colour,"Why We Fight remains to be one of the most powerful episodes of TV I’ve ever seen tbh. The show itself is great, they just really made a point with that episode."
World War II in Colour,"I would love for HBO to do at least one more war miniseries. Korea, Vietnam, WWI. I'll take another WWII series, why not?"
World War II in Colour,Where the hell are they now? Livingston really didn’t land anywhere.
World War II in Colour,Rob? Ron?
World War II in Colour,"A young, slim Tom Hardy looting and rooting."
World War II in Colour,My favorite miniseries ever. To me it’s unparalleled
World War II in Colour,Band of brothers is one of the best shows I’ve ever watched. I don’t own a lot of physical copies of movies/shows but band of brothers is one of the few.
World War II in Colour,Between this and generation kill. Some of the best military shows ever produced. Watched band of brothers 3 times still worth a re watch
World War II in Colour,"this is, in my opinion, STILL one of the best series ever made."
World War II in Colour,Masterful show. Still holds up after 20 year. Must watch for all Americans IMO.
World War II in Colour,I read the book last year and it was even better
World War II in Colour,In the top 5 best shows of all time
World War II in Colour,"> For Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, 1998’s Saving Private Ryan marked the beginning of a fruitful collaboration focused on World War II epics. After that film won five Oscars, they teamed up on a wartime drama for the small screen. It would be HBO’s “most expensive miniseries,” with a budget in the realm of $120 million, THR reported.


> Band of Brothers, a 13-hour dramatization of Stephen Ambrose’s best-seller, followed a brigade of World War II soldiers known as “The Easy Company,” a regiment within the Army’s 101st Airborne Division. Each episode opened with audio testimony from a real veteran of the brigade before focusing on a member of the ensemble cast as they prepared for war and entered the field. David Schwimmer, at the height of his Friends fame, was joined by a group of relative newcomers including Damian Lewis in the central role of Lt. Winters, Scott Grimes, Matthew Leitch, Ron Livingston and Michael Fassbender. (Hanks served as executive producer with Spielberg and directed the fifth of the 10 episodes, but did not have a speaking role.)"
World War II in Colour,"Amazing acting, amazing writing, amazing storytelling and pacing. Wonderful music. All around a classic series.

Also a surprisingly scene-stealing turn from David Schwimmer?!"
World War II in Colour,"My buddy is a marine raider, he’s deployed right now. His wife put a bunch of his shit on the curb for people to take. I took it all, band of brothers disk set all his college lacrosse shit, fixie bike etc. he’s gonna be pump when I bring him a 12er and all his shit back he thought was long gone"
World War II in Colour,In the Top 5 greatest TV shows of all time
World War II in Colour,This series is still the greatest thing I’ve ever watched on tv.
World War II in Colour,One of the best series ever produced and that stands the test of time. Each time I watch it is as great as the first.
World War II in Colour,One of my favourite shows ever.
World War II in Colour,"Not ""The Easy Company"" just ""Easy Company"""
World War II in Colour,Fun fact: Michael Fassbender is racing in the 24h of Le Mans right now
World War II in Colour,"I am emotional in a lot of movies, and I have always been sensitive to the horrors of the holocaust. I did not know about episode nine when I started the series, and good lord did it break me. I was quietly crying for about 30 minutes. Incredible show that is more moving (imo) than a lot of other WW2 content."
World War II in Colour,The goat HBO show
World War II in Colour,Oh yeah I like band of brothers too. Like Hansen or the Jonas one.
World War II in Colour,It’s *Ron Livingston. Just feel the proper credit is due. After all he’s the star of Office Space as well another cult classic like the aforementioned series.
World War II in Colour,The Pacific was good as well. Don’t see as much love for that series much
World War II in Colour,One of the best shows of all time
World War II in Colour,"He was an ass, which really tells you how good of an actor he was there"
World War II in Colour,Masters of the Air when????
World War II in Colour,Always gotta get a rewatch in at least once a year!
World War II in Colour,Still upset they never made a northa africa/Italy mini series
World War II in Colour,"If it were locked up in a vault and then released this year, it would still sweep up The Emmys easily this year. The production quality is simply unreal."
World War II in Colour,For whatever reason most WW2 movies tend to do a better job then most modern movies especially the Marvel franchise.
World War II in Colour,Some of the best television to ever air.
World War II in Colour,"A man who was with the 101st gave a talk at the firehouse about ten years ago. He was fantastic. I still remember some of the anecdotes but the most amazing was about Bastogne, being so spent that he and his foxhole companion woke up in the morning next to a huge hole in the ground a few yards away. They had slept right through the hit.

He got a standing ovation from the crowd and there wasn't one dry eye."
World War II in Colour,Based on how much screen time he gets you’d be forgiven if you didn’t remember Fassbender in it
World War II in Colour,"And Michael Fassbender. Lol dude was not a major part at all. Jimmy Fallon was also in BoB. Give more credit to the actors who actually deserve it. And if you need a popular name to push your article then use David Schwimmer, he crushed his role and his character was significant to the story."
World War II in Colour,"Such a good mini series but this article seemed weak. So much more could have been written.

Edit: hbo did a 20th anniversary podcast which was great."
World War II in Colour,It's a masterpiece. If you haven't watched it before. Get it now. And watch it
World War II in Colour,"And tom hardy, and jimmy fallon, and david schwimmer, and simon pegg, and donnie wahlberg"
World War II in Colour,I have the ten DVD box set. Can never bring myself to sell it off. And I don’t own a DVD player.
World War II in Colour,Bacon sandwich
World War II in Colour,ROB lovingstone was amazing in this.
World War II in Colour,"Michael Fassbender was in like 4 scenes and spoke in 2....out of a 10 part mini series. 

Should've name dropped David Schwimmer."
World War II in Colour,Rewatch every year.
World War II in Colour,It’s Ron Livingston not Rob.
World War II in Colour,Thanks for reminding me I need to do my annual watch for 2022
World War II in Colour,"I’m his later years, Sobel ended up shooting himself in a suicide attempt. His attempt failed and he only blinded himself. He later died in a VA nursing home. Alone."
World War II in Colour,"""Easy Company"" was a company sized element, not a brigade. A few companies make up a battalion, a few battalions make up a brigade. Just fyi. And yes I understand the term could have been used as the alternate definition of brigade, but just stating."
World War II in Colour,Episode 9 “Why We Fight” is one of the single greatest pieces of media ever created.
World War II in Colour,"Damian Lewis is such a solid, understated actor. Brilliant as Henry VIII in Wolf Hall. I didn't even recognize him in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"
World War II in Colour,"My dad loved watching this. Now that I’ve gone through the series a couple times, it’s one of my favorites."
Star Trek: The Animated Series,That image has me wondering if this show takes place in Zuck’s metaverse.
Star Trek: The Animated Series,I hope it's inspired by Sealab 2021. First thing that came to mind.
Star Trek: The Animated Series,...By the guy who made the [TNG Season 8 Twitter Account](https://twitter.com/tng_s8?lang=en) 
Star Trek: The Animated Series,">I promise not to add an episode at the very end that reveals the whole thing took place in a training program.

Shots fired"
Star Trek: The Animated Series," ‘I want to do a show about the people who put the yellow cartridge in the food replicator so a banana can come out the other end”

*It’s cold outside, there’s no kind of atmosphere...*"
Star Trek: The Animated Series,The Barclay Chronicles
Star Trek: The Animated Series,Hoping it’s in the same animated style as the og Trek toon.
Star Trek: The Animated Series,Sci-fi and comedy? I’m definitely looking forward to this.
Star Trek: The Animated Series,Is this the third time they revived Futurama?
Star Trek: The Animated Series,"> CBS All Access

pass"
Star Trek: The Animated Series,"> ‘I want to do a show about the people who put the yellow cartridge in the food replicator so a banana can come out the other end,'

This could be really great!"
Star Trek: The Animated Series,Will I need a high IQ to understand this ?
Star Trek: The Animated Series,So basically this will be the Star Trek parody from TMNT (2012)?
Star Trek: The Animated Series,Uhm I expect there will be 4 years between seasons of the two shows 
Star Trek: The Animated Series,"So, those photos are very misleading. There was already an animated series of Star Trek for a little bit, and that's what you're seeing pictures of. They haven't made any episodes or scenes yet for the new one, so I guess they decided to just B-roll some screen captures of the old show from 1973."
Star Trek: The Animated Series,"> I want to do a show about the people who put the yellow cartridge in the food replicator so a banana can come out the other end

So a little like [Red Dwarf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dwarf), but animated and Star Trek?   I'm down."
Star Trek: The Animated Series,[deleted]
Star Trek: The Animated Series,If they wanna do this extra cheap they should Sealab 2021 the original TAS. 
Star Trek: The Animated Series,"This is either going to be biting and brilliant, or a sad attempt to capture the market that *Orville* tapped.   

Given that CBS/Viacom/Paramount have *never* had a coherent plan on how to make use of the *Trek* franchise -- IMO its successes have come in *spite* of the owning corporations -- and that this would be used to help push the CBS streaming service, I'm rather skeptical of its chances.  Not because of any talent hired to work on the project, but rather due to the inevitable corporate meddling."
Star Trek: The Animated Series,Mike McMahan it's a walking star trek encyclopedia.
Star Trek: The Animated Series,"I love animated Star Trek, I hope the comedy is kinda like Harvey birdman attorney at law, but a bit darker."
Star Trek: The Animated Series,wut
Star Trek: The Animated Series,This has sooo much potential. 
Star Trek: The Animated Series,Stop I can only become so erect 
Star Trek: The Animated Series,Soooooo. The Orville then?
Star Trek: The Animated Series,"Not sure if they will be able to top the episode where they meet the devil, Spock casts spells off a pentagram and then humanity gets put on trial in the style of the Salem Witch trials. "
Star Trek: The Animated Series,"Oh yeah, finally the creators of Rick and Morty get to play around with concepts like spaceships, time travel and parallel realities in a humorous fashion. "
Star Trek: The Animated Series,This is not the tone I want with Star Trek. Let's see if the writer can make it not suck. 
Star Trek: The Animated Series,This will fill the void that Star Wars Detours left. 
Star Trek: The Animated Series,Star Trek on the nes was a big enough joke
Star Trek: The Animated Series,Surprised to see such positive comments. Any other franchise (cough Thundercats: Roar cough.) and people would be bitching nonstop.
Star Trek: The Animated Series,"Has anyone seen the original animated series, that shit is pure comedy gold.

spock at one point summons lucifer with the help of a magic circle, that shit is ridiculous."
Star Trek: The Animated Series,Tbh the animated series was some of the best writing that Star Trek ever facilitated
Star Trek: The Animated Series,Oh no
Star Trek: The Animated Series,">Start Trek Animated

Nice!

>Comedy

Er

>From Rick and Morty Writer

Oh."
Star Trek: The Animated Series,I never knew I wanted this so badly until I herd of it.
Star Trek: The Animated Series,what the fuck... i've been waiting for an animated ST series for ages.
Star Trek: The Animated Series,This sounds like it'll be one long SNL sketch.
Star Trek: The Animated Series,Star Trek comedy series? What a great time to be alive. 
Star Trek: The Animated Series,Please please please please cast H. Jon Benjamin! Fuck it. Just make Star Trek: Archer. 
Star Trek: The Animated Series,"Huh, wonder if it will be at all like the [Star Wrecked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAXW4CktofY) parody that's out there."
Star Trek: The Animated Series,I'm watching if Shatner gets royalties.
Star Trek: The Animated Series,Say what?
Star Trek: The Animated Series,Season one will blow your socks off. Season two will do it again. Season three may never ever show up. 
Star Trek: The Animated Series,Hopefully there’s a lot less incoherent yelling. 
Star Trek: The Animated Series,Give it to Adam Reed. He's getting done with Archer soon.
Star Trek: The Animated Series,I love star trek and there has always. Been comedy in it but I don't know if I'd like a full blown comedy trek.
Star Trek: The Animated Series,Finish rick and morty first!!! 70 more god damned episodes
Star Trek: The Animated Series,I wish they'd adapt the rest of Larry Niven's other works to this type of media.
Star Trek: The Animated Series,So basically Star Trek Przerobiony
Star Trek: The Animated Series,Kuuurwa Spock!
Star Trek: The Animated Series,"Oh good another series we can get really into then wait a fucking decade for the next season for no god damn reason 

Im not bitter promise "
Star Trek: The Animated Series,Work hard enough and your fan fiction can become reality!
Star Trek: The Animated Series,[deleted]
Star Trek: The Animated Series,[deleted]
Star Trek: The Animated Series,Thanks!  I hate it. 
Star Trek: The Animated Series,"""I know, let's copy *The Orville*!""  Screwing Star Trek fans since they got the property."
Star Trek: The Animated Series,I hate nearly every word of this sentence
Star Trek: The Animated Series,"No, we need serious Star Trek, not comedy.

Not fantasy comedy, not sci-fi comedy. Can somebody actually do a serious show FFS?
"
Star Trek: The Animated Series,What?
Star Trek: The Animated Series,Gonna be the Next Orville? But using in universe jokes?
Star Trek: The Animated Series,I'm immediately turned off by the idea. I'll give it due diligence but fuck why do they keep having to fuck with my childhood.
Star Trek: The Animated Series,The bastardisation of Trek continues. 
Star Trek: The Animated Series,"Please have some animation company with 'quality' do this. I recall the Animated series was just...well, ... Filmation sucked."
Star Trek: The Animated Series,"I really hope its better than TOS animated series, that was a tough watch."
Star Trek: The Animated Series,Star Trek: Detours?
Star Trek: The Animated Series,If the chap behind SwearTrek is not involved in this it will be a goddamn travesty. 
Star Trek: The Animated Series,"I had no idea I needed this, but now I need it more than anything"
Star Trek: The Animated Series,sounds unnecessary 
Star Trek: The Animated Series,Oh god please no
Star Trek: The Animated Series,Picard double facepalm.
Star Trek: The Animated Series,oh no
Star Trek: The Animated Series,uhg..
Star Trek: The Animated Series,oh boy i cant wait to hear Justin Roiland do the same three voices and stutter and burp through every joke

Star Trek: The Animated Series,How about they finish the next season of R&M I’m dying inside waiting for it!!!
Star Trek: The Animated Series,GOOOOOD NEEEEWS!! now for some Cigarette Juice.  
Star Trek: The Animated Series,No!!! Go focus on Rick and Morty
Star Trek: The Animated Series,I would LOVE to see Jon H Benjamin play the captain of this show

maybe Scotty will [Bring the Powah!](https://archive.org/details/g4tv.com-video12194)"
Star Trek: The Animated Series,"A star trek animation, with Archers comedy would be hilarious."
Star Trek: The Animated Series,I still want a He-Man comedy remake. That Geico commercial was beautiful.

Star Trek: The Animated Series,"If you think this sounds funny, you owe it yourself to try out *Improvised Star Trek* which is equal parts hilarious, stupid, and brilliant."
Star Trek: The Animated Series,“I ORDER you to exist”  - Writer
Star Trek: The Animated Series,Great Season 4 release date....
Star Trek: The Animated Series,"I hope they can manage both shows, don't want Rick and Morty writing get worse"
Star Trek: The Animated Series,Dunno why the picture made me think of Harvey birdman 
Star Trek: The Animated Series,"Somewhere, Seth MacFarlane is kicking himself."
Star Trek: The Animated Series,Yeeessssssssssss!!!!! 🤗
Star Trek: The Animated Series,"yes, please ill take more star trek in any form, 

Star trek + Rick and morty i have a feeling would be similar to Venture bros :)"
Star Trek: The Animated Series,Reminds me of Sealab :)
Star Trek: The Animated Series,What? Haha
Star Trek: The Animated Series,Why dont they just make a Galaxy Quest animated series? 
Star Trek: The Animated Series,"Star Trek comedy series?

“You know the funny thing about tribbles? They were humping everywhere. One tried to mate with Kirk’s toupee.”"
Star Trek: The Animated Series,As long as the Kirk character talks like Shatner it's all good.
The Fierce Wife,"The shows are being taken off HBO Max and moved to a FAST channel that WBD doesn't own.

* Raised By Wolves
* Westworld
* The Nevers
* Head of the Class
* The Time Traveler’s Wife
* FBoy Island
* Legendary
* Finding Magic Mike"
The Fierce Wife,Still bitter about Final Space.
The Fierce Wife,Sad to see the butchering happening right now to one of the greatest TV catalogs. What a shame.
The Fierce Wife,"You guys remember when HBO Max was an amazing streaming service? Remember that?

**It was 2021**. Those golden, halcyon days, faded to an amber beauty in the haze of my mind..."
The Fierce Wife,">“All those write offs… we didn’t take one show off a platform that is going to help us in any way,” he added on a recent earnings call.

Except in, you know, maintaining positive relationships with talent and not alienating fans of these programs."
The Fierce Wife,I’ll miss the intro song in Raised by Wolves but I guess that’s what YouTube is for
The Fierce Wife,"I was going to watch Raised by Wolves, so now I’m going to pirate Raised by Wolves. Thanks Dave, you’re doing a great job."
The Fierce Wife,The fact that this is happening fucking irks me. We cant do anything about it really and thats the frustrating part. Were at the whim of the burnt toast that is David fucking Zaslav.  Raised by Wolves deserves so much better.
The Fierce Wife,"Raised by Wolves was one of my favorite shows, first they cancelled it and now I won't even be able to rewatch the seasons they did make

Probably best not to even watch any new shows on HBO Max because chances are likely it'll be gone soon enough"
The Fierce Wife,[deleted]
The Fierce Wife,"This is the exact reason I still support physical media. Unfortunately, a lot of these shows aren’t available anywhere except streaming, which is an even bigger loss for the audience when they are removed and taken away. The name of the game now is content and cost, quality and artistry are becoming irrelevant."
The Fierce Wife,"RIP The Nevers, I really enjoyed you :("
The Fierce Wife,I’m starting to feel suckered into buying the HBO plan when it was 40% off a few weeks ago.
The Fierce Wife,"A real shame Raised by Wolves didn’t get to finish it’s story. It was weird, but in such a bold and beautiful way. 

Really would have loved to see it through to the end."
The Fierce Wife,The Warner Bros purge continues.
The Fierce Wife,"Okay, realistically, what are the chances Zaslav's fuckery can be undone?

Is there a board of directors somewhere with the power to tell him no? Or better yet, replace him entirely?"
The Fierce Wife,"To forever disappear, except for pirates who will still have access to them."
The Fierce Wife,Doesn't doing all this hurt them in the long run. I'm sure plenty of writers and directors won't work with HBO max now because there's a chance their show will be cancelled and made impossible to watch
The Fierce Wife,It is a real dickhead move to remove these original shows from the service. I didn't really like either show and this still pisses me off.
The Fierce Wife,Last month of HBOMAX for me. I’m out.
The Fierce Wife,I hope Minx finds a home somewhere else too. I really enjoyed the first season.
The Fierce Wife,The Time Travelers Wife only needed one more season to finish.  Me and my partner are really frustrated this one was canned.
The Fierce Wife,"First they cancel it, then remove my favorite show of the last 10 years. RIP Raised By Wolves."
The Fierce Wife,I’m just learning that Raised by Wolves was cancelled. I’m ready to REDACTED to bring it back.
The Fierce Wife,Okay I have been defending HBO until now. What the fuck?
The Fierce Wife,Piracy and data hoarding continue to be superior to feckless and unreliable streaming services.
The Fierce Wife,"I'm done. I canceled my HBO Max subscription, and won't be subscribing again until HBO is owned by someone that isnt a total shithead."
The Fierce Wife,And Hbo max is being removed from my tv.
The Fierce Wife,Raised by Wolves was so good tho they should have given it a better budget for season 2.
The Fierce Wife,"Wait what the fuck, raised by wolves was amazing why are they taking it away?"
The Fierce Wife,Fuck Zaslav for gutting HBO.
The Fierce Wife,"I loved The Time Travelers Wife. Ended up grabbing the book after the season ended, but hated the writing style. Need more seasons. 😭"
The Fierce Wife,Canceling RBW was a terrible move.   I did not get Max for food and castle remodel shows
The Fierce Wife,Looks like piracy is back on the menu.
The Fierce Wife,Raised by wolves season 2 was really noice.  Sucks the cancelled it. I wanted to see what happened with that ancient black droid chick
The Fierce Wife,Fuck HBO for ending raised by wolves. Damn wont see spac3 Ragnar :((
The Fierce Wife,"Yeah, I bought a few shares of WBD because I thought “streaming value is in the back catalog and WB has an extensive one”

Little did I realize this tool bag was just gonna sell it all to the highest bidder and then blow up the company.

A fool and my money, as they say."
The Fierce Wife,"So now people just can’t watch these shows? And the talent can’t make residuals for the work they did?

That’s…dirty."
The Fierce Wife,"... and put on ad-supported streaming channels, which means that I will not ever see them again. I have entered the stage - and age - where I really can't watch programs or movies with commercial interruptions at this point. And I know that means I will pay more and more through the nose to maintain this status quo.

It's like I tasted the forbidden fruit and can't go back. And even if the commercial interruptions are less than traditional TV on a Pluto, say, it's not enough now. Some of these shows are good, and I will have to accept that I am paying a different sort of price by not watching ad-supported versions."
The Fierce Wife,I’m out.  Not interested in FAST.  It’s worth paying a little for premium productions without ads.  It was a good ride HBO but I’m tired of the changes.
The Fierce Wife,"Really hope someone picks up raised by wolves .. or Ridley Scott makes a film to finish the story.

Unfortunately young actors grow up so may be dead or require some recast or reboot. Which sucks because all the actors were amazing"
The Fierce Wife,"Raised by Wolves having its budget cut and then being cancelled

And Westworld being cancelled. 

This fucking sucks man"
The Fierce Wife,"Yeah, piracy shouldn’t be prosecuted if tax dodging corporations pull this shit to avoid paying royalties"
The Fierce Wife,Still bitter about raised by wolves :(
The Fierce Wife,"Cancelled HBO max when raised by wolves was cancelled, such a shame this beautiful and interesting world was smuthered for tax write-off, i hope it will return some day"
The Fierce Wife,Raised by Wolves ... from the highest rated show to this ...
The Fierce Wife,Raised by wolves was incredible.  I’m so upset at the foolishness going on at hbo
The Fierce Wife,I'm going to go ahead and finish Raised By Wolves and cancel my sub. There's zero reason to stay subbed if they aren't going to keep shows. I'll just subscribe vor a month after whatever I want to watch is fully released for now on.
The Fierce Wife,Raised by wolves was rad
The Fierce Wife,Raised by wolves was a great show for sci fi fanc
The Fierce Wife,Piracy is always the solution
The Fierce Wife,"""Welcome to HBO Max! We've got The Wire, and literally just The Wire."""
The Fierce Wife,When HBO Min rebrand coming?
The Fierce Wife,David Zaslav is the biggest piece of shit in the industry.
The Fierce Wife,"This will be the second streaming service I cancel, after Peacock and the Olympics debacle."
The Fierce Wife,"So far it seems like they're picking the less popular shows to dump. Westworld is the exception, but it's not like it was popular enough to get renewed."
The Fierce Wife,can someone eli5 why HBO is removing original programming they made themselves from their platform?
The Fierce Wife,"They found me in the woods cause I was raised by wolves

You wanna mess with me, you are fools

And I'm serious about this craft

You wanna mess with me, you gotta get back"
The Fierce Wife,Why are they taking their own exclusive content off the service? These shows were the selling point for HBOMax and now what? Only White Lotus and when will that get taken off? I haven’t seen the last couple episodes yet ffs
The Fierce Wife,When?  I haven't watched Season 2 yet.
The Fierce Wife,Feel like I wasted so much time on Raised by Wolves. Hope it gets a new home and another season.
The Fierce Wife,"Take drugs and watch Raised by Wolves. Or not. Same thing. 

So mad it got canceled, this was my favorite fever dream show since Lost, and now I'll never know wtf anything meant."
The Fierce Wife,"Man, just thinking about Raised By Wolves depresses me. So much of that shows first season was so innovative and interesting. Loved the style reminded me a lot jodorowsky's dune. Loved the metropolis references. Then...it all went to shit just in time for it to get cancelled. Im so tired of getting suckered into investing time into these mystery box shows."
The Fierce Wife,Time to cancel my subscription
The Fierce Wife,"While we’re at it, can we remove space jam 2? Whoever thought that was a good idea should also be fired…"
The Fierce Wife,"Just ditched HBO Max.  All these steaming services are raising prices while content is thinning out, and ads are coming back. ✌️"
The Fierce Wife,"Making everyone into sailors is how they plan to be profitable? Just ridiculous 

See you on the seas"
The Fierce Wife,Raised by wolves was awesome
The Fierce Wife,"So not only did they cancel raised by wolves, which was a fantastic show left unfinished, but it will also be erased from existence."
The Fierce Wife,And this is why people pirate movies
The Fierce Wife,Can't wait until ten years from now when someone picks up the broken and scattered pieces of the then defunct Max's HBO catalogue  and relaunches it as HBO.
The Fierce Wife,I was thinking of signing up for HBO soon specifically to binge Raised by wolves and west world. 😐
The Fierce Wife,Unless WB's financial situation is critical this is an incredibly bad move. They'll anger the fans even more and people won't trust to pay the sub expecting that HBO original shows will always be available.
The Fierce Wife,Raised by wolves was insane and I loved all of it
The Fierce Wife,"Well, I wanted to finish the show but I guess I can just unsubscribe from hbo and find it on iirc instead. Weird that they don’t want my money."
The Fierce Wife,All of this sure makes me feel stupid for signing up for an HBO Max subscription. HBO's brand and reputation are really taking a hit from all this.
The Fierce Wife,"Will there literally be anything left on HBO Max when they're done with all this? At this point, it feels like nothing's safe. It's going to be hilarious when the original Game of Thrones series gets removed while they're still making House of the Dragon."
The Fierce Wife,This high key trashy as fuck lmao. How the fuck can you not afford to have the shows YOU made in your own service. Wtf
The Fierce Wife,Please don't remove Station Eleven.
The Fierce Wife,I hope whoever cancelled minx chokes on a bag of dicks. Best show since Firefly to be cut short.
The Fierce Wife,Man hbo has really turned into shit
The Fierce Wife,I liked raised by wolves…kind of. Is there any other way to view that show other than on the app?
The Fierce Wife,Can anyone ELI5 why DiscoBros is removing shows and movies from their service?
The Fierce Wife,"This just sucks for everyone involved, including the audience. Fuck these guys."
The Fierce Wife,"Begun, it has, the great consolidation."
The Fierce Wife,This is why the Streaming Future is bleak.
The Fierce Wife,raised by wolves getting cancelled is one of my biggest tv disappointments in years. to me that show is really cool.
The Fierce Wife,wait... what? So where's it going? Nowhere? Why are they removing their original content?
The Fierce Wife,Serves me right for going against principle and forking over a cool hundred+ for an annual sub after being so impressed by Station Eleven. #NeverAgain
The Fierce Wife,"I was just about to get HBO Max and Apple Plus because my family has burned through the Netflix catalogue. 
But now that they're pulling all their shows?

That's gonna be a no from me, dawg."
The Fierce Wife,So I’m genuinely curious if the actors/crew members/ writers had royalties in their contracts hoe this would effect them? Wouldn’t a lot of the deals have to be renegotiated as a lot of these shows are being taken out of mainstream circulation?
The Fierce Wife,"Honestly, thank you for the reminder. I kept forgetting to cancel HBO Max."
The Fierce Wife,"One things for sure, they get rid of Sopranos and we cancel. That much I do know."
The Fierce Wife,"So why should anyone keep HBO Max in 2023? They’re cancelling good content like Westworld, removing a bunch of content that’s been on there for years, and selling the rest"
The Fierce Wife,"Oh, neat, a whole new generation of lost media being created right before our eyes. The 1930s studio execs who melted down many actors' and directors' entire silent-movie oeuvres for the silver content in the film stock would be proud."
The Fierce Wife,I love raised by wolfs and they take it away.. why do I pay for services If they keep canceling the shows I like…
The Fierce Wife,HBO Max will be nothing but reality tv by 2024
The Fierce Wife,🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️
The Fierce Wife,What’s wild is pirate websites keep things up forever while services you pay subscriptions for remove them when they stop turning a profit.  It seems completely counter-intuitive.
The Fierce Wife,If they want people to pay for these services they need to keep all the content available. People don't want to have to buy Blurays on top of paying for streaming.
Digimon Adventure,"Man, when they 4th digivolved, that shit was the illest when I was 10."
Digimon Adventure, I was a huge fan of this show (and the sequel season) as a kid. I liked it so much I begged my mom to buy me [Digimon World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digimon_World) for Playstation. Unfortunately that game was hard as shit for little me. I mean that pretty literally because you had to train your Digimon to get them to digivolve... and if you did a poor job they digivolved into [shit](https://digimon.fandom.com/wiki/Sukamon). I digivolved my Digimon into shit dozens of times before I gave up.
Digimon Adventure,So is this like a full reboot? I’ve watched the first adventure several times but never continued.
Digimon Adventure,"Wow, first Pokemon got that reboot/spinoff with the new films and now digimon is getting a modern makeover, Its like my childhood is getting a second life here. I'm definately willing to give this new digimon series a watch, just not sure if its episodic or an OVA."
Digimon Adventure,"As a fan of the original three series I'm definitely interested. 

But my first impression is that the Digiworld looks more... I guess ""artificial"" is the word? Its all these geometric shapes instead of an island with anachronistic features.

If this is indeed the case not sure how I feel about that. Guess I'll just have to watch the show and see.

Wonder if they'll follow the same plot and eventually get Mamoru Hosoda back to direct THAT ONE episode that looks like a movie again lol."
Digimon Adventure,Better than Pokemon
Digimon Adventure,.........\*jerks off so vigorously you can see the heat signature from space\*!!Fuckyesfuckyes
Digimon Adventure,Oh god I can’t watch Pumpkinmon die all over again
Digimon Adventure,Adventure Tri was enough for me. Shed a few tears in there.
Digimon Adventure,The first four seasons/series were really good. Any series after frontier is just cringy garbage. They changed the tone so much and made it like feel like a Nick Jr show. The characters are very uninteresting along with bad dialogue and synergy.
Digimon Adventure,did anyone watch tri? which continued the story of the original digidestined? Was it any good?
Digimon Adventure,This is exciting. Looks great.
Digimon Adventure,"Last week I got high and put the ps1 game digimon world on my phone, played it all night. It's pretty awesome still. It's like a tamagochi pet that take for walks and fight other pets with. It's pretty hard tho. The version I played as a kid was a pirate copy that had all the cheats enabled. I was too young to figure that out so I thought the game was crazy easy (my digimon started with max stats)"
Digimon Adventure,"Digimon the lesser known brother of Pokemon.

Edit: Really! downvoted for just stating a fact. I never said it was bad hell I watched it for as long as it was televised."
Digimon Adventure,"omg cant they just stop with the reboots , this anime has been rebooted so much that know the shoes are too loose , and its no longer appealing"
Digimon Adventure,***AGUMAN MEGADIGIVOLVE TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO***
Digimon Adventure,"digimon tamers is still my favorite season.

But series 1,2, and 3 were all pretty good.

There was this digimon game online that I would play when I was younger and Seadramon was a boss I could never beat.

I think it was a browser game? but for the life of me I cannot remember what it was called or much about it other than that part I couldn't pass."
Digimon Adventure,"yeah i was a kid and never understood why my digimon always turned into the shitmon

really annoyed me"
Digimon Adventure,"It turned into shit if you let it poop on the floor too often, you had to get to a toilet before that happened. I think the poop digimon ate the poos tho, if I remember right? I had the problem of not realising that when you 'skip' training it actually advances time, but doesn't show any indication of it, so I would see my digimon want a poop and think I still had time to do another training thing. There was a lot of poop on the floor of that gym"
Digimon Adventure,I loved that game as a kid. I still go back and play it every three or four years for the nostalgia.
Digimon Adventure,"i loved all the digimon worlds aa well as Rumble Arena. They were all so drastically different yet felt like such interesting fleshed out worlds.

Although, i never did find out what it was that Leomon was asking for in DW1"
Digimon Adventure,"I'm not 100% sure myself, but going by the description in the video, looks more like a remake set in modern times. We're prob getting the same main characters but different locations and antagonist. What I'm not sure about is if this is an OVA (like digimon tri) or if its an episodic  show."
Digimon Adventure,"Comment is confusing, the current seasons of Pokémon is the same just they're traversing the Globe not the new promoted Region."
Digimon Adventure,It looks like the place where tai and matt fused their digimon in the kids in america movie
Digimon Adventure,What episode you talking about ?
Digimon Adventure,"I always heard good things about Frontier but it was the last one I just couldn't really get into.  I was probably waning as a fan around the time Tamers came out, but there was something about that series that really pulled me back in, in a way Frontier never managed to."
Digimon Adventure,Tri sucked so bad they’re basically making an alternate time line with a Reboot. I think that speaks for itself.
Digimon Adventure,"No, Tri was not good. None of the Digi kids from 01 don't even care when 02 disappear, and one of them turned evil. They don't bother if he/she died. 

The New arcs, so stigma and the new character and Digimon aren't fleshed out. 

They explored the original Digi Destiny kids and Kiri's power, but the execution is terrible. The whole story has to many ideas that can't properly flesh out."
Digimon Adventure,Except it was a much better anime than Pokémon ever was.
Digimon Adventure,I mean people are probably mad because Digimon came out before Pokemon
Digimon Adventure,"I think people are forgetting that Lesson known doesn't mean worse. 

Blitz, do you mean worse or do you just mean not as well known?"
Digimon Adventure,"This is the first time that Digimon ever got a reboot. All of the installments are their own universe and new characters to follow that aren't based on Digimon Adventure. 

Tri doesn't count as a reboot because it is a sequel to both of the adventure series."
Digimon Adventure,*warp digivolve
Digimon Adventure,"Digimon Tamers was damn amazing, the best season. Loved it. Season 1 and 2 were also awesome. My favorite show as a kid. Later seasons (4 and 5) weren't good.

I have particularly vivid memories of the 2nd half of Season 1. The way they weaved multiple storylines, in the search for the 8th digi-destined, Kori. The city was under siege from Myotismon, they had the characters spread across the city and constantly cut to multiple character perspectives to show the intensity of the situation. I think this was so memorable to me because it was the first time I was ever exposed to the level of quality akin to a good live serial drama TV series. And it was intense.

Also, the Digimon series is like a million times better than Pokemon."
Digimon Adventure,Try asking at /r/tipofmytongue/
Digimon Adventure,"I think Tamers was probably the best written, quite dark for a kids show. Adventure is still the most nostalgic for me though."
Digimon Adventure,"Did the game have an overworld you could wander about, with one of the locations being a carnival or Ferris wheel or something?

edit: https://digimon.fandom.com/wiki/Digimon_Adventure_(Flash_game)"
Digimon Adventure,It's a complete remake and a weekly show.
Digimon Adventure,"Talking about the 2 new, with the 3rd coming out soon, movies. The ones that have nothing to do with the anime (but still feature Ash)."
Digimon Adventure,"[https://digimon.fandom.com/wiki/Home\_Away\_From\_Home](https://digimon.fandom.com/wiki/Home_Away_From_Home)

&#x200B;

The one episode in the original series that looks like it was made by a completely different animation studio"
Digimon Adventure,"From what I remember Tamers had a more serious tone and Frontier went back to a more light hearted tone, plus it didn’t have that connection between Tamer and Digimon that the first 3 seasons had"
Digimon Adventure,"damn, then im taking the end of adventure 2 as canon for what happens to the original 7"
Digimon Adventure,"Digimon 1-3 are legitimate shonens(action-adventure aimed to young people), Pokemon was more like Transformers or He-Man, part series part commercial."
Digimon Adventure,Just not as well known.
Digimon Adventure,"Tamers was good because it had the more serious tone than Adventures, but Adventures was awesome as well. Like you said with the search for Kori, and finding out Gatomon was her digimon, the rift between Tai and Matt, the battle with Devimon, and Patamon evolving into Angemon"
Digimon Adventure,The entire Myotismon arc was so good. It's probably the series at its best (aside from parts of Digimon Tamers)
Digimon Adventure,"Yea it had an overworld

Also iirc seadramon was a fight that was blocking a path at the docks, so I think that's the game!"
Digimon Adventure,"I believe that older stuff are fine, just not near the quality what we have now."
Digimon Adventure,The only part of Digimon Tamer's that people aggressively cling to as adult was the Final 15 episodes where Jeri was heavily involved. Digimon Frontier had a better story and more character focus with having it be entirely in the Digital World plus them being the Digimon themselves.
Digimon Adventure,"It is canon and tri takes place before the ending of adventure 2, which makes the tension none existence in the entire film series."
Digimon Adventure,Tri is 2010. That ending was 2028
Digimon Adventure,"Ah dude I'm sorry you had to deal with that. 

What Digimon do you like?"
Digimon Adventure,Gatomon
Digimon Adventure,"Gatomon confused me because it was a champion Mon. 

Mine are seadramon and Kabuterimon cause I liked saying it's name."
Digimon Adventure,.....why is there a picture of Goku in the thumbnail?
Digimon Adventure,"Covid 19, the true enemy of anime"
Digimon Adventure,"Yeah added to this one of the Editors at Shonen jump got it so no one can come to the office. Meaning Manga writers can't get their assistant's help in detailing out/ shading. 

You don't go from [this](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/ohj7GivfxmDJpstnRwO2bGXEIpnzuRU8oG4_7zZJAJonlcakHL8nP_1EgezjdauxbhHjbJkcVZ-AI1EK8uvFxVsg_K8RggL_WVtAYHpA5CglNXgAFAKiml9T) to [this](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-m7wItQ5jXsg/XnSob8e8yaI/AAAAAAAAo2w/StqN9RHcR_IXJpfM_JUoO0M5oa9QuLH6gCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/3.jpg)

without getting a lot of support staff doing the shading/ detail works.  So expect even the manga to have slow release schedules and a likely decline in art style for a while."
Digimon Adventure,It sucks but I'm happy that they finally decided to be safe
Digimon Adventure,Maybe now I can catch up on One Piece.
Digimon Adventure,Because he is here to save us.
Digimon Adventure,Possibly because both One Piece and Digimon are animated by Toei which also does Dragonball
Digimon Adventure,It’s better not to ask
Digimon Adventure,[deleted]
Digimon Adventure,"You should 100% try watching it using one pace.

P.S: one pace basically gets rid of the terrible pacing."
Digimon Adventure,"Read it, don’t watch it. I know that sounds harsh but the Anime has abysmal pacing and drags on for way too long every episode. You can skip the filler but still need to watch some 800 episodes and 40% of each episode turns into run time padding.

Personally, read it for the amazing story/art. And just watch some of the stand out moments you think would be helped a lot through animation. Although, you’ll find a lot of the animation is rushed and poor quality as a result of never taking breaks."
Digimon Adventure,Doesn't his history of heart disease put him at risk?
Digimon Adventure,Yeah I picked a page with no spoilers that just showed the rain and new pirate long jacket Luffy with his giant detailed chest scar in the rain with all the detail on the crew's design. You can't draw 20+ pages of that design in a week. Like I guarantee something like Carrot (Bunny girl jumping in excitement in background) was completely done by some assistant. Hell I'm pretty sure Carrot is completely one assistants creation and Oda just allows her panels to always be drawn by this assistant he likes.
Digimon Adventure,i agree but one pace is missing parts all over the place. some in enies lobby and some arcs have not even started
Digimon Adventure,All those gasping reaction shots take on a new meaning today
Digimon Adventure,"Trunks came from the future with a cure, but only enough for Goku...and it’s grape flavored.... so we are fucked."
Digimon Adventure,Not adults but teenagers in highschool. The next four episodes come out in march I think. You can go to /r/digimon if you want more info its all there.
Digimon Adventure,It's been out for a while now. The next two movies are out this year.
Digimon Adventure,bruh.... thank you
Digimon Adventure,Sure they are older but it doesn't have the same tone which is bad imo.
Digimon Adventure,[deleted]
Digimon Adventure,Couldn't have been on Hulu for very long the movie came out in late December. Anyone know how long after the movie released that the episodes showed up on Hulu?
Digimon Adventure,No problem that's why I had to post it I knew there were other people like me that would want to know! 
Digimon Adventure,"I think the tone rings very true to the OG Digimon, everything down to the animations, the soundtrack, and the evolution sequences bring me straight back to the 90s"
Digimon Adventure,Again all things teenagers do. Plus we all know how they turn out as adults at the end of 02. 
Digimon Adventure,They are 17. Whether they are adults or not you decide.
Digimon Adventure,"http://myanimelist.net/anime/25687/Digimon_Adventure_tri._1:_Saikai

November. I watched it the day it premiered."
Digimon Adventure,The animation just looks like a generic clone of something like the persona 3 movies and there is no adventure in the series. At least the two so far dragon ball movies felt like the old stuff despite me not liking the second as much.
Digimon Adventure,[deleted]
Digimon Adventure,How did you watch it the day it premiered? Did it even have English subtitles? 
Digimon Adventure,The animations are done by the original animators I think that's why it looks like the original animation to me. 
Digimon Adventure,"Speaking on age and not maturity they are teenagers. This is important cause these are the times that show the child to adult transition. Things like sora becoming more girlish instead of a tomboy. Izzy being attracted to mimi instead of a non romantic intellect. Tais reasoning for becoming a diplomat. Not to mention TK and kari moving on from basic childhood into not adulthood but adolescence. 

In psychology the age of adolensence is highly important to the development of a person. I mutured fast for my age and never when I was in my teens did I look at myself while I had a job, paid rent, paid for trips, did my own taxes and go ""I  Am a complete adult now"". But yes they do handle themselves as adults but I know many teens who make many adults look like infants.

My point is that during adolesence important things happen so its important to recognize it as seperate from adulthood. Especially when talking about a show that has a lot of focus on  character development and interaction like digimon. The diffrence is important cause that is the premis of this season. Them in their hischool adolensence not their adulthood."
Digimon Adventure,Crunchyroll simulcast. Yes.
Digimon Adventure,Sure Toei is listed but it's a different team for sure.
Digimon Adventure,How'd you forget static shock? 
Digimon Adventure,"Since the majority of reddit are probably the ages that grew up with these shows (like me) People are going say yes because of nostalgia.

I'm sure when the current kids are grown up, they will be posting reddit posts ""The thundermans and Stuck in the middle"" were the best kids sitcoms.""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;"
Digimon Adventure,"The lack of Superman: TAS, Aaahh!!! Real Monsters, KaBlam!, and The Angry Beavers is very upsetting."
Digimon Adventure,"These are just things we grew up with and enjoyed. There have been plenty of fantastic shows for kids over the last 15 years. There's also been garbage, and there was also plenty of garbage back then. "
Digimon Adventure,Bobby's World? Ran for seven seasons on Fox Kids. 
Digimon Adventure,"As a child of the 80’s I’m biased. Transformers, GI JOE, MASK, Ghostbusters, He-Man, TMNT, Ducktales, Thundercats, Voltron, and a ton of other shows if I did 10 min of research. "
Digimon Adventure,Indeed. Was lucky enough to have access in Australia to some of these shows.
Digimon Adventure,"I might extend it a few years to include Avatar: The Last Air Bender, the original Ben 10, and Naruto. 

Outside of that, kid cartoons haven't been entertaining me or popular for kids. I know I'm not a kid, but I'd want shows that I could sit back and at least be entertained by if I am with some younger cousins that they actually know. "
Digimon Adventure,"Yeah, you guys certainly lucked out. When I was growing up Disney cartoons were basically ""you like ducks? Here's some ducks. Did you like those ducks? Here's some other ducks."" Non-Disney stuff was just long toy commercials or mind-fucks like Heathcliff."
Digimon Adventure,"X-Men, Spider-Man, and Batman TAS, all at the same time?

Kids will never have it that good again. What song today could ever reach the quality of the X-men intro?"
Digimon Adventure,"Yes it was. Well, in actuality the Golden Age is 1991 - 2003.

There are always going to be outliers that make people assume the real dates are some amalgamation of a 20-something year period but I argue those 12 years were the true golden age because it was a constant influx of quality that was bookended by important events. The forming of Cartoon Network to air the cartoons from the original golden age and Nickelodeon airing their first NickToon; all the way until the corporate crash and burn of the early-to-mid 2000s.

---
Nickelodeon under Warner had been an exclusively kids television channel since 1979; [let's just say it hadn't quite figured things out just yet.] (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ee/Nicklogoiozzi79.jpg) They were operating at loss with shows they now pretend don't exist anymore. They hired the guys who made MTV iconic to spruce up the Network, [which they accomplished exceptionally well] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYAIX96v1mI) and in 1986 they were sold to Viacom. Under Viacom, Nickelodeon began their rise, first with the original Kid's Choice Awards and then by airing Nick Jr. during school hours. In 1990 they opened the Nickelodeon Studios where they filmed their early sitcoms and game shows and in 1991 Nicktoons began.

Meanwhile, in 1991, Ted Turner bought Hanna-Barbera and created Cartoon Network. The purpose being to air the tape library he had acquired over the years. Along with Hanna-Barbera, he also owned the MGM cartoon library, the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies shorts, as well as Popeye.

There was now true competition in the world of kids-exclusive television. Money was being pumped into it and most importantly creators were given the freedom to experiment and tell good/great stories and be silly within of course the guidelines of Standards and Practices. John Kricfalusi would discover this the hard way when his popular masterpiece 'Ren and Stimpy' was cancelled for going too far.

Eight years of near perfection. 

Then within a two year period two cataclysmic events happened. Firstly, in 1999 Spongebob Squarepants happened and it was the most popular cartoon ever made and its merchandise alone became omnipresent. Nickelodeon became oddly complacent and out of touch after this. In 2005 Viacom split into two companies marking a definitive end and you can see it in their release line-up.

The second big cataclysmic event was that in 2001, Turner merged with AOL to become AOL TimeWarner which many consider to be the greatest financial blunder in history. Jamie Kellner headed the company and while it seemed reasonable at the time given he was the guy that made Fox a legitimate fourth network and made WB the who's who of cult classic television. However in 2001, Kellner cancelled everything from WCW to Animaniacs to Batman: TAS in favor of shows he wanted to see. Again, this is the guy who is responsible for The Simpsons, Beverly Hills 90210, Married... with Children, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Gilmore Girls, Dawson's Creek, Charmed and the NFL being on Fox, maybe he knew what he was doing.

In 2003, the AOL TimeWarner experiment had officially crashed and burned. TimeWarner dropped AOL from their name and everything was swept under the carpet. They say that without Turner and his stubbornness (and his finance department working the books) many of his crazy, money losing ideas would have been done away with quickly. Once he was out of the company, that ended up being true. WCW was cancelled immediately. CNN was always sensational but with him gone, [well... yeah] (https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/). Cartoon Network meanwhile... it was never the same and eventually even started airing non-cartoons.

---
In June 2018, AT&T bought out TimeWarner. As of ~~three~~ two days ago, Turner doesn't even exist.

> On March 4, 2019, AT&T began restructuring WarnerMedia. HBO, TNT, TBS and TruTV were combined into a new entity, WarnerMedia Entertainment.

> WarnerMedia's Otter Media and Turner's Turner Classic Movies, Adult Swim, Cartoon Network and Boomerang became part of Warner Bros. 

> CNN, HLN, Turner Sports, Bleacher Report and AT&T Regional Sports Networks were consolidated under newly-formed WarnerMedia News & Sports.

There will never be another golden age."
Digimon Adventure,"I dunno. I guess I'm kind of biased being born near the end of that era, but the 2010s had some really good stuff as well, if not, even better. Of course, this is opinion, and you're free to disagree, but we've had:

Adventure Time

Steven Universe

Star Vs the Forces of Evil

Gravity Falls

Over the Garden Wall

Star Wars: The Clone Wars

The Amazing World of Gumball

Not even to mention the adult cartoons Rick and Morty, and Bojack Horseman.

Sure, there is probably less quantity overall, so you could definitely argue against this era, but quite a lot of these shows are just as good, if not even better than a lot of the shows that you listed.

Again, just my opinion."
Youre All Surrounded,"Why? People will just see the clip on Twitter,  they won't be watching the full 3 hour telecast."
Youre All Surrounded,And suddenly Celebrity Deathmatch was rebooted.
Youre All Surrounded,I don't know. Will Smith overshadowing all the award winners is a bit of a slap in the face.
Youre All Surrounded,"Anyone else (who isn’t a Hollywood icon) rushes the stage to assault someone, they would have been escorted out, possibly in handcuffs.

Instead Smith gets hugs, is allowed to stick around to receive the award he was the odds on favorite to win, and then allowed to weakly bloviate excuses for his actions, without ever apologizing to Rock. 

This is the world we live in now"
Youre All Surrounded,"The Academy should be embarrassed!  The Oscars is supposed to be this classy, august event honoring the best in cinema with the best of Hollywood at their most glamorous.  Having a presenter slapped by a nominee should have some serious repercussions. People have been blacklisted for less."
Youre All Surrounded,I think Will Smith stuck a fork in the Oscars.
Youre All Surrounded,"Will Smith won’t be remembered for the Oscar he won, that will be a foot note of the memory of the time he slapped Chris Rock on live TV."
Youre All Surrounded,"I think they learned after the 'announce the wrong winner fiasco,' that these wild controversies don't do much for ratings."
Youre All Surrounded,"Here’s how they should move forward:

Every year from now on they should commit to always having one surprise bitch slap that can happen to anyone on stage at any time during the show. Nobody will ever know when it’s coming but it always does. This is how you get everyone to watch the Academy Awards again."
Youre All Surrounded,"But will the buzz cause people to watch the broadcast a year from now? 

Fuck no, would be my guess."
Youre All Surrounded,"I must admit my first thought after seeing this was this scene from Airplane.  My mind wandered to what the host might face next year.

https://tenor.com/view/hknylcnsy-shake-gif-18076076"
Youre All Surrounded,"You'd think that it flies in the face of what the Academy is supposed to stand for. Instead of celebrating the art of film and the people who dedicate years of their lives to create content, all of the news around this year's Oscar's will be about Will Smith assaulting Chris Rock."
Youre All Surrounded,"It's kind of interesting that the last time Jada was in the same sentence as the Oscars was back in 2016 (I think?) for her whole 'Oscar's so white' movement and Chris Rock clowned her then too!  
  
I think his joke was like, 'Jada boycotting the Oscars is like me boycotting Rihanna's panties.  It's not like I was invited anyway.'  
  
Kind of funny how we've come full circle to Jada being in an Oscar controversy and Rock clowning on her during the show."
Youre All Surrounded,They need Jerry Springer to host
Youre All Surrounded,"That doesn't really help ratings.

Unless people thought Smith would go back for round two later on."
Youre All Surrounded,Probably a good thing Sean Penn didn’t get his way and somehow have Zelensky on.
Youre All Surrounded,"Sure, just like the envelope mixup in... *checks notes* 2017. 

This won't matter in the long run of this event."
Youre All Surrounded,How was Chris Rock after the slap? I've heard nothing of his POV since
Youre All Surrounded,"I have no idea who won what and I don't really care, but that slap was a meme being born *live*"
Youre All Surrounded,This idiocy turns me off even further to the Oscars. They've gone down the toilet for the last 10 years or so.
Youre All Surrounded,"They want people to watch and engage with the show.

This was mostly a social media thing. Doubt it impacted the ratings and it definitely won’t impact them going forward."
Youre All Surrounded,"Will Smith got up and slapped away whatever dignity The Oscars had left. Before this it was ""oh my, they announced the wrong winner, things like this don't happen at *The Oscars*!"" Now fucking anything goes."
Youre All Surrounded,I’m sure Ricky Gervais is wondering what he did right.
Youre All Surrounded,I think people thought it was staged for this purpose until he started yelling.
Youre All Surrounded,"It probably will get them some more eyeballs. But it sure does cheapen the prestige of the Academy Awards.

I keep thinking about Will Smith, and how for anyone with any self-awareness, this would be a kind of ""went to school with no clothes on"" nightmare experience.

Here Smith is, on the verge of receiving his professions highest recognition. This is supposed to be a moment of personal and profession triumph for everyone to see. And then, in the final stretch, he makes an absolute ass of himself. Just loses his temper, inflicts ugly and inexcusable violence, and acts like a child while the whole world witnesses it, which overshadows the big win, and disgraces the whole event.

Hollywood bigshot or not, I wouldn't want to trade places with him in these coming days."
Youre All Surrounded,Yeah this is why I'm figuring it was staged
Youre All Surrounded,Regina Hall is thankful that she's not getting as much negative attention for sexually assaulting the male actors.
Youre All Surrounded,"Meh. People never stopped *talking* about the Oscars, they just stopped watching them"
Youre All Surrounded,"This has only taught me what I already knew, you can see all the most exciting stuff at the Oscar’s by just checking the news and twitter the next day."
Youre All Surrounded,They should have Chris Rock host next year. Have Jason Momoa or The Rock follow him around all night long as a body guard.
Youre All Surrounded,A 53-year-old man slapping a 57-year-old man will definitely get the young people watching The Oscars.
Youre All Surrounded,"My favorite thing is, most people wouldn't of even known the Oscars happened if it wasn't for the slap. That is how many people don't care."
Youre All Surrounded,Who’s the witty genius that said obviously Mike Tyson will be hosting next year.
Youre All Surrounded,"""oh boy I better turn in the next dozen years to see if someone punches someone out........oh time wasted"""
Youre All Surrounded,Actuallly it’s a massive turn off. It’s guaranteed I will NOT watch because of it.
Youre All Surrounded,"Aside from The Slap, it was a very entertaining Oscars. My highlights were

- The hosts
- Beyonce
- We don't talk about Bruno
- how bored everyone looked after Billie Eilish
- Kevin Costner talking slowly for like 10 minutes, then Jane Campion saying ""that was very dramatic"" had me laughing for like 5 minutes
- Gaga and Minnelli
- Troy Kotsur's speech
- Simu Liu's suit"
Youre All Surrounded,"Hell, I assumed it was staged just for the attention. Who the FUCK cares about celebrity awards other than them?"
Youre All Surrounded,It won't do them any good.  I'm not going to watch next year just because Will Smith slapped Chris Rock this year.  It is a random event that people will talk about for awhile and meme for years.  Oscars are still boring bullshit.
Youre All Surrounded,Only way I would watch the oscars next year is if they get Ricky to host
Youre All Surrounded,where is the petition to have his Oscar rescinded?
Youre All Surrounded,"I think it was staged.

Look at all the headlines of the Oscars last few weeks/months?

""Should Oscars be cancelled"" ""Oscars doesn't have appeal like used to do"" ""The golden era of the Oscars is dead"" ""Should we even have the Oscars anymore?"" etc...

What are the headlines today? What is on every newsbyte? 

Certainly NO talk of cancelling the Oscars anymore and certainly no talk of low ratings anymore.

Chris and Will are both *actors.* 

I believe this was all staged to bring back excitement to Oscars night."
Youre All Surrounded,"This is why part of me wonders if it wasn't staged.

We already complain about Ryan Reynolds and The Rock not even acting, just playing themselves in movies. 

They play those characters in the films. They play them on the press tour.

Where is the line between in character and out of character, between fictional and not and where else might this line be blurred"
Youre All Surrounded,Makes you think it could’ve been staged 🤯
Youre All Surrounded,"It sure ups interest in the show and trending hashtags or whatever metric they want to use but for all the wrong reasons. Do I really want to watch a show where someone can commit assault, not be escorted out of the building for it, then moments later win one of their most prestigious awards to a standing ovation?  I think for many, especially those who were still watching the Oscars for the prestige of it, that will be the final straw."
Youre All Surrounded,Liam Neeson starts warming up for next year.
Youre All Surrounded,"I would be willing to bet anything that next years show opens with a “big moment” of Rock/Smith coming out on stage together, embracing, burying  the hatchet in front of the world to see and possibly crack a few jokes about it, then have it get serious and be a big serious speech about love not hate moment. 

It would be a huge into ratings wise which the Academy would then hopefully be able to retain a large number after the bit is over."
Youre All Surrounded,I doubt it.    It made a mockery of what’s left of the Oscar’s.  It’s a bunch of millionaires that a rent subject to the same laws as we are all patting each other on the back for a rigged competition.  It’s tacky.  It’s irrelevant.  And it’s a disgusting display of wealth in a time of massive poverty.    It’s your financial betters laughing at you and charging hiii for the privilege of doing it
Youre All Surrounded,All this time Will Smith acts like he is hard and he just slaps someone. LOL He is using too much Testosterones cream.
Youre All Surrounded,"I’m assuming that’s why they staged it. That did not look like a real slap, they stage some super dramatic thing almost every year because otherwise no one would give a shit. The only reason I know the oscars even happened is because Reddit is talking about it today."
Youre All Surrounded,"It’s not really surprised that this was coordinated, imo. They’re actors acting for the sake of making Hollywood money. Who ever said they were off the clock at the awards?"
Youre All Surrounded,Was 100% fake. Dude did an overly exaggerated theatrical slap.
Youre All Surrounded,Hmmm maybe it was orchestrated. Chris Rock took it too well lmao
Youre All Surrounded,"A brief tour around the Internet today tells me that a lotta MFers complaining about how ""y'all too sensitive these days and ""blah blah cancel culture"" and ""comedians should be able to say whatever jokes without people getting upset"" sure seem pretty OK with Chris Rock's face getting cancelled by Will Smith over a bad joke. Which one is it? Can't be both."
Youre All Surrounded,[removed]
Youre All Surrounded,"There why it’s a publicity stunt. When was the last time anyone talked about Chris rock? The academy? Even will smith? The only thing anyone is talking about is the slap. Hollywood is dead and gone, we’re just the dopes holding on to it"
Youre All Surrounded,It’s almost like it was planned that way.
Youre All Surrounded,"Yes, there's nothing else going on in the world right now.😒"
Youre All Surrounded,"it was the best Oscar show in recent memory.

 Regina Hall sexually harassed and groped 4 men on stage, Will Smith slapped Chris Rock like an 8 year old girl having a tantrum, Venus Williams nipple was hanging out on live TV, and Liza Minelli was partially there too.  

It was the best worst Oscar show I've ever sen."
Youre All Surrounded,I want to see Tom Hanks knee Ricky Gervais in the groin next year.
Youre All Surrounded,Staged
Youre All Surrounded,"The Academy is a fascist joke. They relegated ""less important"" awards to the pre-show and they staged this stupid publicity stunt. Even the Real Housewives are in shock."
Youre All Surrounded,fake and lame
Youre All Surrounded,/r/movies
Youre All Surrounded,"The beginning of the next gladiator culture.

Also the beginning of the end of our culture."
Youre All Surrounded,Hello? It was staged for this very reason! C’mon wake up
Youre All Surrounded,"Ya it was staged. Chris is bracing himself for that slap and will pulled the slap too. It was perfectly timed and really dumb. No one gives a crap about the Oscar’s so they needed something to get people talking and it worked. 

To be clear he does make contact but that doesn’t mean it wasn’t rehearsed or staged. Andy Kauffman did this with Jerry lawler on lettermen back in the day. It al a publicity stunt."
Youre All Surrounded,I skipped it this year lol. Probably not watching it next year
Youre All Surrounded,*Let's do it again next year.*
Youre All Surrounded,I have seen the news about it. Might watch a YouTube blog about but probably not. Not terribly interested in it. Doesn’t make me want to watch a show where rich people hand each other golden statues.
Youre All Surrounded,I still didn't watch it. And I still won't watch it next year. But I get to enjoy the memes.
Youre All Surrounded,I still don’t give a fuck. Think I’ll take a couple days off from the internet.
Youre All Surrounded,"In 20 years, the Academy Awards will just be all the nominees in a celebrity death match."
Youre All Surrounded,"I don't think so -- it was a really boring show outside of that assault, and none of the movies being awarded were heavily watched. 

And it was just really tense and sterile after the assault. 

 You know there's going to be changes for next year so something like this will never happen again."
Youre All Surrounded,All it took was killing one man's career while they were finally giving it their highest honor.
Youre All Surrounded,They should program atleast 1 fistfight every awards show.
Youre All Surrounded,What does Chris Rock say about all of this?
Youre All Surrounded,I watched it.
Youre All Surrounded,"Traditional tv ratings have declined across the board. There are more entertainment options than ever. Disney might have a few million less people watching ABC, but they had tens of millions watching Disney+ last night."
Youre All Surrounded,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/tqd9vp/tv\_ratings\_oscars\_rebound\_from\_historic\_lows\_1373/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3
Youre All Surrounded,Will Smith thinks he can Single Handedly change things
Youre All Surrounded,Bruh is there a chance that Will Smith going to be blacklisted?
Youre All Surrounded,I itial ratings up 56% over last year.... Still second worst ratings ever.
Youre All Surrounded,The Oscar for best sound should have gone to The Oscar's themselves this year
Youre All Surrounded,Just trash TV now. But they'll take those ratings
Youre All Surrounded,"Youtube will be happy about this, but I don't think it will impact the academy."
Youre All Surrounded,Man I had my money on Russell Crowe being the first guy to assault someone at the oscars..
Youre All Surrounded,"Lol, people and their conspiracy theories. We're just getting over the main ill of Covid conspiracies, we don't need it from all of you. Reddit people should have some brain cells."
Youre All Surrounded,"Seriously. People aren’t talking about the Oscars. They’re talking about Will Smith slapping Chris Rock, which happened to take place at the Oscars."
Youre All Surrounded,"This is like OP saying, ""The NBA must have loved the ratings they got immediately after The Malace in the Palace."""
Youre All Surrounded,Not unless they decide to add a celebrity fight each year that happens at a random moment during the show.
Youre All Surrounded,"Maybe more people will watch next year, though"
Youre All Surrounded,Who has the patience to watch that? I would rather spend the three hours on Reddit.
Youre All Surrounded,Right. People are watching 15 second clips after the whole thing was already over.
Youre All Surrounded,I watched them…hope it doesn’t make me a bad person.
Youre All Surrounded,"""*I can't wait until the Oscars next year to watch the follow up to this""*"
Youre All Surrounded,Indeed. I for one will not be watching this dumb award show any further. I’m not into award shows where the nominee is allowed to assault the presenter with zero repercussions.
Youre All Surrounded,This. Kanye and Pete. Lots of material.
Youre All Surrounded,If only
Youre All Surrounded,Vin Diesel Vs The Rock
Youre All Surrounded,He even overshadowed his own win on best actor
Wentworth,"Didn't the Prison break character have some weird neurological issue that wasn't called Autism? Something like he couldn't see the Forest for the Trees, so when he looked at the prison he didn't see a prison but a bunch of pipes and concrete? 

I could swear that was an episode explaining why he was so atypical analytical."
Wentworth,Didn't watch Prison Break but he was good at hamming it up on Flash And Legends.
Wentworth,He lived near me and came to a local grocery store that I worked at pretty regularly - he’s a really great guy and loves his soup lol
Wentworth,"He always seemed like an intense, introverted kind of guy. Makes sense. Good for him."
Wentworth,Live action Chris Redfeild as well
Wentworth,"His captain cold is one of my favorite superhero related performances.  You can really see how much fun he has with the role.

The fact that he can speak out this way not only about this but his previous battles.with depression is wonderful.

As someone on the spectrum myself (although high functioning) its heartening to see things like this."
Wentworth,"I hope this shows people that not everyone with autism is someone who basically can't take care of themself. We always see the extreme cases in the media, like a guy who seems to have no social filter and just blurts out everything he thinks, or has other ""weird"" behaviour... but sometimes people have it and you can't even tell."
Wentworth,"This article about him has had a surprising amount of real estate in my head since it came out: 

[Wentworth Miller opens up about depression, suicidal thoughts while addressing fat-shaming meme](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-wentworth-miller-depression-fat-shaming-meme-htmlstory.html)

I was worried about him. Robin Williams hit me hard. Seems like he's doing better, loved his character on Flash and Legends."
Wentworth,Michael Scofield and Captain Cold are such different characters. Yet both roles seemed to have been made for him. Great actor.
Wentworth,"We knew this, only an autistic person could had planned the perfect prison break."
Wentworth,We’ve come a long way in understanding autism since Rain Man
Wentworth,A LILA...Late In Life Autistic
Wentworth,49 years old wow
Wentworth,Woop captain cold. Love this guy :0
Wentworth,"Gay, biracial and on the spectrum-- he's got a nerd bingo! Bring him back to Legends."
Wentworth,How is it diagnosed? Especially when in adulthood? Like what sort of tests are done.
Wentworth,Where are my Dinotopia fans at tho
Wentworth,"He's one of, if not my favorite character from Flash. Great in legends of tomorrow too."
Wentworth,Love him. I saw him at a hotel once and it made my year.
Wentworth,"As someone who's almost 30 and known most of his life he was Autistic but told almost no one for fear of being seen as an ""other"", (and only two good friends and one ex within the past year) this makes me really happy"
Wentworth,I think high functioning autism goes undiagnosed a lot more often than people realize.
Wentworth,"I got diagnosed this year at 42 and in retrospect it all makes sense. It’s a spectrum, after all, and not everyone is going to be between Rainman or Sheldon from Big Bang Theory. Most people consider me normal, just “quiet and intense” or “has a resting bitch face but very smart!” But after a while I was driving my wife crazy with my routines  and restrictions in communication.

I’ve masked many of my symptoms that were more prevalent when I was a child and now am learning what they are and how I can adjust my life and my way of thinking to make things easier. That diagnosis gave me the foundation to seek the right type of therapy and it’s doing wonders for me. 

ASD is not a disease, it just a different way if looking at the world and I need to learn how to let it look back at me so we understand each other!"
Wentworth,Wasnt Michael Schofield revealed to be autistic aswell? Casting director deserves a medal
Wentworth,I remember a lot of rags proclaiming him to be the next big thing when Prison Break was hot.  I don't think I've seen or heard of him in anything since.
Wentworth,[deleted]
Wentworth,"What I would’ve given to have someone like him in the public eye ten years ago. I’m gay, struggling with depression since I was a child and was diagnosed with autism around the time he came out. 
Some days it‘s crushing to feel like your whole being was twisted some and then some more and then some and there‘s no way you can ever fully function as one of those beings called humans you‘re surrounded by and supposed to be like. Most of the time I feel like I can‘t even pass as one of the same species. I have always had trouble making friends because nobody can relate to my level of otherness and it‘s so exhausting having conversations in what feels like a language I don‘t speak very well.  
Him sharing his diagnosis proves to me that I don‘t have to accept this feeling of being so screwed and twisted that I cannot ever be whole or do something with my life. He‘s a successful actor and screenwriter (it’s funny, now I know why „Stoker“ felt weirdly relatable in it‘s strangeness), he‘s working on himself and he‘s out there proving to people like me that it can be done. That even someone like… us… can aspire to be more than shards and cracks. 
To me this is big news. It feels like something that‘ll get me through more than one rough day. And yeah, I guess this is why representation matters so much. 
Such a cool guy!"
Wentworth,Finally seeing the underground autism population coming out. Such a mind fuck living in a society that hates neurodivergents.
Wentworth,Kudos for him to open up about that. Must be really hard to tell the whole world about your most inner issue.
Wentworth,You mean Captian Cold?
Wentworth,Loved this guy every place his been. His Captain Cold was amazing.
Wentworth,"I love this guy and it's great that people are not negative when he reveals something so personal about himself.   

I remember how he looked so relieved when he announced he was gay."
Wentworth,Huh captain cold is that you
Wentworth,LEONARD SNART best character in The Flash
Wentworth,"That’s pretty incredible, Miller is a great actor and extremely fun in roles like Captain Cold from the CW DC shows. Hopefully this inspires many others to not hold back from their dreams."
Wentworth,I’ll always see him as Michael Scofield
Wentworth,He was really good in Madam Secretary as the bad guy.
Wentworth,Leonard Snart aka Captain Cold… 🥶
Wentworth,I thought he shared this in the early 2010s already?
Wentworth,"Somewhat unsurprising given how accurately and tastefully he portrayed Michael in Prison Break, who was either autistic or had ""this thing that we won't call autism but has all the same symptoms"". Also glad that he hasn't been pigeonholed into roles like that, dude has had a diverse career and always kills it."
Wentworth,"This is awesome, the more we have good actors revealing that they have autism, the more shit Sia can eat for saying an autistic actor wouldn’t have worked in her movie."
Wentworth,"My parents have worked in the neurodivergent community for decades now. I’ve grown up along side some of the kids my parents worked with. I’m so emotional reading his post because I know that so many of these kids feel so alone. I’m so happy that Wentworth Miller felt comfortable sharing this, I imagine that it matters to a lot of people on a very personal level."
Wentworth,That’s Cold
Wentworth,Oh it all makes sense now.
Wentworth,I didn’t watch this show but he is a very very attractive man
Wentworth,"Everyone that saw Prison Break

""we know"""
Wentworth,AutDHD pride baby! ♡♡♡♡♡♡ this makes me so happy to see. Low needs high needs and everyone in-between we are all autistic and deserve accomodation. ♡♡♡♡
Wentworth,"Last comment tracks. I have autism as well, but diagnosed late. I've struggled with depression a fair bit. Depression feels like an illness of the mind, something that is harming you from a somewhat ""external"" place... like you HAVE depression, rather than you ARE someone depressed.

Autism, meanwhile... is who I am. If I had a choice to ""cure"" it, I wouldn't, as doing so feels to me an awful lot like dying. I know the parts of me that are autistic and they are ME. I'd be someone else without them."
Wentworth,Same thing happened to my buddy chad
Wentworth,I thought it was self-diagnosed? Like he read a bunch of symptoms during quarantine and suddenly realized “that’s me” or something
Wentworth,I am very confused as to how someone can both be autistic and also have the ability to be an actor.
Wentworth,"They quote him using identity-first language (""being autistic"") but then put the annoyingly negative ""has autism"" in the title. /s"
Wentworth,I mean... can't say I'm surprised. He hid it well but I feel like that just became his character's thing. Every character he played it was always interesting how detached he seemed.
Wentworth,I could tell by his acting
Wentworth,He was great in the Flash
Wentworth,It's something I'd change and wouldn't wish on anyone.
Wentworth,"Is coming out Autistic the new, “coming out gay” in the 90’s?"
Wentworth,Another fine addition to our collection
Wentworth,Everyone has autism at this point
Wentworth,gay and autistic?
Wentworth,Well you can’t.
Wentworth,How do you get diagnosed with autism
Wentworth,I’ll always remember him as one of the brothers in Dinotopia. And the other one was Smallville. This news doesn’t surprise me. He’s always had strange reactions to things in the shows he’s done that were very uniquely his. I always thought he’d make a good android character.
Wentworth,So he really did map that prison from memory!
Wentworth,"i dont blame him, i wouldnt change mine either, the positive aspects far outweigh the negatives, i cant even imagine how id get by without some of my traits, probably the biggest being photographic memory (well more video albeit sometimes with busted colours) i dont even know how id approach learning something or even finding something i own without it"
Wentworth,Prison break is underrated
Wentworth,Just the right amount of autism
Wentworth,[deleted]
Wentworth,"I'm currently in the process of being diagnosed with this. My sister is a nurse who works with people with autism, and always suspected. After a life crisis, I thought I might have psychopathy or socipathy. Because I'm cold emotionally and only interact with the world through calculated logic. As well as extremely repetative and few interests, repetition of sentiments, communication errors because I can't understand why someone can misinterpret what I say.   
  
I took a test now. 65 points or more is required for a diagnosis. I scored 130. Still in the process. All of my life and life decisions made sense when my psychiatrist told me after a time - that this is most probably what I have. Undiagnosed high functioning autism or aspergers. (not sure about the main difference between the two)."
Wentworth,"Not all people are this high on the spectrum.  Many are unable to speak, communicate, ever books a job, function without a caregiver.  He is not the face of Autism.  If he was diagnosed with Autism then he's lucky that he's on the  high end of it.  To say he wouldn't change a thing is idiotic as I'm sure everybody on the lower end would change everything."
Wentworth,So awesome to see him finally excepting himself after having such a hard time a few years back.
Wentworth,Because that’s something you could change anyway??
Wentworth,How much GameStop and Doge coin does he have?
Wentworth,"I have never heard it phrased this way before, that somebody “has autism”. You would normally say “is autistic”. Autism isn’t some disease that you “have”. It’s like saying “he has blindness” rather than “he is blind”."
Wentworth,"First off it’s possessive first, so Wentworth Miller  IS autistic. Second off, you can’t “change” autism. It’s not something you can be “cured” of. It’s just how your brain is wired."
Wentworth,"Oh, no, he got vaccinated as a child! What a horrible life he has led since!! **/s**"
Wentworth,"Come on, seriously. Who cares?"
Wentworth,"How unusual!  An actor who’s career is over announces a diagnosis to drum up attention for himself and, let me guess, “raise awareness”…

YAWN."
Wentworth,Toooootally adds up.
Wentworth,I fucking called this to my boys fucking ages ago
Wentworth,"Well , what explains why he is gay"
Wentworth,He owns AMC and GME stock.
Wentworth,He’s gay and has autism? Oh man that’s a double whammy
Wentworth,Autism really isn’t a big deal for many people
Wentworth,"I mean, isn’t this one obvious? Autistic savant, broke his brother out of prison, into prison, out of prison again etc…"
Wentworth,I realize it’s a “spectrum”… but this guy being diagnosed with the same disorder as the boy I grew up next too that was less sociable than my dog is insane to me.
Wentworth,I feel like this guy only ever shows up to say he was bullied or that he's gay or that he's autistic before dissapearing for another couple years.
Wentworth,I used to love the show and Miller and I still do like Miller even though I don’t follow him much but the show and almost all about it was tainted for me in my mind after the day Robert Knepper (T-Bag) approached me at an airport and everything turn into a  metoo moment in a matter of minutes. I feel sorry for the entire cast thinking they have to deal with this character.
Wentworth,Luckily his parents weren’t anti vax. They would rather a dead child than a successful actor with autism
Wentworth,Who cares
Wentworth,"He’s like to get attention every couple years, first depression, than gay and now Autism.. what’s next?"
Wentworth,Who gives a shit.
Wentworth,25% of all children born today are on the spectrum. That's what my husband who works in the industry told me.
Wentworth,Everyone is getting vaccinated these days!
Wentworth,This guy is a real attention whore lately.
Wentworth,[deleted]
Wentworth,"Can we stop using ""autism"" as a diagnosis? It's too broad to be used as such. To the point that it's irrelevant. It's like describing yourself as ""paralyzed"" when you only have drop foot syndrome.

My hairline is receding; I'm not bald. Likewise, I have Aspbergers, not ""autism."""
Wentworth,That sounds like bullshit who the fuck wants autism? Why would you not want to get rid of your autism if you had the choice
Wentworth,Who? What show? And who cares?
Wentworth,So what? Its not that rare tbh
Wentworth,A celebrity paraded because they can be deemed even further not normal here we go again
The Vicar of Dibley,Best British comedy ever made. Did you watch Blackadders Christmas Carol as well? People often miss that one.
The Vicar of Dibley,"Blackadder, red dwarf and mighty boosh. Top 3 for me."
The Vicar of Dibley,"You all remember the final scene. Brings tears to my eyes every time. 

A lot of aristocratic officers made the working class soldiers do stupid stuff that got them killed."
The Vicar of Dibley,"I always assume this isn’t going to catch on cos you’ll start the first season and nope the fuck out cos it’s utter shite. 

S2-4 are arguably the best British sitcom ever. The tweaks to the Blackadder and Baldrick characters are perfect. Elton and Curtis complimented each other perfectly in the writers room. And, no offence to Tim Mcinnerny, but Hugh Laurie was the better pompous fool, and Darling is a much better fit. 

Also: Miranda Richardson is one of the finest actors England has produced. She can do it all."
The Vicar of Dibley,I was watching Blackadder before I could talk; it really developed my sense for cunning schemes.
The Vicar of Dibley,.... Wibble
The Vicar of Dibley,"Yes, Minister!, The Young Ones, The Thick of It and Only Fools and Horses."
The Vicar of Dibley,"the episode with William Pitt, the Younger and the Even Younger had me laughing the most out of anything I've ever seen besides The Office OG and Monty Python's ANFSCD  

""Mr. Speaker, Members of the House, I shall be brief, as I have rather unfortunately become Prime Minister right in the middle of my exams"""
The Vicar of Dibley,"Love the show.  

Our history teacher used to put on a episode of Blackadder whenever it was vaguely relevant.

Studying the history of medicine?  Throw on the episode that mentions leeches!

Studying world war 1?  Time for the saga of speckled Jim!"
The Vicar of Dibley,"I am a busy man and I can't be bothered to punch you at the moment: here is my fist, kindly run towards it as fast as you can."
The Vicar of Dibley,"From s2 forward, one of the best comedies I've watched. And the writing was so so good. Never mind that knowing Atkinson only from Bean, this was... so refreshing."
The Vicar of Dibley,"Baldrick : But, my Lord, I've been in your family since 1532. 

Blackadder : So has syphilis. Now get out."
The Vicar of Dibley,"I still say ""I have a cunning plan"" almost daily. 

Brilliant series, a textbook example of shorter seasons being of higher quality thing."
The Vicar of Dibley,"top 3 all time, sublime

nothing in the world makes me laugh more than Darling's ""there's nothing cushy about life in the Women's Auxiliary Balloon Corps!"""
The Vicar of Dibley,"YOU MEAN COMEDY OF THE GODS??

blackadder 2 is sheer genius."
The Vicar of Dibley,"My hot take:  Season 1 is the worst season of the show, but still really funny and worth watching.  The King character is hilarious."
The Vicar of Dibley,"I Also Watched it all last month for the first time & regretted not watching it earlier! Another one was The New Statesman, that is good too."
The Vicar of Dibley,"I know I'm late to the party here but I grew up with British television and blackadder was probably my favorite one, along with red dwarf. Some people just dont get it but I think that style of comedy tv is some of the greatest humor in media. Happy to hear about your discovery! And if you haven't seen red dwarf, give it a shot. The first few seasons are goldmines of comedy but also pretty awesome scifi."
The Vicar of Dibley,What starts with ‘come here’ and ends with ‘ow’?
The Vicar of Dibley,"When a man soils a Wellington, he puts his foot in it!"
The Vicar of Dibley,One of the greats. Think s3 has to be my favourite. I used to have the cassette tapes and listen to them when I was a teenager. Showing my age there
The Vicar of Dibley,"Love?  Oh, you mean rumpy-pumpy?

So much love for the show., I'm psyched that you enjoyed it.  It's a great show for when you're feeling depressed or down, I can't count the number of times I've seen it."
The Vicar of Dibley,I haven't seen this in years and yet we started watching it last night.
The Vicar of Dibley,"Here are my genitals, please kick them."
The Vicar of Dibley,"Blackadder, Monty Python, Fawlty Towers, and Are You Being Served all contributed to my obsession with British TV as a kid."
The Vicar of Dibley,I have a cunning plan.
The Vicar of Dibley,"I grew up on British Comedy. Blackadder, Waiting for God, Fawlty Towers, Yes Minister, Keeping up Appearances, Are You Being Served, Allo Allo… just iconic shows."
The Vicar of Dibley,The Vicar of Dibley should be on your list as well.
The Vicar of Dibley,I’m eagerly waiting for my kids to be old enough to watch it. Any time someone brings up Mr. Bean I always try to redirect to Blackadder.
The Vicar of Dibley,"I will try it again then.

""Yes minister"" and ""in the thick of it""are both  peak British comedy for me.."
The Vicar of Dibley,black adder is the best British comedy i have ever seen. it is just so ridiculous good. just as you stated. it is timeless.
The Vicar of Dibley,"Melchett: (back to Baldrick) Now then, soldier, do you love your country?

Baldrick: Certainly do, sir.

Melchett: And do you love your king?

Baldrick: Certainly don’t, sir.

Melchett: And why not?

Baldrick: My mother told me never to trust men with beards, sir."
The Vicar of Dibley,A bit of Fry and Laurie is almost on the same level
The Vicar of Dibley,"""Yes, Minister"" will always be my favourite but Blackadder season 4 is a close second. 

In fact, that prompted me to watch ""A Bit Fry & Laurie"" as well."
The Vicar of Dibley,"It was a really brave decision to reinvent the show after the first series but one which has turned it into an all time classic. I think the 'silly' style of comedy presented the first series has aged fairly poorly and it's probably the reason why it isn't shown on TV anywhere near as frequently as the others. The other three series with the focus on the witty Blackadder are an absolute blast where joke after joke lands successfully. After the Inbetweeners, it's my favourite sitcom."
The Vicar of Dibley,"You might want to watch Upstart Crow. Comedy about Shakespeare that briefly, in one episode, reprises a character from Blackadder. I won't spoil it, thought it was super clever. Then go lookup more stuff from David Mitchell and his buddy Mark Webber."
The Vicar of Dibley,Always and cromulently.
The Vicar of Dibley,Father ted also recc
The Vicar of Dibley,"A timeless classic.
Hoarded, to ensure that it never disappears, as the humour, like Fawlty towers is allegedly offensive to snowflakes.

One of the best shows ever created."
The Vicar of Dibley,Ohyes! To be honest I'm not a fan of the last series but just LOVE the rest!
The Vicar of Dibley,Fuck yes you legend
The Vicar of Dibley,"To me it’s a bit samey the whole way through.

“Baldrick, It’s about as funny as slapping a fish against my car on a rainy Sunday”

<viewers rolling on the floor laughing>"
The Vicar of Dibley,"Gentleman, the King!

Where?"
The Vicar of Dibley,I did! I watched all the specials...such good stuff. I'm starting Fawlty Towers next and plan to binge through some other British goodness for a while. :)
The Vicar of Dibley,"This guys brains for example, Theledj, is so immensely ginormous, that if a pack of hungry cannibals cracked his head open, there would be enough to cover ten-thousand water biscuits."
The Vicar of Dibley,You forgot Bottom and The Young Ones.
The Vicar of Dibley,"> Don't forget your stick Lieutenant

> Rather, sir. Wouldn't want to face a machine gun without this."
The Vicar of Dibley,Good luck everyone
The Vicar of Dibley,"Have you seen the original pilot? It reverses the roles of Bkackadder & Baldrick, to the way they are in the other 3 seasons.  Its great."
The Vicar of Dibley,Why DO only fools and horses work?
The Vicar of Dibley,"""And which Pitt would this be? Pitt the toddler? Pitt the embryo?"""
The Vicar of Dibley,I work in a school and I keep telling the history teachers they need to just put Blackadder on but they don't. The students are missing out.
The Vicar of Dibley,"When I was in secondary school, we watched the entirety of Blackadder Goes Fourth when we learned about WW1. Great show."
The Vicar of Dibley,"And 3 and 4 and Chrstmas Carol and Cavalier Years and, yes, even Back and Forth."
The Vicar of Dibley,Red Dwarf is next on my list after I finish Fawlty Towers. And I've gotten some great recommendations from this thread so will likely be stuck on old British TV shows for quite some time. :)
The Vicar of Dibley,I don't know.
The Vicar of Dibley,Ah! I spent the night with a  pair of Wellingtons and I loved it!
The Vicar of Dibley,"I had the cassettes for Fawlty Towers, listened to those for years before I ever saw the show."
The Vicar of Dibley,Done!
The Vicar of Dibley,I had a fun moment with my teenage daughter. She's a huge fan of House. I had her watch a few minutes of the Prince Regent in season three and she just couldn't quite put her finger on who the actor was. After a while she made me tell her and when I said it was Hugh Laurie she totally lost it and is now watching it herself. :)
The Vicar of Dibley,"Really?  The 4th series is probably my favourite.

And I wasn't keen on the first series"
The Vicar of Dibley,"I would recommend *Not The Nine O’Clock News* if you’re going into the UK comedy archives. 

It’s not an obvious one but I’m sure you’ve heard of the usual ones.

Also *The Young Ones*."
The Vicar of Dibley,"If you can find it, there's also a special episode set during the English Civil War which is pretty good. And there's one more called the millennium special that is well, kinda meh.

Edit, oh maybe it's called Back and Forth?"
The Vicar of Dibley,Father Ted!
The Vicar of Dibley,"Fawlty Towers, Bkackadder and Father Ted are the holy trinity of British TV."
The Vicar of Dibley,*A Bit of Fry & Laurie* has two of the greatest comedians/actors/speakers being brilliant right out of the gate.
The Vicar of Dibley,"Put the best comedy series of all time on that list as well, [I'm Alan Partridge](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0129690/). There are more series that feature Alan but start with that one first."
The Vicar of Dibley,"I think One Foot in the Grave would be in my ""Holy Trinity"", but not sure I can narrow it down under about 12 lol."
The Vicar of Dibley,"You really, really wish Baldrick had a cunning plan to get them out of that mess."
The Vicar of Dibley,">Why DO only fools and horses work?

For a Living"
The Vicar of Dibley,"""Pitt the glint in the milkman's eye?""

Rowan Atkinson's specific enunciation makes that line so much funnier than it already was."
The Vicar of Dibley,"Red Dwarf, Keeping Up Appearances, Outnumbered used to be my favorites."
The Vicar of Dibley,"Damn I forgot about fawlty towers! That's awesome, glad to hear you're getting good suggestions. I just remembered another one, Are you being served. Definerly not as good as these others but still worth a try."
The Vicar of Dibley,"No one's mentioned Dad's Army yet, but it's brilliant"
The Vicar of Dibley,"Red Dwarf is awesome. The last couple of seasons of the classic run and Back To Earth aren't amazing, but the rest is solid. The revival was awesome too."
The Vicar of Dibley,[come here](https://youtu.be/HGF25cyFwY0)
The Vicar of Dibley,"Geez yeah, going from George to House would be jarring."
The Vicar of Dibley,"I can totally agree the first is pretty bad to be honest, obviously they're testing an idea and series 2 is where it hits its stride 😂. 

I'm sure I read a fan theory where Blackadder becomes more cunning every series and Baldrick more stupid. 

Being objective about it I think I just have an issue with the World War 1 setting and the tragic ending, nothing against anyone who DOES enjoy it in the slightest of course, it just seems to feel more ""real"" than the others. I hope that makes sense..."
The Vicar of Dibley,Red Dwarf would like a word.
The Vicar of Dibley,Bottom mate
The Vicar of Dibley,Ahem. Only Fools and Horses would like a word.
The Vicar of Dibley,"French and Saunders, I feel, often gets overlooked..."
The Vicar of Dibley,"
*""I Hear You're A Racist Now, Father!""*"
The Vicar of Dibley,AHA!
The Vicar of Dibley,DAN!!!
The Vicar of Dibley,"Laurie needed an accent coach, I believe, to get his British accent back for *The Night Manager*."
The Vicar of Dibley,"""I'm sure I read a fan theory where Blackadder becomes more cunning every series and Baldrick more stupid.""

How is that a fan theory - it's just something you can see. The other side of it is that Blackadder is declining socially through the four series - from prince to some sort of noble to palace servant to a middle class guy - and getting smarter as he does so."
The Vicar of Dibley,"Red Dwarf is very mixed quality-wise. In places it is inspired, but in other places it is absolute dross. The first two series are excellent."
The Vicar of Dibley,"And that word is ""fish."""
The Vicar of Dibley,"Anything with Rik Mayall! May he RIP. I had to watch that one in spurts though. The meanness, depravity and poverty is kinda high. Dude was supposed to play Peeves in Harry Potter. Such a fucking shame he was cut."
The Vicar of Dibley,Lol watched that during COVID lockdowns when I got to work from home. I saw Vicar of Dibley a long time ago and always meant to watch F&R. Also Friday Night Dinner was the other britcom I watched then.
The Vicar of Dibley,"Ok calm your tits, no need to get all intense about me half remembering something. 😂"
The Vicar of Dibley,Yeah incredibly uneven. When it’s good it’s utterly fantastic. But so many episodes are meh.
The Vicar of Dibley,"I always find the best of Red Dwarf could almost be stage plays. Low on special effects, high on isolationist comedy."
The Vicar of Dibley,I’m rewatching Bottom at the moment. So many memories. RIP Rik.
The Vicar of Dibley,"Wow, you got a lot of them already, but here's the one's I think you could also include:

*Freaks and Geeks* is Lindsay Weir's story of how she falls in with the bad crowd.

*The Legend of Korra* while not as strong as the original, yet, is still a good animated series with a female lead.

*Dollhouse* has a female lead although the you could right question how strong a character could be in that role considering the memory is wiped clean every episode.

*Dead Like Me* has a female lead. The show certainly has its ups and downs but overall pretty good.

I would argue the Major from *Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex* is the lead there, and an excellent character all around to boot.

*My So-Called Life* was the original Claire Danes TV show before *Homeland* came along."
The Vicar of Dibley,Why wouldn't Homeland count? Carrie is the main character. 
The Vicar of Dibley,[deleted]
The Vicar of Dibley,Why'd you put Parks & Rec under dramady? It's a pretty straight comedy
The Vicar of Dibley,"[Bomb Girls](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1955311/reference) is Canadian btw, unless there's another one, in which case the Canuck show should be on there...

Also, add in [Being Erica](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1149608/reference) - love that show.

And [Hunted](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2069449/reference)

Both versions of La Femme Nikita, of course... (although the [original](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118379/reference) was better than the [remake](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1592154/reference) hehe..)

[Prime Suspect](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098898/reference) (UK) - all seasons/series.

[The Fall](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2294189/reference) - renewed for a second season yay.

(ps you dont really need to mark anything as Canada since like 50% of the shows listed are produced here and it's redundant.)"
Vic the Viking,Are they still making new episodes of Deadliest Catch? I’m surprised some of those captains are still alive. They looked haggard back when that show first aired like 20 years ago lol.
Vic the Viking,"Next season on The Walking Deadliest Catch: Sig tries to fight off deadly crabs whilst raising his 6 sons.  

(This show has had about 5 spinoffs, ala TWD)"
Vic the Viking,Man Deadliest Catch is quite a guilty pleasure.
Vic the Viking,My dad will love this
Vic the Viking,My guilty pleasure. Get made fun of a lot by family that I watch this show so much.
Vic the Viking,This isn’t staring the rapist one is it? Who am I kidding I was never gonna watch this anyway.
Vic the Viking,"I hate and love these shows lmao this new one, why did it half to be filmed? I mean clearly it's covering your expenses and risks but seeing Jake Anderson like that after years away from the franchise and you can prove to anyone how bad the lifestyle is."
Vic the Viking,Sounds awesome. I love Sig and I love things shot in Norway.
Vic the Viking,200 billion cigarettes later
Vic the Viking,I don’t really follow the show. But that is honestly shocking to hear.
Vic the Viking,"Don't worry, Sig has a daughter training up to take over one day, they'll still be filming this show 30 years from now when the seas are boiling and nuclear rain falls from the sky."
Vic the Viking,There’s some cheesy British voice doing the narration now.
Vic the Viking,They got new captains.
Vic the Viking,Oh they're bringing back Phil Harris??
Vic the Viking,"> why did it half to be filmed?

$$$

Cheap to film for Discovery, plenty of footage to be creatively edited to maximise drama, loyal viewerbase.

It's a no-brainer.

About the biggest threat to the show is the latest controversy in which the older Harris brother was found out to have molested a kid back before the show started and apparently his family including Phil covered it up. The show fired him a few weeks ago and last I heard it was going to be a bitch to edit around him considering he was one of the main guys including having a spin off show they were filming IIRC."
Vic the Viking,100 lbs of methamphetamine later.
Vic the Viking,I think they’d rather not be talking about [the Harris’s right now.](https://radaronline.com/p/discovery-cuts-deadliest-catch-star-josh-harris/)
Vic the Viking,"Oh, that's why Jesse Pinkman went to Alaska!"
Vic the Viking,"Whatever happened to Jake Harris?  I haven't watched DC for a long time, but last time I remember he was on, his face was starting to resemble something that loved meth"
Vic the Viking,Well shit [Edgar’s no bargain either](https://www.distractify.com/p/where-is-edgar-deadliest-catch).
Vic the Viking,Yea there is that ;)
Vic the Viking,Major drug addict who was arrested last I heard.
Vic the Viking,"Not surprised.  Like I said, last time I saw him on screen, he looked like he's been dealing with meth mites"
Vic the Viking,Vikings was really good at the start but turned to shit once Ragnar was gone while the last kingdom has pretty steady quality but never hits the highs of the first few seasons of Vikings.
Vic the Viking,The Last Kingdom. I lost interest in Vikings post Ragnar. I still watched it to the end but it became background noise for me. TLK stayed engaging throughout with the exception of one character who became tiresome.
Vic the Viking,"That's funny because ""*Deep, ruthless and realistic*"" is exactly how I'd describe TLK.

\+ gritty."
Vic the Viking,"I prefer Norsemen on Netflix to both, every day of the week and twice on Sunnudagr."
Vic the Viking,Vikings. I love the characters soo much more.
Vic the Viking,"The Last Kingdom, great from start to finish hardly any flaws, whilst Vikings was still great it was only really great when >!Ragnar was still on.!<

And Vikings last season really did not do it for me whilst The Last Kingdoms last season was one of the best imo."
Vic the Viking,S1-2 Vikings > Uhtred son of Uhtred but Vikings falls off a cliff after that point IMO and TLK stays steady.
Vic the Viking,"vikings after Ragnar became the walking dead after Rick.  

While the last kingdom had a single protagonist and it worked extremely well"
Vic the Viking,"The Last Kingdom. At least, i didn't see the historical non-sense i saw in Vikings"
Vic the Viking,The last kingdom because they at least occasionally wore helmets and refrained from depicting the Saxons as total pussys.
Vic the Viking,The Last Kingdom was good consistently throughout the series. Vikings had some great moments then turned to shit.
Vic the Viking,"Vikings did a better job with the material and had FAR more compelling characters.  

Last Kingdom every season just feels redundant.  The circumstances change a bit, but the drama basically hits the same beats every season as they build up to the ""big battle"" of the season.  The king (whether its the first king or the young king) listens to bad advice, makes big mistakes, then he finally realizes he should listen to the main guy, then they win, then the king refuses to give the main guy credit for reasons.  

And even though Vikings was the show built around a specific legendary hero, Last Kingdom is the show that basically plots all its characters' motivations around their feelings about the main guy.  Which often makes no sense historically.  Imo, Last Kingdom suffers from severe Poochie syndrome.  ""When Poochie's not on the screen, all the other characters should be asking 'where's Poochie?'"""
Vic the Viking,"What I want is for The Last Kingdom to have had some of the Vikings production budget/value.

But to answer your question, I definitely enjoyed the Last Kingdom more just because I'm a fan of the books. The dynamic between a dying King Albert and Uhtred is about as big league, poignant a moment(s) as anything I've ever watched.

But I do agree with others, Vikings was just incredible in the beginning couple of years."
Vic the Viking,[deleted]
Vic the Viking,I prefer Vikings it’s a little more fun I’d say and Ragnar is an awesome character while he’s in the show.
Vic the Viking,"Vikings. I was able to finish that at least, I dropped the last Kingdom 2 episodes in to the final season. Brida was annoying as fuck."
Vic the Viking,love both of them but TLK\`s quest and storyline was closer to me
Vic the Viking,Vikings was better until a certain character leaves.  the Last Kingdom is a tier below imo although their latest season was much better paced and written than preceding ones imo.  Their budget just shows a bit too much as the production values seem cheap.
Vic the Viking,"It look me like over a year to get through 4 episodes of the last Kingdom before tapping out, while I immediately fell in love with vikings."
Vic the Viking,Vikings... Last kingdom is so much cringe drama
Vic the Viking,"Vikings can be a bit of a mixed bag in the later seasons, but it got more vibes imo. Last Kingdom is kinda tame in comparisson, it never really hooked me so I've dipped out of it."
Vic the Viking,"They’re different from each other so it’s hard to say.

I would say Vikings was the better looking and better produced show. It felt far more epic.

I liked the focus and story of Last Kingdom more though."
Vic the Viking,I got really excited until I realised many years ago I watched ‘The 10th Kingdom’ 🥲🥹
Vic the Viking,"Hm, hard to say but I did watch them one after the other. Loved Vikings but had a really hard time watching the Ivar seasons. I liked the last one with the Russian angle better than the previous ones, but honestly was hate-watching for a while just for the non-Ivar parts.

Last Kingdom, I had a hard time getting through the Alfred and his wife parts iin the first 2 seasons. I definitely enjoyed it a lot more once that faded and it was more about uhtred and his pals riding around on missions.

So, for both I had a radical shift halfway through. Vikings went down, Last Kingdom went up."
Vic the Viking,Exactly.
Vic the Viking,"> TLK stayed engaging throughout with the exception of one character who became tiresome.

Brida?"
Vic the Viking,"True, it wasn't as great post Ragnar. But I still liked the last few seasons with his kids, even though it took a bit of time to start."
Vic the Viking,too bad it got cancelled
Vic the Viking,I agree 100% with the take.  It’s like Vikings went from 9/10 to 4/10 while TLK has always been 7-8/10.
Vic the Viking,lmfao the Poochi reference alone killed me
Vic the Viking,Tend to agree.  Vikings was taking characters to extremes quite frequently while TLK was a bit more grounded.
Vic the Viking,What other shows did you enjoy?
Vic the Viking,yeah the show may not target exactly the same audience. It feels like TLK is a bit more romanced and casual
Vic the Viking,Yes.
Vic the Viking,"Netflix didn't buy it for only one season. I hope it's going to be good, but having a Ragnar-like figure seems a high bar."
Vic the Viking,"*Literally any media about vikings*

Execs: So what will it be this time? Valhalla or Ragnarok?"
Vic the Viking,"If it's as good as the first half of Vikings with ol' Raggy, count me in. Sounds like it's back to the short season model, which is a positive sign, especially as Netflix has apparently already ordered three of them."
Vic the Viking,I need another Lagertha in my life. I miss the shield maidens.
Vic the Viking,"I hope it learns from the original Vikings, and stops before it gets too stupid."
Vic the Viking,Absolutely LOVED Vikings and can’t wait for this one.  Anyone know when it’s due to air?  Apologies if already answered
Vic the Viking,"When Ragnar broke up with lagertha, the show never fully recovered"
Vic the Viking,"The first two seasons of Vikings were awesome…mainly due to their perceived adherence to historical accuracy.


I hope the creators learned from the mistakes of Vikings later seasons."
Vic the Viking,"I'm excited

Really loved the first 4-5 seasons of Vikings (>!basically the season after Ragnar death!<) and I hope Netflix is able to understand what made Vikings both so amazing and terrible as the series went along"
Vic the Viking,"I am so excited for this show.. loved the original Vikings.

Here hoping for something at the level of those first 4 great seasons."
Vic the Viking,[removed]
Vic the Viking,"I never heard about it being one season anyway, I figured it was just a new series and they were planning more like all shows do except for a miniseries lol"
Vic the Viking,Lmao king of norway as a Black lady
Vic the Viking,"Ah yes, can't wait to see Netflix at work with the King of Norway, Haakon Sigurdsson, being played by an older Black lady. /s"
Vic the Viking,Eh just want not that happy about Vikings... give me more The Last Kingdom! Im so sad its ending after this season.
Vic the Viking,"Can’t wait until the 3rd series, Vikings: Ragnarok"
Vic the Viking,"""Valhalla is about the beginning of the end. ""

I'm glad they included this. I know Vikings was somewhat historically based and had a lot of embellishments, additions and probably ommissions, but historically, at then end of the OG Vikings show, they were starting to Christianize, and once they became Croatians, they were just another European country fighting all the others. ""Nothing to see here"", type stuff."
Vic the Viking,I thought they cut this from a photo from 1/6/21.
Vic the Viking,Have they announced a cast? I really enjoyed the first few seasons of Vikings but man did it just become a slog to drag through after a while
Vic the Viking,"Wow they are seriously milking this Viking phase. I agree with all the comments about the directioning, but TBH let's stop it. Ragnar is dead. Let's move on to a new original.

I watched a show this year called See with Jason Momoa and it is incredible. Post-apocalyptic pure awesomeness. I don't think it has a big following or viewership count like when Vikings first came out. So here I'm letting you know!"
Vic the Viking,There are 1000 things to do on the Vikings. Loved the show but it was so fucking dramatic. And the historical inaccuracies really turned me off.
Vic the Viking,It's so aweful it sits at a 93% on rotten tomatoes.  God people on the internet talking about entertainment are so damn dumb sometimes.  Clearly nobody liked vikings....
Vic the Viking,TBH I thought that was a Jan 6th pic from the US^
Vic the Viking,"It’s a stupid name. It’s probably going to suck. Ragnar carried the show. When he was gone it went down hill fast. Besides the great heathen army was the peak of Vikinging in Norse culture. Once they captured the lands they were after in England and France and became integrated in to Russia as well that era ended. Christianity ended the Vikings. The great heathen army was only a few hundred years before William the conqueror, who descended from Rollo. 

The Viking trope is getting hammered more than zombies a decade ago."
Vic the Viking,I thought this was a screen cap of Jan 6
Vic the Viking,I legit thought this is a picture from US Capitol on Jan 6
Vic the Viking,Definitely thought that cover photo was from Jan 6
Vic the Viking,"Holy shit, I thought this was a pic of the QANON Shaman for a split sec"
Vic the Viking,"Is this the History channel show that then transferred over netflix, and also got Luke skywalker to have a minor role in it? Good for them!"
Vic the Viking,"I thought Vikings was great until I watched the last kingdom and now Vikings just seems inferior, especially the later seasons.  The last kingdoms been rock solid all the way through"
Vic the Viking,"Well, hopefully they learned from Travis Fimmel and Alex Hogh Anderson that casting can make a big difference."
Vic the Viking,Is Netflix going to acquire the original series?
Vic the Viking,can't wait
Vic the Viking,Is Vikings worth finishing? I watched the first 3 seasons week to week and just never ended up going back when season 4 started.
Vic the Viking,Bold move cotton
Vic the Viking,"Can we get a season that explores Ubbe’s future. I really liked where his plot was going in the last season. Really it was the only good thing about that season. 

Oh and Alfred’s haircut."
Vic the Viking,Loved the show but will never understand why they made Ivar a cripple. He was supposed to be a badass berserker type viking and they decided having him crippled in the show would be interesting. Just don’t get it v
Vic the Viking,"Hopefully it has better audio than Vikings.

Not sure if it's just a me thing, but when I watch older time period based movies and shows I can hardly hear what they're saying because it sounds like they're whispering."
Vic the Viking,"I think it will all depend on Leif and how well done his character is. Let's see, I am looking forward for the show but doing three seasons already might be a stretch."
Vic the Viking,"I don't think the problem is ragnar died so much as they went insane after that. minor characters got promoted and went off on their own and instead of having a clear direction you'd have time dedicated to floki doing whatever nonsense he is up to, all of ragnar's sons get a turn (and basically all of the 'screen effects' surrounding Ivar was just dumb) Rollo even became important. The thing basically went full GoT. Characters had kind of vague goals and while I understand it was supposed to be mostly historical it dragged and got convoluted."
Vic the Viking,"Which doesn't make any sense for this series as Scandinavia was well and truly Christianised by that point. The portrayal of any significant Norse God mythology would be anachronistic. But, since it's said to revolve around Harald Hardrada who by most historians is considered the last of the notable Viking invaders it also doesn't make much sense to call this Vikings either.

Considering that this is written by the same guy who wrote the original I don't really see any semblance accuracy being a concern."
Vic the Viking,It is Netflix so they are probably looking at 3-4 eight episode seasons as long as it does not bomb in the viewership charts. Netflix don’t do long series nowadays.
Vic the Viking,Man I miss Ragnar so much. Travis Fimmel is just the best.

Star Trek: Voyager,"I’m a lifelong Trekkie but my fiancée only started watching it after meeting me. We started binging Voyager and when we got to this scene, she insisted on rewatching it three times."
Star Trek: Voyager,"I've only watched a few episodes of Voyager. I don't know why, but I just couldn't get into it back when it aired. I've watched all of TNG and DS9 back when they originally aired and liked them. Especially TNG. I'm thinking I should get Voyager on my watchlist."
Star Trek: Voyager,"This is the most hilarious scene in all of Star Trek. I'm a huge trekkie have been to several conventions. I started the original series with my grandfather. Furthermore, I've met both Robert Picardo and Tim Russ, great guys."
Star Trek: Voyager,This song lives rent free in my head
Star Trek: Voyager,"One of the best scenes in Voyager. Shit, maybe the *best* scene in Voyager, there's not a flaw, and I've found myself singing *It's all so verrrrrrrrrrrrrrry Illogical* for years after seeing this."
Star Trek: Voyager,Super corny
Star Trek: Voyager,I think Voyager in general isn't a great Star Trek show but the Doctor might be my favorite Star Trek character ever!
Star Trek: Voyager,Thawed is top 10 episode in all of Star Trek
Star Trek: Voyager,"Exactly how my fiancé reacted, she about lost her damn mind before she realized it was a dream sequence"
Star Trek: Voyager,"It has its ups, but it also has a lot of down. It had a lot of wasted potential, if you ask me."
Star Trek: Voyager,[deleted]
Star Trek: Voyager,"It's my favourite Star Trek series. Sure, TNG and DS9 and arguably ENT are better, but voyager was the first one I watched, so I have a soft spot for it. What I will say is It has a lot of the best episodes of stark trek and some of the worst. The same goes for the characters, The doctor is fantastic and most of his episodes are excellent. It's a mixed bag. There is some wasted potential with the plot, they wanted to make a darker show with the maquis story line, there was meant to be more conflict, with rationing, patchy ship repairs etc which would have been more realistic, but with DS9 already dark and getting darker with the dominion war, and TNG off the air, they were forced into making it more like TNG. You can see a glimpse of what they really wanted to do in the episodes' year of hell part 1&2. It would have worked great."
Star Trek: Voyager,"DS9 may have ripped of B5's premise, but it also did that premise wayyy better. And I say that as a B5 fan (reboot!)"
Star Trek: Voyager,I had to google this. I never watched Babylon 5 and didn't realize.
Star Trek: Voyager,It's going to be a youtube cooking show starring Neelix.
Star Trek: Voyager,Oh do we get to finally know what happened to Janeway and Paris’s lizard babies!?
Star Trek: Voyager,Will Harry Kim still be an ensign?
Star Trek: Voyager,"Reading the actual article here, there's almost zero detail relating to this headline. Robert Duncan McNeill wants to do a Captain Proton podcast and wants to cameo in Picard. That's it."
Star Trek: Voyager,DS9: Are you fucking kidding me?
Star Trek: Voyager,HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE YOU GOING TO KILL THIS TIME GENOCIDE JANEWAY!?
Star Trek: Voyager,"The pilot episode should be Admiral Janeway getting briefed about some threat in the Delta Quadrant that only she can handle, in part because it was her fault to begin with.

Janeway has to “get the band back together,” so she goes to each of her former crew and tries to manipulate them into agreeing to go.

She tracks down Chakotay, who is living in a teepee out in nature.  He wears animal skins and has a bigger tattoo.  He refuses to join her because he is at peace/ one with nature, etc.

She visits Admiral Tuvok who is in command of Voyager.  He fails to see the logic in turning command over to Janeway, but Starfleet insists and Tuvok is reluctantly signed on for the mission. 

Janeway goes to see Tom, who of course hasn’t been taking care of himself since his divorce.  He tells Janeway to f off, as he finishes another bottle of ale.

B’Elana runs a meditation and rehab facility.  She won’t allow herself to be in any situation that would make her lose her temper.

Harry Kim refuses to ever go back to the Delta Quadrant because he just has PTSD from being stranded there.

The Doctor has largely given up practicing medicine on patients, favoring research and lectures.  He’s not interested in leaving his current speaking tour to get stuck in sick bay.

It seems that Janeway will not have any of the old crew with her, except for a resentful Tuvok.  But just when they are about to set off, everyone shows up with some quip like, “I thought you could use a hand” or “I’m not letting you have all the fun.”  Even Seven and Barclay show up."
Star Trek: Voyager,"I mean, isn’t Star Trek: Picard already a Voyager spinoff?"
Star Trek: Voyager,Young Vorik on CBS Thursdays
Star Trek: Voyager,"The Picard spin off did not have the same feel as the original series so I doubt this one would either, but god damn, I loved Voyager."
Star Trek: Voyager,"If this has Kurtzman, Bad Robot and/or anyone from Kurtzman/Bad Robot, I am not interested. I will just watch the old Star Trek on repeat."
Star Trek: Voyager,"It's sad that, as a hard core Trekkie, my deepest desire is to just let the franchise die. Maybe pick it back up again in a decade or two."

Star Trek: Voyager,This website is clickbait trash.
Star Trek: Voyager,"Ah yes, because the other two in the last 5 years, haven't been trash at all."
Star Trek: Voyager,"The thing is, that Captain proton thing was my last favourite part!! Too cheesy!"
Star Trek: Voyager,"I'd love to get a non-splody, non-yelly, non-shakey cam Star Trek. Something with nuance that discusses modern human issues and discusses morality. 

I don't need everything to be a meth-addled speed run on my senses."
Star Trek: Voyager,I'd love some kind if star trek series back. I think it would be cooler if they did something much further in the future from voyager and get a fresh start.
Star Trek: Voyager,Garak's tales first
Star Trek: Voyager,Ok but no nelix or kazon
Star Trek: Voyager,Seeing what they did with Picard I'll be avoiding this one

Star Trek: Voyager,"Alas, if Brannon and Braga merely consulted and let Moore take the helm the show would have been really good."

Star Trek: Voyager,"Please note, this article is from ""Giant Freakin Robot,"" which means it's an utter lie. This site makes things up for clicks CONSTANTLY. They're one of the most untrustworthy websites out there."
Star Trek: Voyager,"Being banned from r/startrek just for using the word ""fuck"", it's nice to see a trek post somewhere else. Also..... fuck."
Star Trek: Voyager,"Ugh. Captain Proton was waaay too cheesy for me. Give me episodic stories of The Doctor from Living Witness working his way back home.


Hell, have him link up with Discovery for the finale. Give me more Robert Picardo now, Dammit!"
Star Trek: Voyager,"Written by Kurtzmen, no thanks. 

His adaptions of Star Trek are just garbage. Completely lacking the thoughtfulness, emotion and wonder that TOS, TNG, DS9 and even VOY had. Just grimdark, melodramatic, pessimistic bullshit. Don't care. Will never watch."
Star Trek: Voyager,"I have no faith that it will be good, I hated discovery and Picard."
Star Trek: Voyager,"Did anyone else absolutely hate Neelix? He’s basically supposed to be the alien comedic relief  character but he’s just annoying as hell. He’s no Quark, that’s for sure."
Star Trek: Voyager,Right now Michael Dorn (Worf) is pissed. He's been trying to make a Worf spinoff show for years

Star Trek: Voyager,"Since Hollywood is all about villain movies lately, how about 7of9's memories during her time as a Borg?"
Star Trek: Voyager,"If Alex Kurtzman is in charge I’m stepping off this train, fuck him and his shit writing"
Star Trek: Voyager,"No, not really.  The title is clickbait; Mcneil pitched his show, but Paramount has shown no signs that they are making it.  There are credible rumors that a 7of9-centered show is in the works after Picard runs it's course, which would also be a Voyager spinoff, but Captain Proton is unlikely I think.  That's like saying that the Warf-centered show 'is being discussed' because it was pitched and turned down."
Star Trek: Voyager,Sweeeeet
Star Trek: Voyager,I'm guessing Kes will not be a part of it.
Star Trek: Voyager,They should just ignore Endgame and make this show about Voyager returning home in the original timeline where it took 23 years to return home.
Star Trek: Voyager,"Oh please may this become a reality.

The biggest gripe I have with the latest series, discovery, is it no longer has all the individual standalone episodes, they are all just one long winded storyline that turned out to be an ultra lame reason for the galactic explosion of warp cores.

Please can we have a better series that has lots of amazing individual episodes like the star trek of old. Same as stargate SG1, sure, there’s a background story running through the series but each episode is an individual story in and of itself.

Ok rant over."
Star Trek: Voyager,"I really wish we could just get a proper new, post-Voyager era series with all new characters."
Star Trek: Voyager,Oh yay. Can it be seven seasons of mediocre to shit writing where half the core concept gets abandoned two thirds of the way through the pilot of and the majority of the cast never gets any character development or changes in any significant way for the entire course of the show?
Star Trek: Voyager,I freaking love Captain Janeway/Voyager season!
Star Trek: Voyager,"Another star trek property to ruin, cant w8"
Star Trek: Voyager,"A show with a female captain and diverse cast where they aren't all weeping and saying goodbye every five fucking minutes, or doing shit no starfleet trained officer would ever do. Yes that sounds nice."
Star Trek: Voyager,It’s like no one actually read the link and everyone thinks there actually is a Voyager revival coming.

Star Trek: Voyager,This site is basically Wegotthiscovered
Star Trek: Voyager,"Yup and in the first episode where fans realize ""this isnt the same episodic format Voyager used"" the horror of it not being exactly the same will sink it and fans will promptly begin to shit all over it."
Star Trek: Voyager,"Headline: ""Out of work trek actor float another dead end idea"""
Star Trek: Voyager,"What a horribly misleading title. Nothing is being discussed and the only thing we have is Paris saying ""how great would it be to have a captain proton show"". This post should be removed and sent into the exterminator"
Star Trek: Voyager,A limited series or a TV movie with the cast of Voyager and/or DS9 would be great.
Star Trek: Voyager,I'd prefer a DS 9 spin off but no idea how that story could possibly continue
Star Trek: Voyager,Gritty Chris Nolan Flotter reboot
Star Trek: Voyager,Yeah keep your shitty reboots.
Star Trek: Voyager,"As long as Kurtzman is in charge, there is no hope for ANY new Trek."
Star Trek: Voyager,"Huh I have to admit I was sceptic, but reading through the article the idea of having it just being Tom and Harry playing Captain Proton during their time on board with the others guest staring every know and then, might be really fun to watch.

I really loved the tongue in cheek tribute to old science fiction serials."
Star Trek: Voyager,Does Paramount hate the Star Trek fan base?Nobody wants this.
Star Trek: Voyager,"Oh, will we see Icheb again?

NO WE WON'T, FUCK YOU KURTZMAN!"
Star Trek: Voyager,"Oh, another star trek franchise they will shit all over and give fans the middle finger again.  I will not watch it because we know what will come, but I will watch rlm as they rip it to shreds."
Star Trek: Voyager,I stopped watching Star Trek when they required people to buy CBS All Access.
Star Trek: Voyager,"Robert Duncan McNeill is worth the time. I'd love to see him reprise the roll of Paris, in whatever fashion. If it happens, though, we need Garrett Wang back, too. Can't have Tom without Harry, dammit. And I know the pair are still quite close."
Star Trek: Voyager,Please don't ...
Star Trek: Voyager,Please make it so I can watch Rich and Mike from Redlettermedia make a video tearing it to shreds while I never watch one episode or join Paramount plus(cbs all access).
Star Trek: Voyager,"A mediocre series getting a spinoff.

Stop Paramount. You killed Picard. There's no need to kill that which was already dead in Voyager."
Star Trek: Voyager,Hot Lizard Lovin’: the Next Generation
Star Trek: Voyager,"Maybe a slightly unpopular opinion but a voyager spinoff/sequel isn’t the worst idea. Voyager had some good ideas/concepts/stories that could be fleshed out into some good trek (they obviously also had more then their share of bad stories too). 

There are some options but imagine they set the story at the beginning of when time travel is becoming possible, maybe some new enemy/potential threat is on the verge of time travel so Janeway or some other former voyager crew member brings up the timeship from the year of hell and the story centers on going back out to find the Krenim to see if they had any technology that could help advance time travel/find some key to it/etc. Along the way they could fill out details on the year of hell, other stories that could be expanded, etc. It’s an easy jumping off point into an era not explored yet in trek, easy to align with discovery/Picard and technology can be super shiny with lots of action. You could fill a few seasons based on voyager stories before jumping off into its own thing. 

The potential upside is they make a decent new Star Trek and fix some things about voyager, potential downside is they make voyager look worse."
Star Trek: Voyager,Spin-offs of stuff usually suck but voyager was awesome
Star Trek: Voyager,"I don't know where else to ask this question, but:

How in the *flying fuck* does Star Trek: Discovery and Star Trek: Picard have the rating they do on IMDb? All of the reviews there trash them deservedly, but at first glance you would think that people actually enjoyed those flaming piles of garbage.

The system can't be that blatantly corrupt... can it?"
Star Trek: Voyager,God I remember when Voyager was the worst Star Trek show and now it’s middle of the pack to upper crust compared to everything that has followed it.
Star Trek: Voyager,"They just lost all ability to tell an original story. Or we as viewers lost all ability to tolerate 100% new characters and situations. It always HAS to feature recast old characters to even be considered. 

Make a Star Trek show with no character link to an old show, with a new ship, and even a new timeline... and I'm watching every episode."
Star Trek: Voyager,"I know people hate Voyager, but to me it was the closest to the original.  As they were on their own discovering new things."
Star Trek: Voyager,How can any fan off the old shows be ootimistc for new ones?
Star Trek: Voyager,Can we have a spin-off of good trek instead please? Trying to get through Voyager on Netflix and it’s…such a slog.
Star Trek: Voyager,"If it’s terrible, which it will be because of Kurtzman I can’t wait to see red letter media shit on it"
Star Trek: Voyager,Please don't fuck it up like the last two. Please don't fuck it up like the last two. Please don't fuck it up like the last two. Please don't fuck it up like the last two. Please don't fuck it up like the last two. Please don't fuck it up like the last two. Please don't fuck it up like the last two. Please don't fuck it up like the last two. Please don't fuck it up like the last two. Please don't fuck it up like the last two. Please don't fuck it up like the last two. Please don't fuck it up like the last two. Please don't fuck it up like the last two. Please don't fuck it up like the last two.
Star Trek: Voyager,"After the Discovery and Picard turds, I've given up on Star Trek and just watch TNG reruns."
Star Trek: Voyager,I hope it's about the water planet that Tom Paris saved and Janeway was a major bitch about.
Star Trek: Voyager,"Yes, please."
Star Trek: Voyager,I’d like to see a senior love story between janeway and Picard
Star Trek: Voyager,Well. We really won’t be seeing much of Echeb now will we?
Turn,Imagine your industry being so shit that Twitch is the less toxic environment.
Turn,"Grace Van Dien:
>“Here’s the thing, I have seen that some people are upset with me for turning down acting projects and deciding to stream more, but the fact of the matter is the last few projects I’ve worked on I didn’t have the best experiences with some of the people I had to work for,” Van Dien said.

>She then alleged that a film producer made unwanted sexual advances toward her on set.

>“One of the last movies I did, one of the producers asked me to… like, he hired a girl that he was sleeping with and then he had her ask me to have a threesome with them,” Van Dien said. “So… that’s my boss. And then I didn’t and I cried and I was so upset. But when people are like, ‘How is streaming better for your mental health?’ That’s how. I get to stay inside my house and play video games and I don’t have my boss asking me to have sex with them.”

>Van Dien added that though she’s sticking to streaming for now, she hopes to get back into show business soon — and on her own terms.

>“I’m happy here, and I’m developing my own projects,” she said. “I’m hoping that someone decides to fund them because then I can be in control of my own set, and I’m not gonna ask my actors to sleep with me.”"
Turn,That’s fucked but at least she’s still able to do something lucrative and didn’t have to throw it all away to avoid being Weinsteined
Turn,Scumbags are getting too comfortable again as time passes the Weinstein stuff. Time to nip that shit in the bud.
Turn,who was she on stranger things?
Turn,"This person clearly forgot that her father is Johnny f'n Rico. 

So frustrating to hear things like this. Like the money you get from existing in the producer-tier of the film industry isn't enough? You also have to torment your talent?"
Turn,Hollywood is full of some really dark shit and it’s getting really hard to see past it.
Turn,"I may be naive, but her dad is Casper Van Dien. I would think having a fairly famous dad would be the best kind of nepotism: insulation against those dirty fucking movie execs."
Turn,She should name the projects and producers.
Turn,"She'd rather stream on Twitch playing games than work in Hollywood. And I say good for her, her health and safety are more important. Fuck Hollywood and the sexual predator scum that run the industry"
Turn,"Was so mesmerizing in the few scenes she had in ST, such a shame there are so many shitty people who take advantage of nice people like Grace.

Edit for all of the people arguing about this in the comments: I took her task to be difficult because she only had one episode to make the audience feel sympathy and care for her enough to be the whole impetus of the season, basically.  And I think she did a great job with it."
Turn,"Good for her! Honestly though it's so fucking sickening and at the same time unsurprising that there was a whole cultural moment a few years ago about exactly this sort of behavior and yet there's still just so much rot. Hollywood is morally bankrupt, and I don't blame any young women for not wanting to associate with that cesspool."
Turn,Good for her.
Turn,That fucking sucks nobody deserves to go through that. I’m happy she has streaming as something that she does. Don’t usually give two shits about famous ppl or celebs but that’s just Down right shitty. Do your thing young lady and fuck these Hollywierd ppl and their horrible practices! Hopefully somebody does fund one of her projects bc she sounds like somebody who has a future in helping make sure her cast and crew are safe and protected!
Turn,It's totally bullshit that with film unions and guilds that Producers can keep their job after such disgusting behavior.
Turn,">“One of the last movies I did, one of the producers asked me to… like, he hired a girl that he was sleeping with and then he had her ask me to have a threesome with them,” Van Dien said. “So… that’s my boss. And then I didn’t and I cried and I was so upset. But when people are like, ‘How is streaming better for your mental health?’ That’s how. I get to stay inside my house and play video games and I don’t have my boss asking me to have sex with them.”

Just one of the many benefits of working remotely."
Turn,"Chrissy wake up!

On a serious note, good for her by not compromising her morals to advance her career."
Turn,NPR just did a story about how conditions in the entertainment industry are basically back to pre me too. Large companies hired experts to help them change but just used them as shields whenever concerns were raised. All outward change was purely performative.
Turn,Chrissy woke up!!!
Turn,"I gotta say, for one of the most unioned up industries in this country, they do fucking fuck all when shit like this comes up."
Turn,"Harvey Weinstein was just the tip, the whole industry is fucked"
Turn,So in other words nothing has changed at all?!
Turn,That’s awful. Hopefully she can find some projects without any sex pests. I was impressed with her on Stranger Things. She really elevated what could have been a typical mean-girl cheerleader tropey character.
Turn,"On another note, it just hit me that her dad is Johnny Rico from Starship Troopers, Casper Van Dien. My mind is blown that he has a 26 y/o daughter, but it makes sense."
Turn,I wish some of these women would be more Ellen Barkin-like and say names when they talk of these things.
Turn,Good that she knows her worth and kudos to her for sharing what happened
Turn,What is it with Hollywood and the total inability to not be a creep?
Turn,Wow that sucks. But at least she can get some joy out of streaming
Turn,Out that boss - hollywood still full of assholish men treating women like shit.
Turn,Stranger things star? She was in like one episode
Turn,"No relation to Casper van Dien, is there?"
Turn,“Star” is used pretty loosely these days eh
Turn,Her twitch handle is BlueFille. I couldn't find it in the article.
Turn,"More power too her. She’s doing her part!

She was good in Stranger Things, her role was small but complex and her performance was memorable. I’ll miss seeing more from her but she doesn’t owe us her talent. She owes herself her happiness."
Turn,"I love that she not only didn't cave to the pressure, but called it out. She can't name the man because he'll bury her financially in litigation, but she can make it known that she's experienced what we all know the industry does and that other women don't have to accept it either."
Turn,"I don't want to in any way downplay the inappropriate sexual situations she was exposed to, but this article really exaggerated and overplayed her role in Stranger Things.  She was in part of one episode... Not exactly ""the breakout star"" they claimed

Jazzing up the story is not how journalism is done"
Turn,What’s sad is after everything the last few years these abusers in Hollywood can still get away with it and keep doing this awful shit to more people. I’d like to think we live in a world where they can’t hide anymore. I wish she could name this person but I get why she can’t. I feel for her.
Turn,Didnt know she was Johnny Rico's daughter.
Turn,Had no idea this was Casper Van Dien's kid.
Turn,"Understandable, have a great day"
Turn,It’s horrible that so many industries are operated this way and not enough people put their foot down and expose it.
Turn,Johnny Rico doesn't like this
Turn,Why can’t people just go to work and do their job instead of trying to sleep with people / sexually harass or assault those they work with?
Turn,name names. burn that cesspool to the ground
Turn,Y’all should watch the movie “she said” came out late last year and is about Harvey Weinstein and that New York Times article. Really begs the question of how many other Harveys are out there?
Turn,"I feel so bad for her. She's been bullied by people who are obsessed with Joseph Quinn (Eddie from Stranger Things) too, because they are friends.

I hope things look up for her."
Turn,"Amuzing people are still dubious of potential repercussions if she spoke out more, considering the trash she's already getting in this cesspool of a thread, entirely from people with no stakes in the matter."
Turn,"She was only in 3 episodes, how is she a “star”?"
Turn,Name them!
Turn,"Stranger Things *Star*? I watched it and don’t even remember her character, let alone know who she is."
Turn,Wait… that jawline. I just realized she’s Rico’s daughter.
Turn,No idea who this is
Turn,Hollywoods gunna Hollywood
Turn,"Common Hollywood L 

Wish more actors and actresses were strong enough to call out all the predators

Sadly doing so puts their career and money at risk"
Turn,"A producer asked his girlfriend to ask Grace if she would like to have a threesome. 

She decided not to. Then cried about it. Then left 

What a load of overblown hysterics."
Turn,"""star"""
Turn,Back in the day that would have gotten you blacklisted from movies. Hopefully this isn’t still the case.
Turn,"I didn't know she streamed and I thought I'd check it out, but she has no archived past broadcasts or anything at all eh?"
Turn,It is unfortunate when an industry becomes known for having a toxic environment. It is important for all industries to prioritize creating safe and respectful spaces for everyone.
Turn,"Waiting for the usual suspects to attack and vilify her for daring to speak out against an abusive man, the way they have for other women over the last four years. Claiming it was their fault they were abused, or that they were the ones abusing the men."
Turn,Hollywood never cleaned up after Harvey obv
Turn,"One horrible takeaway from all of this is that too much of this comes down to “talent”. 

The producers with “talent” get away with this shit behavior while the many victims have to hope they’re “talented” enough to be heard. 

Super mature move out of her to acknowledge how toxic that is instead of suffering."
Turn,"Inaccurate title: ‘Stranger Things’ Star

‘Stranger Things’ Actor more like it - she's in 1 episode, and 2 flashbacks (uncredited)

Regardless - why is this still happening? Did Hollywood ignore the Harvey Weinstein crap"
Turn,[removed]
Turn,Why is the industry that prides itself on moralizing to the world is actually the most racist and sexist hive of villainy?
Turn,hows this still happening after weinstein?
Turn,"I always find it interesting when people in America express such sexually liberal views, and then something like this comes up people act as though the employee and worker relationship is somehow sacred. 

She is an attractive and semi-notable young actress, who must receive attention from many men, especially as a streamer. Is the only reason for this being news and outrage-worthy the fact that her boss tried to get his way with her? 

Perhaps it’s the power dynamic people find offensive. They picture a helpless and naive young woman, and a strong older man who aims to take advantage of her. However, the woman in question is well of age, so is this really anybody’s business other than her own?

Surely we wouldn’t mean to patronize the young woman, who is obviously more than capable of rejecting someone’s advances on her own, without the aid and outrage of the thoughtful Reddit community."
Turn,[removed]
Turn,Least depraved Hollywood director/producer
Turn,Star and Twitch streamer
Turn,"*credited with 3 out of the shows 42 episodes*

""Star"""
Turn,Totally understand. I wish she would name names. These animals need to be outed.
Turn,"I'm a bit confused. Inapptiateness withstanding...is she turning down these roles because those several offers were associated with said producer? If so, I totally get it. But to turn down all work indiscriminately? Idk...sounds like we are missing some info here."
Turn,She needs to get her dad to kick some ass.
Turn,The number of people defending the dude as just asking her out is pathetic.
Turn,Chrissy wake up!!! I don't like this!!! Chrissssssy wake up. I didn't know who she was in Stranger Things from the picture without looking her up. Fyi she is Chrissy from S4. Too bad she has to deal with creep producers but it looks like she has been streaming on Twitch so at least she is enjoy still making content.
Turn,Wait til she finds out about the people on twitch too
Turn,Ah... to be a woman. And they say rape culture doesn't exist
Turn,"Imagine thinking that after Weinstein … you of all people can somehow get away with it …

Good for her honestly. She’s making money and she doesn’t even have to leave her house. She literally stays home, plays video games, and gets paid. If you’re mad you’re just jealous because she’s living the dream."
Turn,I like how people can do this and have no repercussions because people around them aren't willing to expose the truth on how bad they are. I get not wanting to as a victim because of how much harassment they get but it's annoying how many people stay silent when they see their boss being an absolute creep. This shit just causes a cycle of harassment because obviously the sexual advances aren't going to stop because they're not punished for their crimes.
Turn,So when are the women in this field going to be smart enough to carry some sort of recording device with them so that when these shit producers do this then there is some sort of evidence against them?
Turn,And people wonder why celebrities keep their kids hidden from the public
Turn,"Hey, guys, we get it, you think the word ""star"" is misapplied. Glad you're all so focused on what's important."
Turn,"Not the point of the article, but: Does anyone else not remember her in Stranger Things?"
Turn,So who’s the producer? Get the name out and hopefully he’ll never produce anything again
Turn,"Apparently if you want to bang women while in a position of power and authority over them, but are dumb and can't become a teacher, you become a sleazy EP."
Turn,The two Coreys took a huge hit for talking about what happened to them. They were mocked reviled and blacklisted. All because pedos make money for Hollywood.
Turn,"""Stranger things star""

Bit generous, that."
Turn,"Hollywood is friggin gross. Always has been always will be, until there’s no more Hollywood."
Turn,"Awful through and through.

We should watch in the future to see if she files a lawsuit for sexual harassment. It’s arguable she’s laying the groundwork for damages (loss of income from psyche basis).

Hypothetically, if she does file suit and prevails, she may get paid for said contracts of films. 

While underhanded, who gives a shit. The industry should not allow this type of crap to happen, they let fucking that sexual predator Weinstein do what he wanted for 20+ years without consequence.

This scum bag probably has a reputation for doing it much the same."
Turn,"not a star of the series, but sucky situation."
Turn,I would be surprise if anyone would hire her after this article.
Turn,[removed]
Turn,Welcome to Hollywood
Turn,Stranger Things star is a bit of a stretch isn’t it?
Turn,"Say they name! Put them on blast. Only way you finna weed all these creeps out, they need to be put on blast. I know it’s difficult and you’re concerned about not being blackballed but we’ve seen people will collectively get together and weed out the bad ones if it’s enough voices. Just get these creeps out."
Turn,"""Star"""
Turn,"I believe her but if she's not going to make names, but she should name names to get the creep removed."
Turn,Who does she play in stranger thing??
Turn,Call in Rico’s Roughnecks! (is her dad not Casper Van Dien?)

Super Why!,Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul love being Walt and Jesse so much.

Shameless,His arc in one of the later seasons where he becomes a contributing member of society only to throw it all away after one little setback is so hilarious to me.
Shameless,"I actually hated his character the whole time and wish he would have died during one of his many near death experiences. 

That is until the final season… I thought he was one of the better parts."
Shameless,"William H. Macy held *Shameless* together the whole run.

It's an amazing performance. I especially love the trivia that he spends the whole first episode passed out on the floor."
Shameless,"He’s a narcissist, drunk, druggie and a negligent father. But… he has redeeming qualities. His bonding with Franny is adorable. He accepts Ian and Mickey. He starts to try with Liam.

But the thing that gets me personally is the finale when the nurses recognize him as a frequent flier. I’m an Er nurse and even when the homeless drunk who can make a shift difficult dies, it hurts. You can’t fix everything for them but you can patch them up, get some services and a hot meal and hope that the next time you see them they aren’t beyond saving. Those Covid scenes of Frank in the hospital endured me to him just a little more because thousands of disenfranchised people died with nothing more than a nurse who had seen them at their worst by the side and Frank brought that to the public."
Shameless,"Check out Magnolia, fantastic performances all around, including William H Macy."
Shameless,"To paraphrase Don Draper, *that's what the awards were for!* (SAGs)"
Shameless,"I can't watch it. He reminds me too much of my dad, which, bravo, I suppose."
Shameless,"I fell in love with him for this role! Check out behind the scenes stuff! He was a cast father to all the kids. And helped Fiona, Emmy Rossum, bloom into the actress she wanted to become. Now THAT is acting. Play a low life, absent father but to help everyone once the cameras are off. This man is a treasure."
Shameless,His portrayal of an absolute piece of shit father made me so furious I couldn’t watch a really well written and acted show. He was that convincing.
Shameless,"Huh, TIL the American remake of Shameless lasted longer than the UK version"
Shameless,It is a sad mimicry of the British original.
Shameless,I have always loved him and I promise that you will love every movie he has been in (I think!) My top faves are Welcome to Collingwood and Fargo; just one of the best actors around.
Shameless,He and George Clooney filmed a movie in my city and I passed up a chance to go to the cast party and missed the chance to meet him and it’s a big regret in my life😅
Shameless,"Isn't that like all of the character arcs in shameless the entire time? I quit in season 8 because I couldn't stand the constant regression. Works in Always Sunny, not necessarily a serialized drama, for me at least."
Shameless,"I really thought that would be the final stage of his character development! 

He really had me there where I thought the death of Monica would open his eyes a little that he needs to be better, but he slips back to his old habits. It was that moment I accepted he was too far gone, much like how his own children had accepted it."
Shameless,"He was always a bad character, but as some of the good characters left the show, his became more important."
Shameless,"Him along with Emmy Rossum (Fiona)! They equally carried the whole series, after she left in S9 it didn’t feel the same"
Shameless,"almost all American remakes last longer, they love to squeeze as much milk out of the cow until it collapses"
Shameless,"I feel that! I’ve had so many chances where I could’ve met Kevin Conroy (the iconic voice actor of Batman), when I visited comic conventions he attended, but never took them. 

I even planned to finally meet him while attending one he was suppose to go to this year but he ended up cancelling last minute, and now I’ll never get the chance cause of his death! That’s one of my biggest regrets in life."
Shameless,"Man I disagree! I felt like Fiona detracted from the show so much towards the end, I couldn’t wait for her to leave personally"
Shameless,Apparently she was a pain to work with and some of the other actors said they were relieved when she left.
Shameless,"Lip was my favorite character on Shameless early on but IMO they made a mistake in keeping him around after he went off to college. They just kept inventing reasons to reset his life back to where he started rather than letting him grow and move on. Same issue with Fiona as well. 

I can get why the role stopped being creatively fun for White.

And yea, his character's personality on his new show is like Lip but the story seems like it's on a very different trajectory. Plus it's with a new supporting cast, new showrunner, etc. So don't see inconsistency in his comments and taking that role either."
Shameless,"I legit had to stop watching shameless because it just was so depressing after a while that it was impacting me negatively. Loved the show, but it just got to be too much"
Shameless,"He was the best thing about Shameless and although I’m glad he got The Bear (which is phenomenal), he should have left Shameless much earlier.

But it’s gotta be hard as an actor to walk away from work and a paycheck."
Shameless,"Jeremy Allen White:

>”I love ‘Shameless’ so much. I love everybody that was a part of it, and the experience was incredible, but I’m not sure if shows are meant to go that long…There was a period where I stopped feeling like an actor and I started feeling like I was just here to do this show.”

>It was an upsetting head space to be in. When it was going to end, I was questioning: maybe I do just exist on this show. What else is there? Am I an actor? I was definitely having a lot of doubt when I was finishing ‘Shameless.'”

White on playing Carmy in The Bear:

>“I think that [self-doubt] was something Carmy was really struggling with, too. We kind of found each other at a similar place. He knew he’s really gifted at this thing, but he could be painfully insecure about his abilities as well. I was feeling a little insecure at the end, too.”

>“I think I was too concerned with what other people might think, [but] I also knew that if I said no to this, that whoever ended up doing it, I would hate them forever. So there was some spiteful stuff going on, too.”"
Shameless,"I've never watched Shameless but just binged The Bear and absolutely loved it. As a 31 year old chef who went from fine dining to hole-in-the-walls myself, I related strongly to his character and thought his acting was fantastic. I think I may start Shameless now because of him. Always heard good things just never was on my radar until now."
Shameless,"He's a great actor. And if he's not cast as the lead in a Gene Wilder biopic, then I will riot."
Shameless,"He absolutely crushed it in The Bear, so I do not see a shortage or a typecasting of roles in his future.


There are awards for that tv show around the corner, guaranteed."
Shameless,"Jeremy is the kind of actor that you could watch something exclusively for his performance and intensity of that character. 
Hope he sees this or hears something similar through his circles, if not I’m sure he already has.

I don’t think there’s many actors I say that about today."
Shameless,"He was the best actor on Shameless and had the most interesting story line. 

The Bear is one of my favorite shows...the best one this year by far in my opinion. I am not a chef but I have a friend that is a chef and I got him to watch it. He told me there were multiple parts where he nearly had a panic attack because of how real this show is and how stressful it is. he also said it was amazing."
Shameless,The Bear is so so GOOD! He was made for the role of Carmy! I can't wait for S2!
Shameless,"The Bear is fucking awesome, go watch it right now!"
Shameless,Shameless was on absolute fire for five or so years there. But the season seven finale clearly should’ve been the send off. It’s such a shame that Showtime ran that one into the ground.
Shameless,I get what he is saying but 10 years of solid work is nothing to scoff at either
Shameless,"Honestly he's one of my favourite actors ever. It's just a weird thing to think of when you've only ever known them for one role but he was just so good as Lip. I'm so happy he's found this new show and that he's surrounded by other amazing performances and filmmakers because The Bear is stunning, and really reassures me that he's truly one of the greats of his generation and now people don't have the barrier of watching an 11 season show to experience his greatness"
Shameless,"There’s a one shot, close up monologue later on in the season that he just nails."
Shameless,"I bumped into him at a baseball game the other day and almost instinctively said “Hey Lip” but stopped myself. Glad I didn’t say it, lol. He was with his family so I didn’t bother him. 

Ironically I had just started “The Bear” and went home and finished it over the next few days. Good show!"
Shameless,Being 29Yo I absolutely love the show shameless and loved lip’s character. The show will always be one of my favorites of all time.
Shameless,"I want to see Jeremy Allen White start to do some cool period pieces. He has such a great, unique face and I feel like he could really excel playing people from the late 19th century or early 20th century. He's got the tough guy act down, but throw him in a 1920s gangster flick and he's golden. He looks so old-timey. People don't really look like that anymore."
Shameless,"Dude, go watch The Bear.  Just binged it on Hulu.  Absolutely fantastic.  He should feel like an actor after his performance in that show because he murdered it.  Looking forward to Season 2."
Shameless,"I thought Lips character arc in Shameless was just straight up lazy writing. I thought they were going to open up a lot of creative directions in the show by leaning in on Lips prowess in robotics and engineering but they just settled for his character foregoing all the economic freedom that would come from that just to struggle to... raise a baby? Yea, right. Don't get me wrong there's nothing wrong with choosing to be a dad but if it's creatively boring...it's creatively boring. And I thought Lips storyline was just that."
Shameless,"Maybe he should find completely new roles. I mean, he is still in Chicago and the Bear character is kind of fucked up and similar as Lip."
Shameless,"The Bear is 11/10 - phenomenal 

I loved him in Movie 43 - other than Hugh Jackman with testicles in his neck - Jeremy getting hazed by his parents with a dead look in his eyes is comedic GOLD"
Shameless,Joan cusack was the best character next to V & kev
Shameless,I'm hearing tremendous things about his show on FX The Bear
Shameless,We could have all had ‘Shameless’ end about 3 seasons before it did.   The last episodes were painful.  Should have ended when the oldest daughter left for good.
Shameless,"True story, I opened the door for this guy at the reception for James Beard Awards last month."
Shameless,"I’m definitely going to watch the new show. But I love shameless, and his character Lip."
Shameless,"His sex scene in college nearly got me thrown off a United airlines flight (the stewardess didn’t believe that I was watching it on the United in-flight streaming app!).  
  
Thanks a lot for going to college, Lip."
Shameless,WATCH THE BEAR
Shameless,He is crushing it in the Bear. Amazing show
Shameless,"Just came here to say that The Bear was some of the best TV I’ve ever watched. Lost interest in Shameless several seasons ago and never finished it. Glad to see Jeremy Allen White not just moving on from Shameless, but knocking one out of the freaking park."
Shameless,I think shameless ruined a lot of stuff for a lot of people
Shameless,I watched the first two episodes of this last night and am already hooked.  It feels fresh and new which is hard to do in TV these days
Shameless,His new show is great.
Shameless,Funny because his character in “the bear”  is not far off from lip
Shameless,The British version felt a lot more grimy and realistic.
Shameless,"He’s great in The Bear. I absolutely love that show, it’s gritty Chicago feel mixed in with food and soul made it an awesome viewing."
Shameless,Put me in an upsetting headspace too after watching it through season 5 or 6. Talk about jumping the shark.
Shameless,I wonder how those from the original British version are feeling about a decade on that show.
Shameless,"I always say this, shows shouldn't last too long it affect the actors and the content in the end."
Shameless,Well dude absolutely fucking KILLED it in “The Bear” AND “Shameless”…….so keep doing whatever that is. Lol
Shameless,Shameless fucked up by not letting his character develop and letting him finish school. Later seasons just became repeat of the same story from the earlier seasons.
Shameless,"Honestly I got tired of seeing Lip catching Ls just to keep him in the series. After the third colossal fuckup to get him to move back I lost interest in the series and just found other stuff to watch. I understand that half of the draw is the self destructive characters, but just let some characters develop all the way for once and let them move on. 

Love Shameless for what I've seen. Maybe I'll go back and watch the remainder eventually"
Shameless,Dude is so compelling. Excellent performance in *The Bear*
Shameless,The Bear character still a troubled Chicagoan but I dig it.
Shameless,"The Bear (Carmy)  is not a huge leap from Lip; but goddamn does he nail that role too. 

Great actor"
Shameless,#CAST THIS MAN TO DO A WOODY GUTHRIE BIOPIC!!!
Shameless,"Lip is such a tragic, complex character. Many times he regressed over and over. Sucks how his story was left off, he deserved better. That is all I can input on his character development."
Shameless,Shameless became a depressing loop after a while.
Shameless,His new show is bloody brilliant!
Shameless,He’s incredible in ‘The Bear’
Shameless,"I feel like that is the fate of most Showtime shows; it goes on for nearly twice as many seasons as it should have and it has some weird ending. Weeds and Shameless come to mind. I didn't watch Dexter but I know there were plenty of upset fans towards the end. I kind of forgot what the ending of Californication was but that got monotonous well before the end. 

And then you have weird shows like SMILF....

I don't have an axe to grind with Showtime but there's a real pattern of having shows go on too long and becoming crap despite being solid shows prior. And then you don't see a lot of the actors from those shows in other projects afterwards."
Shameless,Fantabulous show.
Shameless,10 years of watching Shameless made me feel the same way.
Shameless,Lip and Karen were my favorite characters in the early seasons and after she had the kid and he then went off to college his story should have been done.
Shameless,"As great as his character was, I was pissed that he didn’t get to “make it out of south side”. He seemed like the kind of guy who could hustle and make it anywhere. So much potential yet they turned him into a drunk dropout. Would’ve appreciated his success story"
Shameless,"Then he does The Bear, which is kiiiiinda the same show 😂"
Shameless,"Understandable. Tough portraying a shitty family for a decade, def expect it run off into your personal life after a point"
Shameless,"This show has potential. It just needs to have a ending. Every show tbh. Like a clear beginning, middle, and a clear from the beginning of the show. No deviations."
Shameless,"I’ve never seen Shameless, but this guy is phenomenal in The Bear!"
Shameless,"This is the second actor(idk who,I can’t name names)from this series that has some sort of existential ptsd. What’s the deal?I love Macy so I should watch this?"
Shameless,By season 6 of shameless I was just there for laughs because by then it was clear that they were never going to let anyone on the cast have a fulfilled arc because they didn’t want anyone to leave.
Shameless,The last 4 seasons of that show is simply unoriginal garbage.
Shameless,Yo he was incredible in the bear
Shameless,Acting a character for a decade could certainly brainwash you.
Shameless,It seems like a comfort zone thing. He got really good at playing that role and collecting a steady pay check and that became his identity. And when it was ending he started thinking to himself he wouldn't know how to do anything else. Totally understandable POV
Shameless,Shameless US has an enormous number of seasons for a premium cable network. I’m not surprised he grew tired.
Shameless,Gonna go ahead and file this one under ‘actor problems most can’t relate to’
Shameless,"He got typecast. When I see him, I see Lip, and I think shameless."
Shameless,"> There was a period where I stopped feeling like an actor and I started feeling like I was just here to do this show.”

welcome to having a real job lol"
Shameless,So you did a Chicago based cooking show with the same character?
Shameless,"Show should have been 3 seasons at most, now it’s the Connors but with swearing and sex"
Shameless,I mean I’m sure Ice T don’t feel like a cop.
Shameless,He should go do a summer of roofing and then circle back to this.
Shameless,"I felt the same because that show was on for five years too long and became what I called Poor People Hijinks. 

That show was at its best when it was a drama that had comedic moments cause sometimes dark stuff is funny. But when a lot of it started to feel forced. 

Or how many times can we watch them almost climb out of poverty then do something dumb to mess it all up. 

Emmy forcing their hand w Fiona was the best decision, reminded me of 7th heaven tbh where the writers WONT do something so you gotta just leave and make them sort it out."
Shameless,"10 minutes of watching Shameless left me in an upsetting head space LOL 

Seriously that show is too disturbing, I can’t watch it"
Shameless,10 *episodes* left me in an “upsetting head space”. I can’t imagine what 10 *seasons* did to the actors.
Shameless,"I find this show as a whole unappealing, if not outright insulting, because it's literally millionaire TV execs making carnival attractions out of the actual suffering that people like me go thru for the entertainment of the upper classes— of stupid people like my mother who can see its literally making her childhood into entertainment"
Star Trek,"Just keep SNW and Lower Decks going and I'll be happy.  

I'm glad they're allowing them to do some additional filming to wrap up the series and S5 clearly wasn't the planned ending."
Star Trek,SNW is gonna be the tent pole Trek show it seems. LETS GO!!!
Star Trek,"From three live action Trek show to just the one. Taylor Sheridan is the new cash cow IP that Paramount is betting their future on. 

Be interesting to see if they get a new live action Trek show ready to go for 2025 or if they just cannot afford it and plan to milk just one series and the Trek library and think that will be enough."
Star Trek,"The protagonist in this show always confused me.

They got a really strong actress to play her, but so much of the writing for the character seemed like it was coming from some really awful fan fiction."
Star Trek,"Discovery is my least favorite of the franchise.  I'm a trekie, was really excited for the show, and really wanted to like it.  But I just could get into any of the characters or the plots."
Star Trek,"It’s a mercy killing.

Thank goodness we won’t have to watch Michael Burnham crying again."
Star Trek,"The show's had its ups and downs. S1 and S2 had a lot of great moments and I liked that they tried some different things, even if they didn't always land. S3 & S4 are less offensive (for lack of a better term) to Trek sensibilities but I found the show's gotten really boring. I hope we can have an exciting fifth season.

I wonder where the franchise goes after Picard and this are over. There's hundreds of years they can fill in now, tons of characters they can spinoff or use elsewhere. Hopefully they make good of it and take the right lessons from the less successful shows from this era of Trek."
Star Trek,TIL there are 5 seasons of Star Trek discovery.
Star Trek,"For me, season four is tied with Picard season two for the worst Trek season ever."
Star Trek,Therapy cancelled.
Star Trek,"Only one more season of ""mysterious threat"" while Michael cries about it to go!"
Star Trek,"I can't believe this got 5 seasons.  The first season was bad, but Jason Isaacs carried it a bit.  The second season was dreadful - I couldn't finish it - so either it had a dramatic swing in quality or people just watch anything with star trek on it"
Star Trek,I remember when it was supposed to be an anthology series.
Star Trek,Haven't watched since S2. Glad they're not spending money on it anymore. I'll sign up to watch SNW and Lower Decks.  If they do a 7-of-9 leading Titan show I'd watch that for a bit...  Unsure the current show runners can be trusted with any new shows though.
Star Trek,I’m so angry this lasted longer than enterprise
Star Trek,Good riddance
Star Trek,"It's the worst one, out of all the newer Star Trek shows. Smart move, canceling."
Star Trek,"I wonder what dumb, inane, melodramatic thing will be the center point of season 5?

Will Michaels tears heal a plague or something?"
Star Trek,Thank fuck.
Star Trek,The Pike character was the best thing to come out of this series.. once he was gone it felt like some CW melodrama.
Star Trek,"Im... surprised they got that many seasons. Wow. I like Star Trek so I watched the first season and a bit of the second before deciding it was just too fucking cringe to possibly watch anymore.


Kudos to the trekkies that made it this far I guess."
Star Trek,Maybe giving the space ship emotions meant they ran out of plot ideas
Star Trek,This is good news. Discovery has become terrible and SNW is great. I feared that SNW would be sacrificed for Burnham.
Star Trek,I can't believe that travesty got past season 2.
Star Trek,"Good. Discovery failed because every season it was about something else.  So even though it had lots of good ideas, no one idea could could ever gain it’s footing and flourish. 

And then of course there was all the whining about people’s feelings."
Star Trek,Of all the ST series that I have watched over the last 50 years … STD was by far the biggest disappointment. It will not be missed by me.
Star Trek,"Thank god. Both atrocities (Picard and Discovery) ending. Keep Strange New Worlds and Lower Decks. 

Its too bad theyre committed to this terrible reboot universe or whatever the F it is since theyre still going forward with a Section 31 show i assume. The one thing that should be kept a mystery."
Star Trek,"Keep Prodigy and Lower Decks. Give me Captain Harry Kim. Please, I beg of you."
Star Trek,"The cast and crew are great. 

The acting is great. 

The SFX are great. 

But the writing is anything but. 

Their explanation for what causes The Burn in Season 3 was dreadful. Like I get the angle that Discovery is trying to take but *that* was the best they could come up with?"
Star Trek,are they fucking crying in the thumbnail too?!
Star Trek,"I watched a whole season of this shit without learning what any of the characters' names are, or why I should care about them. ""Because they're on Star Trek"" isn't a good enough reason.

Michael is the main lady, every episode is written around her saving the galaxy by herself again. There's captain Orca, there's Michelle Yeoh, there's the skinny guy. There's the gay guy, and his boyfriend the other gay guy. The redhead is the ""like OMG I'm just so awkward"" character, and there's another whole lady who has robot things on her face. Michael had a boyfriend who was a Klingon in disguise. At some point they added possibly the most boring comedian out there to add... humor? to the show.

I knew more about the crew of the Enterprise after the first episode of Next Generation than I did after a whole season of Discovery."
Star Trek,Am I the only one who thought this show was subpar bordering on hard to watch compared to literally every other Star Trek show ever? Or is something wrong w/me?
Star Trek,Good. This one was never very good.
Star Trek,How many seasons can they save the entire galaxy every single time? Could have been better.
Star Trek,That trash show should have stopped after season 2.
Star Trek,Can anyone who still watches tell me if Michael still cries in every episode
Star Trek,I cant believe this shitshow managed to stay afloat for 5 seasons.
Star Trek,Whew! The Amoxicillin finally kicked in. Took long enough. Don't how much more of that burnham sensation I could stand to take.
Star Trek,"Although I love Trek shows, I'm glad. I'm tired of Burnham crying in every episode over stupid stakes. As long as Strange New Worlds sticks around, I'm happy."
Star Trek,"I just want 10years after Voyager... see what happened in the galaxy post the dominion wars.

It be nice to have an old school 20 season show as well... every single episode doesn't have to have the fate of the universe... 

since Voyager we've had. Enterprise (prequel) Kirk reboot films (prequel) DIsco (prequel) SNW (prequel) and then Picard which was what 30 years into the future, but solely focus's on picard... not so much about the state of things"
Star Trek,"I honestly can't believe this got past S1. The worst trek by far.

Hopefully prodigy survives."
Star Trek,"Thank god, fuck this show."
Star Trek,Paramount bet big on the creator of multiple dead on arrival franchises.
Star Trek,Good riddance!
Star Trek,A truly awful show
Star Trek,Oh thank god it’s finally over
Star Trek,How to fuck did it get too five seasons.
Star Trek,Season 4 **WAS SO BAD**
Star Trek,Good riddance
Star Trek,"I really think that Star Trek needs a minor reset.  They need to make Discovery's future an alternate timeline and advance with the Picard universe.  I am not saying that Picard seasons 1 and 2 were awesome, but you can build off that universe and have some older TNG, DS9, and Voy characters as stars and connect with old Trek fandom, but not worry about the Discovery dilithium disaster."
Star Trek,"give strange new worlds at least as many seasons as this trash was given. lierally the best part of discovery was pike on season 2 as a supporting character, he was so good they built an entire series around him. nothing on discovery works."
Star Trek,"try to watch it, but it was just too bad. RIP"
Star Trek,Frankly this show is probably twice as expensive as SNW but gets less viewers so I'm not surprised. I'm not sure there will be 3 live action shows a year again but they're gonna have more than just SNW. Maybe Seven gets a command (Titan maybe)
Star Trek,Fantastic news.
Star Trek,It should have ended with season 1
Star Trek,"Too much crying for gods sake. Even the thumbnail!


 I still enjoyed S1 a lot though. 
The dillitium plot line was bonkers. .."
Star Trek,Thank god.
Star Trek,"I haven’t hated Discovery, but I’m not disappointed with this.

Keep Lower Decks, Prodigy, and Strange New Worlds and I’m happy."
Star Trek,"Discovery just never found its footing.  It's sad that I've watched 4 seasons, and theres 3 people on the bridge that I cannot remember their names."
Star Trek,"Good, it was not good...."
Star Trek,"I don't hate Discovery, but several of the seasons have been really coasting on auto pilot....not terrible, but not particularly interesting.

Michael Burnham is an insufferably Mary Sue character.  She NEVER does what she's told, always makes decisions WAY above her pay grade, and she always turns out to be right.  

to say it gets old is an understatement"
Star Trek,"I’m a trekker from when I can remember, this is the WORST series ever of Star Trek. It’s just not Star Trek in a Star Trek studios."
Star Trek,"Yup. Called it. They were stupid to give this POS a second season after the first bombed spectacularly, let alone four more. You can forget about those Section 31 and Starfleet Academy spin-offs too because Paramount has finally figured out no one GAF about Kurtzman Trek."
Star Trek,They need to develop a series about Rachel Garrett and the adventures of the USS Enterprise NCC-1701C.
Star Trek,The best Star Trek show is currently The Orville. Hate to say it.
Star Trek,Should have been cancelled 5 seasons earlier
Star Trek,I really wanted to like this show but they tried so hard to imitate the JJ Abrams Trek movies and failed miserably. it was so glaringly obvious.
Star Trek,"I have enjoyed Discovery for the most part, even if most of the internet hates it. It's definitely got it's flaws, I do find Michael a pretty frustrating main character, but it was nice to see them try something different with the Star Trek formula. There were some decent ideas in there, and I do personally prefer the more serialised format, but they didn't really seem to know where they were going with it once they got to >!the future.!<

I did enjoy Strange New Worlds more, but personally I don't like the ""planet-of-the week"" style from old Star Treks as much as an ongoing story arc. I know a lot of people would prefer that all Star Trek sticks to that formula, and SNW vs Discovery does imply that it works. But I think that it's more down to the characters and the writing where one succeeds and the other fails, rather than it entirely being down to the format.

It's a shame to see Star Trek seemingly winding down a bit again, going from 3 shows and a bunch in the pipeline to just 1. It did feel like they might end up oversaturating things a bit with more shows, so it's probably for the best. We'll see if the Section 31 show or anything else pops up to take it's place, but if we just get more Strange New Worlds on a regular basis for a few more seasons, that's fine too. 

Hopefully they can learn from what worked and didn't work in this era of Star Trek shows, and come out with something new. I'd love to see something that continues on the timeline from where Picard finishes off, rather than more prequels, distant futures, and alternate timelines. Perhaps Picard's ending will lead into that, or Discovery will find it's way back to the ""present"" day."
Star Trek,[deleted]
Star Trek,Im suprised that shitshow managed to last that long.
Star Trek,Not much else they can do for Michael other than making her God. Don't know where else she can fail up to at this point.
Star Trek,This shit isn't Star Trek
Star Trek,Burn it and forget it ever happened. Maybe bring Saru into another series but the rest of the story + cast...try to make it all a dream or something.
Star Trek,Yep and I'll never watch it because I refuse to subscribe to yet another streaming service.
Star Trek,Lost its mojo after season 1. Terrible writing.
Star Trek,"I figure that they’re looking at doing some type of continuation of Picard in some form or another and realized there’s not enough in the budget to do that and continue Discovery, a show that has had tepid audience acclaim at best. 

Picard Season 3, Strange New Worlds, Prodigy and Lower Decks have had mass acclaim, so they probably figure money is better spent on those projects."
Star Trek,Thank you
Star Trek,There is a god after all.
Star Trek,Thank god! Will finally be able to take this off the list of shows I have to watch but hate! Hot mess of a show!
Star Trek,"about  2 -1/2 seasons in , you could tell they were out of good writing / ideas.... it went downhill from there.

SNW is far superior , for now."
Star Trek,"Id love to know what the money men reasons for keeping this show alive for 5 seasons was.      

This was the most expensive tv show ever made per episode at release."
Star Trek,"I should have *loved* this show. Instead, I never once connected with it."
Star Trek,5 seasons too many
Star Trek,"I'm a ST fan, but I couldn't become a fan of The Michael Burnham Show. That is not Star Trek."
Star Trek,Thank god. Fuck that show man. I watched the first two seasons and that was 1 1/2 too many.
Star Trek,"I stuck through it till the end of season 3. While it did have a lot of good things, I felt the bad things far outweighed them. It was nice to look at, I enjoyed almost all of the characters, Burnham going through the different time periods in that suit was cool, I liked the idea of the spore drive and theres probably alot more I could think of if I really tried. However, the bad stuff like, changing the Klingons - why change something that wasn't broken, Burnham's constant crying and breaking the rules and not making any fucking sense half the time and so many more things. The straw that broke the camels back for me was after Burnham prevented Stamets from attempting to save his husband, she had the audacity and ignorance to not understand why he was deeply hurt from what she did. Sure, it all worked out but how fucking dense could they make a character. It would have made way more sense if she said ""sorry, I did what I had to"" or something along those lines but to be surprised and upset by Stamets reaction was just too much for me. Fuck what a dumb character."
Star Trek,Thank god
Star Trek,Good riddance.
Star Trek,I appreciate that it directly lead to the current wave of shows.
Star Trek,"I am NOT against diversity and all that at all. But in Discovery it was so badly and over the top implemented i could not continue to watch it.

A five minute unnecessary monolog about removing a ’pimple’ (penis?) of that transgender character was too much and unnecessary. All main cast was power  women while men were weak and clumsy sidekicks.

At the other hand i guess that showcased what TV has looked like from womens perspective in the past. A dated approach nevertheless."
Star Trek,That show was awful. Should have just named in Star Trek : Michael Burnham Saves Everyone Yet Again.
Star Trek,Good riddance. Dire acting and writing!
Star Trek,"Oh no, now do we have to talk about our feelings every freaking decision a bridge officer makes?"
Star Trek,Thank god for that. Even knowing it exists at all makes my life a tiny bit worse.
Star Trek,"4 seasons too late. Should’ve been canceled after the first season. Im hoping all of these nutrek shows just die so they can give the keys to someone who actually cares about trek, like Seth McFarlane. The Orville is the only good trek show on and I’d know he’d respect it if he got to make trek"
Star Trek,"Thank you, it was time for Discovery to die. The only good thing we got from it was SNW."
Star Trek,Honestly surprised it got a season 2
Star Trek,I haven’t watched it and it sounds like I’ve saved time. Is it true they don’t respect the chain of command in this series?
Star Trek,"lol thank the gods. How did it even get to season five. They wasted a lot of supporting talent like good cg, sound, costume, makeup etc on a show with bad cast, bad acting, generally poor prospects. Captain michael was never gonna happen, show runners. You morons still tried to force it happen. And it sucked biiiiig time. 

I loved many things in discovery. Specially good high quality cg and sound and set + modernized look for many alien races. LOts of thought and effort went into these things and I appreciate it a lot thanks."
Star Trek,"Discovery not being renewed? Can I get a hallelujah?!! let’s get the Kleenex ready for Michael! Honestly it was so painful to watch. It’s the only Star Trek I’ve not finished, it’s just too painful to watch all the tears, allllllll the time! And some of the characters, deaf god!"
Rake,People got mad at me for WORDS I said!
Rake,"The fact that she has to go on a media tour to clear the air despite not even being named the permanent host yet, all while *Ken Jennings is literally right in front of them*, is really telling about Sony's pathetic decision making."
Rake,Mayim Bialik is one of those people that the more info that comes out about her the worse she gets. I would assume it was a PR hit job if she did not constantly seem to do these things to herself.
Rake,"In other words: ""Would you nerds just shut up already and let me make a buck reading these stupid questions?"""
Rake,"Well, from what I’ve heard on here (I don’t watch her episodes), she can’t “blend in” because her presence on the show is a distraction. And that’s before all the kooky anti-vax stuff."
Rake,"If you're upset about Mayim, there's no point in simply complaining about it on Reddit. Let the people at Jeopardy know about it. Their new producer openly asked for people's opinions on how to regain their trust and make the show better:

[Contact form](https://www.jeopardy.com/contact)"
Rake,I don't know anyone who likes Mayim Bialik. They like Amy from Big Bang. Mayim is pretty annoying and preachy and acts like she's owed this gig. I like her less and less each time I hear about her.
Rake,She is a horrible choice. She is a snake oil salesman who brings shame to jeopardy.
Rake,She's anti vaccine and a proud Zionist and she wrote an op-ed in the NYTimes saying women in Hollywood are asking to be sexually harassed because of how they dressed. If she were a man with the same rap sheet they would have never considered her for that job.
Rake,"If her goal is to blend into the podium she is doing an absolutely horrendous job of it.

*Cut to her clapping like a seal during yesterday’s episode*

*Cut to her admonishing the contestants for not knowing Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs*

*Cut to her unnecessarily giggling at every opportunity, humorous or not*"
Rake,"""Can you believe they were criticizing things I said?!"" how deluded can you be?"
Rake,"can she go away ?

big bang theory was shit , blossom was a lifetime ago (and joey lawrence made that show popular)- where is the demand to see her coming from?"
Rake,Take a hint.
Rake,"I think the problem is. Her persona was created to seem like the smart girl trope.  Which is fine. But then she erased all that by saying really uneducated ideas and ruined it.  

On jeopardy. She’s awkward. She shows her lack of confidence and it’s not enjoyable to watch with her hosting.  She’ll kill that show if they don’t cut her loose immediately."
Rake,“I said somethings that are wrong and people criticized me for that. I don’t think that should be the case!”
Rake,"There's a lot of reasons to outside of Jeopardy to not like her and if you want to, I want stop you. But for me I simply can't get past the surface level of, she's just not that great of a host. There's plenty of people I did like that I had to say, this isn't for them. And more importantly, Ken Jennings is better, way better. He was better than anyone else who guest hosted, when he hosts it just feels like Jeopardy. And it makes sense, considering his win streak, the amount of times he's come back, the times he's hosted, outside of Alex Trebek and Art Flemming does anyone have more on camera experience with Jeopardy?"
Rake,"Shut up, Blossom."
Rake,"I saw a Jeopardy commercial the other day, hyping up the college tournament and at the end was Bialik saying into the camera, “hosted by **ME**!” 

For someone just trying to blend, she sure has a funny way of going about it."
Rake,"Don’t care about much else, she’s just bad at hosting jeopardy. Being good at it should be the number one qualification."
Rake,"Man, how sick would it be if someone was already losing in Final Jeopardy, and they didn't know the answer, so they just wrote down ""Who is you'll never be as good as Ken Jennings""

I bet Sony would just flat out refuse to air that episode."
Rake,Literally things that i have said and spoken about
Rake,She also breastfed her sons and slept in their beds til they were about 10. Look it up if you don't believe me
Rake,Honestly the real problem is she's not a good host.  Her personality on the show is off putting. Game show hosts should feel warm and she feels like an extremely judgmental person.
Rake,why do they insist on keeping her? Nobody likes her. She must  have relatives in high places at that network
Rake,She’s not a good host. Couldn’t watch any of her episodes last week.
Rake,Looks like she let herself go in the thumbnail pic
Rake,"It’s been a while since I’ve seen a picture of her, but she really let herself go after Big Bang."
Rake,"me to me rn—stoned, scrolling too fast and with this photo: “wow, mayim bialik has really let herself go”"
Rake,I looked into a lot of the stuff she supposedly said and it confirmed my suspicions that a few out-of-context quotes were being blown out of proportion. She and Ken both do a fine job as hosts and all the drama surrounding them is more about the dumb times in which we're living than them.
Rake,"Not a Mayim Bialik fan, but I read The Rolling Stones article and it seems her biggest vice is simply political incorrectness. I don’t agree with many of her views either, and at the end of the day she is quoting her own lifestyle preferences, and it’s unfortunate that she is getting so much hate for that"
Rake,Oh good I was afraid Joe Rogan completely knocked this out of the news cycle 🙄
Rake,"And the actions I do. 

(Look up her parenting advice )"
Rake,"“I should never be accountable for things I said in the past or wrote in my parenting books because I am an actual neuroscientist so take that critics” 

*Sarcasm, in case it’s not clear in my very bad imagining of Mayim’s thought process"
Rake,"About how it's cool for kids to grow up without grandparents because I got my vaccine info from someone other than a doctor.

I am so special I demand human sacrifice."
Rake,Like blaming sexual abuse victims for being too pretty.
Rake,"She said, getting mad over words they said about her."
Rake,Or is this genius marketing because more people are paying attention to jeapordy for the wrong reasons because of this drama?
Rake,It's really starting to feel like Sony signed her to a contract they can't afford to buy out.
Rake,"Ken Jennings was great as a contestant,
Ken Jennings sucks as Jeopardy host."
Rake,"She's getting paid to promote some snake oil right now too, see her on a ""brain enhancement"" drug commercial all the time."
Rake,"""Just let me read the clues"" part 2

Edit: For the uninitiated, yes, she actually said this

https://www.yahoo.com/video/mayim-bialik-reacts-to-drama-surrounding-jeopardy-just-let-me-read-the-clues-074328805.html"
Rake,[deleted]
Rake,All of her off-the-cuff remarks are stilted and awkward and it's not getting any better. Ken is quick witted enough to make that work but she just can't do it convincingly.
Rake,"I refuse to watch any of her episodes, but I started up the Jeopardy Alexa game thing the other day, and they got rid of the old Alex recording and now it's Mayim instead and even THAT was awful. The host pretty much just says ""welcome back, we've missed you!"" and asks if you want to subscribe to the full Jeopardy, and even THAT was hard to listen to from her."
Rake,I never write to TV shows but this time I will. I can't stand seeing Trebek's legacy shit on like this.
Rake,I never watched TBBT and I’m disappointed Blossom turned out this way.
Rake,"> They like Amy from Big Bang. 

I always felt like her introduction to the show started the decline. Her character is annoying as fuck."
Rake,I can’t even watch episodes of The Big Bang Theory anymore…knowing who she is completely ruins it for b me.
Rake,"All of that is 100% true, and ought to disqualify her from Jeopardy right off the bat. But if you ""give her a chance"" and just watch her host an episode of Jeopardy...she's totally bad at it, too. No rhythm, no connection with the contestants, bad reading skills, acts like she's surprised when a daily double is unveiled, and has even been caught laughing out loud when the contestants don't know the answer (and don't get me wrong on the last one: Art Fleming, Alex Trebek, and Ken Jennings have all been AMUSED when contestants don't know answers...but Mayim Bialik actually vocally chuckles where the mic can pick it up, which can't be fun for the three guests playing the game at the moment).  She's just not good at this. Period.  

If Sony and ABC want her to host the prime time events so her sitcom star cred can be used to draw prime time ratings, fine with me. I don't really watch the special events too much. But just put Ken in place for the regular daytime show's hosting duties. He isn't perfect, but then again Alex wasn't perfect in his first year or two (or three) as host. [He was famously criticized](https://redd.it/ozz68j)! But Trebek became the legend over time, and Ken is getting better and learning what not to do after each period of being a host. He'll get there. Mayim? I tried watching one of her shows (again!) this past week. Ugh. I think she's actually worse. She sure isn't improving. She's fine as a sitcom actress. But hosting a gameshow is not the same skills as acting in a sitcom."
Rake,I was a fan of The Big Bang Theory at the time that op-ed was published. She (and that show) never came back from that for me. I hate seeing her host now because she must've really felt strongly that those women deserved it to go out and write that. Truly gross stuff.
Rake,"She also sent money to the IDF - because uh, they don't have enough US tax dollars ?
https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/mayim-bialik-on-why-she-supports-idf-1.5257647"
Rake,You know Cloudy with a chance of meatballs is the ONLy answer she knew. I’m kidding but it did feel that way.
Rake,"yeah, the Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs comment was just like what the fuck - I only guessed it by going ""uhhh, food sounding name, what was that kids movie? cloudy with a chance of meatballs!"""
Rake,"My favorite from last week was when she mispronounced two names and then basically dressed down a contestant for mispronouncing ""Bernstein""."
Rake,Literally just that she’s an actor with a doctorate in a science. That’s it.
Rake,This is my question as well. How did she even get in the running? WHAT is her association with the fucking show??
Rake,that's anybody's guess
Rake,"I think you’re right, she’s worth over $200 million why not retire?"
Rake,It really is like an academic “pick me” chick
Rake,Dude...commas are never going to recover from you. You've murdered them.
Rake,Fuck yeah
Rake,> Portions of this program not affecting the outcome may have been edited
Rake,That would be so awkward. Like when that reporter asked Duncan Jones why he ruined Warcraft.
Rake,"So, Lysa Arryn kinda nutjob?"
Rake,Please don't make me Google Mayim Balik breastfeeding
Rake,"Until they were 4yo you muppet, not 10."
Rake,"One of her son's still wasn't rolling over at 12 months and she refused to have him evaluated because her ""mommy's intuition"" told her he was fine. 

There is something seriously wrong with her."
Rake,"No, her biggest vice is being a subpar host. I'd vastly prefer Aaron Rodgers to her despite his own anti-vax BS. At least his guest run was well-hosted."
Rake,Or how she shills vitamin pills for the brain as a Nero scientist. I bet her university wishes they could recall that degree.
Rake,"One of my former journalism teachers was writing an article on traumatic birth and she spoke with Bialik about it, who believes in natural births. She said, “some people in our community believe if you can’t survive childbirth without medical intervention, you shouldn’t have kids.” She didn’t say she believed it, but heavily implied it. My teacher almost died giving birth, but doctors saved her. Was super traumatic and Bialik‘s words and behavior just made it worse.

ETA: Person below me has the article with the correct quote from Bialik (I was paraphrasing from my memory): *“There are those among us who believe that if the baby can’t survive a home labor, it is OK for it to pass peacefully. I do not subscribe to this, but I know that some feel that… if a baby cannot make it through birth, it is not favored evolutionarily.”*"
Rake,Yea only people who are perfect deserve jobs
Rake,Are the idiots who love stupid click bait gonna watch a trivia show where they can’t answer any of the questions?
Rake,"Despite what most people think, there *is* such a thing as bad publicity. In this case, sure, controversy will give you a short-term bump in viewership. But for a show like Jeopardy its long-term prospects rest squarely with the fans not the ones who came to watch the train-wreck. And the fans have spoken. Loudly. We want Ken Jennings."
Rake,I mean I'm reading the articles but I haven't watched the show in over a decade
Rake,">Or is this genius marketing because more people are paying attention to jeapordy for the wrong reasons because of this drama?

...while actively driving away long time watchers. Doesn't seem like a solid marketing plan to me."
Rake,LOL Sony can afford to buy out anything
Rake,And yet he's a vastly better choice than Bialik who is quite simply a cold off putting host. I can't think of too many worse choices of a personality type for a gameshow host than who she projects herself to be on the show. It is almost as if conservative religious people are the absolute worst.
Rake,"Worked in the neuroscience field a bit.

Neuroscience is a bit like The Force from Star Wars, there is a ""Dark side"". 

There is a whole industry of conmen looking for their shit products to get 'verified'. Neuroscientists that turn to the darkside 'verify' these shit products and get paid big money."
Rake,Because she’s a “neuroscientist”. Excuse me? Really? Seriously? What the fuck? She’s a clown masquerading as a “scientist”. 🤥
Rake,"Lol

“I was the headline on CNN three days in a row,” Bialik said. “Who knew people were so passionate about who hosts Jeopardy”…

Ok…"
Rake,"I mean I agree with her, no one under the age of 50 actually gives a shit about jeopardy, I’m sick of seeing it in the headlines"
Rake,"Considering she admitted that she [never actually watched the show before they chose her](https://old.reddit.com/r/Jeopardy/comments/s29sud/mayim_bialik_sits_with_kelly_clarkson_to_discuss/), I could totally see this being a real exchange."
Rake,"I feel like there's something to the rhythm of her delivery that makes it feel so much like she's just reading the card; the way she always just says ""no"" instead of any variation (not it, incorrect) or empathy (the occasional teeth-sucking, breath, or apologetic ""sorry, no"" goes a long way) makes it feel very stilted and impersonal. Her sitcom delivery of lines that lacks subtlety and only feels a smidge reserved from shouting doesn't help that.

I will qualify that complaint to say that game show hosting - especially trivia - is surprisingly tricky to manage in a way that comes across as natural and tricks kids into thinking you actually know the answers - which Trebeck did. Even Jennings doesn't quite have the conversational timbre and dynamics down the way I think Trebeck did. 

Not saying Byalik won't get better but it definitely doesn't feel like they gave enough tryouts if they wanted to give not-white-men a chance and I agree with the sentiment that Jennings has the cadence of the game down - almost as if he has some experience with it - at a much more practiced level already to the point where regular viewers may be left a bit confused by the back-and-forth hosting."
Rake,I also don’t watch when she’s hosting.  I’m so annoyed that the College tournament is 1. hosted by her and 2. airing in prime time (as Olympic counter programming I would imagine). A friend said “but don’t you want to support those students?” My reply was “Those college kids deserve better.”
Rake,I’ve never watched Jeopardy but I know I’ll be upset if someone incompetent ruins Pat Sajak’s legacy on Wheel of Fortune.
Rake,">I always felt like her introduction to the show started the decline. Her character is annoying as fuck.

I always thought Sheldon could do better."
Rake,"The IDF is strange in that it's a foreign military power that openly recruits and fundraises in the US. 

I remember sitting through a bunch of IDF propaganda and recruiting events in college. It was unsettling, but the food was usually pretty good though."
Rake,">	WHAT is her association with the fucking show??

Nothing. She said she hadn’t even watched it before.  She is an actress trying to act like a host.   You can hear it in her voice. 
To her this is just a job where she just “reads the clues” for a paycheck."
Rake,I think someone at the head of ABC is pushing for it for it. 30 rock plot line irl
Rake,"If you made that much money, that easily, that young, and had no conscience, why would you stop?"
Rake,True
Rake,r/unexpectedEyrie
Rake,"That’s better. Still weird, but probably not the serial killer maker weird if it was 10."
Rake,Does a Nero scientist study the effects of the burning of Rome whilst fiddling?
Rake,"So, if she's a Nero scientist, does it mean she's dead weight?"
Rake,Did your teacher write [this article](https://www.self.com/story/birthing-plan-controversies)? It was cited in Rolling Stone's [profile of Mayim Bialik](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/new-jeopardy-host-mayim-bialik-1216461/) amidst the Mike Richards controversy.
Rake,"The problem with the statement, is that evolution has made it so that nobody has to die during childbirth."
Rake,"Damn, I already didn't like her without knowing she'd said maybe the most ableist thing I've ever heard outside of historical eugenicists."
Rake,"What she actually said is worse. It's very Trumpian. ""Some people are saying this thing... I don't believe it, but lots of people do. Now let me explain in excruciating detail what other nameless people believe."" essentially."
Rake,That’s a lil insensitive. Everyone just wants mother and child to be healthy and safe. How they’re birthed or even how they’re fed (breastfeeding vs formula) shouldn’t be some kind of competition.
Reign,"Where is my Jurassic Park/Westworld cross-over you cowards

**Edit**: Starring George Clooney as Dr. Doug Ross of course."
Reign,My favorite author. Miss him a lot.
Reign,"Jurassic Park, Sphere, Congo...dude had a hot streak. Timeline was meh."
Reign,"Hans Moleman enters the ""Just Crichton and King"" bookstore at the Springfield airport.


Hans: ""Do you have anything by Robert Ludlum?""


Clerk: ""Get out."""
Reign,One of my favorite authors growing up. My favorite book by him is The Great Train Robbery which has an excellent movie adaptation that he directed that features Sean Connery and Donald Sutherland.
Reign,"From the 80’s through the 90’s, John Grisham, Micheal Crichton, and John Hughes were basically each making 1.3 movies a year for a decade plus. 

When people say there are no more original movies. It’s only partly true. There are not that many and these three guys retired."
Reign,"He made me fall in love with books again.  I appreciated that he always did the work to create plausible plot lines based on his understanding of science.  While far out, it could happen — or at least he built a believable case for it.  So many other books I put down because the plots were just nonsense and authors didn’t try explain anything in a way that fed my imagination — but Crichton spoke my language. I couldn’t get enough of his work.
The movies didn’t always translate well, but his books were just amazing. I miss him dearly."
Reign,"He was great until the brain eater got him, state of fear was some of the most anti scientific nonsense I ever had the displeasure to read. Let’s put inaccurate foot notes to make it seem more sensible? And the terrorists are environmentalists!

I guess him being dead, I can safely call state of fear awful, without being concerned that he will insert me as a child rapist in his next novel, unlike what he actually did in “next”

The best thing he did for his legacy is die, if he’d continued writing I suspect his politics would have become so toxic that only the left behind crowd would have touched them."
Reign,For someone who wrote so much science based literature it is so weird that he was a climate change denier
Reign,"Then he kind of went crazy and started jamming his politics into his novels (badly) and everyone was disappointed.  So definitely avoid the end stage stuff, its bad. Like Tom Clancy got some money and nobody to edit him anymore bad."
Reign,Why is this blowing up? This article is almost 6 years old…
Reign,"Everything I read from him was a total thrill and very cinematic, but the anti-science themes and bad science means to his entertaining ends really burned a bunch of holes in mainstream brains."
Reign,Loved his ideas and initial halves of his books. I found after reading some that his endings repeatedly lost something. Not satisfying.
Reign,Crichton seemingly became more anti-science as he got older. State of Fear could have been written by the worst and dullest minds at Fox News.
Reign,I love re-reading his books. Wish they would make “Micro” into film.
Reign,"ITT: People that care more abut Michael Crichton's politics than his contribution to thrilling sci-fi. Man created Jurassic Park, Sphere, Andromeda Strain, Timeline, Congo, etc. etc. Yet his politics are only what matters. You guys are predictably focusing on the wrong thing."
Reign,"Jurassic Park was great.

But never forget that Crichton turned into a total climate change denier with *State of Fear*."
Reign,a fascinating article about a fascinating person. I think he was the first mainstream science fact entertainment content creator. He will influence many generations to come. RIP Michael.
Reign,Re-watching ER as we speak. Truly a masterpiece
Reign,Literally reigned over. The guy was UGE!
Reign,"You could call it...

Jurassic World"
Reign,Too bad Sean Connery isn’t around anymore.
Reign,"An IRL Westworld would just turn into a rape retreat quicker than a ""no censorship"" social media site attracts Nazis and pedos."
Reign,"There’s nothing that hits like a Crichton book. If you’ve read his stuff you’ll instantly recognize the formula, but it still manages to hook me every time"
Reign,He almost certainly would not have aged well if he were still around. He totally would have gotten on board with the alt right.
Reign,"Me too, my friend and I read nearly all his book between 6th-12th grade, and would discuss them regularly and trade ones we'd read.

Incredible writer, and such a unique genre that you don't really get much these days"
Reign,Ms. Himalott*
Reign,I love his books. I've read most of them. They're such great reads.
Reign,And ER on television
Reign,And don’t forget andromeda strain
Reign,13th warrior I think at least follows the story of Eaters of the dead I believe.
Reign,Timeline deserves a better adaptation - could make for a great miniseries if someone got a 2nd shot at it.
Reign,The only way to explain the desastrously terrible *Timeline* is that Crichton was so fed up with screenwriters hacking chunks of meat and brain matter out of his book that he did it himself out of spite. The book reads like a terrible first draft of a screenplay. It’s astonishingly terrible in every aspect.
Reign,"Can't explain why, but Sphere was my favorite"
Reign,I thought Prey was pretty boring too
Reign,Disclosure too
Reign,*”Man getting hit by football.”*
Reign,I will not stand for this Philip K Dick erasure
Reign,"I really like a lot of his books, but the man had some nutty beliefs. You ever read his book Travels? The guy believed in spoon bending, that he could see peoples auras, and that a cactus spoke to him at a meditation retreat. He was always pretty far from being completely scientifically minded."
Reign,"I read *Next* for assigned summer reading before I started my freshman year of college, and during the discussion we had about it during orientation, I directly called Crichton a hypocrite for baselessly fearmongering about genetic engineering right after he accused environmentalists of doing the same about climate change in *State of Fear*.

I shudder to think what Crichton would’ve written if he were alive for the COVID-19 pandemic or the emergence of transgender rights as a serious issue. It’d probably be some conspiracy nonsense about Big Pharma and depopulation schemes that would make even J. K. Rowling say “whoa, slow down there!”"
Reign,Not only that but the article fails to mention his public comments on secondhand smoke. He definitely denied science that went against his personal pleasures. A common thread with smoking and climate change denial.
Reign,"After reading *State of Fear* I realized that at their core, his books are basically neo-Luddite. Entertaining, but basically anti-progress."
Reign,"I’ve only read two Michael Crichton books (both this year) and both of them were the most ridiculous “unscientific” books I’ve ever read. I literally had to look up some of the “facts” the book laid out because they seemed too insane to believe. Turns out they were all fake. 

I just figured that was kind of his thing lol"
Reign,"To be fair, weren't all terrorists in 90s American media environmentalists? When they were not white suburban couples without political affinity, that is."
Reign,"I mean, most of his themes are ""science gone too far."" One of my favorite authors, but hard to look back and not see the pattern."
Reign,"More like climate alarmism skeptic.  When he wrote State of Fear, that shit was at a fever pitch and, much like today, climate change activists were screeching about how every coastal city on Earth would be underwater within a decade if we didn't completely cease the use of fossil fuels right then and there.  Lo and behold, nearly two decades later, after not only not stopping the usage of fossil fuels, but expanding their usage, none of those cities are under water.

He didn't deny climate change, he denied all the ""OMG humanity will literally go extinct if we don't revert to the stone age right now!"" nonsense at the time, which persist to this day."
Reign,"That’s mentioned in the article, and discusses the issue with a fair amount of depth."
Reign,"state of fear wasnt about climate change, it was about environmentalism being turned into a religion"
Reign,"Or ""West Park.""  Which apparently is a real place in Florida.

And if anybody thinks making gunfighter robots fight cloned dinosaurs is a good idea, it would be a Florida Man."
Reign,Or Yul Brynner for that matter.
Reign,"it kinda was like that on the show. well, rape/murder for good measure."
Reign,"After reading all of his recent books I was a bit skeptical to start some of his older books, surely Andromeda Strain (1969) is so old that his style would be different, the science so out of date and boring, but no I instantly recognized Chricton and I really enjoyed reading about the science and how advanced it must have been to read that in 1969 for most common folk."
Reign,"This is why I really try to disassociate actors, athletes, writers and filmmakers from everything outside their own craft. It just leads to disappointment"
Reign,"Based on *state of fear*, I think you may be right."
Reign,"Did you read his book, “Travels?”"
Reign,He was a doctor and a scientist. He certainly would not be on board with AOC and the hard left. I know somebody related to him and she told me the man was amazing.
Reign,"Read the book, then see the movie. Very interesting comparison. I prefer the movie myself, but they're both great."
Reign,Which is Chrichton’s retelling of Beowulf
Reign,"And even then, the movie adaptation was still terrible and sloppy."
Reign,It is pretty bad. I did appreciate one aspect of the story that so many time travel stories tend to avoid: The basic human necessity of modern life aspect. Like how people back then would smell awful to our noses. The food they ate would gross us out. Stuff like that. But the overall story was just poop.
Reign,I was citing a specific time frame. PKD has a lot but they are spread over a lot more time. For instance. Grisham only has 7 movies but six of them were made from 1993-1997 just crazy density in that era.
Reign,That’s one of my favorite books.
Reign,I just read the plot description of Next and it sounds absolutely discombobulated and inane
Reign,Didn't know that about the smoking. It's even more weird because he had a medical degree.
Reign,He was a weirdo but at least his idiosyncratic beliefs were actually his and he wasn’t just an unwitting shill for a larger political movement. I kind of miss that kind of author. Like Robert Anton Wilson or Heinlein.
Reign,Which two did you read?
Reign,The 90s was still mostly Russian bad guys / sprinkling of Middle East bad guys.
Reign,"Well, they were the big baddie of rainbow six.  I think the IRA was heavily featured, Middle East terrorists were still on America's mind as well

Kind of crazy when you think about Oklahoma City bombing, ongoing abortion murders, and how the right wing militia movement was in the process of going off the fucking rails."
Reign,"Crichton said that banning CFCs was a mistake because it withheld cheap refrigerants from 3rd world countries. CFCs have a well documented destructive effect on the ozone layer, which has measurably rebounded since CFCs were banned."
Reign,"This is some seriously tinted glasses that you're looking at the mid-2000s with. While undoubtedly people were saying dumb things about climate change, the push-back and denialism against the science by the political right was incredibly intense and the science back then (you can read the IPCC reports during that era yourself) have largely remained unchanged because it continues to be successfully predictive.

>He didn't deny climate change, he denied all the ""OMG humanity will literally go extinct if we don't revert to the stone age right now!"" nonsense at the time, which persist to this day.

This isn't accurate. Crichton very clearly disagreed with the general consensus of global warming that the scientific community held (and still does). Specifically, he argued that the Antarctica temperature record contradicted the notion of a warming Earth. He also believed that CO2 and global temperatures weren't correlated and instead thought phenomena like the urban heat island effect were to blame for the apparent temperature rises. The dude was invited, and accepted, to testify before Congress on climate change by a Senator who called global warming ""the greatest hoax"" ever perpetuated on the American people.

[Here's a takedown of Crichton's scientific understanding from back in 2005.](https://web.archive.org/web/20090430012139/http://go.ucsusa.org/global_environment/global_warming/page.cfm?pageID=1670) All of those arguments dismantling him still ring true today."
Reign,"Yes, this.  He never said the climate wasn’t changing, his was trying to say that the science at the time was wildly inaccurate and maybe we shouldn’t take drastic actions just yet."
Reign,"The whole thesis of the book is basically that climate change is unproven and/or not a big deal, and instead is being perpetuated as a myth by people for political/economic reasons. Several real-world scientists whose studies were referenced by Crichton in the book have said that the data is presented in a distorted and misleading manner, and that the book is filled with errors and cherry picking.

Fun fact! Crichton's book ""Next"" includes a character named Michael Crowley who is a child rapist (with a small penis), described as a Washington-based political columnist who graduated from Yale. A real person named Micheal Crowley, who actually is a Washington-based political columnist who graduated from Yale, wrote a negative review of State of Fear before Crichton wrote Next. Real classy move on Crichton's part."
Reign,"With footnotes, where studies were cited who’s own authors were say were mischaracterized. He was a climate change denier, and denied the effects of smoking. (Shocker he was a smoker)

He was a great author, but like a lot of people who were great in a field he decided he must be great in all fields, and it made him incapable of changing his mind. Look what he did to his critic. It’s crazy."
Reign,Here's another one now.
Reign,"Ot better yet, ""South Park"" - a place where Cartmans rule the world"
Reign,"I wouldn’t be able to enjoy Wagner, Kanye, chrichton, Frank Herbert, and many other artists if I didn’t consume work from people with bad traits."
Reign,Before I started reading Dune I learned that frank Herbert was a raging homophobe. Makes reading it way less enjoyable. I'm still not through.
Reign,Kinda hard when it's an author/screenwriter who is weaving in climate change as a left wing eco terror plot to destroy capitalism into his work.
Reign,"Not just State of Fear. All of his ""science"" based books are essentially anti-progress i.e. Jurassic Park. Rising Sun was him encouraging the US to wage an economic war with Japan. Disclosure was about a man being assaulted by his female boss who then accused him of assault and had no one believe him, long before ""cancel-culture"" and ""mensrights"" were what they are today. And he also publicly denied that second hand smoke could cause cancer."
Reign,I never saw the movie but I liked the book
Reign,You see they finished the second book for him?
Reign,"And came about because his friend said Beowulf was boring, and Chrichton bet he could make it interesting."
Reign,yep
Reign,"Don’t forget too, the fact that medieval people wouldn’t speak modern English"
Reign,"Here’s a link to one of his comments:

https://youtu.be/aGoZ-b1OaW4

I’ve never seen this about secondhand smoke. I can see why the EPA did what they did. It seems fairly impossible to me to conduct a long study of only secondhand smoke to get the results he seems to be looking for. 

Also, not all secondhand smoke is created equal. There’s a big difference between being in a room with someone who smokes a cigarette, and being in a pool hall or bar that’s filled with people smoking. When I was in college, I used to go out to these places and even though I never smoked, I would still come home reeking from cigarette smoke. You can’t tell me that doesn’t have some sort of affect on the lungs."
Reign,didn't doctors prop up the tobacco industry for decades?
Reign,"Sphere and Jurassic Park. Two of his most widely celebrated books lol.

I understand why people love them, but they were not for me. I especially hated Sphere."
Reign,"And? That's not a climate change denial argument, that's a lesser of two evils/utilitarian argument.  And one that is generally accepted by the entire international order (not for CFCs in particular, but pollution in general)... Along the lines of it being unfair for post-industrial western nations to hold developing nations to the same pollution reduction standards because those post-industrial western nations already had their own dirty pollution fueled industrialization phases that propelled them to post-industrial wealth/status."
Reign,"Admittedly, Most people who died in 1986 would be raging homophobes by our standards. Not excusing it or anything but I’m not shocked when I hear anybody of that era was gross."
Reign,"Oof, did not know this. Will still do my annual re-read of the Dune series though."
Reign,"I think his books aren't anti-progress like Jurassic Park, Timeline, etc.

Shockingly a lot of his books are more inherently anti-capitalist.

But yeah. Hed definitely be on board with the rest of the alt right. It's super weird that so many of his books have anticapitalist and anti-corporate sentiment considering"
Reign,"> And he also publicly denied that second hand smoke could cause cancer.

Something tells me a lot of the anti-covid stuff won't age well, historically speaking."
Reign,"I gotta disagree. I think a much bigger point in Rising Sun is something many westerners refuse to acknowledge: People in other cultures don’t think like and aren’t repressed Westerners. Westerners seem to think people from other cultures are all just like them with cosmetic differences. They aren’t. There are cultures that are fundamentally different down to how they think. I used to do some Judo/Jiu-Jitsu competitions and I noticed a Chinese team cheated. They sandbagged and lied about the credentials of their competitors. 

A Chinese dude on my team explained it to me that, in a lot of Chinese culture, it’s more important to get over and win than to play fair. So cheating is encouraged. It’s better to cheat and win. Where as, in the West, when we find out someone cheated to win, we lose respect for them. When he explained it to me, I was like “that’s such bullshit…” but I realized he was right. The Chinese cultural mindset was that different. Westerners can’t comprehend that other people’s cultural firmware is different. We think, if they learn our “better way”, they will adopt it. But that’s arrogance. We all have things in common but there are distinct differences that are cultural and hardwired and that was a big part of Rising Sun. As was the Western inability to grasp that people in other cultures think fundamentally differently."
Reign,"heh I had to read the old english version in my AP english class and like sure, the story is fine, but getting all the detail when you can only understand every 5th word was a pain.

Like Canterbury tales is funny once you know what's going on, good luck getting there."
Reign,"I used to run security in an after hours club, and me and my coworkers would comment how we would literally blow out black snot after our shift."
Reign,my husband had hemangioma when i worked at dave and busters decades ago. i would come home saturated in smoke. i had to quit because it fucked with him terribly every night as if i was personally smoking the cigs in our house.
Reign,"Ian Malcolm is one of the most annoying, self righteous, idiotic characters ever created. If you plucked him out of Jurassic Park, the book improves substantially. On my rereads I just skip his rants."
Reign,"(Edit, I see you deleted your 2nd paragraph talking about vaccines and refrigeration, so this first bit is now redundant) 

The lack of refrigeration isn't due to CFCs having been banned. CFCs have long since been replaced by HCFCs and HFCs, which are much less destructive to the ozone layer (while still being potent greenhouse gasses). The issue for vaccine storage is the relative lack of refrigeration equipment capable of maintaining a stable -50C to -15C temperature range (in the case of the Moderna vaccine), especially for mobile transport. Not to mention unstable power grids rendering refrigerators unreliable even when communities have access to the right equipment. The issue is not a lack of chemical refrigerants.

Back to State of Fear - it's frankly full of climate denier talking points that were easily debunked even in 2005 when the book was published. For example, one character refers to Dr. James Hansen's Congressional testimony in 1988 on climate change, claiming that Hansen was ""off by 300%."" In reality, Hansen presented 3 different simulations based on different assumptions around future human emissions and volcanic activity. One of those simulations (Line B) came very close to predicting what actually happened, and this was the scenario described by Hansen as being the most probable. When Patrick Michaels gave testimony 10 years later, he omitted Hansen's lines B and C, presenting Line A as Hansen's only prediction so he could claim it was off by 300%. This was repeated by Crichton in the novel.

Much of the observed warming is written off in State of Fear as being attributable to the urban heat island effect - e.g., the temperatures at weather stations were observed to rise because the weather stations are in cities, which exhibit local warming. This had already been largely debunked in 2005. Ocean water temperatures have been rising for most of the last century, and most land glaciers around the world are melting despite being far from urban centers.

Crichton presents lots of graphs showing cooling trends in specific locations. But no one has ever suggested that global warming means the entire surface of the Earth is warming uniformly, or that it is impossible for specific localities to exhibit cooling. There is no question that the average global temperature is increasing.

Crichton also compares the study of climate change to the historical study of eugenics.

He has a point that some in the media are overly alarmist when it comes to climate change (although I defy you to find anyone with a shred of credibility claiming that literally every coastal city on Earth would be underwater in a decade). That doesn't make State of Fear any less full of blatant nonsense."
Reign,Seamus Haney did a good version of Beowulf.
Reign,Is he different in the book compared to the movie?
Peep Show,It gets so good
Peep Show,Yes.
Peep Show,Yes. One of the funniest shows ever made
Peep Show,"It's my favorite show. The first person POV is less jarring after the first season. It's still all in first person, but it doesn't feel as much like a Go Pro in the later seasons."
Peep Show,"“Mark, if I can just get rid of the dog corpse, there’s a chance I still might get laid here.”"
Peep Show,"It's worth multiple watches. The show is an incredible recipe of cast and material,  but the secret ingredient is crime."
Peep Show,It‘s really moreish
Peep Show,People like Coldplay and voted for the Nazis.  You can’t trust people.
Peep Show,Unquestionably yes.
Peep Show,It's hard to imagine a comedy show that's **more** worth watching
Peep Show,Yes.
Peep Show,"No *Peep Show*, Jeremy? None!? That's insane!"
Peep Show,"It is, with no hyperbole intended, one of the funniest shows ever made."
Peep Show,"Peep Show is fantastic, def worth watching."
Peep Show,"Well, it does start off weak and gets better (like most shows). That being said, the first episode is accurately indicative of the overall tone and content.

I love Peep Show and i think its one of the greatest sitcoms of all time, but its not for everyone. The other shows you mentioned have more of an ""over-the-top,"" style of british comedy, where as peep show is more realistic, subtle, and relies on stereotypical English cynicism and a very self deprecating tone.

I would stick with it for a few more episodes but it won't take too long to find out whether its for you or not. It doesn't change dramatically from its first season"
Peep Show,"If you don’t laugh your ass off from the drop, I don’t want to talk to you.  It’s one of the best shows ever created."
Peep Show,"“I’ve got a fucking grass skirt, a grass skirt made of dicks”

Still one of the funniest lines in television history"
Peep Show,I've seen the hurt locker mate and you don't want to go in there. Super Hans is one of the best characters ever.
Peep Show,"Endlessly quotable, incredible characters, incredible performances, unique way for a show to be shot, some of the best comedy writing of all time.

Yes. Everyone should watch Peep Show."
Peep Show,Way funny
Peep Show,I got about a season in and didn't llke it so I stopped. My friends love it but it's just too uncomfortable/awkward for me to find enjoyment in it. Everyone has different tastes!
Peep Show,"It's worth it.  It's fun, it's light, and now I'm thinking of all the quotes.  I'm an american and have not met many others that have even heard of it.  I wish more people watched it."
Peep Show,Is water worth drinking?
Peep Show,Best comedy series of all time in my opinion
Peep Show,It's my favorite show of all time
Peep Show,"Their gunna use me for a sex game, and burn me in the bath."
Peep Show,"Yes x a million. Relatable af decade after and I think about it all the time.

Mitchell and webb look too!"
Peep Show,"One of my favorite shows of all time. It can take a few episodes to adjust to the 1st person perspective, but it's totally worth it. I've never experienced anything like it. You have two main characters that play off each other perfectly, cringy but hilarious inner thoughts to accompany what is actually being said, and some of the most quotable lines."
Peep Show,Hell yeah. Peep Show is fantastic and in some ways relatable but in absurd ways. David Mitchell is absolutely brilliant and his work with Webb here is awesome. Peep Show was so easy to binge.
Peep Show,"Yes. Brilliant show, right to the very end."
Peep Show,"Just by mentioning Peep Show, you’ve attracted all the die hard fans like me that think it is the best comedy show ever made. 

As a counter, some people find it hard to watch because of intense levels of cringe, but if you like FND and Inbetweeners, you should be good lol"
Peep Show,"Dear god, yes."
Peep Show,Peep show is the greatest British sitcom of the last two decades. Friday night dinner wouldn’t make it in the top ten.
Peep Show,I've watched it so many times I swear my internal monologue is just Mark Corrigan at this point.
Peep Show,It's so awkward but definitely worth it
Peep Show,"spaced!

i loved peep show when i first encountered it way back when. but it is cringy humor which isnt to everyones taste. give it a chance though."
Peep Show,"It's my favourite sitcom ever, it only has 2 or 3 episodes that aren't on par with the rest of the series, but outside of that it's the funniest sitcom ever for me."
Peep Show,"Obviously it's not really delicious like hot chocolate or coke, but for a TV show... brilliant."
Peep Show,Pardon my French but fucking yes
Peep Show,"Not sure how one could not like the first episode.  It is amazing.  My vote is yes, but you’ll need to decide I guess"
Peep Show,"I didn't care for the first few episodes the first time I watched them but I was hooked by the first episode with the character Alan Johnson (episode 4 I think). Now that I've seen the whole series all the way thru multiple times, I appreciate the early episodes more and especially the first episode since you can see how different it is compared to where the show ended up. One of the best comedies ever imo."
Peep Show,It’s deliciously rich and creamy.
Peep Show,"Yes, it gets better, by season 2 it has legs."
Peep Show,One of the best comedies ever made so yes.
Peep Show,"Peep Show is one of the greatest situation comedies ever made, period. Yes, it's worth a watch. It's one of the few shows I will rewatch repeatedly. 

Like a lot of shows, I enjoy season one but I felt it hit its stride and figured out its formula as it went on. Personally, I think of seasons 3 and 4 as the absolute peak stretch of the show- From the start of season 3 to the end of season 4 is a non-stop roll of banger episodes, some of the most classic moments and stories, to me."
Peep Show,"The low production quality and camera angles are a bit of a turnoff initially, but the writing is brilliant.  Stick with it!"
Peep Show,"I like it but it’s not one of my favourites. If you didn’t click with it then that’s fine, we all like different stuff! 

Recommendations for similar shows to the ones you’ve mentioned ; IT Crowd, Green Wing, Alan Partridge, Stath Lets Flats, Black Books, Fresh Meat, to name a few"
Peep Show,Yes! Just went to do a rewatch and could not find it.
Peep Show,I rank it 5th best sitcom ever
Peep Show,"Watch season 9 episode 3 (Threeism). It's probably the best peep show episode and so if you don't like it you won't like the rest. Also, if you don't like it maybe television just isn't for you."
Peep Show,"Peep Show you either love the humor or can't stand it.  

I can't stand it.  You might love it."
Peep Show,"Yes, you do not need to watch Peep Show in any particular order as they do not follow a storyline. Peep show is absolutely brilliant."
Peep Show,"Depends on the person of course. I gave up after about a season and a half, since I could tell it wasn't my type of show. Just couldn't stand the characters,"
Peep Show,"I like it for the awkward main character in the same way I like Curb Your Enthusiasm. Not sure if Peep Show aged well, I still repeat lines from the show!"
Peep Show,"It gets very good. David Mitchell is a genius.

It has one of the best sketches ever - they play a couple of SS officers standing around chatting and DM says, ""Are we the baddies? I mean, look at the skull on our hats."" It's so funny."
Peep Show,1st seasons are always a bit rough..
Peep Show,"First time I watched it I watched a couple of episodes and couldn't get into it.

Tried again and powered through and loved it by the end. Have watched it all again since with my girlfriend and loved it still, and found even the earlier episodes I know I didn't like initially fun too"
Peep Show,"i wouldnt judge a show on the first episode. At least watch the 1st season, it's only like 6 episodes and hilarious."
Peep Show,"Its vastly different in terms of comedic style to all those shows youve mentioned, but its my second favourite tv show of all time right after IASIP.

I find it far more like a British IASIP than anything else.

Watch the first season.  If you still dont like it, you have bad taste.  But thats ok."
Peep Show,Yes.
Peep Show,Its amazing
Peep Show,Absolutely!
Peep Show,Without even giving a second’s thought.
Peep Show,"Peep show has multiple episodes that keep me cracking up throughout them, and some that aren’t necessarily worth the rewatch. Overall it is a great show though."
Peep Show,Absolutely yes!
Peep Show,I think episode 2 is one of the best tbh
Peep Show,"Love David Mitchell, didnt care for Peep show. QI, gimme more of that"
Peep Show,Not my cup of tea. It's quite bleak and depressing.
Peep Show,"I believe with the first season, they actually filmed some scenes with cameras attached to the actors heads, which made for low quality shots. After they only used proper cameras. It definitely gets better."
Peep Show,100 percent. If you love dry early 2000’s humor it definitely gets better
Peep Show,"It gets better, I'd also throw white gold and brassic in the mix if peep show doesn't scratch that itch."
Peep Show,"It’s worth a dozen watches imo, best show ever."
Peep Show,Absolutely
Peep Show,I recommend stopping after the 60th rewatch.
Peep Show,100% - They really find their footing like late season 2/start of season 3.  Season one gets better too.  The series is one of my favorites and I've re-watched 3 times.
Peep Show,I for one loved it. First ep is really just introducing the characters more than anything. The very next episode it shows signs of picking up steam and the first four seasons are absolutely classic. And the back half is still pretty funny also.
Peep Show,"It took me a couple tries to get trough the first episode, but once I did it became one of my favorite shows."
Peep Show,"Yes.  Its easily one of best comedies this century and id say ever.

Brilliantly written and acted and very unique.  Great characters ...

Who knows maybe you dont like it but its genuinely one of the best comedies ever and worth giving another shot.

Id say give it to the Jez interview episode a few episodes in.  That is the episode where i fell in love with it."
Peep Show,Chance would be a fine thing
Peep Show,"It is a an amazing show. 
That said there are parts that make you super uncomfortable and awkward. The fact it’s first person perspective I think adds to this"
Peep Show,Yes yes and yes
Peep Show,Easily one of the best comedies ever. Absolutely worth the watch.
Peep Show,"Peep Show is easily one of the greatest comedies ever made. I love Friday Night Dinner, but will pick Peep Show over it any time."
Peep Show,It's a great show if you're a pedophobe.
Peep Show,"Peep show is one of the funniest shows ever made, so yeh"
Peep Show,I loved the concept but couldn’t handle ten minutes of the show. It was too jarring. I assume it’s well written because I love the company of people involved. Couldn’t deal with the peepness.
Peep Show,Yes.
Peep Show,I will say it’s a hilarious show that sometimes creates a powerful sense of dread
Peep Show,"Yes - it’s great 
(Also Check out Ghosts, it’s egg-cellent)"
Peep Show,YES
Peep Show,Am I really alone in thinking even the pilot itself was an instant classic? “Oh right. I see. I get it. You were lampooning me. It was a simple lampoon.”
Peep Show,"Moreish, even."
Peep Show,The secret ingredient is crime.
Peep Show,"Peep show is my favorite series of all time. Brilliantly written, genuinely one of the funniest comedies of all time IMO. It’s only matched by Seinfeld/Curb/IASIP.

The lower production value makes it aged a bit more poorly than those others, but I think the actual comedy has aged better than any of them (despite being an American, so I can’t relate with some things)

I guess the best way for me to describe the comedy of it would be that usually shows based on cringe comedy (like The Office, for example) would have a scenario like this:

Character A is interviewing for a job and pretends to have a mental handicap for whatever reason. The comedy would be in the awkwardness of the perspective of the interviewer.

In Peep show, the same scenario would also insert Character B into the interview as a someone who directly vouched for Character A. The comedy of this scenario would come from Character B trying to carefully juggle controlling Character A and diffuse the situation. He’s got a vested interest in this because he directly vouched for Character A, and there’s no right way to play the situation because no matter what he does he either comes off as untrustworthy or an asshole to his own boss. 

I guess that’s a long winded way of saying that although it’s a “cringe comedy” it’s quite a bit more dynamic usually than most others. Characters often find themselves in unwinnable situations."
Peep Show,The opening song is also much better season 2 onwards
Peep Show,"It’s actually mostly shot in the second person, that is from the perspective of a person looking at the main character of the scene. There are some first person shots too, when you can usually hear the characters internal monologue."
Peep Show,"""There are many things I would do for Jeremy, but digging a hole in the wintery earth with my bare hands so you can bury the corpse of a dog you killed is *not* one of them"""
Peep Show,But you love crack! Crack’s your favourite.
Peep Show,"YOU FUCKING IDIOT JEREMY, YOU TOTAL FUCKING IDIOT. THAT WAS YOUR JOB, YOU FUCKING MORON. YOU CRETIN. YOU'RE A FUCKHEAD, THATS WHAT YOU ARE, A FUCKING SHITHEAD"
Peep Show,I think Series 1-4 are the peak of the show. Goes down a bit after that imo.
Psycho-Pass,[deleted]
Psycho-Pass,"Well, it's only one episode in, so it's hard to really get a sense of the season as a whole. The episode was a pretty solid start to the season, though there remains the potential for it to end up repeating the villain's motives from the first season.

I enjoyed the first season for the most part. What did you find lacking about that twist?

Akane can be a bit annoying at the start, but she grows over the course of the first season, and you kinda see that in the first episode of the second season."
Psycho-Pass,Shame you didn’t give each episode a rating 
Psycho-Pass,Go outside
Psycho-Pass,"I watched 53 tv shows last year here they are

The Office

Friends

Parks and Rec 

How I Met Your Mother

The Office

Friends 

Parks and rec 

...and so on and so forth. A viscous cycle of rewatching the same shows over and over"
Psycho-Pass,Check out wilfred on fx. And Californication. Seems like something  you might like.
Psycho-Pass,You should watch Daredevil.
Psycho-Pass,"I did 200+

*maybe this could serve as a suggestion for shows*"
Psycho-Pass,"So you posted a list? OK, I guess. Who cares? "
Psycho-Pass,And no Fargo? Come on man 
Psycho-Pass,Use trakt.tv dude
Psycho-Pass,Cool! What Doctor Who episodes did you watch?
Psycho-Pass,Why didn’t you watch season 3 of Better Call Saul? That’s literally the best season
Psycho-Pass,"Yes. What's the point of this other than to say ""look how little of a social life I have. I can knock out show a week""! "
Psycho-Pass,Damn boy
Psycho-Pass,"You and I could definitely watch low profile TV shows together. Ink Master *and* Trixie/Katya! Cool.

Curious how the Trakt totals work -- did you watch the entire Honeymoon Special three separate times, or did it take you three tries to finish?"
Psycho-Pass,yeah for some reason this didn't come out as a list. it looks really poor. 
Psycho-Pass,thanks.
Psycho-Pass,"Maybe it’s just me, but having so many 9/10 and 10/10 shows doesn’t really make sense as a rating system for helping others with suggestions.. Plus you rated nothing as a 6/10 or below. I don’t think everything has to be a Bell Curve or anything, but there has to be some separation/distinction."
Psycho-Pass,Idk it was just fun keeping track of it all.
Psycho-Pass,I've seen the first 2 seasons.
Psycho-Pass,really? OK then I'll watch it. I wasn't really that into the first 2 seasons. I loved BB though.
Psycho-Pass,"thanks, for the full list and to browse more my data, go here: https://trakt.tv/users/philrivers/history/shows/added?days=365&start_at=2017-06-23"
Psycho-Pass,"Honeymoon special on Netflix is split into three parts so I used the tv show data that listed it in three parts instead of the movie entry as one 90minute piece.  
  
"
Psycho-Pass,Love ink master. Some amazing art is.made on that show. 
Psycho-Pass,"Well, I thought it was telling.  I try only to watch good series.  Theres so much content out there that I dont commit my time watching a whole season if it's a 6.  You can compare simply!  By taking a show you've seen and looking at how I thought about it and what shows here I watched and the type.  Imo I thought I was helping someone who would be looking for a good series to watch.  For e.g. community is listed s1-3 10/10 seas4-6 7/10 that's helpful imo.  Thanks for the feedback I'm sorry it didnt help you."
Psycho-Pass,what did you use for tracking?
Psycho-Pass,Season 3 is great. 
Psycho-Pass,Yeah each season gets better and better. They just released the season 4 promo today and it looks intense 
Psycho-Pass,"I guess I feel that if the worst show you watch is a 7/10, then the scale is broken. But on a more subjective note, I’ve seen 10-15 shows on your list and would give a few a 5 or 6 and none a 10. I would really only give 3 or 4 shows ever made a 10. But hey, this is all very much a matter of opinion. "
Psycho-Pass,"I think you're putting too much time into what I offered as suggestions.  All opinions are subjective, my reply was to offer help not to try to change the system of ratings.  I'm just a earthling nothing special.  "
Psycho-Pass,"Ugh, we *need* a TV show like Psycho-Pass in America."
Psycho-Pass,"Well, *Kamen Rider Gaim* is a live-action action-drama series from Japan. It's written by Gen Urobuchi, who also wrote the anime *Psycho-Pass* (season 1), *Fate/Zero*, and *Puella Magi Madoka Magica*."
Psycho-Pass,"Your best bet are Chinese wuxia shows like Dragon Sabre and Heavenly Sword (latest adaption is the 2009 version), or Strange Hero Yi Zhi Mei. 

For American shows, you could try Sleepy Hollow. It's a fantastic blend of the supernatural and procedural that manages to be serious about its cheesy premise. "
Psycho-Pass,"CW DC superhero shows maybe(first seasons are best)/ not batwoman, Buffy the vampire slayer tv series, the spinoff Angel, OG Charmed (alot of powers in this show), Smallville while has alot of powers and action it's mostly teen drama if you don't mind it. Roswell gets good crazy by season 2, Mech-X4"
Psycho-Pass,"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and Grimm are the two that jump right out.  I enjoyed both of the anime you mentioned in the op, and I enjoy both of these shows.  "
Psycho-Pass,"Arrow! The action it's pretty fun and there's plenty of juicy plot if you don't spoil it. Just like watching most anime, give it a few episodes to really pick up. Season 2 especially is gold. "
Psycho-Pass,"For Psycho Pass(one of my favorite animes of all time), I would say Sherlock or Hannibal would be the closest.

Nothing is like AoT to my knowledge. If you are into Shounens (e.g., Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, Fairy Tail, etc.), then there is Smallville. If you are a fan of Tokyo ESP or Hamatora, there is Heroes and Misfits.


EDIT: Forgot to add some other shows.

If you enjoyed Steins; Gate, then you should watch Quantum Leap, Sliders, or Doctor Who.
"
Psycho-Pass,"You would really enjoy [Minority Report](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181689/) then. It's a live-action film. In Minority Report, crime is basically eradicated through police units that arrest criminals before they commit their crime. The system works at first but then flaws are exposed. Can't think of anything else close to Psycho-Pass though.
"
Psycho-Pass,Gaim was amazing. It took the title of my favorite Kamen Rider away from 555/Faiz.
Psycho-Pass,Don't forget Supernatural 
Psycho-Pass,I was trying to think of one to one similarities between an anime and a live action show and I couldn't think of any for Supernatural. Would Blue Exorcist be a good match?
Psycho-Pass,"Funnily enough, Supernatural got made into an anime somewhat based on s1. Although if we discount that, it'd have to be Full Metal Alchemist."
Psycho-Pass,I forgot they made it into an anime (didn't watch it). I can see it being compared to FMA due to the relationship between the brothers.
Psycho-Pass,"**Netflix**: We finally got the streaming rights to Evangelion that everyone thought would never happen!

**Everyone**: Yes! Yes! Yes!

**Netflix**: We're also making a live-action Cowboy Bebop!

**Everyone**: No! No! No!

**Adult Swim**: We're making a Blade Runner anime!

**Everyone**: *Confused Screaming*"
Psycho-Pass,"Please do yourself a favor and watch the Blade Runner short by Shinichiro Watanabe, of Cowboy Bebop's fame. Here it is:

https://youtu.be/rrZk9sSgRyQ

This anime series will be done by Kenji Kamiyama, who directed the Ghost in the Shell TV show (Stand Alone Complex) which is, imo, even better than the original movie.

So. Get. Hype.

Edit: Also Watanabe from Cowboy Bebop as Creative Producer."
Psycho-Pass,"Well, fuck. Didn't anticipate this today."
Psycho-Pass,Please for the love of god don't do it in that 3D CGI animation bullshit.
Psycho-Pass,YES!!!!!!!! Blade Runner and BR2049 are some of my favorite movies ever. The watanabe short was dope. 
Psycho-Pass,[deleted]
Psycho-Pass,"is this week going to be anime history? What is going on? :D

can I get a third Black Lagoon season, too? "
Psycho-Pass,Oh we got money for Blade Runner anime but no Metalocalypse finale ok.
Psycho-Pass,"Anime is becoming that new shit, guys. Hop on the train everyone it's gonna be a fucking awesome ride."
Psycho-Pass,"It is interesting that there wasn't even a mention of the source material, but I guess after a sequel and now a spin-off that this is more just based on characters from Philip K. Dick's novella.

That being said I'm super stoked for what they will do with it. Cowboy Bebop + Blade Runner is a match made in heaven "
Psycho-Pass,"I'm so glad adult themed animation is finally getting its due respect. There are so many books out there that would be really hard to pull off in live action but would perfectly suit animation, and now it looks like that might be a possibility in the future "
Psycho-Pass,"Fucking hype, I think cyberpunk is one of my favorite genres and I adore everything blade runner.

Let's see if they can get the tone and score right, because the sound design is such a big part of blade runner. 
"
Psycho-Pass,"Awesome! I expect it to be slow, dreary, visually stunning, and pretentious in all the right ways.

I also expect it to have bad viewership and last one season tops."
Psycho-Pass,"Live-action adaptation of beloved Anime - I sleep

Anime adaptation of beloved Live-action property - REAL SHIT"
Psycho-Pass,*Psycho Pass* is already out
Psycho-Pass,Looking forward to the Voight-Kampff bumps.
Psycho-Pass,"I'm glad CR is punching back -in some way- against Netflix, this competition will lead to better content for users, and the partnership with AS open the door for more collaborations to bring projects like this one."
Psycho-Pass,I would rather have an Adult Swim-produced 'Blade Runner' anime than a Netflix-produced Cowboy Bebop live-action series.
Psycho-Pass,I would like to board the hype train now.
Psycho-Pass,These things tend to work so much better in this order. All the anime to live action crossovers I have seen are awful.
Psycho-Pass,"I'm fairly certain this already exists and is called ""Ghost in the Shell"""
Psycho-Pass,"> Kenji Kamiyama and Shinji Aramaki

Please, please don’t be another full-CG series.

Also, a little concerned that neither Ridley Scott nor Hampton Fancher appear to be involved in any way."
Psycho-Pass,First we get live action cowboy bebop on netflix and now this? Feel like we're living in opposite world and I LOVE IT!
Psycho-Pass,Netflix should take notes.
Psycho-Pass,[deleted]
Psycho-Pass,[deleted]
Psycho-Pass,"Goddamn! It's a good week for anime. With Alita around the corner, we could see a full fledged assimilation into western culture here soon. And yes, I remember when dragons were in that same taboo category, then Game of Thrones comes around and suddenly dragons are cool..."
Psycho-Pass,inb4 the new Bladerunner anime inspires Bubblegum Crisis Ver 2.
Psycho-Pass,"Id love if we got that scene roy batty talks about before dying always had that visual in my head when he says 'Attack ships on fire' all you Blade runner fans know what im talking about but for those who don't watch this 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoAzpa1x7jU&t=56s"
Psycho-Pass,Nope
Psycho-Pass,[deleted]
Psycho-Pass,OMG YES!!!!! 
Psycho-Pass,"Nice! Same people involved that made the BR2049 animated short film prequel.. which was amazing.

Count me in."
Psycho-Pass,"I'm going to have to watch this in secret, can't be accused of any weebcraft."
Psycho-Pass,After 2049 I would much rather Blade Runner was just left the hell alone.
Psycho-Pass,MAKE IT STOP
Psycho-Pass,oh fuck yeah!
Psycho-Pass,Christmas came early this year.
Psycho-Pass,So does this mean it won't be on CR in the US? That's a real bummer. 
Psycho-Pass,This is good.
Psycho-Pass,This sounds so dope
Psycho-Pass,Holy shit I just got a second Christmas 
Psycho-Pass,There was already a Blade Runner anime short film and it was excellent. If they get the director of that film for this project then I am completely on board.
Psycho-Pass,I hope this is going to be good enough to warrant a shitty netflix adaptation in 5 years
Psycho-Pass,"Yes. Yes. Oh, on so many levels, yes!"
Psycho-Pass,Adult swim yay crunchyroll nay 
Psycho-Pass,https://youtu.be/8QfSzgV1q5g
Psycho-Pass,Nice my crunchyroll subscription finally put to use other than Attack on Titan
Psycho-Pass,"Ok, was kinda worried Watanabe might make it too 'light' but just check out the Blackout short and 

I. AM. HYPED. 

That perfect moment when two things I love come together. 

(My mind did kinda go on a tangent though: a BR anime made by Eva era Anno 🤤)"
Psycho-Pass,Did they mention when this is going to be airing?
Psycho-Pass,"Anime news has been like a roller coaster this past week.

Evangelion on Netflix:  :)

Live Action Cowboy Bebop on Netflix: >:(

Blade Runner anime: :D"
Psycho-Pass,Blade Runner becomes a Anime and Cowboy Bebop becomes a live action...
Psycho-Pass,They already did an anime blade runner tho
Portlandia,At the time in that mid 2010's era where everyone was getting a sketch show people felt it was getting over-saturated but we got so many killer sketches around that time
Portlandia,I love Craig’s crazy guac tac’s
Portlandia,"Man, the Portlandia sketches that hit are so damn good! Great show"
Portlandia,I loved this weird TV show.
Portlandia,Kumail was one of my favorite guest players and I always loved how he was the same character. This was probably my favorite of them. His delivery of the line where he tells them the entire menu just changed is one of my favorite deliveries Kumail has ever had.
Portlandia,This show had ups & down but Kumail playing a frustrating salesman always hit lmao.
Portlandia,This was the first time we saw Kumail in anything and the first Portlandia sketch I saw as well and it made me an instant fan of him and the show.
Portlandia,"I have seen this before and I love it, but it is just too painful to watch again."
Portlandia,"Portlandia was hit and miss at times, but Kumail showing up as an obnoxious salesperson was always a highlight. [His role as a cell phone salesman was also hilarious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrccTMwoLv8)"
Portlandia,"The Kroll Show is the best from that era, I will fight anyone who says otherwise"
Portlandia,The camera station is on top of the taco station
Portlandia,"LOL ""after you pay for it, it's free"""
Portlandia,"I prefer him as the Birthday Loan Officer.

My favorite sketch of all is [The Studio](https://youtu.be/xP5-jp6nbsM)"
Portlandia,Kumail was also great in Murderville.
Portlandia,The skit with the chicken and the free range farm is one of the best skits.
Portlandia,[The Battlestar Galactica sketch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyHXzYTuLi4) is timeless.
Portlandia,"Well now I'm wondering what an Oregon pinot tastes like.

I can relate to the clip. It's always amusing seeing the disappointment on people's faces when they realise I have no discernible talent and am also severely lacking in the personality department, lol."
Portlandia,Josh Homme playing a gay guy is a nice touch
Portlandia,They just wanted them to be domesticated animals.
Portlandia,Josh homme is a fantastic musician. My favorite musician randomly poppin up in something role is Jerry Cantrell in jerry maguire but this shit was still awesome.
Portlandia,That’s my friends house!
Portlandia,"> Well now I'm wondering what an Oregon pinot tastes like.

A whaaat?"
Portlandia,Explains why he and Dalle broke up lol
Portlandia,I always forget how huge he is.
Portlandia,"I think they broke up because he's an abusive alcoholic, no?"
Portlandia,"If you always forget, he’s not that huge. *sly grin*"
Portlandia,I immediately think of that photographer woman he leveled (with a kick no less) every time I see his name. I used to really admire the guy for his incredibly memorable riffs and songwriting. Whatchu gonna do.
Portlandia,"""Sometimes, to have fun, you have to dress a little lame"".

Words to live by."
Portlandia,"I paid 10 bucks to see Danzig in a tiny basement club in either 1988 or 89. 

There was no barrier between the little stage and the crowd. Some drunk moron kept grabbing his mic cord and pulling on it. After the third time Glenn just upper cut the dumbass and knocked the fuck out of him. I didn't see what happened to him but he didn't mess with the mic cable anymore."
Portlandia,'BLACK 666 hut hut!'
Portlandia,[deleted]
Portlandia,I find out that robot was here I’ll be eating my cereal out of the bottom of your fuckin skull. Verständlich?!
Portlandia,You can never have enough Hurley.
Portlandia,[deleted]
Portlandia,"Portlandia...I feel like I should like the show, it seems like the kind of humor I would like, but I can never find it funny. Not sure what it is, like they were almost to a funny part but never quite got there."
Portlandia,Fucking Danzig. I’ve never watched this show except in clips. Maybe I’ll start soon. I always enjoy what little I see.
Portlandia,"I love the one where they go to Bed, Bath and Beyond to buy a vacuum cleaner. When he yells “JAIME!” in that demonic voice I lose it."
Portlandia,Everyone should check out the show Documentary Now!-Sandy Passage episode if you haven’t. It’s a parody of this documentary called Grey Gardens about a reclusive mom and daughter living in this mansion that is falling apart. They’re also related to jfk or his wife somehow.
Portlandia,Is this show worth watching? I always see it on our tv as suggested
Portlandia,"Where can I watch this in the UK, I quite liked that 😂"
Portlandia,"This reminds me of a time I was in the south of France with a bunch of germans. There were 12 of us, and there were 2 serious, very serious goths. It was absolutely hilarious going to the beach with them. They were hiding in the shade, not swimming, just observing. With their black eyeshadow and tats and collars. I loved them."
Portlandia,‘Till you’re bleeding...
Portlandia,[Goth satire always makes me think of the parody song from Stick of Truth which I ironically really liked...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqSfUdagwW8)
Portlandia,Is it just me or does anyone else think the  chemistry between Fred Armisen and Carrie Brownstein is amazing in these skits?
Portlandia,Where did they get footage of me on my last vacation from?
Portlandia,"Loved it, and great having a giggle with Danzig. Loved the stock music too - it's like someone listened to Dumpweed by Blink 182 then made a sound-alike version in 5 minutes. Perfect for the sketch."
Portlandia,"The original:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vC7PnGWf1Y"
Portlandia,"Goth to Boss
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL9tm3LHG6Y"
Portlandia,This is the only show that I can rewatch
Portlandia,this is one of my favorite episodes. i too have always wondered how goths handle beach attire. the only thing i like better on portland is is the rats.
Portlandia,[deleted]
Portlandia,Redditors in the wild
Portlandia,This is supposed to be a comedy show?
Portlandia,I just had such a flashback of being 16 years old and obsessed with visual kei while also spending a month at the beach.... I downed 2 tubs of 60 fps trying not to get a tan.
Portlandia,How have I never seen this show. Thank you for showing me the way
Portlandia,"I love this.  Going to look for this episode of Portlandia and watch it now. Danzig was pretty funny here. 
This is sadly me at the beach too often. I have to learn that having a good time means dressing a little lame and live by it."
Portlandia,"Holy cow. This is my closet... 

Add my uggs"
Portlandia,"I lived in a city in Brazil with an average of 37°C and 80% humidity.

I'd feel for the goths in the town square... That Took effort!"
Portlandia,God damn thats a good song.
Portlandia,"""You can never have too much Hurley""

*Looks at my dozen tanks and 10 board shorts*

Yeah basically"
Portlandia,"Is it just me, or does that guy kind of look like Papa Legba?"
Portlandia,"Well that looks absolutely nothing like Canon Beach. Hell, half the time goths would be right at home in the gloomy overcast."

Portlandia,"Why don't you see more Goths in movies?

Because the studio gets very messy when the director shouts CUT!"
Portlandia,I love love love love this show with a passion
Portlandia,heyyyy Radu from Romania :D. Am I the only one who gets really exited when my country gets mildly mentioned in a vid?
Portlandia,Can they pickle that?
Portlandia,whoremonger
Portlandia,My favorite documentary about our state
Portlandia,I just watched this tonight random. This is so weird.
Portlandia,"At first I'm like ""is that Glenn Danzig?""

Then I think ""no, no way, no way he could even pretend to be this likable.""

But it's Glenn fucking Danzig. I'll be damned."
Portlandia,"Armisen is in everything these days, don't see Brownstein at all."
Portlandia,I forgot that Carrie was kind of a smokeshow with that goth gear on.

Portlandia,"Every time my wife and I are shopping at a department store and see Hurley or Billabong,  we both launch into this scene. I love it."
Portlandia,Was I the only one who didn't find this funny at all?
Portlandia,When was I supposed to laugh at this?
Portlandia,"Was that supposed to be funny?

Where’s the joke? I totallymissedit."
Portlandia,Worst show in the history of awful shows.
Portlandia,"Kudos to the fucking editors, man."
Portlandia,"Enter the sand, man"
Portlandia,What kind of stale humor is this? Why is every clip of this show like this? There’s so much potential but why does it always flop
Portlandia,Everyone in here is talking about Danzig and pussies and shit.  All I can think about is how weird it is they drove all the way to Cali to go to the beach.  No fucking way there is a warm sunny beach in Oregon.  They could have sold the Portland idea so hard if he was handing him Patagonia and Arc'teryx...
Portlandia,it had me at first but when he pulled out the shirt i was done.. I might have gave this show a shoot if it didnt go how it did..

Portlandia,Hello
Portlandia,"If you spend a lot of time in the sun, it’s important to get a stupid hat with a big brim.  Mine is a straw cowboy hat- nobody wears those around here but I don’t even realize I’m wearing it anymore."
Portlandia,[deleted]
Portlandia,"I saw The Misfits at a smallish venue and people were jumping up on stage, climbing up on the Marshall stacks and jumping into the crowd. 

So I jumped in the line and, eventually, got up on stage. Well, I was a short kid at the time and the stacks were taller than I expected so I was having a little trouble getting up on to the top. 

Glen fucking Danzig put his hand on my butt and just *shoved me* up onto the speakers with one arm.  

Once I was up there it was a lot farther down to the crowd than I was prepared for so I hesitated for a moment trying to build up my nerve. 

mid song I hear ""Go Pussy!"" and, again, Danzig shoves my ass. I went flying into the crowd. 

I became semi famous at that show and a few others at the same venue. Everyone knew me as ""That's the guy that Danzig touched his butt!"" Unfortunately I also earned a new nickname at that show. Everyone called me ""Pussy"" for years.

edit: Thanks for the gold stranger!"
Portlandia,"I feel like Reddit has traumatized me. I can no longer read descriptions of things that have happened without wondering if I'm reading an elaborate copypasta. I'm not saying this sounds like copypasta, I'm saying everything does."
Portlandia,"One time Danzig had a show with North Side Kings. Danzig pushed them off the lineup after the other acts (Danzig) ran long in setup and sound check.   


When confronted, he yelled ""fuck you motherfucker!"" and shoved the guy. The dude cold-cocked Danzig and it was lights out. I thought he was dead at first.  


Danzig has made some good music but he has a reputation as a total d-bag to uphold."
Portlandia,[removed]
Portlandia,"I was at that show! If I remember correctly, Danzig proceeded to eat a jar full of his own cum for the encore. Great show"
Portlandia,"I've been to a few shows like that. In '88 I saw Government Issue and the stage was like four inches high. A guy got slammed really hard in the pit and fell into the drum set. John Stabb and the drummer just started punching and kicking him until he scurried off the stage. I broke my nose and accidentally kicked someone in pit and split their head open at the same time. 

In '89 I begged for change on the corner to get enough money to see Ministry (I think it was like $7) and Al accidentally spilled poppers up my nose whole passing around during the show. Ah, good times."
Portlandia,Heard he only eats hotdogs
Portlandia,r/thathappened
Portlandia,I didn’t even catch that!! They have the best writing
Portlandia,"Looks, sometimes we want to hear Marilyn Manson's intelligence and insights, and other times we just want to to hear Danzig talking about [bangin' demon hooores](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWzSy3Am3ns)"
Portlandia,He was supposed to play Logan first in XMen
Portlandia,BRICKS
Private Practice,"How does NCIS, on CBS, drawing lots of viewers at all help shows on NBC and ABC rise in ratings? That makes no sense at all."
Private Practice,"What's NCIS like lately? I find it incredibly difficult to tell which episodes are new and which are reruns. It seemed like it had run its course ages ago, but those numbers are hard to dispute...

I genuinely enjoyed it back in the first couple of seasons. IMO it peaked when they [](/s ""killed Kate, instead of the intolerably abrasive if handsome Tony. Ziva was fun for a while, McGee was never very interesting, only Abby was worth watching, but it just felt stale."")

I flick past it now and then, and one thing I have noticed is that every new season seems to look progressively more glossy, visually, with everything blooming together, as though someone's steadily turning up the dial on some filter or other during the editing process."
Private Practice,Isn't Private Practice ending after next week?
Private Practice,"All in all, a lot of ""quality"" shows seem to be doing really well right now, but are still being beaten in ratings by multicam sitcoms... sigh"
Private Practice,"When they what? WHEN THEY WHAT?

I still like the show, I watch the Los Angeles version as well. Mostly for the chemistry between the characters."
Private Practice,"Bah, are those spoiler tags not working? I used the syntax from the /r/television sidebar, which seems to be different from every other subreddit's spoiler tags.

I found LA pretty unwatchable. It's an action procedural, but the characters aren't interesting, the action isn't good enough or bad enough, and the procedural part isn't very interesting either. Plus the token computer nerd was some dude, instead of Pauley Perrette, so why even bother."
Private Practice,They work for me.
Private Practice,"The computer nerd is also a hot chick named [Nell](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2782142/). Plus Daniela Ruah is on the show.

Pauley Perrette, I can't stand her character, way over the top, would never happen. Also, she's a 42yo playing like a late 20s."
Private Practice,I don't accept the opinion of any person that could write Fringe off so callously and yet claim to be an expert on TV. But he did have an excellent point about James Van Der Beek on Don't trust the bitch in apartment 23.
Private Practice,"Florence briefly left The Jeffersons, then came back after her spinoff failed.

Same re Joanie and Chachi from Happy Days."
Private Practice,Kinda counts - Hunter and Bobbi from Agents of SHIELD left to do a spinoff that didn't end up getting picked up. Hunter showed back up again on Agents of SHIELD for a single episode.
Private Practice,"Captain Jack Harkness was spun off from Doctor Who into Torchwood, and showed back up on DW after TW had run its course."
Private Practice,"Tom from The Blacklist got spun-off to The Blacklist: Redemption, then when that show got cancelled, he was brought back to the main show for a bit."
Private Practice,"don't know if this necessarily counts but criminal minds had a spin-off called beyond borders and once that got cancelled daniel henney went to the original and became a main character the last 3 seasons

tyler blackburn went from og pretty little liars to spin-off ravenswood then back to the og when it got cancelled"
Private Practice,"Unluckily for The Ropers, Don Knotts as Mr Furley was a huge success. No return for them."
Private Practice,"It’s a loose fit but technically *The Jay Leno Show* was a spin-off of *The Tonight Show with Jay Leno*. Leno left, then came back."
Private Practice,"Antonio (Jon Seda) left Chicago PD for Chicago Justice. That lasted a season, was cancelled and back to Chicago PD he went."
Private Practice,Caleb from Pretty Little Liars left for a spin-off and when it got canceled he came back
Private Practice,"Bobbi Morse/Mockingbird (Adrianne Palicki) and Lance Hunter (Nick Blood) both left Agents of Shield for a spinoff show called ""Marvel’s Most Wanted"".  After they officially got rid of the characters and shot the pilot the head of ABC said ""This show will never see the light of day"" and killed it.  They both came back to Agents of Shield for a few episodes.  It really was unfortunate because both characters were great."
Private Practice,Not exactly what you are asking for but Damon Wayans Jr left New Girl to be on Happy Endings and then when Happy Endings ended he came back to New Girl. There's a fan theory that Coach was leading a double life as Brad.
Private Practice,"I think Angel was in a few episodes of Buffy after Angel had ended, if I remember right.

Edit- I did not remember right."
Private Practice,"Langly, Frohike, and Byers were characters (""The Lone Gunmen"") who would occasionally appear on The X-Files. They were spun off into their own show called The Lone Gunmen, and when that show was cancelled they would return to The X-Files for an episode called ""Jump The Shark,"" which finishes the cliffhanger the spin-off ended on. They also appeared in the second film ""The X-Files: I Want to Believe"" as well as in the continuation of The X-Files series (Seasons 10 & 11)."
Private Practice,Angel last season started after Buffy ended and even brought in a main character from Buffy.
Private Practice,Angel had one more season after he popped up in buffy's final season
Private Practice,"James Marsters said when they approached him for Angel the amount of money he asked for significantly drained the budget.  Which is apparently why the vast majority of Season 5 was shot on one set in daytime.  As a fan of that show, I gotta say I never even noticed that transition at all.  It made perfect since that Angel sold his soul to work for the evil law firm.  I really liked that season."
Private Practice,I think it was just the finale but yeah
Private Practice,"They returned in the Series 9 finale, and the first movie, but weren't in the second one."
Private Practice,">Which is apparently why the vast majority of Season 5 was shot on one set in daytime.

I don't really understand this, sets don't have window out to the real world. They have studio lights to make it day time or night time."
Private Practice,"I'm wondering if, in like 25-30 years, when people will be watching shows, they'll wonder why certain shows in the 00's have like 10 episode seasons.

And then someone will make a ""TIL that in 2007, the Writers Guild of America had a strike. This is why many television shows during that year had extremely short seasons."""
Private Practice,"I still mourn for Pushing Daisies, whose ratings momentum was cut off by the strike and it never recovered in season 2 and was canceled without a properly-filmed finale.

Dr. Horrible’s Sing-Along Blog also came out of the strike, and there's a [song on the musical commentary track about the writers' strike](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfwElBO-gQ8). "
Private Practice,And Heroes never recovered as a show
Private Practice,Was zack and Cody really cancelled tho? I thought it was because there 3 season contract was up (as what most Disney shows have.) And  on deck aired soon after and lasted another 3 seasons.
Private Practice,Who Made Huckabee? Might be one of my favorite bits ever done on Late Night TV.
Private Practice,Something that isn't mentioned as much - the strike was the end of strictly regimented TV season starts/finishes and sweeps weeks.
Private Practice,RIP pushing daisies
Private Practice,Am I correct in thinking that the Writers' Strike successfully prevented the Deposition and Dinner Party episodes of the Office from airing one after each other?
Private Practice,The Writer's Strike is what made Misha Collins' career. The original SPN storyline got scrapped in favor of 'an angel raises Dean'. 
Private Practice,"Writer's Strike Conan was the best string of television that late night television has ever produced. Sure his remote episodes done in other cities/countries are still the best stuff on late night TV now, and his final few weeks of shows on The Tonight Show after falling out with NBC were awesome, but the writer's strike showed how much better Conan is when he is freed from the shackles of archaic late night television bullshit of being forced to do monologues and sketches. It's just like how his current TBS show is unwatchable on a daily basis, yet suddenly he does a remote segment or a remote episode in another city or country and that is immediately must-watch."
Private Practice,And I'm still bitter about Pushing Daisies
Private Practice,That's a really nice write-up. Great job! Let's hope that will never happen again.
Private Practice,Desperate Housewives wasn't a reality show
Private Practice,"One show that got cancelled and it bugs the fuck out of me is “The Riches” I saw it on Netflix a few years back, finished season one, then season two ends abruptly with the bad guy calling to tell the main character that he has his son. "
Private Practice,"I don't think anyone has mentioned, ""The Riches"":

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Riches

It was hit by the writers' strike in season 2 and only half of the planned episodes ever aired (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Riches#Season_2:_2008).

I thought it was quite clever but I could see how they'd likely run out of good story ideas fairly quickly."
Private Practice,The writers strike was a weird time for tv. 
Private Practice,Journeyman TV show from NBC. I am sad.
Private Practice,"The great late night madness will always be the most memorable thing from this. Conan was the best comedy on TV during the writer’s strike, late night or otherwise. "
Private Practice,"I loved the 4400, it was heartbreaking to see it go."
Private Practice,"Only 3 shows which debuted that season got to a 3rd season; Gossip Girl, Chuck and The Big Bang Theory. "
Private Practice,Do non-union people suffer after union people are back in the industry? Are they placed in a blacklist or anything like that?
Private Practice,"I remember being a journalist visiting the set of a lot of those series and talking to the cast. They all seemed happy as they got to have a break, but it was tough on the other people like lighting, make-up, catering etc. 

"
Private Practice,it's insane that it's already been ten years. Quantum of Solace had shitty writing unfortunately.
Private Practice,[deleted]
Private Practice,Since the last writers strike gave us Dr Horrible I am anxious for another one!
Private Practice,And new episodes of The Office finally came back! I remember when this happened It was torture having to wait.
Private Practice,"Wait, why is Desperate Housewives listed as a reality show?"
Private Practice,I know it's not television but Quantum of Solace basically didn't have a third act because of the Writer's Strike.
Private Practice,I remember how annoying that time was. 
Private Practice,RIP Pushing Daisies. 
Private Practice,Pushing Daisies never recovered.  Such a shame.
Private Practice,"Other than 30rock and the office having shorter seasons, I remember Late Night with Conan O'Brien. During this time he grew a beard and during the show he would spend time flicking his wedding ring. Each episode he would try to beat his previous record. Now, this does sound boring but Conan made it hilarious. "
Private Practice,[Always worth watching the South Park episode making fun of the strike.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_on_Strike)
Private Practice,RIP Drawn Together. 
Private Practice,Aaaannnddd....all we have now is remakes of old shit.
Private Practice,I was so excited for The day the Earth stood still too.
Private Practice,writers strike ruined Battlestar Galactica
Private Practice,And the industry never recovered. Movies have largely been shit rebrands ever since. Movies are dead. Series are the future.
Private Practice,Essentially it saved breaking bad. It cut season 1 short and thus resulted in Jesse not getting killed off 
Private Practice,RIP Reaper
Private Practice,"After being introduced to the GEICO cavemen show in that thread about worst reviewed shows of the 2000s, I have to say its cancellation was a tragedy. What a hilarious trainwreck of a show. "
Private Practice,I took the time to watch all seven seasons of the West Wing.  I've been a fan of Sorkin ever since.
Private Practice,Quantum of Solace
Private Practice,"...and gave rise to Netflix, reality unscripted TV and cord cutting, which is directly biting them in the ass in the latest negotiations (2017 expiration).

Talk about short sited. They got their little contract, but their value will never be the same."
Private Practice,Spoiled whiners should just have been replaced
Private Practice,TIL Steve Buscemi was a volunteer firefighter during the 2007-08 Writers Strike 
Private Practice,Look at the '88 strike.  Mission:Impossible remade episodes from the 60's series and Star Trek TNG did a clip show.
Private Practice,Life also got screwed in the writers strike. S1 was great and then just huge mis step in S2. 
Private Practice,"I watched Dr. Horrible in my junior year English class when my teacher put it on, took a Xanax, and fell asleep. We quoted it for days"
Private Practice,"I loved Pushing Daises but it’s ratings were dropping *fast* before the strike, it shed **half** its viewers over the first season. There was no momentum."
Private Practice,And Jesse Pinkman's life was saved.
Private Practice,Came here to say this. After season 1 the show just spiraled downward into a horrible mess.
Private Practice,"Honestly I think the show was doomed  after season 1 anyway. 

They started drifting away from what I felt like the show was meant to be: human characters from different backgrounds dealing with super human abilities. These days that sounds rather generic but at the time it was a great concept that worked really well. But as the show went on, it seemed like it became less about humans dealing with super powers and more about just the fact that people had super powers. I honestly think season 1 was lightning in a bottle. There were good characters all circling around this mysterious event as well as a really cool villain.

Then there is the fact that they started fucking with their powers which really doesn't do anything but break the immersion of the world the whole story works to build. Some say they had to nerf certain characters' abilities but I say that's a lack of good writing and creativity. I could go on about Heroes. A damn shame it turned out the way it did, and the revival certainly did not make any improvements. "
Private Practice,"Save the cheerleader, save the world! RIP."
Private Practice,"Yeah thats true, shame they couldnt get back to their glory days not even once. "
Private Practice,it was a lost cause before the strike
Private Practice,Every time Stewart and Colbert did something with Conan it was gold
Private Practice,Streaming (and the rise of HBO and other cable networks) also contributed to that.
Private Practice,Can I get an EILI5 style explanation. The business of TV fascinates me.
Private Practice,Eh...I dunno. I know that the original plan was for Sam to save Dean but that doesn't mean angels wouldn't have entered the picture anyways. I think Kripke added them in more to have balance with demons than to have an explanation of how Dean got raised from the dead.
Private Practice,"Misha's performance is what made Misha's career. I'm pretty sure the angels were planned anyway, Kripke claims he had a 5-year plan from the start. It's just the manner in which they were introduced that came out of the strike. "
Private Practice,"It was really great for late night television.

But as an actor and someone who worked behind the scenes it essentially meant there was basically no work for almost a year.

Made me leave the biz....which ended up probably being a really good move seeing how much the industry changed post streaming."
Private Practice,I agree. Seems fitting a write up about the writer's strike is well written. Too many lengthy write-ups on Reddit are poorly written but OP is good at it.
Private Practice,"Yeah, it was a bit worrying how close we got recently, I think it was last May? "
Private Practice,"thanks, I had it on there twice, had the one in the wrong spot but removed it now"
Private Practice,"Man I loved that show, I still listen to the theme song sometimes"
Private Practice,We'll never know how well Promise City will/would have turned out.
Private Practice,"How does that compare to other years though?


Edit: you also left out Private Practice and Flaspoint and non scripted shows The Moment of Truth, Kitchen Nightmares, and The Singing Bee"
Private Practice,Yes! Hosted by Hulk Hogan and Laila Ali. I think NBC should make an American Ninja Warriors vs American Gladiators show
Private Practice,Kind of a mercy kill at that point in the show's life
Private Practice,LOL the writers strike isn't why we have Netflix. We have Netflix and similar products as a reaction to internet piracy of films and tv shows which was a reaction to studios refusing to use the internet to bring content to audiences faster and with less hassle (picking a tv show to binge on netflix vs having to go buy a dvd boxset). Basically studios didn't want to accept the future because it meant selling things cheaper. They were collectively told to fuck off by anyone who was able to pirate content.
Private Practice,"Netflix and unscripted reality tv started before the writers strike. Netflix has been around since 1997 and the two shows that really kicked off our current reality tv show dystopia, keeping up with the kardashians and the real housewives of OC both started before the strike. The rash of competitive unscripted reality shows like survivor and the bachelor started way, way before that. So I don’t really understand your comment. "
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"I'd actually say The Twilight Zone aged better than almost any other show of that era. The '60s were like a science fiction arms race, and even with the massive season orders the scripts were overwhelmingly solid because there were so many genre greats working at the same time and led by Rod Serling, a great himself. Sure, a modern audience might see a twist coming here or there, but the acting and development of themes are still excellent, and many endings remain striking and evocative to this day.

The show dealt in universal themes but was also very progressive for the time. So it doesn't feel too terribly dated regarding social issues the way many such programs do—with the primary exception of an episode called The Encounter which centered around an unfounded notion about Japanese-American spies at Pearl Harbor and was withheld from syndication until 2004. Feel free to ignore that one.

The Twilight Zone's camerawork and visual direction are more creative and refined than its peers', too, and in its recently remastered high definition format can appear nearly modern. Of course, some episodes are more aesthetically appealing than others. That said, I started watching in the prestige TV age, and even ignoring the show's historical significance it remains easily my favorite speculative fiction anthology series. I rewatched it in the last year and appreciated it even more."
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),It absolutely stands up. An utterly timeless show that speaks to universal themes that as a society we are still grappling with.
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"So the short answer is yes.

The long answer is yes with an asterisk. A lot of episodes are incredibly predictable or cliche now just because they've gone from insightful to trope or genre defining now to cliche. The performances and execution are still generally admirable or enjoyable if you don't mind seeing the twists coming a mile away."
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),Absolutely
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"The Twilight Zone was made in an era when television needed to make 30+ episodes on razor thin margins every year. Serling and his team were on a crazy unforgiving schedule.

As a result of this, for every good episode, there are three bad ones, and for every brilliant episode, there are three good ones. So I will warn you; don't expect every episode to be a masterpiece.

But the enduring popularity of this series lies in the brilliance of the few episodes that do stand out. They are some of the best television ever made."
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),Yes.
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"I think so.

The effects are not great of course but the social commentary holds up."
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"Absolutely.

In fact, I’d like to see some auteur directors take the scripts and shoot modern versions of their favorite episodes. Only restriction would be that the script can’t change. Could be interesting."
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"Yeah, you can barely even tell it's in black and white."
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"Some episodes are still very powerful, others are quite cringey."
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"Sadly, yes. Many of the issues they covered back then are still relevant today"
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"go watch it and find out. why ask first? just do shit, man. you don't need someone to tell you what is good or not. lol."
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),Some are things are outdated but the general topics are
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"The original Twilight Zone has aged like a fine wine. The only possible downside is that through cultural osmosis, a few episodes are going to be spoiled. It's like Psycho, even if you've never seen it, you already know what happens."
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"Yes. The only thing dated about the show is the black and white and some of the designs for monsters or whatnot, but they don't take away. The lessons imparted are still relevant, and a lot of episodes are still interesting types of science fiction."
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),Most episode are weak now but the great ones remain incredibly good.
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"So, I am of the era when the Twilight Zone and even the Outer Limits were considered decent entertainment. For me, the Watchmen series, The Leftovers, Mr Robot and various others have done quite well at outshining the Twilight Zone!"
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"Damn skippy. Watch ""I am the night Color me hate"" and see for youself."
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"This. Maybe don't watch it straight through. Look up ""Top 25 Twilight Zone episodes"" or something like that and stick to the classics."

The Twilight Zone (Original Series),Inside No.9 has a Fantastic dialogue free episode about two guys robbing a very fancy house. The name currently escapes me but I was so blown away by the execution.

The Twilight Zone (Original Series),Haven't watched a ton of anthology series but I like the good hunting episode from love death robot
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"The Outer Limits. Simon Says.  2000. An engineer builds a robot and incorporates the memories of his son who died in a car accident twenty years earlier.     Creepy episode. 

Amazing stories.  Mirror Mirror.  1986.   While guesting on a talk show, horror novelist Jordan Manmouth claims he is immune to being frightened by the nightmarish creatures he creates - and comes to regret the taunt when he is terrorized by a black-caped phantom in reflections.  I couldn’t look in a mirror for weeks after that episode."
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"""Masters of Science Fiction"" only had six episodes ordered by ABC and I only remember seeing three of them broadcast by the network (supposedly four made it to air).  ""A Clean Escape"", the first to air, was about a psychiatrist working with a man with amnesia. I don't want to spoil it, but for me it ranks up there with the greatest episodes of ""The Twilight Zone"" and ""The Outer Limits"". I'm not sure where you'd be able to see any of the episodes today."
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"The outer limits - white light fever. 

100 year old billionaire with failing heart desperately tries to cheat death by funding research while death physically stalks him. The outer limits (90s version) is really underrated."
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"""The Zanti Misfits"" from The Outer Limits. Creepy as hell."
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"Night Visions, underrated early 2000s Fox show. Cancelled too early, and a lot of the best episodes were first run in syndication. 

The one I remember enjoying was with Michael Rappaport. He inherits a big mansion in the woods where lights are burning 24/7. But there’s a reason the lights are always on, in closets and drawers and in every corner of the house. It’s to completely prevent shadows from forming at all. Don’t remember the episode name, but should be easy to find, as Night Visions didn’t last long. 

Fear Itself has a few good episodes too."

The Twilight Zone (Original Series),Hell Toupee - Amazing Stories (1986)
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"Tales of Tomorrow (1952) The precursor of original Twilight Zone. In fact, Serling cribbed many of his episodes from this series. My favorites are season 1: 'All The Time In The World'. A man gets a watch that stops time so he can steal art masterpieces for a mysterious woman. Then he finds out why. 

'Dark Angel' - I have to say this is probably the inspiration for 'Carrie'. A man's wife goes through a terrible transformation. 

These used to be on Hulu, but not anymore. Some were done live. A great look at primal TV sci-fi. Some great shows."
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),'Easy' on Netflix has a few good ones. The show revisits some characters through the seasons but episodes all stand alone just fine.
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"[**""Her Pilgrim Soul""**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-Y707u0SHU) from the **1985** ***Twilight Zone***. I once amused the hell out of Alan Brennert (the writer) by bringing him *every* version of that to sign: the DVD box set, the short story anthology with the prose version of the story (adapted from the teleplay, not the other way 'round), and the book/CD of the off-Broadway musical *(Weird Romance).*

The commentary track on the DVD of the episode has Brennert, Wes Craven, and the showrunner Philip deGuere.  I crack up every time when Craven and deGuere mention how they'd broken down crying while watching it to prep for the commentary.

I also loved the companion piece in that episode, (also Alan Bennett scripted), [**""I of Newton""**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoQ6ZC8EUQ0), based on the Joe Haldeman short story.  Ron Glass was sexy as hell as the devil.

>.... I don't think the first revival of The Twilight Zone is particularly beloved.

It is, but mostly by old farts who watched it on broadcast back in '85. :)

>but it sure had a lot of talent involved. ...George R.R. Martin and J. MIchael Straczynski wrote episodes

You forgot Harlan Ellison, Alan Brennert, and Rockne S. O'Bannon. :D

>Wes Craven directed several episodes, and Bruce Willis even starred in one.

It was pre-*Moonlighting,* so nobody knew who he was, back then.

Willis appeared in the pilot episode (""Shatterday""; Harlan Ellison short story, adapted by Alan Brennert). Brennert is hilarious in the commentary track on the DVDs about how Ellison was so angry at him over it, that he actually handed it back to Ellison and told him to try his hand adapting.  Only to have Ellison shouting ""You son of a bitch!"" at him the next morning, to which he yelled back, ""Not as easy as you thought, huh?!"".  That's why Ellison threw in the dialogue line, ""Alan? Alan is that you? You do me better than anybody else!"" as a compliment to Brennert's writing.

BTW, Helen Mirren was in [""Dead Woman's Shoes""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C53V2rLZT70), a gender-flipped remake of the classics series ""Dead Man's Shoes.""

But for me, the most amazing casting was probably Danny Kaye in [""Paladin of the Lost Hour""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdgpx_VtO30) by Harlan Ellison. Ellison's commentary track is fun, too.

The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"Goosebumps ""Attack of the Jack O Lanterns"", ""Calling all Creeps"", and ""Click"" all genuinely freaked me out as a kid, and as an adult I still watch those episodes."
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"Maybe it's because I like Brian Tyree Henry but Room 104's episode, ""Arnold"", is one of my favorite."
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"Since you mentioned Are You Afraid of the Dark, my favorites include The Tale of the 13th Floor, The Tale of the Dangerous Soup, and The Tale of Old Man Corcoran. There are quite a few with darker endings and more interesting twists than you'd expect for a kid's show."
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"""Breakdown"" from Season 1 of ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"". Brilliant, simple and horrifying concept. (Hitchcock himself directed the episode.)"
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"I don’t remember the episode names, but I found  two of the episodes from Tales from the Loop to be really good. The second episode is a freaky Friday thing and there’s an episode with the giant robots."
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),Suits from LDR.
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"There was an episode of an early 90's anthology set in a world where people had only a certain amount of time to live, but could barter to extend their lives.  The protagonist looked like a JFK Jr. knock-off and went to the Judge deciding who lives and who dies to trade months off of his life so that his mother could live.  He also got hooked in by a femme fatale from the cabal running things.  

Does anybody know what this was?  It's really stayed with me."
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"Sonnie's Edge from Love Death and Robots.  

Adult Pokémon with a twist that would make it an awesome show on its own."
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"Probably too late, but Masters of Horror on Showtime had a few good episodes.  One I remember in particular was called Cigarette Burns, and it was with Norman Reedus.  He plays a rare films dealer who's mourning the death of his wife and is hired by Udo Kier to find a rare film, which is said to have incited a violent riot the one time it was viewed.  Pretty creepy, IMO.  It was also directed by John Carpenter."
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"Soul Man, the first episode of VH1's *Strange Frequency* (2001) in which a guitarist finds a cursed transcription of Jimi Hendrix's lost magnum opus. It wasn't particularly well written or acted or anything, but it has haunted my thoughts for 20 years in much the same way that crossroads and blues do. 

There is a fascinating depth to music beyond that of lyrics or emotion or theory, something metaphysical in its very manifestation rarely alluded to in media outside of generic catch phrases like ""it just came to me."" It's the culmination of art and philosophy in an appreciation for the wellspring of human creativity that is one's soul. Most people would call this spirituality but for me it's beautiful enough without the baggage."
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"""[Nightcrawlers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfGT4kzTevI&ab_channel=AdrianAlec)"" from the 80's Twilight Zone is one of my favorites. It's directed by William Friedkin (The Exorcist).  It's about a Vietnam vet who can materialize things out of thin air, and forces a roadside diner to experience one of his Vietnam flashbacks.  Creepy episode."
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),The hood maker was such a great episode. Wish they would make a spin off series about it. The concept and actors were both great. I've gone back to rewatch it a couple times.
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"I liked Kill All Others, but otherwise I didn't like that series all that much. But hey taste is subjective right?"
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"That's one of my favorite Inside No. 9s... I'm not a horror person, so the more horror-ish episodes usually aren't my cup of tea. Diddle Diddle Dumpling is my favorite, because I identify completely with obsessing over something stupid and insignificant."
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"The Light Brigade is actually a sequel to the season 1 episode ""Quality of Mercy"", about Skokes' imprisonment by the aliens."
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"That reveal is horrifying. It has stayed with me all these years. I’ve only seen it once the night it aired, yet it’s stayed with me."
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),I just watched the entire series but skipped season 2 because it's not on prime. I'll have to check this one out.
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),Oh boy! What a Great Episode. Outer Limits made a lot of Trash but there are Pearls and god are they good!
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"I don't know it, but [it is on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcHcYaLrKSk) so I will have to check it out."
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"Loved that one. There are a few moments where I forget it's CG, the people look so real."
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"It's A Quiet Night In, with the guy who played Wedge Antilles in Star Wars and Oona Chaplin from Game of Thrones. A great episode!"
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"Hmm there's a [potato quality 10 minutes on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GOF6PsSae0) but I don't know if that's the whole episode or not. I only saw the early 90s Tales from the Darkside movie, but I never caught the actual series, so I'm not even familiar with the format."
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"That show more than any other I've followed has really diverse opinions on what the good/bad episodes are. I liked Good Hunting but it wasn't one of my favorites, and I've seen my favorites on /r/LoveDeathAndRobots listed by other people as among the worst. I guess because they not only have different stories that people might feel differently about, but also different animation styles."
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),I loved this episode and really wish it was a full length movie
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"[Simon Says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhZaSyyqgY8) is on youtube, but I think maybe because of the remake series they sent the copyright bots out, and the Amazing Stories episode only seems to be for purchase."
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"Hmm that one's on [Hoopla](https://www.hoopladigital.com/title/11079883) if your library is affiliated with them (mine isn't, so I don't have access to it)."
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"I have no memory of this even existing. Henry Rollins as the Rod Serling type? Interesting. 

The Michael Rappaport one is the second half of Hate Puppets/Darkness, and [it is on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOr6dUZjLS4)."
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"With Peter O'Toole, wow! That's [on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFnx3Bs15vM)"
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),Loved the one where Carol Kane gave birth to a blue pyramid.
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"[The New Breed](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5veczk) is on DailyMotion. Haven't watched it yet, but Richard Thomas is always good as somewhat unsettling characters. 

And [Let the Punishment Fit the Crime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMC8YEkGoMg) is on youtube. With Catherine O'Hara! Definitely going to check that one out."
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"I wasn't really expecting anyone to go back to the kinescope era, but you have successfully come up with the deepest cuts in this thread."
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"I have a hard time imagining Ron Glass as the devil, but I'm intrigued."
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"I have an irrational dislike for all musicals, so that is not one of my favorites. But with Room 104 even more than most anthologies, no one will love every episode, but I think there's at least one episode for everyone."
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"Diddle Diddle Dumpling was another episode that I thought was really well executed and had some great performances.   I felt the twist was a bit predictable, but still well done."
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"Yes! I didn’t realize it was the same guy, that episode is definitely do for a re-watch. That whole series is amazing... I’m shocked Netflix hasn’t picked it up and given it the “Black Mirror” experience."
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),I'm curious what's your favorite?
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),It’s on dailymotion.  https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6hhiff
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"It’s a bummer Tales From the Crypt isn’t on HBO Max yet, but I did watch this on YT a few weeks ago and it’s still good.

The 90s Outer Limits was streaming on Hulu when I rewatched this...it’s on Amazon Prime now."
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),These were great. Some are sadly lost to time and space. This is truly the grandfather of all TV scifi. Just search it on IMDB and read some of the plot descriptions.
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoQ6ZC8EUQ0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoQ6ZC8EUQ0)
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),A Quiet Night In is one of my favorites. Such a great piece of media with almost no talking
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"For Americans, Hulu's had the first two seasons forever. HBO Max just picked up the later ones. I don't have a clue how the contracts worked out for them to end up in that condition.

But it's a little bit of a harder sell in the US than Black Mirror, because they frequently employ accents that are harder for us to understand, or reference cultural things that are lost on me at least (cryptic crosswords not being much of a thing here, for example). I didn't mind, and I enjoy the series a lot, but I think that (and the bad streaming situation) prevents it from being widely popular."
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),Probably either Beyond the Aquila Rift or Three Robots. The subreddit seems to love Zima Blue which I didn't like very much.
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"I agree but when Netflix snapped it was 2 seasons of a British show. I feel Netflix totally Americanized it with their own produced seasons, even toning down the subject matter. I could see then doing the same and making their own season. They are currently doing this same formula with Cobra Kai which they purchased from YouTube Red"
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),I had no idea about Max getting the later seasons. I've been trying to get them. Thanks! Now if only Max would be available on roku
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),I thought zima blue was fine and I liked Aquila Rift but I wasn't a fan of the 3 robots. I like the yogurt episode more than the robots
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"I think Charlie Brooker had pretty free reign on Black Mirror, so if anything got Americanized or toned down, it was his call (Crocodile, Shut Up And Dance, and Black Museum were hardly what I'd call toned down, though). 

And I wouldn't be surprised if the Steve and Reece were just happy with the BBC. Where they are, they can probably keep doing their show until they decide to stop. If Netflix buys it up, they could get bigger budgets and Hollywood guest stars, but they could also get cancelled if the viewers aren't there."
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"It’s been years since I’ve seen either episode yet the “Beauty is in the Eye of the Beholder” surgeon and the “Nightmare at 30,000 feet” monster both still give me chills.   What a phenomenal show, I really hope Jordan Peele can exceed expectations with the reboot."
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"Time Enough At Last  
Death's Head Revisited  
The Monsters are due at maple street.  


These episodes changed teenage me."
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),I like the black and white episode that deals with social commentary.
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"Walking Distance (S1E5) is probably my personal favorite. It's not as heavy on the fantasy or horror aspects as some other classic episodes, but it's a potent story for anyone aging out of their youth. "
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"*To Serve Man*, what a great episode. Cool depiction of *It's a Good Life,* the episode that featured Billy Mumy as a spoiled kid with limitless power. I'll stop now, because I'd be here all day.

&#x200B;"
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),Cool...how do i buy it?
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"What a show.

One of my favorite references of the show has to be Madagascar when the lemur's are in the plane and one frantically yells ""*It's a cookbook! IT'S A COOKBOOK!*"" while point to the book *To Serve Lemur*"
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"
Like something out of...The Twilight Zone.

Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo."
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),I gotta binge watch the series.  I keep watching 1 or 2 and not getting back to it for months.  I went to the Esty site to buy it and it looks like he had to pull it from sales.  Very cool poster.
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),I want this made into a 5000 piece jigsaw puzzle please...
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"I recently watch the episode ""The Lonely"" and the main characters name is James A. Corry. I believe this might have been the inspiration for the pen name that The Expanse authors used, James S.A. Corey.

The episode is about a man imprisoned alone on an asteroid on deep space."
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"CBS will find a way to fuck this up, while dragging Jordan Peele’s reputation. "
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),"I’ve never seen all of the episodes, but the episode Nothing in the Dark always stood out to me as very touching and timeless. 

I really hope we see episodes similar to that one in the new reboot. "
The Twilight Zone (Original Series),An occurrence at owl creek bridge made me weep and I still get misty eyed when I think of it
Noddy in Toyland,Shocked It’s a Wonderful Life isn’t on the itinerary.
Noddy in Toyland,Pretty interesting the only movie from the 90's is Little Women. Pretty rare to see something so recent on TCM.
Noddy in Toyland,I think NBCUniversal hoards the rights to that on broadcast and on cable (seen it on USA before)
Noddy in Toyland,Amazon Prime Video has it. 
Noddy in Toyland,It got so oversaturated in the 70's and 80's- it makes me glad NBC only plays it twice a year.
Noddy in Toyland,2nd and 3rd movies in the list are from the '90s
Noddy in Toyland,Interestingly I had never heard of those and they were by the same woman that's no longer with us: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Jacobson
Noddy in Toyland,"Especially now that Filmstruck is gone, I'm glad that TCM is still occasionally running stuff like this."
Noragami,"I don't suppose you could add a brief few sentences/words selling us on the series and why they're worth a watch and what makes them special? To me, I just see a laundry list of titles and genres honestly. 

Knowing the animation studio and year released is pretty much meaningless for knowing the quality of character development and plot depth."
Noragami,">Flip Flappers  
Land of the Lustrous  
Mawaru Penguindrum  
Noragami  
Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu  
Tanaka-kun is Always Listless  
Tsuritama  
Yona of the Dawn

Aaand you have great taste! Guess I'm gonna need to take recommendations off the rest of this list."
Noragami,"> Blood Blockade Battlefront

I was confused for a second there, then realized thats the English name for Kekkai Sensen."
Noragami,"Konosuba definitely should be on here for it's hilarious subversion, wherein everyone seems nice but are terrible people"
Noragami,My Hero Academia is also really excellent.
Noragami,"I think you can also add Megalo Box to this list. While the ending wasn't as good, rest of the show was still great, and might actually suit most of the audience here. The old school animation and design, etc. "
Noragami,"Next time I would include Animes that would appeal to Western Taste. Most of these will not be appealing for the general audience. 

Some good animes for the Western Taste (2010s only):

One-Punch Man (Action/Comedy. An overpowered dude that is a hero for fun).


My Hero Academica (Action/Coming of Age story. A weak powerless boy gets the most powerful superpower in the world and his tale to master this power without breaking everything in his body using it.)


Psycho Pass (Thriller/Crime. Dystopian Future where police kills everyone who has a hint of mental instability)

Parasyte (Thriller/Horror. Dude gets infected by an alien parasite but the infection doesn't go as planned.)

Edit: Forgot to add that these all have English Dubs. Most of the list above do not.
"
Noragami,"Gundam: Iron Blooded Orphans
Is a great one, its serious, the animation looks great, it does get dark because it deals with children piloting the mechs"
Noragami,"First, thank you putting this list together and trying to offer more exposure to an entire medium/format/genre (Japanese animation) that is, imo, underappreciated in the west. Now, on to a few thoughts/opinions:

When people actually ask for recommendations, it's best not to overwhelm them with options else they might feel overwhelmed and give up. If they get a response of ""Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, Death Note"" then they already have ~100 hours of watching ahead of them and those are totally fine options. 

There's a lot of comedy and slice of life on this list. While more variety sounds better on paper, I don't think those genres work as well as others with a language/culture barrier. They're usually more character focused and thus body language, dialog, inflection, dialect, translation, nuance, delivery, inside jokes, locality, animation style, etc. become more important. The usual Cowboy Bebop recommendations are generally more serious, conceptual, sci-fi, psychological, seinen, action, mystery -type series that show off what ""adult"" animation is capable of which result in more ""wow!"" experiences (and western media ""borrowing"" from them). The unfortunate ""anime stigma"" in the west is that anime is perverted and characters look/act like 12yo children (which westerners already have in the form of youth-targeted cartoons). So, while I personally really enjoy something like Kill La Kill, I don't think the over-the-top action, ridiculous plot, and easily misinterpreted sexualization would be a good starting point/leave a good first impression for the uninitiated. 

This list is great for those who have already watched most of the popular recommendations for westerners and want to branch out a bit more. That said, new fans should keep in mind that they'll probably dislike 95% of all anime produced. I've watched 300+ series and I wouldn't go anywhere near some of the stuff on this list. And that's OK; it's common with most hobbies/interests. Find what you like, look for more, have fun with it, share your experiences!

For reference, my favorite TV (top 10, random order):

* Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul
* Game of Thrones
* Westworld
* Black Mirror
* Lost
* The Wire
* Battlestar Galactica
* Utopia
* It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia
* Mr. Robot

My favorite anime (top 10, random order):

* Ghost in the Shell
* Ergo Proxy
* Evangelion
* Black Lagoon
* Cowboy Bebop
* Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann
* Full Metal Alchemist
* Steins;Gate
* Psycho-Pass
* Fate/Zero /Stay Night (UBW)"
Noragami,Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt
Noragami,"I was kinda hoping you would list [Uchuu Kyoudai](https://myanimelist.net/anime/12431/Uchuu_Kyoudai ) or Space Brothers in English.  Pretty good slice of life/sci fi about becoming an Astronaut.   Here is the [trailer with English sub for it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciS3fDqT1Vw )

Another series maybe not considered in the past decade is [Hajime No Ippo](https://myanimelist.net/anime/263/Hajime_no_Ippo ) even though the 3rd season (Hajime No Ippo: Rising) came out in 2013/2014.  Its a great sport/slice of life/comedy series."
Noragami,Needs more Jojo
Noragami,"i like cowboy bebop, ghost in the shell, FMA, samurai champloo

basically anime that does not rely on anime troupes and tells a great story, what would you recommend from this decade?

edit: action oriented is a plus"
Noragami,I'd like to throw a shout for Terror in Resonance too. Great show
Noragami,"Barakamon and Girls' Last Tour are two of my absolute favorite shows, and I'm pretty happy to see them make the list. Sora no Woto is up there too.

Those three are all slice-of-life type shows, a genre that can be pretty hit or miss, but these three do a great job of building a world (or a town, as in Barakamon) and making you keep watching because you're interested in that world, and the characters, even if there's no overreaching plot trying to tie everything together. They aren't necessarily exciting, but they're thoroughly enjoyable. And sometimes you just need a nice calm show like that."
Noragami,Kind of a weird post. I'd expect at least a sorry description with each show. A genre doesn't really cut it.
Noragami,"**Sora no Woto** is surprisingly good. Definitely not what I expected. It's part slice of life, part post-apocalypse, and also an anti-war story. And the music is fantastic. Occasionally feels like **Kino's Journey**, but somwhat less bleak. 

***
**Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu** is a slow burn, but is an exceptionally good period drama set in the post-postwar era where the Japanese economy was beginning to pick up again. One of the popular forms of entertainment was a style of traditonal comic storytelling called Rakugo. In an era where not many had televisions yet, they were often broadcast on radio. 

A recently released convict approaches one of the masters of this artform to become his disciple after having only heard his radio broadcasts in prison. Drama ensues. Lots of dialogue as you may expect. **Joshiraku** is a much less serious take on Rakugo, if you like terrible puns and Japanese cultural references you won't understand, this is for you. 

***
**Natsume's Book of Friends** is really one of the most heartbreaking yet heartwarming series I've ever seen. Main character is the only person who can see the denizens of the spirit world, resulting in him being ostracised by almost every human he meets due to his reaction to heir presence, but returning to his grandmother's hometown changes that, for better or worse. Partly episodic, but with some overarching plot. For another contemporary fantasy series that's kind of similar, try **The Ancient Magus' Bride**. **Mushishi** is also excellent and has a similar spirit detective vibe, but much more serious. "
Noragami,Didn't see Steins Gate on here..... Better than 90% 0f the things listed 
Noragami,"My Hero Academia and Assassination Classroom are noticeably not present :o  
I personally fuckin loved AC, I know it's not everyone's cup of tea, but I found it wholesome and touching"
Noragami,Madoka magica ! 
Noragami,"I’m not a huge anime fan. But I watched Erased recently... good lord that’s a fantastic show. Cool plot, good characters, good mystery. Plays on a fantasy I think a lot of people have at least once in their life. And there’s only one season. They got in, told their story, and got out."
Noragami,"Thank you so much, OP, for this! I haven't watched much of anime since my college days, and I have lost track of what's what. Thank you for the recommendations, definitely going to save this post."
Noragami,"You're Lie In April, imo, is also a must watch."
Noragami,Awh no your lie about in April 
Noragami,This is actually a really decent list
Noragami,You need to add Hunter x Hunter 2011 to this list 
Noragami,"You're forgetting

Noragami,"Mfw I've seen all of these. I just want to be a fresh weeb again :'(
"
Noragami,"Thank you for making this. I have a hard time keeping up with all the awesome anime coming out. I can barely keep up with all the western shows that are out. Just finishing up breaking bad.

I can recommend darling in the franxx."
Noragami,"If you are looking for slow burn anime's that don't have your typical Japanese pervy tropes, watch Mushishi and Monster. Masterpieces imo."
Noragami,"Blood Blockade Battlefront, Mob Psycho, and Made in Abyss are all in my top 10 anime. Very solid shows. "
Noragami,"What do you guys recommend as good mindfuck mystery type ones?

in the vein of Mirrai Nikki, Madoka Magica, Shinsekai yori"
Noragami,"My anime background is just the classics and most well known (DragonBall, Naruto, Bleach). Right now my only base for anime is Netflix. I've watched Attack on Titan, Tokyo Ghoul, Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, Sinbad, Death Note and One Punch Man, and currently I started watching Sword Art Online. 

Do you recommend it? Based on my viewing history and the Netflix catalogue what would you recommend I watch next?"
Noragami,I would say you’re missing Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure. Besides being awesome it’s a cultural touchstone in Anime that is constantly referenced and parodied. I would argue it’s a must watch show
Noragami,"\>K-On!  


My. Fucking. Man. The best taste."
Noragami,"Devilman crybaby is also a good anime, gory , but good."
Noragami,Add in wotakoi: love is hard for an otaku. It's a really good romance comedy that deals with adults instead of the regular HS ones
Noragami,No love for Welcome to the N.H.K.?
Noragami,"I'm someone who haven't watched a lot of anime since about 2008 or so, so I'll check out some of these, thanks. 

That said, I feel like the medium has definitely changed a lot since that time. So many shows now have either very strange animation styles (Kill la Kill, Made in Abyss, Devilman Crybaby...) or these strange formulaic stock characters everywhere (at least I don't remember people talking about tsunderes and moes and I don't know what back in the day). I'm sure there's a lot of good stuff once you get past these things, but in most cases nowadays I don't get further than some weirdass synopsis before I sigh and re-watch Black Lagoon or Claymore instead. And I'm someone who, despite not immersing myself into the anime/""weabo"" culture, has after all read and watched quite a lot of manga and anime in my time, and someone who likes 'weird' stuff Evangelion or Gantz.

I think that's the reason why Attack on Titan has been such a hit here in the West, despite imho not being that good of a show (it seems to go for repeated 'shocks' over telling an engaging story). It has a pretty 'realistic' and good looking animation style, characters that for the most part look rather normal, and though the premise is a bit strange it's very straight-forward once it gets going."
Noragami,"Recently saw Made in Abyss because a lot of people have been raving about it.

The main characters are a girl of 14, and a robot that looks like a boy of about the same age.

I would like it a lot more, if there were not shit like recurring ""jokes"" where people look down the robot boys pants and exclaim that he has a penis. 

Like often when people were recommending it, I'd see em specify that it was not for children, and I kinda assumed that was because of horror elements or something. Like god dammit Japan."
Noragami,"Ummm...My Hero Academia?

It's an amazing shonen series with much better pacing, animation and characters than a lot of its contemporaries."
Noragami,"Another one I’d absolutely recommend if you’re looking for a more light hearted/comedic take on anime is “The Devil is a Part Timer”. 

Really funny, great story and quick watch. Premise is pretty simple, Devil comes back to earth and tries to take over the world...by working in fast food. 

If I’m not mistaken it’s still on Netflix, highly highly recommend."
Noragami,Parastye -the maxim- should 100% be on this list. 
Noragami,"I'm gonna use this thread to mention that, yes, One Piece has over 800 episodes, but it is probably the most pure fun that you can find while still managing to be epic, emotional and engaging. "
Noragami,"Your lie in april. 

Shokugeki no soma 

Nanatsu no taizai"
Noragami,I'll martyr myself and list Tokyo Ghoul. I guess it's become pretty 'normie' but i still really enjoyed it. Also The Lost Village was a pretty neat short one.
Noragami,I recognized so few animes in that list. Feel like you're missing a TON.
Noragami,"Damn. When you realize all of the super popular anime you liked as a kid aren’t part of this decade lol 

Old. "
Noragami,Does crunchyroll or funimation offer offline/download & play yet? That's been my biggest obstacle to consuming anime.
Noragami,Black Clover?
Noragami,.
Noragami,I would recommend Made in Abyss. Only one season and it's already one of my favorites.
Noragami,Beast Player Erin (Kemono no Sōja) is a really good one that I never hear anyone mention.
Noragami,"Pretty good list, though I'd add Higurashi (the official stuff, essentially seasons 1 and 2.) for how damn good it was it combining the slice of life with horror, especially the more psychological aspects. Umineko is different, but good just somewhat odd at times and feels better to read than merely watch. 
"
Noragami,"Baki 2018. Absolutely brutal fighting. If you are squeamish do not watch. It is metal as hell though, I love it.


I could probably recommend some others but I'll leave it at that."
Noragami,[deleted]
Noragami,"Don't forget to request to get new seasons of your favorite anime:

https://help.netflix.com/en/titlerequest"
Noragami,"I've only ever watched one anime in my adult life and that's Attack on Titan. I really enjoyed it but I'm fine not watching anything else. I have some personal hang ups about anime being ""for kids"", even the one tailored for mature audiences. "
Noragami,"Not only are these shows that fall out of the ""Same 10 anime"" thing. They're all shows that I can see actually getting people into anime. Shows like FMA:B and Death Note are shows that feel detached enough for people to think ""I'm not too sure about anime, but Fullmetal Alchemist is pretty good"" instead of ""hey maybe I like anime"". All of these shows (at least the ones I've seen) are both great and feel like anime. Good list.


I also want to boost March Comes in Like a Lion to anyone reading this. It's one of my favorite shows. It follows a 17 year old depressed professional Shogi player who just recently started living on his own. Over the course of the series you watch him open up to people and form a familiar relationship that he's never really had in his life. You don't need to know anything about Shogi to understand the show."
Noragami,"I'd like to think that Shouwa Genjou Rakugo Shinju is the pinnacle of anime in recent years. THE series that towers above the rest. It's not my favourite series for sure, but it comes incredibly close to perfection in so many ways. I doubt I'd recommend it to someone new to anime, but there's no excuse for anyone who calls themselves an avid fan of anime to not watch Rakugo. 

And then there's Ping Pong... The things I would give to see another series of this caliber. I'm so glad to see it on your list."
Noragami,All are pretty good except Yuru Camp and Flip Flappers
Noragami,"Kobayashi's Dragon Maid is probably the first new-ish anime I've fully watched in years, since Bodacious Space Pirates and Jormungand. It's poignant, cute, a little... creepy... but still heartily recommended."
Noragami,"I was never an Anime fan.  I remember enjoying Ninja Scroll back in the 90's, but that's about it.  Then one day 'Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress' popped up on Amazon Prime, and I clicked on it, because there was nothing else to watch.  Loved it.  As soon as I finished it, I wanted to see even more.  Attack on Titan was a recommendation I've heard over and over, so I started watching it next.  It was even better than the Iron Fortress.  The animation, the soundtrack, the story - they were all just perfect, and I couldn't wait for more.

While waiting for the next season, I was eager to see all the other great anime shows I've been missing out on.  But here's where the disappointment came.  I would check dozens of the top recommended shows, and they simply weren't my cup of tea.  Either the animation was looking like something made in the 80's, or the story was just meh.  I could barely watch one episode, before giving up in the search of the next Attack on Titan. 

It all made sense, when I found out both Attack on Titan, and Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress are made by the same studio.  I have yet to find any other anime show that comes close to those two.  And this is not me shitting on other shows.  I'm sure they're great, but they just don't do it for me.  There's just something about AoT or KotIF, whether it's the awesome visuals, or soundtrack, that put them in a league of their own."
Noragami,"No sword art online season 1?

What's the point?


Jk (though I do like SAO)

Great list op thanks for sharing"
Noragami,"Maybe doesn't *technically* count, but 48% of Gintama (and potentially more, maybe, hopefully) has come after your cutoff date, and imo Gintama is a legendary anime. Action/comedy, has survived multiple hiatuses, and has reportedly been more profitable than Bleach or Naruto in Western countries, made even more incredible due to its lack of an English dub or mainstream viewing channel (such as Cartoon Network's Toonami). Insane amounts of fun, and I'm incredibly sad to be seeing it go."
Noragami,[deleted]
Noragami,"Totally expected, but still dissapointed that there's no Yu-Gi-Oh. :p  
Just fits well with my personal taste.  
  
My favorite beyond that though is the old anime Ranma ½. Although the manga has better plots and characterization, love the animation, voices and music. :D"
Noragami,"Look at you making a worthless list that doesn't include whether there is a dub, which makes it awful, and by extension you awful."
Noragami,"Oh! I can do a brief rundown of all of them. Give me a few minutes and I'll be back with a few words about each.  


EDIT: OKAY! Here we go.

**Barakamon:** brash young calligrapher gets exiled to the boonies to find himself

**Blood Blockade Battlefront:** secret society of supers fight weird monsters in wacky New York

**Cells at Work:** Osmosis Jones but with a cute redhead as the lead instead of Chris Rock

**Chihayafuru:** Sports show about a poetry card game. Cooler than it sounds.

**Death Parade:** Bar in purgatory hosts games to judge souls’ fates

**The Eccentric Family:** An eccentric family of shapeshifters go about their lives

**Erased:** Time travel murder mystery where the time travel isn’t that big of a deal. Tearjerker.

**Flip Flappers:** I literally cannot describe it beyond “two magical girls and trippy world”

**Flying Witch:** Extremely relaxing show about a witch training in the countryside

**Girls’ Last Tour:** Two girls journey across a harsh post apocalyptic wasteland. Philosophy?

**Haikyuu:** Hot guys play volleyball. Character development.

**Hyouka:** Bored high schoolers solve boring mysteries. Show is anything but boring.

**K-On:** Cute high school girls play in a band and eat cake. Super comfy.

**Katanagatari:** Finding swords? Weird art style. Weirder dialogue.

**Kids on the Slope:** Realistic jazz coming of age in the 60s. Great music.

**Kill la Kill:** Skimpy lingerie battles at fascist high school. Way better than it sounds.

**Kyousogiga:** Similarly trippy, often confusing show about multidimensional family. Fantastic.

**Land of the Lustrous:** One of the few 3D CGI anime worth your time. About gem people, but not the Steven Universe kind.

**Little Witch Academia:** Harry Potter.

**Love, Chuunibyou, and Other Delusions:** Cute middle schoolers do things? Haven’t seen it.

**Lupin III:** Classic, classy thief steals riches and hearts. Got Miyazaki his start.

**Made in Abyss:** Don’t go exploring the big scary hole, kids. Don’t.\\

**March comes in like a Lion:** Drama about a chess prodigy and his relationships. One of the best. 

**Mawaru Penguindrum:** Brothers and penguins(?) try to help their sister. Haven’t seen it.

**Miss Kobayashi:** Fun, funny show about a woman who adopts a bunch of dragon people into her life

**Mob Psycho 100:** Cool, trippy, great action show about a kid with super psychic powers

**Monthly Girls’ Nozaki Kun:** High school girl’s crush on romance manga artist goes unnoticed; she becomes his assistant in this wacky, hilarious comedy about romance.

**My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU:** Catcher in the Rye if it were anime and there were three Holdens. Very good.

**Mushishi:** Cool-ass spirit detective does spirit detective shit

**Nagi no Asukara:** Very pretty show about water people(?) Haven’t seen it.

**Natsume’s Book of Friends:** Arguably the closest you’ll get to a Ghibli TV show. Guy has spirit friends.

**Nichijou:** Wacky sketch comedy about wacky insane people. Very good.

**Noragami:** Haven’t seen it …. a fallen god is trying to get back on his feet(?)

**Ore Monogatari:** Gentle giant falls in love with pint sized classmate. Adorable as fuck.

**Ping Pong the Animation:** Guys play ping pong, learn about themselves. Looks wacky. Is fantastic.

**A Place Further than the Universe:** Girls go to Antarctica. Sweet and touching show.

**Polar Bear Cafe:** Polar bears and other animals run a cafe (?) Haven’t seen it.

**Shinsekai Yori:** WORLDBUILDING. New generation of humans trying to figure out about themselves(?)

**Shirobako:** An anime show about making anime shows. It’s incredible, heartwarming and educational.

**Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu:** Stand up comedy but it’s sit-down comedy and it’s very old fashioned. Character drama about artists in a dying medium in the 60s, 70s, 80s, and beyond. Slow burn that’s easily one of the best shows of the last few years, anime or no.

**So Ra No Wo To:** Girls in a small brigade run an army corps of musicians. Also they have a tank? There’s more to it but I can’t remember.

**Sound Euphonium:** High school concert band, and all the character drama and shenanigans that go with it. Very good.

**Space Dandy:** About a dandy guy in space. Lots of sexual humor. From the guy who made Cowboy Bebop. 

**Tamako Market:** Girl living in a market district has fun shenanigans with friends. Warm and comfy. The talking bird grows on you. Oh, also there’s a dark-skinned prince who shows up.

**Tanaka kun is Always Restless:** haven’t seen this one -- it’s about a guy who’s always lazy. But supposedly it’s very good.

**Tatami Galaxy:** Very fast dialogue, weird visuals. About a guy figuring out his life in college. Once you get the hang of it, it’s very entertaining and relatable.

**Tsuki ga Kirei:** Adorable show about middle schoolers’ first love.

**Tsuritama:** Haven’t seen it. IIRC there’s a guy who’s like a mermaid? Comedy, I think.

**Usagi Drop:** Relaxing, sweet show about a bachelor who takes in his grandfather’s six year old daughter from an affair. 

**Violet Evergarden:** Gorgeous show about PTSD and a young woman who becomes a letter writer in a semi 1930s world. Don’t go in expecting an action show. 

**Yona of the Dawn:** Semi-historical action adventure about a princess and her crew who go rogue.

**Yuru Camp:** Comfy show about high schoolers camping. Will make you want to camp."
Noragami,[deleted]
Noragami,"Nichijou, Ping Pong the Animation, Sound! Euphonium, Kyousougiga, and A Place Further than the Universe are my next biggest recommendations.

Also, I actually almost didn't include Noragami, as I had some problems with the 1st season, but damn was Noragami Aragoto amazing. It's everything I love about battle shounen (a genre I'm not really a fan of) but without the filler. Too bad we'll never get a 3rd season."
Noragami,"Haha yeah i decided to use english names unless it's so uncommon. I've seen a fair amount of people online refer to kekkai sensen by the english name, so i went with that. In contrast, I've literally never heard anyone call Nagi no Asukara by the english name: A Lull in the Sea."
Noragami,"Agreed. One could make an argument that it's the anime equivalent to It's Always Sunny. 

Not me obvious, but someone else could."
Noragami,"Watched it but didn't find it quite as funny as others. Then again, I actually like Isekai as a genre (I know some dismiss it) and would probably have recommended Overlord at least. Honorable mentions to Re:Zero, Death March, and even Knights & Magic IMO though I know that last one is held up by many as an example of what is wrong with Isekai shows. "
Noragami,"It's so popular I feel the OP decided it didn't need another shout out.

But yeah, it's a pretty good show."
Noragami,"It just annoys me how none of the heroes ever die.

Kills the suspense everytime they battle these villains who are more experienced and powerful than them."
Noragami,Watching that show only makes me pine for OPM that much more. 
Noragami,I feel it's just a copy of Naruto. 
Noragami,How does it compare in tone/style etc to Hajime no Ippo? Definitely loving the idea of another boxing anime.
Noragami,"Oh right, I should get around to watching that."
Noragami,"Parasyte is really good, Imagine Japanese Peter Parker turned into venom before he ever became spider-man, and takes the responsibility to make sure to the best of his ability that humans and alien body snatchers are able to co exist secretly without everyone dying. 

"
Noragami,I dunno those first two are the sort of over-recommended shows that the OP was trying to avoid. 
Noragami,"> Next time I would include Animes that would appeal to Western Taste

Baccano!"
Noragami,Psycho Pass season one is AMAZING
Noragami,Pretty sure OP was going for non-generic picks.
Noragami,"OPM, MHA and Psycho Pass are such cliche recommendations. They're good but defeat the whole purpose of this list. 

This whole ""Western Taste"" nonsense is so exaggerated "
Noragami,"-	imo One Punch Man wore its premise thin pretty quickly
-	I guess I kinda liked My Hero Academia, but that's about it.
-	Psycho Pass sits just right outside my list because of the disappointing 2nd season.
-	I have to give it to you for Parasyte tho. Great show that I somehow forgot while making this list. Not sure which one it would replace tho (probably Kill la Kill or Tanaka-kun is Always Listless)"
Noragami,I'd throw in Berserk and Hunter x Hunter and then call it a day.
Noragami,"Do they get all emo and decide to defeat their enemies through power of love/friendship/telepathy/whatever?

Because I am watching Gundam Unicorn and it's abysmal. Especially since I watched Gundam 8th MS Team, Thunderbolt and Origins before this one and those seemed way superior even though Unicorn is supposed to be some hot stuff.

I mean, where did all that emo/telepathy stuff come from all of a sudden?  

"
Noragami,"My taste overlaps with you quite a bit on live action. I couldn't get into Black Lagoon or Gurren Lagann, but I'll try to give Ergo Proxy, Steins;Gate, Psycho-Pass, and Ghost in the Shell a shot.

Thanks!"
Noragami,This show was hilarious
Noragami,I will never forgive Gainax for what they did in the finale. God fucking damn it. I'm pissed years later.
Noragami,"Damnit how did i forget about this show? If I had to replace a show on my list with Space Brothers, it'd probably be Kill la Kill or Death Parade."
Noragami,Agreed. Every anime fan needs more Jojo!
Noragami,"Since you've seem Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo, the logical next step is to see Space Dandy made by the same director. Where Cowboy Bebop was jazz and Samurai Champloo was hip hop, Space Dandy is disco/funk. It's also a lot weirder than the other two, but in a good way."
Noragami,"My main recs would be Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu and Ping Pong the Animation. You could also maybe try Death Parade, Erased, Katanagatari, Natsume's Book of Friends, Shinsekai Yori, and The Tatami Galaxy."
Noragami,"It's from the 90s but it basically takes the cake when it comes to throwing anime tropes on their head: Neon Genesis Evangelion.  Giant robots fighting giant... ""monsters"" plus depression."
Noragami,"A little late but I would recommend these. parasyte, banana fish, Durarara, psycho pass, and dororo which is airing me but is very good."
Noragami,"Watch kids on the slope, same person who did bebop Anh champloo"
Noragami,Agreed. One of the best shows I’ve seen tbh.
Murdoch Mysteries,"I feel like it is a plot point and/or storyline that is interesting to pursue. If you look at the comments on the Murdoch Mysteries Facebook page, you can see why these types of stories are needed, as there are many people other, especially older people, who took offense with homosexual/bisexual PDAs, which is rather sad. 

Dr.Grace is still very cute, and I am glad that they are exploring her character more. "
Murdoch Mysteries,"Does no one here actually watch Murdoch? 

I [know](http://www.broadcastermagazine.com/news/cbc-reports-its-primetime-schedule-garners-record-breaking-numbers/1003467955/?&er=NA) over one in thirty five Canadians watch it"
Murdoch Mysteries,"I am, too! But ughhhh why with Lillian Moss? She was the one talking about how violence is often necessary when protesting 2 episodes back right? I can't believe she had the audacity to say that to Dr. Ogden and defend it! Didn't like her tone and her character from then. She better treat Dr.Grace right. "
Murdoch Mysteries,"Line of Duty. It's a British drama about an anti-corruption unit within the police force, and Series 4 just finished airing about a week ago, but it has been renewed for 2 more series. Thandie Newton was in the last series and she was so good in it. I think it is on Hulu in the US."
Murdoch Mysteries,"Harlots. Very good show with a kind of poor/cheap marketing.  Good acting, great costumes and production values, compelling story lines. "
Murdoch Mysteries,Shetland. Nice little murder mystery show from the UK. I love the setting in particular. Series 4 is being made now.
Murdoch Mysteries,I really like This is Us and it had monster ratings but it was rarely discussed here.
Murdoch Mysteries,12 Monkeys
Murdoch Mysteries,Travelers.....MAN I LOVE THIS SHOW. Just the best show to shut off your brain and just watch. 
Murdoch Mysteries,The Amazing World of Gumball
Murdoch Mysteries,I loved Trial and Error. I hope it gets renewed. 
Murdoch Mysteries,"*The Get Down* on Netflix.

It's about the last days of disco and the birth of hip-hop in 1970s the Bronx.   Produced by Grandmaster Flash and Nas, Baz Luhrman is the showrunner and a director. I love it, but it's so rarely discussed that sometimes it feels like I imagined the whole thing."
Murdoch Mysteries,"I *love* Versailles 

You can see it on Netflix. It's basically about Louis XIV (and his brother) moving his court from Paris to Versailles and the construction of his new palace. 

I'm a shameless sucker for court intrigue and the production design on this show is excellent.




"
Murdoch Mysteries,"Outcast. The show is phenomenal and doing a really good job of adapting the comics. The leads are great, the show is brooding and tense, and the problem is:

Most people don't know season 2 has 6 episodes out already. It's been releasing in EU but FX is being stingy with releasing the show in US/CAN. Rumor is that they're cancelling production, and I think that'd be awful. It's really not getting the love it deserves, which is also the fault of FX if they're not willing to support it.

Edit: Cinemax, not FX"
Murdoch Mysteries,Impractical Jokers
Murdoch Mysteries,"Catastrophe. I don't see it discussed a lot, but I think it's one of the shows that makes me laugh out loud the most. "
Murdoch Mysteries,*Power* is pretty great and I've never seen even one thread on it.
Murdoch Mysteries,"Absolutely love Call the Midwife. I kind of want to hate on it for being too feel good but it really covers social change, a changing world, women's places after the war, and heck, I'm even into the babies of the week. I wasn't sure how the show could survive past some cast departures but I'm still into it. "
Murdoch Mysteries,Speechless
Murdoch Mysteries,"It literally just ended, but Bates Motel. They did a great job of reimagining the backstory of Norman Bates. They kept it familiar, while still changing it enough to feel fresh. Vera Farminga and Freddie Highmore did an incredible acting job as well. "
Murdoch Mysteries,"Havent seen them yet but Outsiders, Underground and Queen Sugar are on my list and people rave about them on other boards but they never get mentioned here at all."
Murdoch Mysteries,"Wynonna Earp

Big Brother

The Mick

"
Murdoch Mysteries,Angie Tribeca has been on fire for season 2 and 3. Just amazing. 
Murdoch Mysteries,"The Magicians is amazing, and almost never talked about on here. I wished more people knew about it"
Murdoch Mysteries,"Crazy Ex-Girlfriend. Well-written comedy and really nuanced exploration of what it's like to struggle with obsession, unhealthy relationships, and possible mental disorders like depression without making the character seem either too fake or too unlikeable. I normally hate musicals and love the musical numbers on this show.

Gets perpetually low ratings on CW too, despite their Golden Globe wins! It's on Netflix and Season 3 is coming back in the fall."
Murdoch Mysteries,"I've been enjoying Brockmire. Mostly for Hank Azaria's voice, but it has its moments. "
Murdoch Mysteries,"The Detour, hands down my favorite family comedy. By a lot."
Murdoch Mysteries,Kingdom. Season 3 comes back next month. This show is sooo good. 
Murdoch Mysteries,"Survivor

Often dismissed because it's a reality show, but I recommend it to anyone who enjoys quality, well made TV."
Murdoch Mysteries,Schitt's Creek. Great show I started in Netflix. 
Murdoch Mysteries,"Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency. Fantastic retelling of the Douglas Adams novel, also starting Elijah Wood. It premiered in  BBC America last October, and I would see a couple comments here and there about it, but nothing big."
Murdoch Mysteries,"***The Mindy Project*** and ***Difficult People*** don't get a lot of love. Also, Netflix's ***Love*** never gets talked about, which is unfortunate because this past season was a really great season of television. Also ***Transparent*** is one of the best shows on air and rarely gets talked about.

Then there's the shows that ended already and never received their proper discussions: ***Looking***, ***Girls***, ***Enlightened***"
Murdoch Mysteries,"the middle, mom, the goldbergs, speechless, impractical jokers"
Murdoch Mysteries,"Lethal Weapon 

It's a guilty pleasure because it's yet another procedural show but I genuinely enjoy it. The characters are a little different from the movies but it still captures the spirit of them pretty well. It's just a fun show all in all. "
Murdoch Mysteries,"Anne was just released on Netflix, but it already aired in Canada, where it was a national phenomenon. It's said most stores closed early when it was on. Strangely, there are no threads about it here.  "
Murdoch Mysteries,I don't think a single person mentioned Black-Ish. Really funny and has amazing social commentary. 
Murdoch Mysteries,"The Last Ship 

It starts off overly military/murica eff yeah but then becomes probably one of the more thrilling and entertaining shows I've seen. It's only gotten better. I don't want to say more due to spoilers but there is a lot of fun international politics in a post-disaster world.

ALSO... Into the Badlands.

Probably one of the only good things AMC is airing right now. It takes place in a world well after an apocalyptic event took place and the worldbuilding in this new world is pretty good. Good fights (crazy, almost hammy levels of kung fu) and the story is interesting."
Murdoch Mysteries,"""One Day at a Time"" on Netflix

This is a family sitcom, so automatically people aren't going to talk about it. But it is probably the best current sitcom out there. It is such a perfect combination of earnest schmaltz and hilarious goofyness. Also, being on Netflix, this is the first sitcom I've ever seen with a very strong plot follow-through from one eisode to the next.

It's touching and saccharine, like a good sitcom of it's type should be. It's outrageous in parts. But it handles that balance better than  most (certainly better than Full House or similar). And it deals with interesting subject matter that is rarely addressed on mainstream TV.   "
Murdoch Mysteries,Bosch
Murdoch Mysteries,You're the Worst
Murdoch Mysteries,Into The Badlands. Criminally underrated show. The fight choreography is imo the best on television right now.
Murdoch Mysteries,"I love all of those cooking and traveling shows like Andrew zimmern and Anthony boardgame (or however you spell it).

Also divers drive-ins and dives. Watch those shows compulsively. Used to really hate guy, but now I find he's okay.

"
Murdoch Mysteries,Chicago Med is my jam. And Blue Bloods.
Murdoch Mysteries,Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown is the single best written and beautifully shot travel show that I've ever seen.
Murdoch Mysteries,"I haven't seen any talk about Sneaky Pete, but I really enjoyed it. Also:

Humans

Flowers 

Crazyhead"
Murdoch Mysteries,There's this show called Travelers on Netflix and it's honestly pretty great 
Murdoch Mysteries,People of Earth
Murdoch Mysteries,"The Middle, my favourite network comedy. "
Murdoch Mysteries,While it's seems like a second season is unlikely Quarry was criminally underwatched. Easily my favorite show of 2016 and I'm convinced if it aired on HBO instead of Cinemax it would have been a hit.
Murdoch Mysteries,One Punch Man
Murdoch Mysteries,Animal Kingdom on TNT
Murdoch Mysteries,[deleted]
Murdoch Mysteries,"No one ever discusses BET shows like Being Mary Jane nor Rebel.

And now that I think about, shows on OWN, like Queen Sugar, aren't discussed either.

Maybe I'm grasping, but are shows that appeal more to a female demographic not discussed because most of the people on this subreddit are male?"
Murdoch Mysteries,Hunter X Hunter. I'm not a big anime guy but this show keeps amazing me each week.
Murdoch Mysteries,"Dear white people, i only see outrage and no discussion and it's​ a shame cause it's a good show regardless of what you think about the title or how many shows with minorities are bombarding the media with politics.

It's​ constantly calling itself out and also putting things in perspective. Coco episode made me really sad even though I'm not a black girl from South Chicago.

I've only seen like 6 episodes but the show works."
Murdoch Mysteries,"The Good Place is fantastic, especially the twist at the end. It's written by the Parks and Rec people"
Murdoch Mysteries,Saving Hope. 
Murdoch Mysteries,"Rogue - started strong and gets better every season. Its in season 4 now and one of the best shows on tv.

Line of Duty - British police drama. first season is ok, but it also gets better every year. Season 4 just ended very strong.

Thandie Newton stars in both shows, but in different seasons."
Murdoch Mysteries,"Grace and Frankie 

Angie Tribeca 

Speechless 

Life in Pieces 

Travelers 

Trial and Error "
Murdoch Mysteries,Gomorrah. 
Murdoch Mysteries,I've started to watch Murdoch Mysteries on Netflix. Really like that show. A procedural but set in 1890's-1900's Toronto. Some pretty good plots and a charming cast.
Murdoch Mysteries,60 days in
Murdoch Mysteries,Making History. Great show that nobody had time for in their Sunday schedule.
Murdoch Mysteries,Globe Trekker 
Murdoch Mysteries,19-2 is a bloody great show. 
Murdoch Mysteries,"I was really blown away by  Good Behavior earlier this year, it's so tense and well shot "
Murdoch Mysteries,"Not technically airing at this moment, but the season 2 premiere is in a couple of weeks: Animal Kingdom."
Murdoch Mysteries,"Bloodline

Chicago Fire

Designated Survivor"
Murdoch Mysteries,The Expanse
Murdoch Mysteries,"Lopez on tvland.

 Animals on hbo. "
Murdoch Mysteries,"The Killing Fields.  Wish they'd solve the case, though."
Murdoch Mysteries,"There was a lot of build up before the new MST3K episodes, but besides the Kaiju song from the first episode getting posted I don't think I've seen anything about it since release.

Also, Billions."
Murdoch Mysteries,Your Pretty Face Is Going To Hell on Adult Swim. I smoke a lot of weed though and like any dumb crap that channel airs.
Murdoch Mysteries,"Technically it just ended, but Ripper Street was criminally under appreciated. Also Turn."
Murdoch Mysteries,Life in Pieces is great
Murdoch Mysteries,Stan Lee's Lucky man 
Murdoch Mysteries,"Gurilla, madiba, hap and lenord, underground,"
Murdoch Mysteries,The Late Late Show with James Corden. A very worthy successor to Craig Ferguson.
Murdoch Mysteries,"All the good stuff comes from people saying, ""here's some money, give us something good"". HBO has done that in the past, but now it's about netflix/Amazon early days. They have the faith in creative people to do something impressive. And they continue to do that, and draw big audiences because of that.

People talk about the golden age of the BBC: They were just too drunk to be paying attention. But they still get the credit."
Murdoch Mysteries,Lady Dynamite on netflix. It's like Louie but with a women. 
Murdoch Mysteries,Fargo! Such an awesome show.
Murdoch Mysteries,"dont wanna sound racist but Fresh off the Boat is only ethnic people will get, im sure there is white people who enjoy this show due to 90s nostalgia but the message is for ethnics from the 90s too, however the further this show goes the whiter it will get since it is on network tv. I love the show as it is the same struggle my parents went through and my late cool grandma that assimilated to western television which she enjoyed, instead of Garfield, she was a Pink Panther fan. "
Murdoch Mysteries,Candy Crush 
Murdoch Mysteries,I'll be suprised if it hasn't been mentioned before (if not for a few years) but The I.T. Crowd is one of my favourite all-time shows 
Murdoch Mysteries,Atlanta
Murdoch Mysteries,Game of Thrones. All the posts I see here is about late night talk shows.
Murdoch Mysteries,"Rick and Morty is really good

edit- guys, this was a joke"
Murdoch Mysteries,I will check this one out. It sounds really interesting.
Murdoch Mysteries,One of my favourite shows right now - it's criminal how little attention it seems to get.
Murdoch Mysteries,Hey there fella! The last scene of the season 4 finale.. fucked me up 
Murdoch Mysteries,"Line of Duty is in my opinion the best show that was airing about this period of time. I enjoyed its episodes even more than Better Call Saul ones (which of course is still airing and has more episodes to come). 


"
Murdoch Mysteries,Exactly! Its got game of thrones level intrigue and amazing performances! Everyone should be watching this show!
Murdoch Mysteries,well i guess i'm sold now 
Murdoch Mysteries,"Yeah Hulu seems to focus most of their marketing on The Handmaids Tale, which from the look of it, looks to be Hulu's breakout hit, so it makes sense why they marketed that show. "
Murdoch Mysteries,Sounds like a show my wife would like. Marked!
Murdoch Mysteries,"Shetland is great, one of my favorites that I've seen on PBS, up there with Case Histories."
Murdoch Mysteries,"Yeah the show was a smash hit, but not really with the 20 something male demo, which is the majority of reddit.  Never really hear a peep about it here."
Murdoch Mysteries,"Man, I love the writing and all of the actors were really talented and well cast but I just cannot get into how it was directed. It's too melodramatic for me. Like, it didn't trust its audience to keep up so it just pummels with ""this is happy"" ""this is sad"" ""this is tragic"" ""this is joyous"". "
Murdoch Mysteries,"There's a pretty active subreddit for This Is Us, actually. Sure it's quieter now, but when the episodes were airing, the discussions were great."
Murdoch Mysteries,Love that show. I'm curious if the weird airing schedule means this is the last season.

"Love, Now","Community. It came up in my Netflix feed over and over again, and I just brushed it off thinking it would never be my cup of tea; I'm not huge on most sitcoms. But a friend of mine eventually *insisted* that I give it a try, and I fell in love with it. The show has such a great cast, and a really surprising amount of heart given the premise of the show. 

&#x200B;

On the plus side, I came into the fandom just in time to appreciate the #SIxSeasonsAndaMovie prophecy being fulfilled!!"
"Love, Now",Bosch.  Didn't think it would be my thing then absolutely powered through it in a couple days and watched the sequel series.  Can't wait for it to come back :D.
"Love, Now","Honestly Better Call Saul, I remember trying it a while ago and it bored me, but after a slightly recent rewatch of Breaking Bad and a more mature mindset, I gotta say it’s the better of the two"
"Love, Now","What we do in the shadows-- just tossed it aside because I didn't think vampires were entertaining after being somewhat forced to watch the HBO vampire show ( wife LOVED her vampire porn who was I to complain?). Turns out WWDITS is really funny!

Alone-- thought it was another BS survival show where cameras follow around a survival ""expert"". Nope, people actually struggling against nature in competition with each other. Totally mesmerizing!"
"Love, Now",Game of Thrones. Resisted the hype for years. Somewhere after season three or four I started from the beginning with my siste and loved it. And than came the final season.😖
"Love, Now","The mick and superstore, both a little slow on the front end but pick up really well"
"Love, Now","Babylon 5 for me. I kept avoiding it despite numerous people saying that it's so good, largely because the effects and the aesthetics are quite dated.

Eventually, at some point in time I ran out of shows to watch, and I decided to try out Babylon 5 to see if it's really good as people say it is. 

***They are right.***"
"Love, Now",Hey they’ve been from deserts to mountains to rainforests in Stargate Canada. Am currently finishing up a rewatch of SG Atlantis.
"Love, Now","Not recent, but Fringe.

I started watching it when it first aired, but I  stopped after a few episodes.  Not that I thought it was particularly bad, but I was watching a lot of shows at the time and something had to go.

Years later I watched it on streaming and wished I had dropped something else!"
"Love, Now",Derry Girls. From the look of it I thought it wasn't for me but I'm really loving it. Such well written characters
"Love, Now","As a Hispanic male, absolutely NOTHING about Downton Abbey was specifically tailored to my interests or demographic but man did I fall in love with that show. Randomly saw the first episode and was hooked. I kinda regret watching it all so fast in such a short amount of time while not properly savoring it"
"Love, Now",Frasier. Everyone is absolutely charming and hilarious.
"Love, Now","You’re the worst. I only watched the first episode for some reason, then came back to it this year out of utter boredom. Watched all of it in about a week and a half and was stunned at how good it is!"
"Love, Now","Not watching it currently, but Better Call Saul.  I watched and loved Breaking Bad, but wasn't that interested in seeing a show about Saul.  It wasn't until around the time when El Camino came out that I got interested in it.  That movie may not have been the greatest thing to come out of Breaking Bad, but I liked it, and it got me back into that whole world.  That, mixed with tons of comments I was seeing about how good BCS had become convinced me to give it a chance, and I'm so glad I did.  Great expansion of the character himself, giving him much more depth than on BB, with a great set of supporting characters, both old and new.

Edit:  And honestly, I put it right up there with Frasier as one of the best spin-offs of all time."
"Love, Now","Quantum Leap. The original, not the remake"
"Love, Now","Not currently watching but Dexter, I watched half an episode and thought it was so boring, then watched it again 2 years later and now it's one of my favorite shows."
"Love, Now","The Leftovers. Watched the pilot when it first came out, then I took 5 years to start again and was blessed with the best show I’ve ever seen."
"Love, Now","Killjoys.  

Watched the premiere, thought it low budget and derivative. Started again and I am so glad I did. It’s super fun."
"Love, Now",Star Trek: Deep Space 9. I couldn’t get into it when I was younger and binged it when I was older.
"Love, Now",Chernobyl is amazing
"Love, Now",I blew off the first few seasons of Bob's Burgers and now it's one of my favorite shows
"Love, Now","I remember blowing off Farscape and Babylon 5 when they were on Scy-fi, but now I have Blu-ray collections of both."
"Love, Now","Ted Lasso and holy shit is it infectiously good and heartfelt. Almost makes me like people in general, again…almost"
"Love, Now","Eureka!  A clean, wholesome show that was gone too soon"
"Love, Now",I skipped out on The Last Airbender when I was younger because I thought Aang's character design was dumb and thought it was some run of the mill anime series. Finally watched it after hearing years of praise. Turned out to be one the best animated series I've seen and was totally wrong for dismissing it.
"Love, Now",I just finished watching Freaks and Geeks for the second time this year. It will be our Thanksgiving to Christmas series. It’s so damn good!
"Love, Now",Andor. Very different from almost everything starswars. It is like a WW2 resistance series disguised as a starwars movie. Dark and gritty.
"Love, Now","The Sopranos. Just typically not that into Mob stuff, but boy was I wrong on this one."
"Love, Now",I blew off Supernatural as a lame show for the ladies when it came out just 2 pretty boys on the CW network. At like season 6 or 7 I was introduced to it and got hooked.
"Love, Now",I needed 3 tries to manage to get into justified but then it clicked and I loved it.
"Love, Now","Ozark. I watched first episode when it launched first season and thought it was very dull and dark (in the sense of color palette) I just binged watched it last week, and found it amazing."
"Love, Now","For All Mankind. I thought it was a little slow at first, but after having heard some rave reviews, I tried again and I now love it."
"Love, Now","Breaking Bad. I didn’t start it until it’s final season. Everyone talked about it, but I wasn’t sure I wanted to watch a show about meth & drug dealers, etc. I was dumb and its now a show I consider nearly flawless. So glad I finally watched it."
"Love, Now","Doctor Who. Wasn't fond of some people who were fans, and that colored my perception unfairly (both to the show and to them). 

Adore it now, and midway through a rewatch, and learning to be a better liker of things."
"Love, Now","Rick & Morty. 

Didn’t like the concept or art style. 

Slept on it for 2 season. 

Gave it another go and in love with it ever since, can’t get enough."
"Love, Now",Fleabag
"Love, Now",The Middle. So funny for families to watch. Both parents and kids can relate (but especially parents).
"Love, Now","Haven’t seen it mentioned in here but Station Eleven.

I added it to my list around thanksgiving while I was searching through HBO Original stuff to justify continuing my subscription. The description sounded interesting. Hadn’t heard of it before and I love Mackenzie Davis.

Once holiday break started I decided to give something new a try and remembered it was on my list. God is that one of the best shows I have ever seen."
"Love, Now",Ash Vs Evil dead. Everyone needs to watch it right meow
"Love, Now","Cheers. I was born in '95, so when I'd see reruns, I just assumed it was a boring, old people show. I gave it a chance one day when I was about 21 or 22 and I fell in love with the show."
"Love, Now",The Boys
"Love, Now","Parks and Rec. I watched the first couple of episodes a while ago and hated it bc i really didn’t like the mockumentary style humor. 

And then my wife encouraged me to keep going and once I got into season 2 it became one of my favorite shows."
"Love, Now","Brooklyn 99

I figured it wouldn’t live up to the hype but it’s living up to the hype. Rosa and Gina are my favorites."
"Love, Now","Oh, I found Dark Matter at just the right time, I was depressed and needed something distracting, I didn't want to go back to the well and watch something I'd seen a hundred times but I wanted something similar.  DM totally scratched that itch for me."
"Love, Now","Both Mad Men and Breaking Bad fell victim to my attitude of ""oh I HAVE to watch it huh?"" When people bombard me with a show. I caught both of them in their last season, caught up and finished with everyone else for both of them."
"Love, Now","RuPauls Drag Race. I always knew I’d get to it at some point. Started watching it in June. Hoo BOY! I became obsessed. The show, the music (seriously, my replay top 10 is nothing but Ru songs from the queens each season, and ONE song from a favorite lipsync). Honestly, Ive gotten such joy and happiness from watching this show. I feel good when I watch my queens."
"Love, Now",Mad Men. When I was younger I honestly looked at it like a Soap with a 1960’s setting. Little did I know Don Draper is one of the most fascinating TV characters of all time.
"Love, Now",Community
"Love, Now","Lucifer. 

I was a fan of the comics, and was disappointed they dumbed it down to a procedural romance. 

After it got picked up by Netflix, I gave it another chance. Once I accepted what it was, it was much more enjoyable."
"Love, Now","I already finished it awhile ago, but I blew off American horror story for the longest time because I thought it was another stupid show for teenage girls like pretty little liars and the vampire diaries, but I end up loving it!"
"Love, Now","Ted Lasso. After watching the trailers the show didn’t look that enjoyable, and I couldn’t stand Jason Sudeikis’ accent.

After being home all the time due to early COVID pandemic, I was running out of things to watch and the everyone was raving about the show. So decided to watch it. Hooked immediately! My initial thoughts were soooo wrong. Great show."
"Love, Now","What We Do in the Shadows. So funny, so camp, and so fun!"
"Love, Now","Barry

Didn’t really like the pilot and so I dropped it. Years later, I’ve now binged three seasons. I still don’t love it but it’s much better than I first thought. I still don’t like all of the acting class scenes. They’re boring to me."
"Love, Now","The Office (U.S.)

For so so long I thought it looked cheesy, corny, and generally not funny or entertaining. Typical big network comedy fare, and the fan base with their goofy Dundler Mifflin shirts and such rubbed me the wrong way. I thought it was all very cringe and avoided like the plague.

Finally watched it a few years back and absolutely fell in love. The humor is goofy but endearing and the characters are so wonderfully fleshed out it’s hard not to get invested. I think Jim/Pam might be my favorite TV romance ever at this point."
"Love, Now",Mannix
"Love, Now","I blew off The Mayor of Kingstown because I was like ""wtf would I give a shit about a show about a mayor for?"" Watched it. Loved it. It's not a real mayor, actually a power broker. They should lead with that."
"Love, Now","The Wire, Mad Men, Boardwalk Empire"
"Love, Now",Only Murders In The Building
"Love, Now",One Punch Man and For All Mankind. Both are awesome for different reasons.
"Love, Now",I loved Dark Matter!
"Love, Now",I just watched the Trailer Park Boys X-Mas Special after finding it on Netflix. Now I've started the show. Its pretty funny but I never knew there was so much Trailer Park Boys content. The show has so many specials!
"Love, Now","Bojack Horseman.  I watched a couple episodes in the first year or 2 it came out, and it didn't click.  a little while ago a friend told me I need to watch it longer, and I tried... by the time I hit episode 4 or 5, I was up to my neck and in love with the show.  I binged it to the end, then watched it again (a bit more slowly)."
"Love, Now","House.

Never watched it. Just started to binge it and am really enjoying it!"
"Love, Now","The Sopranos 

20 years late but damn it’s good"
"Love, Now","Better call Saul. 

I loved breaking bad, one of my favourite shows of all time. When better call Saul was first coming out I read a few articles and interviews that made it seem like it was going to be a goofy comedy, but with breaking bad characters. So I figured I'm out. Didn't want to taint the original breaking bad by seeing Gus doing pratfalls or something. 

I heard a few friends talking about how the final season was brilliant so I decided to bite the bullet and give it a try. I ended up watching the first 3 seasons over a weekend. Absolutely superb stuff that I can't believe I slept on."
"Love, Now","Boston Legal. I can’t, for the life of me, remember why this show passed by me unnoticed. James Spader an William Shatner in one show. Brilliant."
"Love, Now","The Righteous Gemstones. The concept didn't really appeal to me at the time, but several friends persuaded me to try it when S2 came out and I was hooked so fast."
"Love, Now","It's Always sunny in Philadelphia. When people told me it was a really depraved Seinfeld, I said fuck that shit. But now it's among my favorite shows."
"Love, Now",Altered Carbon needs a new season!! Even the animated one was great!!
"Love, Now","Sons of Anarchy. Just looked so bad. Lol White gang going up against blacks, Hispanics and Asians. It IS bad but great because it’s dumb fun. A soap opera for men"
"Love, Now","My one of these is *Friends*. I thought it was so fucking stupid when it was on TV. Then in my first law job I was getting home around 11 pm every night, and my dinner was cold in the oven, so I would heat it up and look for something to watch. *Friends* played on Nick@Night for a three or four hour block, and I took to it.

That show is so funny. I was wrong."
"Love, Now",Not exactly what you’re asking but White Lotus. I watched the first 2 episodes of season 1 and didn’t care for it. Watched season 2 and it was great.
"Love, Now","I blew off *Supernatural* as teen angst. I finally gave it a shot when it was half-way into its 15th season. I've been an ardent fan ever since then.

\#Supernatural #SPN #SPNFamily"
"Love, Now",Doctor Who! Started from the 9th Doctor.
"Love, Now",I watched Dark matter with killjoys and Defiance. Those were the days
"Love, Now","Parenthood … far from the kinds of shows I normally watch (Mike Schur-like comedies, sci-fi). Preparing myself to watch the last episode."
"Love, Now","Young Sheldon

Am actually enjoying it way more than TBBT, the family dynamic is quite enjoyable and the individual characters are far more engaging and likeable."
"Love, Now",I recently watched 'Dark Matter' too. It ends too soon.
"Love, Now",Stargate SG-1.
"Love, Now",">Its almost giving me nostalgia for cheap scifi genre shows made in Canada from the 90s lol!

Off topic, but the short lived SyFy network show *Vagrant Queen* was a love letter to 90s syndicated science fiction, right down to obviously kitbashed props and bad looking CGI, one of the main characters was even Canadian. A lot of *Cleopatra 2525* mashed up with *Andromeda* with a bit of *Farscape* and *Lexx* sprinkled in. And even in a galaxy far far away the SyFy network props dept still has crates of P90s."
"Love, Now","Better Call Saul. Didn’t necessarily blow it off, but after LOVING Breaking Bad I kept putting off BCS… eventually it finished and everyone kept telling me to watch, so I did, and WOW. Great freakin show."
"Love, Now","Community, I thought it was gong to be “Chevy Chase needed a paycheck” the show. Everyone is great, they all play their parts well, and Chevy works for his money."
"Love, Now","The Boys.  I have always hated Supernatural and so didn't even try to watch The Boys.  I kept seeing all of those Homelander memes, though, so I decided to give it a chance.  What a savage satire of the entertainment industry in the CBM era!  Great cast and it's sometimes even thought-provoking.  Very underrated show."
"Love, Now","House. I had a disdain for the boringness of procedural medical dramas, but House is another beast entirely. The other dramas would be way too oddly specific with the way their themes were presented, it was to the point where I felt like each episode was a lecture on not causing unnecessary drama/suffering. House does that but to a lesser extent, and it's much better. The show treats its viewers like we're actually smart instead of just spelling things out all the time."
"Love, Now","Dark

don't let this German Si-Fi Noir pass you by"
"Love, Now","Started watching Breaking Bad for the first time earlier this week. 

Holy shit."
"Love, Now","I never watched ""Breaking Bad"" until I began binge watching it this past week.  I love it!"
"Love, Now","Patriot

So many people on here have recommended it for years and now I see why. It's dark, funny, great music and characters, interesting story and wonderfully shot."
"Love, Now",Ted Lasso: when it first came out I ignored the shit out of it. I started watching it now and I almost finished binging the whole thing.
Last Tango in Halifax,"Hope they bring back Happy Valley too, that was a great police drama."
Last Tango in Halifax,Bout time.
Last Tango in Halifax,"Nice, I just finally watched the Christmas special episodes from a few years ago after not watching it for years. I forgot just how cozy the whole thing was, such a nice light drama with likable characters. Sure there are some serious themes but I love the bits like can Alan remember his lines for the community play? So this is great news after rediscovering this. 

I really need to watch some of these actors other shows. I've never seen Happy Valley, Viscous, or I think anything else that Nicola Walker has done. Really enjoyed Anne Reid in Years and Years."
Last Tango in Halifax,"i watched the first few seasons of this lovely series but then was blindsided by a very problematic and, for me and lots of folks, devastating storyline.  while i still watch wainright's shows, i'm not sure i'll ever forgive her. ruined it for me."
Last Tango in Halifax,"They are planning to bring it back, but not for a little while. The screenwriter said a few months ago that they're waiting for the actor that plays the little boy to grow up more into a teenager for the story she has planned."
Last Tango in Halifax,"Just me, but if you like *Last Tango,* maybe it's time to look at Sally Wainwright's other shows.  I'd highly recommend all of them, but I'm pretty pan-genre in my viewing. In chronological order of the things you can currently find on streaming:

* *Scott & Bailey* (Amazon Prime / Hulu). Wainwright only ran the show for the first three seasons, but it's a cop show where the two partners, their captain, their captain's boss, and the ME are all female.  Nicola Walker has a guest role in Season 3. Stars Suranne Jones and Lesley Sharp.
* *Happy Valley.* (Netflix). Sarah Lancashire stars. Crime procedural.
* *To Walk Invisible: the Brontë Sisters* (Amazon Prime/PBS Masterpiece). Miniseries biodrama. 
* *Gentleman Jack* (HBO). Stars Suranne Jones as the 19th century diarist, mountaineer, industrialist, landowner, and lesbian, Anne Lister. 

If you need more Nicola Walker and like crime dramas, I'd also recommend *River* (Netflix), which was written by *The Hour's* Abi Morgan. And [*Unforgotten*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oX_WsLS7sQ) (Amazon Prime/PBS Masterpiece). If you prefer non-crime dramas, Sundance has aired the first season of [*The Split*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqbaDu_djOA) (also written by Abi Morgan)*,* and renewed it for a second season."
Last Tango in Halifax,Can you elaborate how you were blindsided? There were multiple storylines so wondering which one you found problematic.
Last Tango in Halifax,"Granted, Sally Wainwright said that during the premiere for *Gentleman Jack,* which has also been renewed for a second season, and which she is also writing, so S3 of *Happy Valley* will be a while."
Last Tango in Halifax,"Wow, you got a lot of them already, but here's the one's I think you could also include:

*Freaks and Geeks* is Lindsay Weir's story of how she falls in with the bad crowd.

*The Legend of Korra* while not as strong as the original, yet, is still a good animated series with a female lead.

*Dollhouse* has a female lead although the you could right question how strong a character could be in that role considering the memory is wiped clean every episode.

*Dead Like Me* has a female lead. The show certainly has its ups and downs but overall pretty good.

I would argue the Major from *Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex* is the lead there, and an excellent character all around to boot.

*My So-Called Life* was the original Claire Danes TV show before *Homeland* came along."
Last Tango in Halifax,Why wouldn't Homeland count? Carrie is the main character. 
Last Tango in Halifax,[deleted]
Last Tango in Halifax,Why'd you put Parks & Rec under dramady? It's a pretty straight comedy
Last Tango in Halifax,"[Bomb Girls](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1955311/reference) is Canadian btw, unless there's another one, in which case the Canuck show should be on there...

Also, add in [Being Erica](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1149608/reference) - love that show.

And [Hunted](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2069449/reference)

Both versions of La Femme Nikita, of course... (although the [original](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118379/reference) was better than the [remake](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1592154/reference) hehe..)

[Prime Suspect](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098898/reference) (UK) - all seasons/series.

[The Fall](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2294189/reference) - renewed for a second season yay.

(ps you dont really need to mark anything as Canada since like 50% of the shows listed are produced here and it's redundant.)"
Last Tango in Halifax,"What about Bones? Booth is also a lead, but the show definitely revolves around her.

The Middle could also potentially fit. It generally focuses on Patricia Heaton's character as she deals with her family, though it's become more of an ensemble.

The New Adventures of Old Christine was definitely all about Julia Louis-Dreyfus' character, and should be added for sure."
Last Tango in Halifax,"I think perhaps you might consider adding Little Mosque on the Prairie, it's a little goofball, and kind of skirts some of the more serious issues brought about by the meeting of Canadian culture and Islam, but does feature some strong women, and women of colour to boot.  My personal favourite character is Fatima, a local restaurant owner."
Last Tango in Halifax,I think both Moesha and The Parkers would both qualify as well as Sabrina the Teenage Witch. 
Last Tango in Halifax,"""Veronica Mars"" is not a fantasy show. You might want to add ""Nancy Drew Mysteries"" though. Cheers. :-)"
Last Tango in Halifax,"*Necessary Roughness*

I quit watching this season because it basically rebooted itself. Not groundbreaking. Along the lines of traditional USA shows, but it's Callie Thorn. She's wonderful.

Definitely add *Murphy Brown*.

And while they're older than most shows listed: *The Mary Tyler Moore Show*, *Rhoda*, *Maude*, *One Day at a Time*, *Cagney & Lacey*, *Police Woman*, *Wonder Woman*... I'd even argue *Bewitched* and *I Love Lucy*."
Last Tango in Halifax,"Without a Trace (US Marshall/cop drama)  
~~Gilmore Girls (debated whether this fit your 'strong' criteria, decided relationship-oriented didn't necessarily mean weak).~~  

Edit: never mind, you were on it."
Last Tango in Halifax,Hawthorne! Was on air for 4 seasons. Jada Pinkett-Smith is lead. 
Last Tango in Halifax,No X-Files? 
Last Tango in Halifax,"I would have thought Grey's Anatomy would count. It's named after the main character, Meredith Grey.

Borgen, Spiral, Lost in Austen, Land Girls, Sugar Rush, The Sarah Jane Adventures.... Daria? ;)"
Last Tango in Halifax,"Separate the list to include science/speculative-fiction and fantasy as a separate category. Put Fringe, Torchwood, Terminator:SCC. Dollhouse, Star Trek Voyager, Buffy et al under that. "
Last Tango in Halifax,[deleted]
Last Tango in Halifax,"Both from Denmark -  Borgen and Forbrydelsen.  The Killing is based on Forbrydelsen. Borgen is a political drama.

Also Annika Bengzton, Crime Reporter.  On Netflix."
Last Tango in Halifax,"I'm glad to see Covert Affairs here--that show is continually getting better and better. Season 3 was incredible. 

I'm also a big Necessary Roughness fan, although the show's new direction has taken some of the focus off of Dani, and doesn't spend much time on family life anymore, which I enjoyed because how many other shows revolve around a mother with older kids? "
Last Tango in Halifax,"[McLeod's Daughters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLeod's_Daughters) - this may or may not be to everyone's taste, but it's really good for what it is. The story is carried by a strong cast of female leads and is very heavily female-centric. I personally love it to bits."
Last Tango in Halifax,"None of these have women of colour except maybe Drop Dead Diva (asian woman), but she isn't really a main character.

Pulling (UK) - A comedy revolving around the antics of 3 quickly aging but uncompromising women.  

Accidentally on Purpose - a middle aged woman gets pregnant on a one night stand (might be too focused on both the woman and the dude from the one night stand, but I think the woman is really the main character)

2 Broke Girls - The story of 2 financially lacking girls trying to make it in life.

Drop Dead Diva - A female model gets put into the body of a chubby female lawyer after death.

Hellcats - Cheerleaders dealing with university and athletic pressure.

Reba? Might focus too much on the whole cast rather than just Reba.  (Don't judge, it's a great and adorable show)

Pan Am? Also might focus too much on the men in the show, but I think the women are the main characters.

EDIT to add more shows and: This is a pretty comprehensive list you've got going - I'm definitely saving this thread."
Last Tango in Halifax,"Maybe I'm wrong but I would definitely say Castle.

I guess Castle may be the lead, but Beckett is a close right?"
Last Tango in Halifax,You can put Law & Order SVU on your list. Detective Benson is the main character now that Stabler has left the show.
Last Tango in Halifax,"American Horror Story,
The Americans,
Bates Motel?

"
Last Tango in Halifax,"What do you suggest if I like action/crime shows? I have already watched R&I and I don't like things that are too old or that can't be grabbed from the Internet.
"
Last Tango in Halifax,"I'm rather late to this thread, but: [Hit & Miss](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/70271757?locale=en-US&mqso=81198655&titleVideoId=70271757&awadgroupid=8344250348&awcampaignid=121071908&awcreative=34988547188&awdevice=c&awexpid=&awkeyword=%2Bhit%20%2Bmiss%20%2Bnetflix&awmatchtype=b&awnetwork=g&awposition=1t1&gclid=CMP-vaOv_LsCFXPNOgodf2IAqw) (UK). (Technically the character is a pre op transexual, but close enough)"
Last Tango in Halifax,Nice list but now the question is : which are worth watching?
Last Tango in Halifax,"""Strong"" female figures? Some of them, maybe, not all. Not by a long shot."
Last Tango in Halifax,Hightown.
Last Tango in Halifax,I take it you didn't see the end of *Dollhouse* if you question whether or not Elisa Dushku's character is strong even with the memory wipes.
Last Tango in Halifax,"Some good ones, thanks! Added to the list."
Last Tango in Halifax,"I wasn't sure - it seems like an ensemble show (Carrie and Brody). But now I'm remembering that the producers have said the show could go on even without Brody, so you're right. I'll add it to the list. Thanks!"
Last Tango in Halifax,"Great suggestions! Hadn't heard of Devious Maids or Scott and Bailey, and forgot about Prime Suspect and Call the Midwife. Will add them and The Killing to the list. Probably won't add The Bridge since it appears to be an ensemble piece (both the male and female lead have equal billing), but still plan to check it out. "
Last Tango in Halifax,"Just missed it when I was going back through the list. Thanks for the reminder, I'll correct."
Last Tango in Halifax,"Good catch re: Bones and The New Adventures of Old Christine. Never watched the latter, but love Bones. She's a great character (Angela, too :).




Left The Middle off for now because it seems more of an ensemble."
Last Tango in Halifax,"Added. Looks like an interesting show, is it available to watch on DVD or a streaming service?"
Last Tango in Halifax,"Good additions, thanks!"
Last Tango in Halifax,">but it's Callie Thorn. She's wonderful.

Damn right. Her guest starring on Burn Notice was great as well."
Last Tango in Halifax,"Added. Keep seeing Necessary Roughness and plan to check it out - though this season's promos of John Stamos have not filled me with confidence. Good to hear the first few seasons are good, though."
Last Tango in Halifax,"Nice one! I like Jada, though I got bored after a few episodes...did it get better over time?"
Last Tango in Halifax,"The show seems equally focused on Fox and Scully. Scully's a great character, though."
Last Tango in Halifax,"Agreed. Greys main character, meredith, is complicated and interesting. And the good thing about greys is while Grey is the show's namesake, the rest of the female cast are arguably more interesting and funny and fun to watch. It seriously belongs on the list of good shows with strong female lead(s).

It's written by a woman of color, Shondra Rhimes who also writes Scandal. It's also very rewatchable, it has layers and connections that you can pick up on a 2nd or 3rd viewing. It's on Netflix, 172 eps, and it's good until the S8 finale."
Last Tango in Halifax,Done. Also specified which shows have teen leads. 
Last Tango in Halifax,Added. Is it sc-fi?
Last Tango in Halifax,Are these shows in English?
Last Tango in Halifax,"Just finished marathoning Covert Affairs from the beginning. Starts off a little generic, but gets really good! I'm definitely hooked now."
Last Tango in Halifax,"Good suggestions, added. And I liked Reba, too. :)"
Last Tango in Halifax,">women of colour

sup tumblr"
Last Tango in Halifax,"Officially it revolves around Castle, so it doesn't qualify. Since most TV shows are still led by male characters, or by ensemble casts (if you don't believe me, just browse top TV shows on IMDb, or the shows nominated for Emmys, or the prime-time lineup for almost any network), I want to keep this list to the relatively smaller number of shows led by female characters."
Last Tango in Halifax,"Good point - it started out as an ensemble show, but I think she evolved to be the main character."
Last Tango in Halifax,I think all these are technically ensembles. Good shows! But not appropriate for the list.
Last Tango in Halifax,"All pretty good (in my opinion): Alias, Nikita, The Closer, Major Crimes, The Commander (UK but available on Netflix), Scandal, The Good Wife, Damages"
Last Tango in Halifax,Depends on what you like. What are your preferences?
Last Tango in Halifax,"From the OP:

> It doesn't necessarily mean likable or physically strong, but they have to be *more than one-dimensional caricatures* (i.e. no I Dream of Jeannie's).

""Strong"" as in carrying the show, not as in a character trait."
Last Tango in Halifax,"I think they've said it could go on without Carrie, too. But I would still consider her one of the two lead characters for now, which is enough to make the list, I think."
Last Tango in Halifax,[deleted]
Last Tango in Halifax,Another one is Rookie Blue. It's a Canadian show where Missy Peregrym plays a rookie cop that the show is centered around.
Last Tango in Halifax,"Grey's Anatomy has tons of great female characters, I just forgot it technically revolved around Meredith. I'll add it. 




LOVE Scandal - that was one of the first I thought of when I started making the list."
Last Tango in Halifax,"I was thinking Utopia as well.  It's not exactly sci-fi, but you can put it in that category.  It's also amazing btw lol..."
Last Tango in Halifax,"They're not but the first two are definitely worth watching even if you don't like reading subtitles.

My suggestions would be The Blue Rose (NZ), Outrageous Fortune (NZ), Offspring (AUS), Spirited (AUS) and Lip Service (UK)."
Last Tango in Halifax,I don't get it.  Is there a famous women of colour tumblr or something?
Last Tango in Halifax,That makes more sense. I've always thought that science fiction writers tend to create more well-rounded female characters than other writers. Why do you think that is?
Last Tango in Halifax,If they take Carrie out then they'd have to change the opening.
Last Tango in Halifax,Added. Thanks! Been meaning to check some of these out on Netflix.
Last Tango in Halifax,"Will definitely check out the Danish shows, thanks for the recommendation! And for the NZ and AUS shows, they're good additions to the list."
Last Tango in Halifax,"I think it's because of the writer's theory-of-the-future, or progress more generally.

When thinking of how the future will be, they decide that women will have a larger role in society, more important roles in leadership, and to-but-it-bluntly *more complicated* lives.

I think this is gibberish myself as women already have more complicated lives than they are shown to live in most fiction. When a writer has a female character in a present day fiction that character needs to be complicated in order to be both interesting and realistic.

I think another reason is the mostly male producers either poorly relate to complicated female characters *or* the believe the *auduience they are selling to* will poorly relate."
Last Tango in Halifax,I don't see that as a problem.
Last Tango in Halifax,[deleted]
Last Tango in Halifax,"If I had the time, I'd try to do the Bechdel test on all of those shows/movies. Thanks for your reply, I didn't think I'd get one from anybody!"
Last Tango in Halifax,"Demographics. US TV lives and dies by the adults 18-49 demo. BBC is funded by the government, so there's not as much worry about the make up of who is watching as much as how many. 

FWIW, the last episode of Murder She Wrote was titled Death By Demographics. It was getting slaughtered up against Friends."
Last Tango in Halifax,"Perhaps Diagnosis Murder?

And I think particularly with shows like OFitG, Dad's Army and Last of the Summer Wine, there is a dry, often self-deprecating wit that is not too easily transferable to a U.S. audience. This isn't limited to sitcoms though as there is a classic British banter that permeates a lot of fictional TV shows in the UK, Rosemary & Thyme is a good example.

I think this banter is something that also used to be a part of American culture too, particularly amongst American troops during the Second World War. This would mean this generation of Americans were in their 60s and 70s when these kind of bantery, elderly-centric shows were in their prime. With Generation X evolved an identifiably American sense of humour. Modern Americans seem much more progressive and open to change. Brits are a people set in their ways who hold onto things that are quintessentially British. You don't so much see America airing MASH, Cheers, or other old sitcoms on Christmas Day but it's very common to see Only Fools and Horses or Vicar of Dibley reruns on primetime British telly on Christmas.

EDIT: Sorry for the wall of text."
Last Tango in Halifax,"The BBC is funded through the television license fee, not government.
"
Last Tango in Halifax,"Old people don't buy the new Android phones, Apple Watches, and go out to eat at Applebee's."
Last Tango in Halifax,Same difference. 
Last Tango in Halifax,"Regardless of if they do or not, the US ad industry is based on adults 18-49, and has been since people meters came out in 1987. The reasoning is that older people watch more significantly more television (which is true - the numbers bear this out), thus no matter where you advertise, you're going to reach them. Adults 18-49 (and younger demos) don't watch as much TV, so reaching them comes at a premium.

Let me give you this example:

The Good Wife does about 9 million viewers, but a 1.1 rating in adults 18-49 (or around 1.4 million people in that age range). Grey's Anatomy does around 8 million viewers, but a 2.3 rating in adults, or around 2.9 million people in that demographic. If you advertise on either GA or TGW, you're going to get a good chunk of older viewers, but on GA you're also going to get a large number of young people, which TGW doesn't offer, or offer in any more quantity than you can find on a million other shows. GA is still in the top 10 in adults 18-49, so there's more competition for scarcer viewers. The shows on TV that outdraw GA in that demo? Big Bang Theory, Scandal, Modern Family, Empire, Football (of course, that's a whole other beast), The Voice, and a few shows on AMC (like TWD, etc).  Shows that equal/outrank TGW in viewers 50+? Too many to mention. There's a ton on CBS alone."
Last Tango in Halifax,"Not really.  The beeb is governed by the bbc commission, a state sanctioned yet self regulated, independent body.  There are all sorts of checks and balances to rule out state interference."
Last Tango in Halifax,I was agreeing with you.........?
Last Tango in Halifax,"Sure, but it isn't as beholden to audience size as US networks are because of that funding. It's sort of like the CBC in Canada (which is federally funded, but maintains editorial independence), which is far different than being a private network. "
Last Tango in Halifax,Sorry! You never know on this sub....
Last Tango in Halifax,"Another way to write this headline 
“HBO had the biggest hits on TV for 2nd consecutive year”"
Last Tango in Halifax,"HBO needs to teach their movie counterparts (WB) the importance of screenwriters, because they’re the ones responsible for delivering quality! HOTD and TLOU are so damn good!"
Last Tango in Halifax,Maybe this will make execs notice you should be hiring writers who love your ip and not writers who hate it/just use it as a vehicle for their own shit ideas.
Last Tango in Halifax,"Sony to Neil be like ""please make part 3, we have consoles to sell & more money to make!"""
Last Tango in Halifax,"I knew it!

&#x200B;

Second season, just like Dragon, is gonna be huge, man HBO just doesn't miss."
Last Tango in Halifax,"Well deserved.

I for one am so happy they didn't mess with the story.  Too many adaptations just do lip service to the source material and end up being completely different.  This just upsets the existing fanbase, especially when the adaptation is bad to boot.    Here they had a stellar story and didn't mess with it often recreating scenes that were near identical to the game.    It was so awesome seeing it come to life without significant changes other than cutting things for brevity.    

Here's hoping they do the second game similar justice as it's story is just as worthy of being adaptated straight up though I can see how they might tinker with way they tell the story in that they'll show the stories of the dual protagonists at the same time rather than separately."
Last Tango in Halifax,"Discovery really underestimated HBO, I hope this means that they aren't going to try and control more in the merger and still take risks on shows."
Last Tango in Halifax,"You know what's the best feeling in the world after every good news about this show? 

It's knowing that the salt mine that is The Last of Us 2 subreddit are seething with hate. Absolutely love it. 

Good news. Can't wait for season 2."
Last Tango in Halifax,"HBO needs to pick up the Witcher man, which they won’t do because they have Westeros, but I still dream of what could have been"
Last Tango in Halifax,"TLOU is a rare example of a big production team having respect and understanding for the source material. Most of the time, Hollywood follows the business model of  taking a generic script and sticking a known IP in it to gain publicity (see- Halo TV)."
Last Tango in Halifax,"I played the game a couple times. Once on ps3 and then ps4. But I didn’t it so long ago I was able to watch the show and not know exactly what was going to happen scene to scene or what was change or the same. The game definitely has you feeling more attached to Ellie and Joel together as you play as Joel and it’s your job to keep Ellie safe. So some of the stuff in the show didn’t hit the same. Also, I found when I played the game I sided with Joel almost fully. Like he was doing the the wrong thing for the right reasons. But being removed from controlling him and watching it play out on a tv show, I feel I got the intended effect. And it definitely makes Last of Us part II more obvious how that plays out."
Last Tango in Halifax,"Damn. This is impressive.

Imagine how Halo show could’ve been if they actually respected the lore."
Last Tango in Halifax,The writing has been superb.
Last Tango in Halifax,"I liked TLOU wayyy more than HOTD and I’m saying this as someone who loves GOT and who didn’t play the TLOU game.

TLOU felt way more streamlined and easier to follow. Maybe it’s like not really comparable as they’re different thematically and stylistically, but I remember numerous times during HOTD being like “who’s that guy again?” Or “why are they doing this again?”

TLOU is solid storytelling and great acting. Coming into it with no background, my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed ourselves far more."
Longmire,Weird to see Netflix co-financed shows leaving Netflix. First the Marvel shows. Now this. I guess maybe it wasn't performing well anymore.
Longmire,underrated show
Longmire,Gonna be a weird transition from a *Hee Haw* episode to this.
Longmire,"It doesn't say anything about the show also leaving Netflix. If you go to the show in Netflix, it doesn't say anything about it leaving soon, unlike the Marvel shows."
Longmire,[deleted]
Longmire,"Makes sense, kind of. Longmire has been on Netflix for a few years now. The people who were going to watch it have done so, shopping around for a new audience on a different platform is the next move."
Longmire,This is true. I guess I jumped the gun. I just assumed if the other company holds distribution rights though and it's being outright sold to them it would be for streaming as well. I could be wrong. We shall see.
Longmire,"I know that's the case with shows like Riverdale, where it's advertised as Netflix original, but they just hold exclusive distribution rights for online in certain areas. However, Longmire's production was co-financed by Netflix for the last three seasons."
Longmire,The Expanse and Slow Horses
Longmire,"Binged the first season of Game of Thrones and then read all five books over the next three weeks. 

Still waiting for Winds."
Longmire,"The new Interview with the Vampire, and it has been extremely helpful to do so. I think it provides a lot of needed context for how they are setting up the story and there are a lot of little details and moments of characterization that make extra sense with knowledge of the novels. I think S1 might even come across very differently to someone with no knowledge of the novels at all."
Longmire,"Shadow and Bone led me to read Six of Crows, which is the prequel to the books the show is based on."
Longmire,"Huge fan of Red Dwarf got me to read the books.  Lots of big differences, one of which is where they find a derelict ship with Faster than Light and a copy of Better Than Life.  So they all decide to enter the game while the FTL takes months to get back to earth, only they get trapped in the game and dont know it.  Everyone's BTL fantasy was great, but the Cat was hilarious. 

>!The Cat's fantasy has him living in a massive castle, with a moat made of milk.  Stationed all through out the castle are half naked valkyrie warriors.  In the back yard, he's playing polo, except hes riding on dinosaurs and a dog is the ball.   While everyone eventually realizes they're stuck in the game, Cat is the only one that doesn't, he thinks he just deserves all this and asks no questions. !<"
Longmire,Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. Some day I'll get around to Smiley's People.
Longmire,The Dresden Files and Bosch. I guess I’m a sucker for noir.
Longmire,the expanse and the last kingdom
Longmire,"I enjoyed Lockwood and Co so much. I actually recently recommended it to someone. I had no idea it was based on book, but of course it is.

I didn’t know Queen’s Gambit was a book either. But again, so obvious. Will get that too!

I finally read Watchmen after the Lindelof  series. And Handmaid’s Tale. Appreciated both especially since I found them unappealing before the shows.

My favorites are The Magicians series. True Blood way back in the day was fluffy ludicrous fun, at least the first few."
Longmire,the expanses
Longmire,"Justified got me to read a ton of Elmore Leonard. 

The Clooney Catch-22 and the Tennant Around the World in 80 days convinced me to finally read those classics. 

They’re not the source material, but I liked Fargo, Legion, and The Unusuals enough to read all of Noah Hawley’s novels. 

Also, since I’m not talking source material, I will admit to having read every book with a Quantum Leap title and far too many Star Trek books. Many of them were glorified fanfic with an ISBN number, but there were high points."
Longmire,Not out yet but the ```Silo``` trailer hooked me. Just started book 1.
Longmire,True Blood. The books are way better and ended up ruining the show for me.
Longmire,Bosch and recently started reading the Lincoln Lawyer novels. I enjoyed them greatly.
Longmire,"The Magicians

It's *very* different after like the first half of book 1. I prefer the TV show but both are great"
Longmire,Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and Smiley's People.
Longmire,"The Expanse. Loved the show. Probably my favorite scifi series.

Now reading the books, currently at #4 and I love them just as much."
Longmire,"The trailer for the Tom Cruise 'Jack Reacher' film got me to read the novels.  I still can't believe how well it was adapted for Amazon, that first season is very close to the book.  Even some of the stuff they added was from a different book."
Longmire,People should read The Magicians. After the first season the books and show diverge a lot. I love both though.
Longmire,"Killing Eve

The Terror

Longmire,Station Eleven and The Sandman
Longmire,The slow horses. Both the TV show and the books are fantastic. Also recommend the audiobook
Longmire,"Jonathan Norrell & Mr Strange

Pride & Prejudice (reread)"
Longmire,I haven't read it yet but I will be reading Station Eleven.  I know the book and the show are different but if I like the book even half as much as I loved the miniseries then I'm in for a treat.
Longmire,"I was going to say Lockwood and Co. too! I’ve never been big on YA fiction, but how the show was presented, and considering it’s a finished series with a reasonable amount of books, I’ve had the boxset sitting in my cart ever since the first episode ended."
Longmire,"The Terror. The book is pretty good. One change the tv series made from the book that I really liked.

It isn't out yet, but Three Body Problem trilogy. Read it due to the upcoming Netflix series.

If you like science fiction it lives up to the hype. That said, I was tepid on the ending."
Longmire,The Queen’s Gambit
Longmire,"I watched the first 2 episodes of The Expanse assuming it was standard, low budget off-brand Canadian produced sci-fi a-la Andromeda, Killjoys, Orphan Black, etc. 

Realized I was wrong, and did some research on the property. Stopped watching after those 2 and consumed the available entries in the book series before going back to the show. Definitely in my top 5 sci-fi shows of all time and the books expand and elaborate on the world and the characters beautifully."
Longmire,The Sandman show finally made me bite the bullet and buy the comics. It's been on my to-read list as a Neil Gaiman fan but I have putting it on hold due as I found it intimidating due to the number of issues involved. Buying the comics was the right decision. I am now excited for season 2 and hope they find a way to include the many short stories aside from the main plot.
Longmire,The Winds of War mini series got me to read The Winds of War and War and Remembrance.
Longmire,Reacher
Longmire,"Of Mice and Men.  I saw the Gary Sinease/John Malkovich movie and it blew me away.  I read the book shortly afterward.

Game of Thrones.  I read the first 2 books.  Loved the show, but the books were dull, IMO.  I got VERY bored with the lengthy descriptions of food and armies marching by, getting a play-by-play of every banner held by the men and hedge-knights.  Gave up on it.

Dances With Wolves.  Incredible movie, and it was VERY close to the book.  I liked the movie ending a little better though.

Jurassic Park.  Movie blew me a way.  Then I read the book and it blew me away all over again."
Longmire,"My Brilliant Friend - Neapolitan Quartet (My Brilliant Friend, Story of a New Name, etc...)

Longmire,"I read 11/22/63, A Game of Thrones, Turn of the Screw (The Haunting of Bly Manor), and Daisy Jones & the Six when I learned they were going to be turned into shows, but I read the books before the shows premiered.

I think the only book I've read after watching the TV adaptation is The Haunting of Hill House.

All other adaptations I've watched I had already read the books before I knew they were being turned into a TV show or I haven't read the books at all."
Longmire,Dublin murders (Season is a mix of two crime novels written by Tana French)
Longmire,"Daisy Jones & The Six

ETA: I picked up the book 2 weeks ago after watching the first 3 episodes. I finished it last night. TBH I don't know if the book was all that great. It's good beach read I guess. I'm more in love with show."
Longmire,The Leftovers

Got hooked on the first 2 seasons, and now am on book 23 and eagerly awaiting the next one!"
Longmire,American Gods and discovered Neil Gaiman. What a man! Enjoyed Anansi Boys and Neverwhere
Longmire,After I saw Dorohedoro on Netflix I stayed up until like 3am for a whole week reading the manga!
Longmire,Outlander and most recently Daisy Jones and the Six (although it's just one book.)
Longmire,"* GoT - Only the first book in the series
* True Blood - Only the first book in the series
* Altered Carbon - *Loved* this one. Read the whole trilogy, but the first was by and far my favorite."

Longmire,Does Playboy after Dark count????
Longmire,"Agatha Christie's Poirot by ITV. I started checking out the books after watching the show, starting with an audiobook of *Murder On The Orient Express*, narrated by Kenneth Branagh.

Not exactly related to television, but you can tell that Branagh incorporated a lot more of the book into the movie than is immediately apparent, which I have to give the man credit for. Hearing his reading the book sounds almost like an early concept sketch for the entire film, from how he does a deep and gravelly voice for Ratchett to how near-identically he sounds to Josh Gad's MacQueen. They even manage to sneak in a reference to how Poirot managed to get onto the train as well and made it into an extra reference to Poirot loving Charles Dickens (if you didn't catch it, he >!caught onto the existence of a fake extra passenger because Hector MacQueen unknowingly referenced a Charles Dickens story; in the story he references, Mrs Harris isn't a real person but someone constantly referenced by another person so they can tell tall tales!<)."
Longmire,"Netflix Daredevil inspired me to start reading some of the important Daredevil comics, which inspired me to start reading comics in general."
Longmire,"There were rave reviews of Station Eleven the TV series, so I read the book first before watching.

They were weirdly both disappointing in different ways, and the book and TV series don't really sync up either. The TV series deviates a lot from the book, with some confusing decisions like >!changing and/or basically omitting lead characters, letting one character live and become a villain, and completely changing the ending!<"
Longmire,Dopesick led me to read the book. The book is a lot different than the show. Both are good though.
Longmire,Game of Thrones.
Longmire,"The Terror, Game of Thrones, Justified, Lonesome Dove, and the Sandman. The only books I thought were truly fantastic was Lonesome Dove and GoT. The rest were decent though."
Longmire,The Magicians - the books were so good I gave up on the show.
Longmire,"I started reading A Song of Ice and Fire after season 2 of Game of Thrones. By the time season 3 aired, I had read all of the released books."
Longmire,"The Expanse , Game of Thrones, Shadow and Bone, The Terror, Altered Carbon .

Planning to read Slow Horses."
Longmire,"**House of the Dragon**

Fire and Blood is better and cutting out Aegon I - Jeaherys I story makes me sad."
Longmire,"Not show, but the movie Ready Player One got me to read the book and the sequel and they are now some of my favorite books.

Finished watching His Dark Materials recently and plan on reading them."
Longmire,"GoT, quite simply. Still prefer the series, though."
Longmire,Watched Game of Thrones 1-6 and then went and read the books. The save the Expanse Reddit campaign didn’t get me to watch the show but it did get me to read the books and it might be my favourite book series ever now.
Longmire,Slow Horses sounds interesting. I'll give it a try if I ever get Apple TV.
Longmire,I read all the Slow Horses books pretty much as soon as the first series finished. I’ve struggled to watch the second series to be honest as the books were great and while the series sticks close it’s almost redundant.
Longmire,"I read The Expanse books, but not because I liked the show. I watched Season 1 and I liked some of the ideas in it, I found the execution to be… not great? I didn’t continue. I know a lot of people enjoyed it but it just wasn’t for me. Anyway, a few years later I finally started reading the first book and ended up reading the whole series.  

EDIT: I will consider trying the show again! I haven’t given up on it. 😀"
Longmire,[removed]
Longmire,That's exactly how I did it. Although I am no longer waiting for Winds. I gave up.
Longmire,"I got hooked during season two, read the books before season three, and felt *so* in-the-know about the upcoming weddings!

And now, ten years later, I'm thinking of just donating my hardcover copies at this point."
Longmire,The heat death of the universe will occur before that book is released.  It was supposed to released nine years ago now.
Longmire,"IWTV was utterly fantastic.  They took quite a risk and really stuck the landing.

That Witches thing though ~shiver~ that was awful."
Longmire,"Smiley's People is so, so, so good. Requires your full attention because it's got a trillion characters old and new and an incredibly intricate plot, but LeCarre has never been better"
Longmire,They need to remake The Dresden Files.
Longmire,"This is on my list. The first book was not easy to get through, because Q is somehow even less likable in the book, but I love them more as they go on, and I think the ending is gorgeous. I also love the show and think they interpreted the author’s intention with his series e find with the controversial S4 finale."
Longmire,"You are! I read the book in December and then watched the show right after. I loved them both. I am currently reading another book by the author, Glass Hotel."
Longmire,You should read her other books too: The Glass Hotel and the Sea of Tranquility. All 3 tie together
Longmire,"Yeah, it's definitely YA but it's the best YA I've encountered in recent memory."
Longmire,The Chinese version is already out and legally available on YouTube (Tencent) with English subs.
Longmire,Jurassic Park! That is a really fun book.
Longmire,Would you recommend the books? I am on season 3 of the TV show but haven't felt the urge to read the novels.
Longmire,If you are a fan of horror and don't mind seriously messed up things then Bentley Little is superb. However the book and TV show are extremely different like almost am adaptation in name only. Also feel like I should give a brief content warning - a dog gets harmed in the book
Longmire,"Btw, despite the Iron Fist show being terrible, I highly recommend the Immortal Iron Fist by Ed Brubaker. Danny Rand will always be one of my favourite Marvel characters thanks to that run of comics."
Longmire,"GRRM actually wanted the show to begin with Jeaherys story. Also after Dance of the Dragon finishes, the show will start a new Story relating to Targaryens, which could be Aegons"
Longmire,HOTD should have included Mushroom.
Longmire,Ready player one is such a wonderful book and such an unfortunate movie.
Longmire,"> Still prefer the series, though.

...what? Do you simply dislike books, or why would you prefer the show?  
  
IMO the books are so much better, it's not even close."
Longmire,"You also need to see Ted Lasso, The Afterparty, Shrinking, Schmigadoon! and Black Bird.  Oh and ""The Greatest Beer Run in History"" is a pretty great film."
Longmire,"I know what you mean lol. Just FYI, the second series deviates more from the books than the first did."
Longmire,I personally loved the show but agree the books are even better and worth a read regardless. I think the first few seasons they were a little hamstrung by being on Syfy. Avasarala just isn't the same without her f-bombs!
Vampire Knight,"I loved that show, and all the inadvertent parallels with *Angel* which came afters: viola in the theme music, bottles of cow blood in the fridge, '60s convertible (Nick's was a Caddy; Angel's was a Plymouth GTX), the similarities between Darla and Jeanette, etc. etc.

Worst finale ever, tho."
Vampire Knight,"I have not heard anyone mention that series in twenty years. A friend of mine was part of the crew. 

He says the night shoots were killer.  Made him feel like a vampire because they'd have to rush to get scenes filmed before the sun came up."
Vampire Knight,"If we are talking about early 90s Canadian TV...

Can we stop for a moment and appreciate how far ahead of its time [The Odyssey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Odyssey_(TV_series)) was.


Plus it had Ryan Reynolds as a kid"
Vampire Knight,"I remember the TV movie they made of that, starring Rick Springfield of Jesse’s Girl and soap opera fame and thinking it was cool. I was 8th or 9th grade I think and vampires were My Thing. 

When the TV show came later I was distracted by other stuff and never got to see it. 

Maybe I’ll give it a look."
Vampire Knight,Canada makes some fantastic TV - I am absolutely in love with Zoie Palmer from ‘lost girl’
Vampire Knight,I'm saving my shout out for Friday the 13th the Series. It's been my binge lately.
Vampire Knight,"HELL TO THE FUCK YES!  I used to stay up to watch this on weekend nights and loved the shit out of it!  I think there's more than a little of this show in Angel, especially the theme music (which I now see has been mentioned).  One of my luckiest pawn shop finds was the complete 3rd season box set for $5.  I believe the whole thing is on YouTube too, but in 360p quality."
Vampire Knight,"It's one of those series that I actually love how gutsy the ending was. It was a definitive, *Hey, maybe this series could have another season....wait, no, never mind.* 

LaCroix was such a great antagonist and one of my favorite popculture vampires. You never know how exactly he felt about Nick at any given moment. Maybe he hated him. Maybe he loved him. Maybe he just wanted to toy with him. Who knew?"
Vampire Knight,"This definitely a favorite 90s show of mine alongside the likes of Flash, the Dark Shadows revival, the three TNG-era Star Trek shows, Lois & Clark, Hercules and Xena, Sliders, Wings, and Millennium. I got all three seasons of Forever Knight on the original DVD releases and love it, all the cast, the flashback motif every episode, plus the story is never afraid of how dark it can get."
Vampire Knight,i've seen a few episodes of this and i loved it - i keep meaning to go back and properly watch it. i think now is the time.
Vampire Knight,"I think of that show everytime I see John Kapelos pop up in a role.

Catherine Disher has a regular gig on Good Witch."
Vampire Knight,"I loved it!!!   I think of it often.  He was brought across in 1228.....

Is it streaming anywhere?   I have the dvd box set but I’d love it if it was streaming.  I second the recommendation up thread for Blood Ties.  Liked that one too."
Vampire Knight,"From the very beginning when FK was part of the CBS Crime Time after Prime Time lineup, Natalie was always my favorite character. She still is and I’ll watch anything Catherine Disher is in."
Vampire Knight,Loved this show back in the day. I have a feeling it might be ruined if I tried to rewatch it now.
Vampire Knight,"Loved it when Nick would vamp out and say *""Skankeeeeee!""*

Edit - oh I almost forgot!  Remember that one where the fucking dog was a vampire?"
Vampire Knight,"Aw, I liked the Forever Knight finale. I think it inspired Angel's ending but in a different way. Angel and Nick's final scene ended with them going out but while Nick gave up on life, Angel went down in a blaze of glory. But the end result was the same. There would be no next season. (And I don't care if Angel had further seasons in comics. I don't count those as canon.)"
Vampire Knight,Of angel or forever knight?
Vampire Knight,"I always watched Buffy so I was familiar with Angel but when he got his own show I thought ""this is Forever Knight"" it was kind of off putting at times how close the two were. Especially since a lot of the things we see in Angel we didn't see in Buffy, such as the theme music, the car, even Darla wasn't much of a factor in Buffy but was pretty close to Jeanette in Angel."
Vampire Knight,"Oh, they used to play that show in the US on syndication. I loved that show."
Vampire Knight,"Man, I only got to see a bit of that."

Vampire Knight,"It’s broody and super cheesy but also kind of rad. The set design and craftsmanship is pretty good for the time. There are a lot of flashbacks to ancient and medieval times with parallels to the A story. It kind of plays out like a quasi gothic police procedural. You’ll recognize a lot of mainly Canadian, but also some British actors who went on to varying degree of success.  It’s a little bit risqué for an early 90s network tv show as there is some language, skin and some other thematic elements.

It also has kind of a rad post punk soundtrack."
Vampire Knight,[deleted]
Vampire Knight,"It has some creepy and cheesy stories. But, I would love a modern day version of it, with both John LeMay and Louise Robbey helping out some younger family members in tracking down the rest of the artifacts."
Vampire Knight,Lucky. I had to order the 3rd season box for 45 quid from amazon. And that was years ago.
Vampire Knight,OMG the dog episode.
Vampire Knight,You can not count them as canon if you want but they were done by the creator of the show and considered canon. So they aren't your head canon but they are canon in the overall mythology.
Vampire Knight,*Forever Knight.* I thought *Angel's* finale was swell.
Vampire Knight,"There were some key differences for example the career choices, Nick was a full-fledged Detective on the police force whereas Angel was more an unofficial ""private investigator"" whom on top of saving lives like Nick went further by prioritizing the salvation of peoples souls. Angel was a very serialized story where you literally shouldn't miss an episode and only occasionally did flashbacks in certain episodes, Forever Knight on the other hand was very episodic and had flashbacks in every single episode."
Vampire Knight,"That's weird, because when I click on it my link works and yours doesnt"
Vampire Knight,"Yes, on the soundtrack. I remember watching scenes at Janette's club over and over again just for the songs. Especially [Automaton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i67GQMplzDg) by United State."
Vampire Knight,Thematic elements? Elements of themes?
Vampire Knight,Well no offense but I could never ‘gel’ with trailer park boys - GF lives it though
Vampire Knight,"Seeing Things, You Can’t Do That on Television, to name a few more."
Vampire Knight,It really was.  There's a used media chain that has had 2 copies for $45 for like 3 years now.  They even have 50% sales around Christmas and I just couldn't make myself do it.
Vampire Knight,"> *Good boy!*

Good grief that fucking show"
Vampire Knight,"The last ')' gets cut off from the url when I click on your link.  That takes me to a page with ""Did you mean: The Odyssey (TV series)?"".

I added the cancel character so it treats the ')' as part of the url.   Odd that it is working differently for you than me."
Vampire Knight,"A lot weird stuff, mainly sexual dialogue. By today’s cable standards it would be considered a little weird, but nothing quite taboo."
Vampire Knight,[deleted]
Vampire Knight,For some reason the third series is a tough find.
Vampire Knight,I was really just pointing out how meaningless the phrase 'thematic elements' is. :P
Vampire Knight,I'm kind of embarrassed to learn that trailer park boys was one of ours.
Vampire Knight,It really is.  Probably low print run.
Vampire Knight,"I hear you, it’s kind of a catch-all term for the film industry, but it does have meaning. 

[thematic elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thematic_elements)"
Vampire Knight,"I loved it. Gothic, broody atmosphere, oozing mood and style, and really tight writing that explores a broad range of ethical and philosophical themes. They developed the idea of a conscience-stricken vampire seeking to redeem himself and regain his humanity, years before *Angel* was a twinkle in Joss Whedon's eye.

The acting is top-notch. Each episode contains a flashback to the past, and the actors all adopt a more theatrical style of acting in the flashbacks than they do in the present day.

S3 is weaker than the first two seasons but still not bad."
Vampire Knight,[deleted]
Vampire Knight,"I adored that show. It has that late 80's/early 90's urban gothic vibe down cold but with a cop procedural twist. I know the cop/detective + supernatural is an old trope but it works here because the characters are fun. Especially, the main antagonist, Lucien LaCroix, who just steals every scene he is in. Yes, he chews scenery but he does it with such gusto."
Vampire Knight,I watched when it was on. It started with a bad pilot staring Rick Springfield. The show was good up until the last couple seasons.
Vampire Knight,I still love it!!! I bought the first two seasons on DVD and I’m debating whether to buy season 3 (because it was so upsetting)
Vampire Knight,I have seen it and have all three seasons. This show has a special place in my heart
Vampire Knight,"Forever Knight was one of my all time favorite series from that era.. I'm proud to say I've got all 3 seasons on DVD.  I've binge watched every episode within 2 weeks (only that long because I only watched non stop on my days off from work)

The dynamic between the actors is top notch, especially the way Nigel Bennett nails every single moment on screen! There's just something about him as LaCroix that makes you like him, even though he's a constant thorn in Nick's side. 

If you're looking for an amazing show from the mid 80's then look no farther than Forever Knight, you won't be disappointed."
Vampire Knight,It didn't hold up when it was originally on
Vampire Knight,"I've never even heard of this show, but I'm just gonna break it down

There's a vampire show called ""Forever Knight"" and you're really wondering if it holds up... come on man"
Vampire Knight,"Season 3 was the weakest but at least we got LaCroix's backstory out of it. And, boy, was it a doozey."
Vampire Knight,"i LOVED kindred back when it first aired. i barely remember it now lol. all i remember is that i loved how they treated it almost like a mob. like it was organized.
besides that and Highlander, what other canadian shows are from that era that fit into this conversation?"
Vampire Knight,Are vampires the only supernatural element in Forever Knight or are there ever other creatures/occult elements?
Vampire Knight,"Kindred was great!! My little heart burst into a million pieces when Mark Frankel (the actor who played the vampire, Julian) died suddenly in a lorry accident shortly after the cancellation."
Vampire Knight,"I think the actor's name is Nigel Bennett. He's a big reason why I've always been curious about the show. I know him from another incredibly bizarre Canadian series called The Lexx.

Have you ever watched Alien Nation. Aliens instead of supernatural, still with a cop twist. And the characters are fun."
Vampire Knight,Last couple? It was only 3 seasons long lol
Vampire Knight,"I saw the Rick Springfield pilot movie when it was originally on — and I *loved* it. 

Tried to rewatch the pilot a couple of years ago with my husband who had watched Forever Knight but never the “Nick Knight” pilot...and dear god it’s **bad**. I guess my 9 year old self was NOT a good judge of quality."
Vampire Knight,Did you ever watch the show The Lexx. It was so weird and I wouldn't recommend it for most people. But Nigel Bennett was great in that show
Vampire Knight,"LaCroix was the best character any time he was on screen, thanks greatly to Nigel Bennett's deliciously over-the-top performance.

*Father's Day* is my favorite LaCroix episode."
Vampire Knight,[deleted]
Vampire Knight,"> i LOVED kindred back when it first aired. i barely remember it now lol. all i remember is that i loved how they treated it almost like a mob. like it was organized.

FWIW, the Kindred TV show was based on the Vampire: The Masquerade RPG:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire:_The_Masquerade"
Vampire Knight,"Yeah, it's a vampire only show. No werewolves. No witches. No demons. I...don't remember any ghosts. And the classic pop culture vampire tropes are there. Fangs. Can fly like Lost Boys style. Can't do sunlight. Not too keen on crosses and holy imagery. (There was an episode where the main vampire had to hang out in a church and it didn't work out that well for him.) Immortal. Super strong. Super healing factor. Can die from a stake to the heart. Can hypnotize people."
Vampire Knight,I loved Alien Nation when I was a kid and then all the TV movies that came after when the initial series was canceled. There was some great world building with the alien race in that show.
Vampire Knight,"My statement stands. Tho to be fare, watching it all the way thru makes it feel longer."
Vampire Knight,The make up lines alone... holy cow that was bad. But I can’t believe the series was only 3 seasons. When I was a kid it felt like it was on forever!
Vampire Knight,Never got to actually.  I'll have to try to find it somewhere.. any idea if it's on a streaming service like Prime video or Netflix?
Vampire Knight,"I can never get into millennium. Besides one episode where a bunch of demons were sitting in a coffee shop telling stories. And I think the show had one crossover with the X-Files. But the show itself didn't really work for me.

I didn't watch moonlight because it looked too similar to forever knight. which is funny that that would bother me because I never actually watched forever knight lol

Never heard of blood ties tho"
Vampire Knight,"Thanks. It sounds interesting and I will check it out. I've seen a few pics that made me hope it was kinda like a cop/procedural version of Dark Shadows (seems liked a similar melodramatic Gothic atmosphere) and would feature all kinds of things but vampires only is fine too, if it's good."
Vampire Knight,Last I saw it was free on IMDb. Which I think is owned by prime now. So it should be easy to find
Vampire Knight,"Cool, I've got Prime video now so I'll have to check it out sometime. 👍👍"
Vampire Knight,"Only if Lazlo is a presenter.

Would be comedy gold from the first moment"
Vampire Knight,[deleted]
Vampire Knight,Let the Nadia doll do it.
Vampire Knight,This fuck-king guy
Vampire Knight,"only if Lazlo accompanies him

Jackie Daytona would suffice as well"
Vampire Knight,Sounds kinda boring. Now if a world renowned yo yo master happened to show up...
Vampire Knight,I would actually watch that
Vampire Knight,The whole cast should host.  Matt Berry is my favorite actor in television right now.  Lazlo is born to be an MC.
Vampire Knight,Wouldn't it be more fitting for him to host The Emmys?
Vampire Knight,He does a great W.C. Fields
Vampire Knight,"They really should have characters, not actors, host."
Vampire Knight,Nah I think Jackie Daytona should.
Vampire Knight,"Hey, dipshit! That is a fantastic idea."
Vampire Knight,I'd sign that petition
Vampire Knight,"Colin Robinson as K-Strasse, the Yo-Yo guy. https://youtu.be/dj9VF7LyffU"
Vampire Knight,If only to hear him tell us a thoroughly detailed speech about how sound editing and sound mixing are different.
Vampire Knight,">The most energy draining Oscars ceremony of all time. 

Maybe, Franco will be hard to beat."
Vampire Knight,"One of my coworkers and I were talking about What We Do in the Shadows and another coworker came to us and said his neighbor growing up is on show. Guess who it is?

Colin Robinson himself, Mark Proksch."
Vampire Knight,Steven Toast is already in Tinseltown..
Vampire Knight,I thought it said Craig Robinson at first. And now that sounds more appealing to me
Vampire Knight,"Good idea, but considering what happened on Shadows this season I’m not sure that’s possible......"
Vampire Knight,I think he'll only host it if you give him some more updog.
Vampire Knight,"Wait, did Tim Robinson say no?"
Vampire Knight,I read that as Tim Robinson and was immediately on board.
Vampire Knight,"It’s a good idea, I’m just not sure there would be enough updog."
Vampire Knight,Only person I would watch for
Vampire Knight,"As a Colin Robinson fan, I approve of this message."
Johnny Test,*whipping noise*
Johnny Test,"""Why didn't you stop for Police Officers?""

""Why are you guys Police Officers?""

""I blew up Malaysia"""
Johnny Test,I always dismissed Johnny Test as the Best Value version of Dexter's Laboratory. Is it worthwhile?
Johnny Test,Why
Johnny Test,My kid (10) raged about the animation. I just thought it made Johnny look a little more like a teen.
Johnny Test,"If Johnny Test can get a revival in 2021, is there hope for some other  early/mid 2000s shows I grew up with? 

(*Cough*, Jackie Chan Adventures, Code Lyoko, *Cough*)"
Johnny Test,Holy crap. I completely forgot this existed. I used to watch this all the time. Maybe I should give it a nostalgia watch.
Johnny Test,this show has surprising longevity. i was getting into my tween years when this came out but I don't remember it being that big.
Johnny Test,"Dookie’s voice sounded different in the trailer, or maybe I’m just misremembering."
Johnny Test,Are they gonna keep the villains because uhhh
Johnny Test,"What an odd show. I watched for a year or two back in the day, but I've never seen or heard anyone say that Johnny Test is one of their favorite shows they watched as a kid. Despite this it still permeates in my generation's culture 7 or 8 years after we all watched it last, if only just."
Johnny Test,"This is the kind of show that is nice to watch when you're a kid, but would be very boring as an adult. Even as a kid, the best part of the show was that it was a cartoon lol."
Johnny Test,Interesting they brought back Scott fellows.
Johnny Test,Not with the same theme song tho smfh
Johnny Test,the art style is terrible..
Johnny Test,No one asked…
Johnny Test,"Haha reboots/adaptations of old Ip accounts for 80% of all media.

How innovative"
Johnny Test,Ugh
Johnny Test,Mr. Black and Mr. White were the best part of that show
Johnny Test,"It is mostly that, but the side characters (sisters) are more engaged in the science. The boy is more adventurous. In other words, it’s just different enough"
Johnny Test,I never got into it. Johnny just seemed like kind of a douche who never learned anything.
Johnny Test,It's a show I watched a shit ton as a kid but never really loved. It's good but not worth going out of your way for.
Johnny Test,"I absolutely hated it as a kid. Johnny and the stupid dog were annoying as fuck, and the sisters weren't interesting."
Johnny Test,I liked it!
Johnny Test,"It's fine, it's not great, but it's not horrible, it's just average. I do like the sisters designs though"
Johnny Test,"It’s an easy watch, if you like cartoons. Not too many real high level concepts, but entertaining enough that it doesn’t matter."
Johnny Test,It’s good. Like surprisingly good.
Johnny Test,"The first season animation was amazing cuz it was hand drawn till they went digital or flash or whatever they’re using, excuse my art"
Johnny Test,">Code Lyoko

live action...i'd watch it"
Johnny Test,I would prefer not to have Jackie Chan back after his comments about the Hong Kong protests and just utterly sucking the peen of the CCP
Johnny Test,American Dragon: Jake Long?
Johnny Test,Jackie Chan can be problematic with the current CCP issues. Let's bring back Xiaolin Showdown instead. Loved that show.
Johnny Test,It doesn’t… super hold up.
Johnny Test,"It's sounds a little off, it could just be because the actor is older"
Johnny Test,[removed]
Johnny Test,It’s what made Jonny test funny and stupid lol
Johnny Test,https://youtu.be/5wT4UbxQiTg
Johnny Test,Any episode where they all raced were my favorites.
Johnny Test,I would say that is an accurate representation of a 12 year old.
Johnny Test,So Deedee.
Johnny Test,"Exactly. It’s a show that if it was on, you wouldn’t change the channel, but you would be like “Man, I wish this was Avatar or something.”"
Johnny Test,"Well, uh, I hate to break it to you, but...

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91Z411LTNAk

It already exists! (And it's not pretty)"
Johnny Test,Give Zixx a try
Johnny Test,Jackie Chan did not actually voice Jackie Chan in *Jackie Chan Adventures* interestingly enough. That was [James Sie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Sie).
Johnny Test,I can't believe it's taken this long for people to find out Jackie Chan is a nationalist. Did Americans sour on nationalism or something?
Johnny Test,"My dude, you are not the target demographic. My son actually just discovered the original a few weeks ago, and he is ecstatic about this reboot."
Johnny Test,"I knew it was absurd and almost entirely why I couldn't watch this, but holy cow."
Johnny Test,Deedee with more toilet humor.
Johnny Test,Deedee except she's the main character and every episode is her doing annoying stupid shit with no consequences
Johnny Test,"For me it was a show where if it was on and nothing else was, I would actually just turn the tv off."
Johnny Test,"I’d like to see an American company take another pass at it.

*Monster Squad* meets *TRON* meets *Fast Times at Ridgemont High*. Easy."
Johnny Test,"Is it bad that I actually enjoyed it? Also didn't realise it was French, that definitely makes sense."
Johnny Test,I guess promoting Jackie Chan is what I’d be against. Maybe a similar show with the same voice actor as a spiritual successor would be good by this point.
Johnny Test,Americans are very good at sticking their head in the sand when it comes to something they like having a bad history or doing morally corrupt things.
Johnny Test,"okay, but he's speaking to another adult who's considering a nostalgia watch

from an adult perspective, it doesn't...super hold up"
Johnny Test,Same
Johnny Test,"It's certainly surreal to see it in live action... I guess it's hurt by the limited budget which makes every XANA attack basically boil down to ""possess someone and try to attack the heroes"" instead of the creative threats they could pull off in animation. The CGI parts were pretty cool and you could tell how far it had come from the original."
Johnny Test,Jackie Chan adventures was alright but Xiaolin showdown was better and basically the same premise.
Johnny Test,Maybe center the show around a grown-up Jade?
Johnny Test,"Point still stands. This show is not aimed at adults, so adults angry that a reboot of a children's show that doesn't target adults can, frankly, die mad about it."
Johnny Test,"One thing's for sure, every time I watched them in the virtual world, I wanted to play that game they were in."
Johnny Test,"Xiaolin Showdown actually DID get a revival a few years back (I think on Disney XD?) called Xiaolin Chronicles. Unfortunately they replaced most of the voices, even Wayne Knight..."
Johnny Test,"There is a level of aggression here that I’m not sure Johnny Test of all thing warrants. It’s fine that it’s aimed at younger kids, it’s also fine that I didn’t find it as enjoyable once I wasn’t a kid anymore."
Johnny Test,who said they were mad about it
Johnny Test,Wait what? Is it any good? At least the writing?
Johnny Test,I'm not upset that you didn't enjoy it. My point is more that you outgrew ADHD in television form and act like it doesn't hold up when you've grown beyond the shows demo.
Johnny Test,"Unfortunately, not really... here's a YouTuber's take on it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqoLmkEVOlE"
Johnny Test,"A guy asked if he should watch it for nostalgia. Another guy said no, because it doesn't hold up for adults. What exactly are you arguing? Nobody even said the show sucks because it's not enjoyable for adults. They just said it's not enjoyable for adults, period. In response to somebody asking if it is"
Johnny Test,I didn't finish that video but I'm saving it for when I rewatch Xiaolin Showdown now because in the first 3 minutes I just realized I remember none of that show except how good it was.
Johnny Test,"I don’t think they *can’t*, they just choose to do parodies instead.

Kiss guest-starred as themselves in a Fairly OddParents special, IIRC."
Johnny Test,"They can, they just choose not to."
Johnny Test,Are you telling me Chip Skylark isn’t real?
Johnny Test,"A lot of it has to do with laws protecting children from advertisements. Like, if you see product placement there is almost certainly a behind the scenes deal Arby's paid X to be featured. 

Likewise, using a product without a deal can be problematic. Not just because that is money left on the table, it can also alienate potential sponsors and can lead to legal trouble."
Johnny Test,[deleted]
Johnny Test,[deleted]
Johnny Test,"fairly odd parents did have some exceptions like Adam West, and Stephen Hawking"
Johnny Test,How about the celebrities?
Johnny Test,"Tons, like Mcdonalds, Outback steakhouse, Disney, etc."
Johnny Test,"Those are all mixes of it, like Simpsons made a parody of Star Wars call cosmic wars despite the fact that Star Wars is established to exist in the world of the Simpsons multiple times, or how Bojack Horseman has Jurj Cloonis instead of Clooney even though George Clooney exists in Bojack"
Johnny Test,"I think it's very much so a choice. Like The Simpsons uses Steve Mobbs over Steve Jobs, but also did Bill Gates in the past.

It also makes sense if you compare your examples. Robot Chicken often does parodies of pop culture things and South Park, especially now, is more satirical than anything else. In these situations it makes more sense to actually use the name, whereas what possible benefit could Fairly Odd Parents have to include Selvester Stallone? Kids likely won't know who he is, it increases their legal risk and they're often such side characters it makes no actual difference in the end."
Johnny Test,Why can't they have Sylvester Stalone you aren't required to pay plus he's a nice guy I'm pretty sure he won't sue the pants off Viacom for that
Johnny Test,"You act like this is a complicated question.

You can use his name and risk repercussions for little to no reason or you can slightly change his name, decrease liability, without losing people on the reference."
Johnny Test,It's always been a pet peeve of mine.
Johnny Test,"Hm, I watched the original religiously when I was younger but I don't remember ever enjoying it. Always felt very cheap."
Johnny Test,"Oh interesting. The colour pallet change definitely leans to a younger audience. I see some familiar villains, will this follow the pre-established lore of the orig actually I don't give a shit. I'm going back to bed. I need to get my shit together, use the precious time I have left on this planet. There's gotta be more than this. Fucking Johnny Test man"
Johnny Test,"okay, fine"
Johnny Test,sure.
Johnny Test,"That part in the intro where Johnny transforms into a girl made me think about some stuff as a kid ngl.

Also that episode of Fairly Oddparents where Timmy wishes to be a girl."
Johnny Test,Why can’t they reboot a good show like Dexter’s Lab or Courage?
Johnny Test,Huh
Johnny Test,no mister black and mister white i want my money back
Johnny Test,Not as good as the original.
Johnny Test,A boy with special needs is experimented on by his psychopathic sisters
Johnny Test,"Im 27 so was a little old for Johnny Test when it came out but I remember seeing a few episodes and thinking ""Man, I would've loved this show when I was a kid"""
Johnny Test,"Seems like they ~~stole~~ got ideas from other shows.  Genius sibling - dex lab, evil baby - family guy, gps escape - rick and morty.  Not knocking it since all ideas come from somewhere, but some of them are a little to on the nose."
Johnny Test,*record scratch*
Johnny Test,Yep. Looks like Johnny Test all right.
Johnny Test,I read this as Johnny Quest and now I'm unreasonably disappointed.
Johnny Test,It used to hate how frequently they played it. I was target demographic and all I would think about is wanting to watch Ed edd and eddy or courage instead. But there wouldn’t be any other cartoons on so I put up with it.
Johnny Test,[deleted]
Pokemon: Indigo League,$60 though? I'm not sure its worth that IMO
Pokemon: Indigo League,"Wouldn't it be great if they finally released the episodes that never got localized?  They've confirmed they recorded the english audio for the Porygon and the Dratini/Safari Zone episode, they were just never released.  Surely they could release an edit of the Porygon episode with no chance of giving seizures.  And the previous DVD releases exclude the Beauty and the Beach episode even though it did air once heavily edited in english."
Pokemon: Indigo League,What?
Pokemon: Indigo League,"Do you mean you want to watch up until X/Y? As there's like, over 900 episodes, it may be hard to track them all down!"
Pokemon: Indigo League,[deleted]
Pokemon: Indigo League,"Yea, I dont think I was very clear, on netflix, there are only ~50 episodes streamable, even thought there are 70+ aired. I'm asking if there are any other places to find the remaining episodes. (Is it clear?)"
Pokemon: Indigo League,"How is that relevant to the question?
"
Pokemon: Indigo League,The rest of orange island can be found on the internet on anime websites
Pokemon: Indigo League,"Yeah, through illegal sites, Netflix is the only place that legally streams Pokemon in full.

Though the [official Pokemon site](http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-episodes/?mo_ar=true) does stream some of the episodes, take a look on there."
Pokemon: Indigo League,"So Ash goes on vacation to Hawaii and:  


\- Trains not one, but TWO legendary pokémon, and evolves both of them

\- Becomes a power ranger

\- Wins the Pokemon League 

&#x200B;

... All while attending school."
Pokemon: Indigo League,Jesus Christ I was in 7th grade when he started. I've ruined my life like 7 times over since then.
Pokemon: Indigo League,"Holy shit, between this and the new anime teaser showing Pokemon from all 8 regions... Does this mean we're finally getting the Champion League arc that was hinted at back in Diamond/Pearl?!"
Pokemon: Indigo League,Does this mean he's now finally able to awake from the coma he was put in when the lightning struck him in the very first episode?
Pokemon: Indigo League,This is bizarre and what Alternative universe do we live. Does this mean Ash will grow up now that he isn't ten anymore? Will he finally go on a date with Serena and friendzone her.
Pokemon: Indigo League,[deleted]
Pokemon: Indigo League,"#A

pokemon league."
Pokemon: Indigo League,Shame he won the least prestigious one ever :/
Pokemon: Indigo League,he finally became the very best 😭
Pokemon: Indigo League,Sooo does this mean we can finally get a new protagonist??
Pokemon: Indigo League,Like about time but this is a little lame. Alolah is like the baby brother of leagues. Not even 6v6 and the competition was mehhh. If Ash had to win it should have been XY or Sinnoh when his team was pretty stacked. Ash winning at least may retire his character or else he’s going to need to come back guns blazing.
Pokemon: Indigo League,"*After 22 years, he finally wins*

*still a 10 year old boy*

Wat"
Pokemon: Indigo League,Is it just me or is Ash looking a little... puffy?
Pokemon: Indigo League,"Imagine being 7 when this started and you quickly became entranced in it. Followed by Pokémon dwindling as the teenage years fired up, graduating high school and college working up to 5 yrs as a Store Manager followed by District Manager. Then suddenly one day hearing of this again and it’s huge popular resurgence and you see the 12 & 14 year olds as entranced with Pokemon GO as you were with that binder and as protective of their phones as you were with the holographic mewtwo, after all this, it still took Ash this damn long to win. Da-damn dude."
Pokemon: Indigo League,"After 22 years Ash, **age 10**, has finally won the Pokemon League."
Pokemon: Indigo League,"Damn, he must have finally figured out the leveling system"
Pokemon: Indigo League,"I wonder  if that means that that the rumors about the  Anime FINALLY writing out Ash is true. I would be glad. They actually wanted to want him to win the Sinnoh-League  back in the  day and write him out there  - which is why he was written much more mature and capable there - but then production  meddling hjappend and they were told to keep Ash, which why he got unfairly decimated in Sinnoh by a One-Time Character with two Legis almost sweeping his Team. 

And honestly, that would be a good way  to end it.  The SM-Anime was pretty good,  in its own  unique way. Diffrent from previous seasons, but I think that would make a great end for Ash. 

Honestly,  if someone were to ask me, I would have prefered them to go the Digimon-Route from the beginning,  with unique protagonists for each region (or at  least not more as two seasons.)"
Pokemon: Indigo League,Didn't he win that league in the second series? Uhhh... Orange league?
Pokemon: Indigo League,So he won a league that was pretty lackluster and he used a team that’s arguably worse then his Kanto team
Pokemon: Indigo League,High-key upset this didn't happen during DP or XY which are the best written Pokemon series to date and had Ash experience true character development where he became a brilliant strategist but hey a win is a win.
Pokemon: Indigo League,Why does that thumbnail look so...off?
Pokemon: Indigo League,“...And after 22 years - ASH KETCHUM”
Pokemon: Indigo League,Spoilers? Like wtf is this shit.
Pokemon: Indigo League,"I was going to joke about how Ash hasn't aged at all, but then I saw the thumbnail.

Yikes. He hasn't aged well at all."
Pokemon: Indigo League,Literally been waiting for this since I was born (I’m 22). So what do I do now with my life?
Pokemon: Indigo League,"First Team Rocket finally beat Ash legit two years ago, and now Ash finally prevails in the Pokemon League. Sun and Moon has provided some noteworthy moments"
Pokemon: Indigo League,"As he returned home, he found the professor is his new dad."
Pokemon: Indigo League,Why isn't this listed as spoiler? Iam watching the show and finding this out like this is really shitty.
Pokemon: Indigo League,What's wrong with his face?
Pokemon: Indigo League,"I watched it live, so this doesn't effect me personally, but I wish OP had kept the Alola League winner ambiguous in the title. Plenty of fans are either waiting for the fansubs later today or the English dub later in the year. The episode had only just aired when this was posted, not even a day was given to spoil the winner. Pokémon's sub-reddit at least kept titles spoiler-free."
Pokemon: Indigo League,The fuck happened to his face?
Pokemon: Indigo League,"Did you do it?

Yes

What did it cost?

22 bloody years of torture"
Pokemon: Indigo League,Wow spoilers
Pokemon: Indigo League,"Is it weird to actually be proud of an anime character? I’ve definitely had more than one shit-talking conversation about this exact thing. 

And now the boy’s gone and done it. Those feels."
Pokemon: Indigo League,Fuck you and this massive fucking spoiler
Pokemon: Indigo League,Y'know that means he's reached the highest he can in his career by 32. Pretty good imo.
Pokemon: Indigo League,Fuck ash. Hes weak. Red would destroy him.
Pokemon: Indigo League,Finally finally
Pokemon: Indigo League,"/u/NicholasCajun  /u/DasHuhn  /u/hero0fwar /u/Prax150 

Spoilers rule?"
Pokemon: Indigo League,dude.....spoilers
Pokemon: Indigo League,"When did the traditional ""look"" change? It looks very different."
Pokemon: Indigo League,"Da fuq are those lines on his face? 

That’s not the ash ketchum i know"
Pokemon: Indigo League,"I know 'dae still 10' but it's always thrown me that the meme is he's such a loser after putting in multiple high level finishes. It's like, he's a generic enough self-insert as it is - shouldn't we be celebrating that he's not depicted as unbeatable?

Certainly still neat that they finally did it, especially after spending literally decades building up to it."
Pokemon: Indigo League,Now he just has to find his dad
Pokemon: Indigo League,Didn’t this League consist of like 10 trainers that inhabited the island? Lmao. Guess they realized they fucked up so badly with the Kalos League ending that they’re finally bailing on Ash.
Pokemon: Indigo League,RIP people who havent seen the episode.
Pokemon: Indigo League,This story was picked up by our actual local news channel: https://wgntv.com/2019/09/15/ash-ketchum-finally-becomes-the-very-best-wins-pokemon-league/?fbclid=IwAR0FN_pGv3azLJHNzhwCIGLTXoX4oQyVfZhIwFrqVcRhkju6McEFZWk6QJs
Pokemon: Indigo League,"And yet not aged a day, I think he’s secretly a midget"
Pokemon: Indigo League,[deleted]
Pokemon: Indigo League,SPOILER ALERT!
Pokemon: Indigo League,So what is he gonna do with his life now?
Pokemon: Indigo League,"Alola is a fake league, final match is 3 vs 3. Almost none of the contestants ever did an official match"
Pokemon: Indigo League,"After his BS win against Hau, this is probably the league he least deserved to win."
Pokemon: Indigo League,And he is still 10 years old right haha
Pokemon: Indigo League,"I just found it on youtube.

For such a (seemingly) important moment, I wish they would have improved the animation quality.  I saw a clip of a previous season with Greninja and the animation was really good.  It's too bad they didn't do that here too."
Pokemon: Indigo League,That kid doesn't look like Ash.
Pokemon: Indigo League,Wow his face looks stupid. What the hell happened?
Pokemon: Indigo League,"HE GOT TO BE, THE VERY BEST, LIKE NO ONE EVER WAS

TO CATCH THEM WAS HIS REAL QUEST, TO TRAIN THEM WAS HIS CAUSE

HE TRAVELED ACROSS THE LAND, SEARCHING FAR AND WIDE

EACH POKEMON, HE UNDERSTANDS, THE POWER THAT’S INSIDE"
Pokemon: Indigo League,What happened to Ash's face
Pokemon: Indigo League,"*30 years later at a bar in pallet town*

Blue: ""Hey I'm looking for a man named Ash Ketchum""

Ash: ""I haven't been called that in years""

Que Movie based around ash Ketchum coming out of retirement to defeat Red, who after losing his mind on Mt Silver has returned to take control of each region by wiping out each and every single elite 4 member."
Pokemon: Indigo League,"OK look I love that he finally won (I don't even care about the rest of the Anime I grew up with Digimon Beyblade Yugioh that shit felt like they just wanted more money with the new shit no harm in that but I liked Ash coming back)but if this means Ash isnt going to be in S&S and this anime is the shitty ending they give him ""I dun wan it.""

Not with this shitty Anime. It's alright don't get me wrong but damn did they Peppa Piggged/Paw Patrolled/shitty Netflix kid showed it. I mean my nephews like it but damn they don't even know about Johto Hoenn Battle Frontier Orange Island Sinnoh. I thought Kalos was bad but damn I really wanted Ash to go all out for once if what I read is right he beat Gladion(Lillie's Brother?) its like if Ash beat Brock to become a Pokémon Champion back in Kanto."
Pokemon: Indigo League,that art style is fucking revolting
Pokemon: Indigo League,Finally has finally?
Pokemon: Indigo League,He should've won the kalos region championship... His greninja was op as fuck
Pokemon: Indigo League,"When did the animation switch to ""looks like something my little brother drew in 3rd grade art class?"""
Pokemon: Indigo League,[deleted]
Pokemon: Indigo League,Wow are they operating on a shoestring budget or have they just given up. The screenshot looks ugly as hell.
Pokemon: Indigo League,Finally finally!
Pokemon: Indigo League,I'm still pissed off at his animation.He looks like a Peanuts character
Pokemon: Indigo League,"I think the show went downhill after Sinnoh. He had a very powerful team there, along with his old pokemon. But then they had to introduce Tobias and ruin it. All seasons after that were just bad. Like pikachu losing to a snivy, and a rowlet beating the desidueye in this season."
Pokemon: Indigo League,WTF happened to Ash and Pikachu faces? They look absolutely terrible.
Pokemon: Indigo League,Spoilers
Pokemon: Indigo League,Did they cut the budget or something why does Ash look so weird
Pokemon: Indigo League,Too bad it's in this horrible art style.
Pokemon: Indigo League,"He's still 10 years old btw 

j/k I'm not sure how old he is in the newest show, but probably not much older than that"
Pokemon: Indigo League,They rebooted Ash though. so its not the same Ash that we grew up with :/. His story Ended after Pokemon XYZ.
Pokemon: Indigo League,"Are the pictures in the article what the show looks like nowadays? The artwork looks, very derpy."
Pokemon: Indigo League,God ash’s new design is absolutely horrible.
Pokemon: Indigo League,SPOILERS WHAT THE FUCK
Pokemon: Indigo League,He just had to collect them all...
Pokemon: Indigo League,"Even after 22 years, he still looks like the same 10 year old kid with his pal Pikachu. He must have already invented some age regression medicine."
Pokemon: Indigo League,What's with the vertically stretched art style?
Pokemon: Indigo League,"How....wasn't he like the worse trainer ever, sending electric types to fight ground types and such."
Pokemon: Indigo League,Wasn’t this expected since it was just his friends n not a true league
Pokemon: Indigo League,FINALLY.
Pokemon: Indigo League,So I guess that's the end of Ash's journey
Pokemon: Indigo League,Why wasnt Misty and Brock anywhere to be seen in that clip?
Pokemon: Indigo League,Well that took my entire lifetime.
Pokemon: Indigo League,And all it took was approximately 22 years for him to achieve this!!
Pokemon: Indigo League,What's wrong with his face though?
Pokemon: Indigo League,All it took was a poorly done face lift. Welcome to Hollywood.
Ink Master,“Unscripted”. Yeah right.
Ink Master,"For anyone confused about the murder charge, in California you can be charged with Second Degree Murder if you drive under the influence and it results in another persons death. Part of a conviction of this charge is proving that the person “knew that driving under the influence was dangerous to human life”. This sounds like common sense but generally a good lawyer can swing it that you didn’t know that driving under the influence could kill someone if you’ve never been caught driving under the influence before. However, in Daniel’s case, he’s been convicted previously of a DUI where you sign a form that says “you understand that driving under the influence is dangerous to human life.” So in Daniel’s case, he is being charged with Second Degree Murder and is likely to be convicted. Unless of course he pleas out which could result in a lesser charge."
Ink Master,What dumb fuck. Already had a DUI. Dude is fucked.
Ink Master,"Sounds like he'd been drinking and wanted to impress someone, so he drove too fast and wrecked, killing the passenger. Then he tried to flee the scene.

Ordinarily I'd say he's definitely going to prison for a while but he's a rich white guy so I'm guessing teary apology, slap on the wrist, ""rehab"", and he'll be back in trouble in a couple years."
Ink Master,You guys should check out this tattoo shop he used to do tats at called “the rock zone” this guy Daniel Silva has god awful reviews about how much of a dick he is to his clients. The guys an overall entitled prick who kisses the asses of celebrities and treats clients like shit.
Ink Master,That's crazy. I had been watching a bunch of tattoo videos on YouTube recently and some of them had him in it. He was a great artist. This is rough. What a fucking idiot.
Ink Master,Bye Felicia.
Ink Master,[deleted]
Ink Master,"Murder? Really? Aren’t these usually manslaughter?

If there was alcohol, I guess that’s understandable. But according to the article, that might not be the case.

*edit:* none of the info about the DUI was in the article when it was originally posted. I was the first person to comment. And there was none of that in there.￼"
Ink Master,More importantly what kind of car did he destroy?
Ink Master,"Wow

so he already has a DUI and still decided to not only drive drunk, but to careen about like a fucking mad man, high speed, running stop signs, while drunk off his ass. Then after the crash, as his friend lay dying in his car, he ran off like a bitch and tried to get away instead of rendering aid.  

Incredible"
Ink Master,Yeah I had to sign that paper too. Puts the fear of god in me that if I even have a .01 BAC and I'm involved in a wreck and someone dies then I'm going to prison for life. Also why I'm over 2 years sober. *shudders*
Ink Master,He deserves to eat the charge. Fuck him.
Ink Master,If you don’t mind me asking how do you know he had a dui previously if that’s true or not?
Ink Master,He was a whiny bitch on Ink Master. He'll piss off anyone stuck in a room with him. His own stupidity will undo any advantages he has. He killed someone. That's forever.
Ink Master,"Thankfully he wasn't jogging through a neighborhood while being black, so he'll be fine."
Ink Master,"No, he will definitely do time.

2nd degree murder in California is 15 to life.

It doesn't matter if you're white or not.

Newsflash: he is not that rich. He was making very good money but that doesn't make him rich, especially since he had a hard life style.

He'll get a good lawyer who will manage to get the judge to drop the leaving the scene charge, but the 2nd degree murder charge will stick, believe me, since he already did time for possession with intent.

With good behavior and a sincere apology to the families of the victim, he may be out on parole at about half the sentence.

So, all in all, he'll probably do 7 to 8 years plus a decade on parole."
Ink Master,He'll be dishing out some sick prison tats for as long as he lives 🔥🤣❤️

'Ink Master' Star Daniel Silva Arrested For Murder After Crash Kills YouTuber Corey La Barrie https://www.tmz.com/2020/05/11/ink-master-daniel-silva-arrested-murder-youtube-corey-la-barrie-dead-crash/"
Ink Master,"Its his second dui, he was driving like a fucking crazy person, then after the crash as his friend is laying dying in the passenger seat instead of calling 911 he abandoned a dying person and tried to flee the scene. 

Yeah, thats murder."
Ink Master,Dude tried to flee. Fuck this dude forever.
Ink Master,Possibly negligent homicide.
Ink Master,I think if they can prove he was being “chased” by law enforcement then it would be murder and not manslaughter.
Ink Master,2020 McLaren 600LT
Ink Master,Good job turning it around! Proud of you
Ink Master,Why 0.01? Isn't the legal limit 0.05 or 0.08?
Ink Master,[deleted]
Ink Master,"And frankly he deserves it. My best friend was on ink master the same time as him, and she dated him for a while after the show. He was a douuuuuche to her and anyone he ever met that he couldn’t exploit. Like he was really, really mean to waiters and baristas for no reason at all. And he treated me and my boyfriend like losers because we couldn’t up his net worth in any way. 

She told me about the felony he had from possession, and that he also has a DUI. He even convinced her to put his San Fran apartment in her name because he couldn’t get a good one with his record. The dude is screwed, and he fucking deserves every bit of it."
Ink Master,[removed]
Ink Master,On his birthday too.
Ink Master,Oh wow. That info wasn’t in the original article.
Ink Master,"He was drunk and in shock. That may help his lawyer get the attempt to leave the scene charge dropped.

The 2nd degree murder charge will probably stick."
Ink Master,"Cops don't race speeders nowadays.

1. They don't have the horse power most of the time
2. It's risky to themselves and the public at large
3. There are other means to get you: cameras, choppers, tips, plus calls to leasing agencies to find out who drives a yellow MacLaren 600 LT AND is probably very immature (age range 18-30)."
Ink Master,That's one of the stupidest death traps out there.
Ink Master,Technically you can’t get charged with being under the influence for having even .01. I think you have to be some kind of danger to society (in an accident or reckless driving) for this to apply but don’t quote me on that last part. They might be able to enforce that whenever
Ink Master,[deleted]
Ink Master,"Who's your best friend? Come on, spill the beans..."
Ink Master,Leased. LA is all about fluff.
Ink Master,Does that ink master guy make that much money to afford a quarter mil car?
Ink Master,[deleted]
Ink Master,Nah I’m sure you can all accurately guess. Lol
Ink Master,Bluff & fluff
Ink Master,"Yes, he charges thousands of dollars for his work and before he killed someone was booked until October."
Ink Master,Leases are a hell of flex
Ink Master,Probably the Youtubers car
Ink Master,"It was leased. But, yes, he made good money with his tats. He was seriously getting good. He was not to the level of a Nikko Hurtado but he showed brightness."
Ink Master,[deleted]
Ink Master,Hmm... Linzy Michelle?
Ink Master,"Yeah. His ink work was insane(was) , and I say that as someone without any tattoos. Car lease and rent a mansion. I get it. I lived in LA for 7 years, including the expensive areas of west Hollywood, so I should have known better than to ask that stupid question."
Ink Master,What's your point here apart from making yourself look like a dumbass?
Ink Master,And Jesus wept.
Ink Master,"Too bad, it was a nice show to turn your brain off until the reveal, and then make fun of the stupid ones. 

&#x200B;

All the super fake arguments between artists were beyond lame tho. They should have cut those out ages ago."
Ink Master,"Paramount is cancelling a few shows, “Ink Master, “Wife Swap,” and “Battle of the Fittest Couples” are all canceled


https://www.thewrap.com/paramount-network-drops-all-unscripted-series-in-move-to-rebrand-as-a-movie-channel/"
Ink Master,"It was a good show, but I think it had run its course.  The flash challenges were getting really stupid (Hey, here's a giant pile of buttons, glue them to a wall for an advantage in the elimination round!), the fights and arguments seemed really choreographed, and some of the tattoos that the human canvases were requesting seemed like they were fed to them by the producers (yeah, I want a photorealistic kimodo dragon riding a skateboard in front of the Milky Way Galaxy!)"
Ink Master,"Probably for the best. It became less about the craft (which is more popular than ever) and more about manufactured drama.

Also you can only poll the same region for the ""Ink Master"" so many times, which is why they end up with so many return contestants. They should've reformatted it to a tattoo contest halfway in or brought in foreign contestants. That probably would've broken their budget though."
Ink Master,2020 keeps on giving. Thought this was one of the most fun reality show competitions.
Ink Master,"My dad, and dads everywhere will be bummed out about this."
Ink Master,I didn’t know about Pecks blackface and removal from season 13 until I read the article. Season 13 was filmed before his departure so I was none the wiser.
Ink Master,Damn! I really enjoyed this show!
Ink Master,They have been releasing new eps of each season on youtube every few days. I have actually been really enjoying it
Ink Master,The rating for the show were not bad.  Given all the streaming outlets there are I would hope they shop this property around.  Does anyone know if their contract with Paramount would let them do that?
Ink Master,For there were no more worlds to conquer!
Ink Master,"Exactly how I watched it. Played on the phone or whatever until they show the tattoos. 

The fake drama was brutal."
Ink Master,Wife Swap should just be put on hold until all this shit is over...that show is hilarious.  Love the crazy people they pick.
Ink Master,"It is not just that they are also moving ""bar rescue"", what are they going to do with 3 days of the week reruns, so they must be doing a major shift."
Ink Master,I think he would have been removed for the finale only which never happened. Bit of a sad end for the show really.
Ink Master,NEW episodes? Or releasing old ones?
Ink Master,"I mean, I could easily be very wrong, but don't shows like this do better as brain-dead broadcast marathons than something you actually pick to watch?"
Ink Master,"“Hans Gruber, *Die Hard*” - Jack Donaghy, *30 Rock*"
Ink Master,[removed]
Ink Master,You have to watch after hours dvd specials for that
Ink Master,Canceled not delayed?
Ink Master,The finales are always the worst part about this show anyway.
Ink Master,"After they fired Oliver Peck I wasn't really planning to watch anymore, this is just another reason why I no longer give a shit."
Ink Master,Yup. They gave the final 3 each some cash and that was that.
Ink Master,"Which is odd, because if they just did a regular show (not live) it would be fine."
Ink Master,Exactly. I thought it made sense if the tattoos weren’t finished and they could no longer work on them. But if they’re done then have a skeleton crew film a finale or even have them Skyped in. The judges and host are really bad live anyway.
Ink Master,"Qualified to fill in for Jimmy Kimmel, act as Virginia Gov or Canadian PM."
Ink Master,"Are we actually surprised about this? 

Peck is obviously a product of his environment. I don't believe he's actually racist, but no one told him the shit he was doing was fucked up because he probably doesn't hang out with many black people. 

I think white people don't understand how out of touch they can be. You may not be a racist, but making a lot of racist jokes is still going to make someone uncomfortable even if it's just for comedic value."
Ink Master,"I’ve had the pleasure of knowing Oliver for the past couple of years. Insensitive, for sure. Racist, not even close. Sucks that he made these dumb decisions that will haunt him. He’s a genuinely a great dude and an awesome human being. Hope he learns from this and people can learn to forgive a dumb mistake."
Ink Master,Or a host on The View.
Ink Master,"Bitch, you serious?

The stories about this guy that have emerged in the last few days are INSANE.

A racist and a misogynist is really the guy you want to come out and defend? That is the cross you choose to die on?"
Ink Master,"What are your thoughts on him calling a woman coming forward with rape allegations a ""lieing, fucking whore""? That was just recently and seems like a shitty thing to do. [https://www.instagram.com/p/B6ys-xzF1KY/](https://www.instagram.com/p/B6ys-xzF1KY/)"
Ink Master,"I'm not OP but I really have no idea. Is she lying? Is her accusation credible? Doesn't seem like anyone is asking this question. If its true, Stell is a piece of shit and so is Ollie but I don't like how a video of one thing and a few sentences from 1 person turns that whole situation into something bigger without any evidence or questions being asked."
Ink Master,"Not defending him at all, but the video caption says it’s from 2014."
Ink Master,"He did it, he did the same to other women, read the story on [insta/mollyvince13](https://www.instagram.com/mollyvince13/?hl=en)

The accounts of the two women are pretty similar."
Ink Master,"That story was just...nothingness. I'm not saying that nothing happened, I'm just saying she didnt actually say anything bad happened, other than Peck like, choking her with a seatbelt in a car full of people. Not good, but given that that's literally the worst thing she said he did, other than talk shit and be full of himself, seems like a bad joke rather than a microcosm of a bigger problem. I'm not saying nothing happened, but that story was way to vague to take anything away from it. 

Also it didnt say anything at all about Stell, the man the woman Ollie called a whore was accusing. So I'm just more confused now."
Ink Master,"There are two different women at two different times that accuse one guy of choking them with a seat belt then calling it a ""joke"".

Which part of choking women with seat belts are you in support of here? ...Or its it the black face and racism that is doing it for you?

I'm not getting where you are even coming from, what's to defend?"
Ink Master,"I was originally talking about the accusations against Richard Stell. Obviously yes, Peck seemingly has a habit of choking women with a seatbelt which is not okay."
Ink Master,"Tattoo themed  ""reality shows""  , especially Ink Master, pretty much have  been like this since the days of Miami Ink. Less about the tattoos more about the drama queens and snobs that work at the tattoo parlor. "
Ink Master,"The art should speak for itself (I don't have any tattoos yet...am still trying to justify my first)...but the producers clearly feel the need (since Miami Ink) to inject constructed drama into the proceedings.

Nothing wrong with this....except it is synthetic, and akin to a soap opera."
Ink Master,"I've watched a lot of the past seasons and that sounds about par for the course.   Are there two or three angry loud guys that aren't very good, two slutty women, and three guys that actually know how to tattoo?"
Ink Master,"Yeah I thought this season was gonna be a bit of a change, both teams actually coaches by these guys could make amazing tattoos and television. But seems like more drama than ever. The 2 girls on that team seem like giant bitches already, can tell they are gonna be annoying and bringers of drama
"
Ink Master,"They've been going downhill for the last several seasons.  There is too little focus on the art and more on the manufactured drama.  Not to mention that all the women have apparently learned that low cut, bra-less, undersized shirts will get them passed through at least three more episodes than they deserve to be.  The last two shows I have to watch strictly for the talent are Face Off and Forged in Fire, where the competitive art creates the drama without the need for douchey contestants, although even FO is starting to show little cracks.  "
Ink Master,This is going to be terrible.  I will most likely watch every episode.
