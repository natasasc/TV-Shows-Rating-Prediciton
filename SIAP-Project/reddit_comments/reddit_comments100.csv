Joanna Lumleys Japan,"""There's an old saying in Tennessee‚ÄîI know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee‚Äîthat says, 'Fool me once, shame on... shame on you. Fool me‚Äîyou can't get fooled again."""
Joanna Lumleys Japan,"Joanna Lumely? Yes, darling."
Joanna Lumleys Japan,Has Richard Armitage got Netflix‚Äôs CEOs nudes or some shit
Joanna Lumleys Japan,"So they can cancel it after one season? 

Where do i sign up?"
Joanna Lumleys Japan,"Fool me once, I'm mad. Fool me twice, how could you. Fool me three times, you're officially that guy, okay? You know him, you know the one. You go up to the bar and he's like, ""This suit is, uh, officially it's a Giorgio Armani, ech, my dad knows him."" Fuck you! I aaaaain't havin' that sh*t!"
Joanna Lumleys Japan,"Lol!!!! Interesting choice of title when Netflix has become notorious for pulling the plug on good shows after one season. Yea you aren‚Äôt fooling me again Netflix! It‚Äôll have terrible viewership because nobody wants to waste their time getting invested into any more Netflix shows that get cancelled after season one. Which will ultimately lead to it being cancelled after season one ‚Ä¶ see how that works Netflix? You are unknowingly, preemptively tanking your own shows, alienating and punishing your customers for your own failures, and you‚Äôre too stupid to realize it."
Joanna Lumleys Japan,Love the Keegan
Joanna Lumleys Japan,"It was closer to ‚Äúfool me once ‚Ä¶ shame on, ü§î‚Ä¶ shame on you ‚Ä¶ fool me twice? ‚Ä¶.. wellllll you ain‚Äôt gon‚Äô fool me aginnn‚Äù"
Joanna Lumleys Japan,"Came here to say this. 

You beat me."
Joanna Lumleys Japan,"Cheers, sweetie"
Joanna Lumleys Japan,"I won‚Äôt complain because I enjoy seeing him on my TV, but I thought something like that when I saw the headline."
Joanna Lumleys Japan,I guess you missed an /s as this is a book adaptation.
Joanna Lumleys Japan,Don‚Äôt forget to sign up additional members incase you want to watch at additional locations
Joanna Lumleys Japan,"Fuck em, I‚Äôve already been fooled‚Ä¶."
Joanna Lumleys Japan,"It's literally an 8-episode limited series, so I mean I guess if you consider ""we only ever intended for one season"" to be canceling it after one season then sure."
Joanna Lumleys Japan,"Quite fond of the first series of this, but something about the second series didn't really click for me."
Joanna Lumleys Japan,love Purdey.
Joanna Lumleys Japan,Now there‚Äôs a show that needs a reboot!
Joanna Lumleys Japan,There was an episode where they would find out that she used to be a man. 
Japan with Sue Perkins,"I thought i would check the series because i really like Mel and Sue, both individually and as comedy partners. But 4.8 IMDB? Yikes. What went wrong?"
Japan with Sue Perkins,Couldn't get through this.
Japan with Sue Perkins,If you don't like the first episode you aren't going to like the rest.  I watched it because I've watched a good amount of panel shows with Perkins and Giedroyc.  If they weren't the 2 main characters I'm not sure I would have continued to watch the show.
Japan with Sue Perkins,"I applaud Sky for investing in more original series. The only negative is the fact that all their comedies are absolutely awful. I‚Äôve tried a bunch of them and not made it past the third episode of any of them. I‚Äôve never had this consistent a failure rate with any other content provider before! I just do not seem to like the same sort of shows as whoever Sky have in charge of ordering all these shows. 

I actually thought Hitmen sounded like it would be fun from the synopsis but I never made it past the second episode. This renewal is good news for the fans of the show though and Sky do seem to be pretty decent when it comes to giving shows a few seasons."
Japan with Sue Perkins,"Hitmen and Mandy are similar, if you like one try the other. I liked them both. I can understand people not liking them but these two shows surprised me. Easy to watch."
Japan with Sue Perkins,Why?
Japan with Sue Perkins,Read an actual review by an actual professional critic.  IMDB ratings are always kind of skewed to the tastes of young white American guys.  Of course they're going to give shitty ratings to a show starring two middle aged British ladies.
Japan with Sue Perkins,Was Brassic not good? I heard good things about that one.
Japan with Sue Perkins,"""Sick of it"" is alright but I could watch Karl Pilkington do anything."
Japan with Sue Perkins,"The thing is that these originals (original and drama) are now becoming their biggest performers - I think outside of Game Of Thrones, it‚Äôs usually originals getting more than 2 million viewers so regardless of quality (and they are very hit and miss) it‚Äôs a content strategy that‚Äôs working for them."
Japan with Sue Perkins,I did. Most of them are middling. I went through the user reviews as well. Will probably check out one or two episodes to see if I like it.
Japan with Sue Perkins,I think Brassic was a big hit for Sky and it definitely seems to be a show the critics think highly of as well. It just never worked for me. I bailed after the first episode. That was not super surprising though as the premise was not one that appealed to me and I just never seem to connect with Joe Gilgun‚Äôs style of humour.
Japan with Sue Perkins,"I read that somewhere about a year ago and it stuck with me. It does seem like their own content is their top rated shows outside of a few hit shows they get via the HBO deal. It is such a pity I‚Äôm failing to connect with a lot of the Sky Original shows as they do seem to be the future. I think that was inevitable as soon as it became clear that the big US media companies were looking to go direct to consumer in the near future. Disney are halfway there already and I think WarnerMedia might follow at the end of the new HBO deal. 

It makes sense for Sky to rely more on their own originals as well as content from NBCUniversal. I just hope that with Universal at the helm we start to see a better quality of Sky show in the future. I think we will as the intent to produce more of them is definitely there. I find I fare a bit better with Sky dramas than I do with the Sky comedies so perhaps it has to do with the tastes of whoever is commissioning the Sky comedies just not lining up with my own personal taste."
Japan with Sue Perkins,"The reviews I read were positive.  Not raves, but they seemed to find it to be a pleasant, likable show."
Japan with Sue Perkins,"There was an interview with Zai Bennett shortly after the WarnerMedia renewal where he stated that... and it‚Äôs becoming normal for shows like Tin Star, Riviera and Gangs Of London to break the 2 million mark with ease - and I think Chernobyl surpassed 4 million if I recall correctly. 

What you say is right... Sky will be relying more on their own content, their US sibling and I can easily imagine Sky/Peacock co-pros becoming more common.

Disney are already shoring up their content and their international plans- and I do also think this is the last renewal of the Sky/HBO pact but I think it does benefit both parties in the short term... for WarnerMedia, it gives them stability so they can launch in priority markets like Latin America (where AT&T have a market interest), for Sky it gives them a stream of US content while they build up a content pipeline via Sky Studios, it probably gives Sky and NBCU time to closer align, complete the Elstree studio as their base of operations and the co-production pact ensures both Sky and Warnermedia are getting something permanent (as in content for their respective territories) out of the pact when it ends.

I think like anything their content is going to be hit and miss - Brassic worked for me personally but then I thought Little Birds was horrendous! That being said the fact they‚Äôre throwing a lot of money at new U.K. originals is a great thing as well as some of the content coming out of Italy and Germany... if as a company you can boast Gomorrah, Chernobyl, The Young Pope and Das Boot in the last few years alone it would suggest you‚Äôre on the right track."
Japan with Sue Perkins,"I agree with pretty much everything you said! It is only a matter of time before WarnerMedia go direct to consumer in the UK market. They are the only company outside of Disney with the IP and mass appeal to make it work in the long run. I agree with your assessment that this will probably be the last HBO/Sky deal. WarnerMedia seem to be rolling out the international expansion in phases. It makes sense to minimise start up costs and I think the Sky markets will be the last of the big ones WarnerMedia enter as they are likely getting a good deal from Sky that will help them fund HBO Max while subscriber numbers are so low in the US. I tend to think that even when the current deal ends we will likely not have seen the last of the Sky/HBO co-productions. They work for both companies and HBO have shown a growing willingness lately to co-produce content with foreign companies as it lets them share costs and increase the amount of content they have for their own platform. From the outside looking in it seems that AT&T have decided to try and mix Netflix‚Äôs volume approach with HBO‚Äôs quality output as the strategy for HBO Max. 

What might help Sky is the disaster that was the US launch of HBO Max. If WarnerMedia cannot turn that around in the next 4 or 5 years then we might see another renewal of the Sky/HBO Max deal. I doubt Sky are counting on that though as it seems impossible to be able to botch such a strong proposition as HBO Max for any significant length of time even if WarnerMedia are making a good go at it! 

Disney seem quite committed to going direct with Disney+ and their new Star streamer. It will be interesting to see what that means for Sky in the long run but if they do lose all that Disney/Fox content then it just means they will have more cash to invest in their own Originals. I wonder if it will make more sense for Disney to give Sky non-exclusive access to their big theatrical releases even in the long run? That is how it has been for the last few movies with them premiering on both Sky Cinema and Disney+. It is not like that deal seems to have hurt the growth of Disney+ any so it might be a deal that makes sense for both going forward. 

I read that Sky plan to slowly increase spending on Sky Originals year on year and that by 2024 they expect to be spending twice what they did on content in 2019 so we will definitely be getting more Sky shows in the coming years. I‚Äôm not so sure we will see a lot of Sky/NBC co-productions. Seems a bit of a waste of time considering both are under the same corporate umbrella. I do think we will be seeing more Sky shows make it to Peacock in the US and more NBCUniversal shows making it to Sky in the UK. It makes sense to maximise the content across all the markets they are big players in. We might see a lot more shows with a big US star. Stuff like Intelligence. It gives Peacock a star to sell to the US audience. 

I‚Äôve not been watching a ton of Sky Original shows of late. We live in a golden era of TV content and my preference has always tended towards US shows and I find I‚Äôve got more of them on my watchlist than I have time to actually watch! That said, I do intend to try Little Birds, Gangs of London, and Code 404 and will probably try I Hate Suzie and Two Weeks to Live as well. Of that bunch it is Gangs of London that I have the highest hopes for. I‚Äôm not that hopeful for Little Birds as it is not typical my type of show but I‚Äôm still going to give it a go as the fact it got put on Sky Atlantic and not Sky One caught my interest and the trailer does make the show look like it has high production values."
Japan with Sue Perkins,"In regards to Disney, we‚Äôre already seeing some early signs of pulling away from Sky - obviously the linear channels close next month, but I note Disney Plus has scored Dark Phoenix and Spies In Disguise exclusively even though both are 20th Century Movies which Sky had apparently retained... I think the shared movies may have been a concession by Sky when negotiating for D+ access as they appeared to have the pay tv window for 2019 movies up until D+ launched. I do think however Disney are very much going to go all in on their own ecosystem and expect the Sky Cinema pact to expire (there doesn‚Äôt appear to be many ongoing tv shows licensed by Sky outside of Grey‚Äôs Anatomy, Station 19 and The Simpsons so think there would be little impact on that end).

And even if Disney launch Star here it won‚Äôt matter too much to Sky - the recent launch of the factual channel brands and Sky Comedy is very much a sign of a company who themselves shoring up their own proposition and offering themselves as a big D2C partner; just look at the recent deal with Discovery where most of it seems focused on D2C & streaming... they are sensibly investing in themselves but ensuring they have a platform that partners like Disney, Discovery and Netflix can leverage too and if WarnerMedia go it alone in 2026 (I think the deal runs until the end of 2025 based on some content expiry dates) Sky will no doubt position themselves as their primary distribution partner for them and for Star too. 

In regards to content I think Sky/Peacock co-productions may have been too literal (but still I expect to see new shows developed with both platforms onboard from the outset) but expect it will be a case that you could see more NBCU things such as Brave New World given Sky Original branding on this end and vice versa. I did read somewhere Seth MacFarlane was developing something dramatic called Wrath for Sky & Peacock but unsure how legitimate the report was but if it is the case, then I would expect that to be the first of many shows (I‚Äôm also calling it now that Battlestar Galactica will get Sky Original branding too given their connection to the 2004 series). 

I have watched a fair number of the originals and as I mentioned above, there‚Äôs interesting things coming out of Germany and Italy too like ‚ÄòHausen‚Äô which just had a trailer released and ZeroZeroZero which I hope gets a run here at some point! I think those territories are going to be no less important than the U.K. especially as non English content now travels so much better. 

Ultimately I think Sky are going to surprisingly adapt well to the streaming age - the Comcast connection is a massive advantage (and do think they are a better fit as owners than Disney as they will also actively be looking at things like developing the broadband and mobile business) and Comcast do legitimately seem like they actually want to build up some firepower for the content arms race."
Japan with Sue Perkins,Really recommend her Mekong River mini series.
Japan with Sue Perkins,Why did the original hosts leave the show ?
Japan with Sue Perkins,"The hosts said that they quit, because they felt that the producers were starting to create a more intrusive and crueler show toward the contestants."
Japan with Sue Perkins,"This is so strange to me. For 20 years, Disney had a relationship with Studio Ghibli that started out strong but was seemingly squandered in the latter half. You would think Disney and Ghibli are a match made in heaven. When they split up, I assumed Disney just didn't feel like they had any idea how to market and distribute anime."
Japan with Sue Perkins,Crazy how when I was in high school liking anime was social suicide. Glad to see it changing
Japan with Sue Perkins,"I live in Japan right now and  Disney+ has a huge anime selection with lots of new anime that is currently broadcasting still in Japan. There are no English subs though so you have to understand Japanese. But if you want to watch MS Gundam Witch from  Mercury, SpyXFamily, or Chainsaw man plus others use a VPN and switch to Japan."
Japan with Sue Perkins,"Oh fuck. Disney are so shit at releasing anime. Please just fucking stop, even Netflix are somehow better."
Japan with Sue Perkins,I don‚Äôt want Disney to mess with my anime
Japan with Sue Perkins,"Interesting strategy. Considering how poorly they handled having Studio Ghibli and the lack of adult-oriented IP outside of Marvel and Star Wars, I‚Äôm curious to see if they have a fan base for this.

It would be nice to have anime on a platform that is better constructed than Funimation or Crunchyroll"
Japan with Sue Perkins,"Disney can't keep their claws off of anything, can they? Soon they'll have a monopoly on all entertainment."
Japan with Sue Perkins,"I‚Äôm down, Tokyo Revengers is really good, and maybe it‚Äôll help include more of an audience than the kiddos"
Japan with Sue Perkins,If this means I can watch an episode of AOT without the app crashing I'm here for it. you would think Crunchyroll would be able to handle traffic on the app
Japan with Sue Perkins,"Holy shit, they are gonna ruin anime too now?"
Japan with Sue Perkins,"Yeah, because the Bleach simulcast in the EU worked so well..."
Japan with Sue Perkins,That‚Äôs the studio that did Attack on Titan (Shingeki no Kyojin) -which is fantastic-so I‚Äôm all for it.
Japan with Sue Perkins,Will we finally get decent dubs?  Only time will tell.
Japan with Sue Perkins,So hbo max is really done for‚Ä¶ jujitsu is going to be on Disney too?
Japan with Sue Perkins,Anime wars begins? Next HBO or Netflix gets all the Shueisha stuff
Japan with Sue Perkins,Nani in the Lilo and Stitch anime is gonna be hella thicc...
Japan with Sue Perkins,"Noooo, not Disney"
Japan with Sue Perkins,Good thing I have Funimation and can Pirate any other Anime I need or Disney would have finally succeeded in getting a dollar out of me.
Japan with Sue Perkins,[removed]
Japan with Sue Perkins,Will family friendly Disney really go along with some of the themes anime throws around like nothing?
Japan with Sue Perkins,"They basically still don‚Äôt. People were pissed earlier this year when they bought the rights to air Summertime Rendering, but decided to put the entire season up after it finished airing in Japan, rather than week to week as anime is traditionally broadcast."
Japan with Sue Perkins,"i think that was the thing. no one in the early 90s and 2000s really knew what to do with anime. to them it was a foreign medium that must be recontextualised for the western market. from making small changes like rice balls to doughnuts in pok√©mon. to rewriting characters and chopping plot lines like in sailor moon.

it took the success of sites like crunchyroll to make them see it could just be what it is. you don‚Äôt need to heavily localise and recontextualise it. you don‚Äôt have to attach big names to a dub cast to ensure people will watch it. let it be what it is and if it‚Äôs good they‚Äôll watch it."
Japan with Sue Perkins,"To me its wild that most anime before 2000 came from a canadian partnership and that most of the voices from every show i grew up watching was from recorded in Canada, in Vancouver. And i mean like a lot of shows, over 200+.

Think of your favorite pre 2000‚Äôs anime and the ocean group was probably involved.

The same guy that did Goku was also Miroku was also a vancouver guy!"
Japan with Sue Perkins,Disney got an ego. Didn‚Äôt want Spirited Away to be loved more than lion king
Japan with Sue Perkins,"I remember having a few select anime friends that I found by chance. One was a guy a year older than me on the basketball team with me. We were out at a weekend tournament and between games he was like ‚ÄúI gotta eat to recharge my chakra‚Äù and everyone just said haha because he said weird stuff sometimes. When everyone else walked away I quietly said to him ‚Äúsoooo you watch Naruto?‚Äù He was one of my best friends at that school for years after that haha.

Another was a kid who watched bleach and I‚Äôd talk about new episodes with him at his locker. One time I had to do a speech for some election thing and one of the things I mentioned was talking about bleach with him. It was a Christian school so they were weird and had to approve the speeches ahead of time so we didn‚Äôt say something covertly sexual in front of the whole school or whatever. So the teacher who reviewed mine was like ‚Äúwhat does this bleach line mean? What does it imply? Is it something inappropriate!?‚Äù And I had to spend like 15 minutes explaining that it‚Äôs a tv show we both like and not some hidden code."
Japan with Sue Perkins,"I‚Äôm still taken aback sometimes when I see girls who watch anime. Back in the day, it guaranteed that girls wouldn‚Äôt come near you."
Japan with Sue Perkins,"For people outside Japan, better option will be to switch to Singapore which has tons of anime with English subtitles."
Japan with Sue Perkins,"All of the shows you listed are on crunchyroll in the US, been following MSG:WFM"
Japan with Sue Perkins,It‚Äôs on Hulu here bro
Japan with Sue Perkins,Spy Family and Chainsaw man are on Crunchyroll and on Hulu in the US
Japan with Sue Perkins,Not sure where you are but they are doing a fine job with Bleach in the US.
Japan with Sue Perkins,They release it the same way?
Japan with Sue Perkins,If they're just the distributors then it's mostly fine. They've done pretty decently in most markets and hulu has been Disney's anime distribution arm stateside for a while. I think the only thing they could legit screw with is the subtitle translations.
Japan with Sue Perkins,Or westernize it
Japan with Sue Perkins,"
>the lack of adult-oriented IP outside of Marvel and Star Wars

They own Hulu, FX, Searchlight and 20th Television all of which mostly make adult oriented entertainment. And we get a lot of adult oriented entertainment on Disney+ in international territories. It's just the US where they have a sanitised version of Disney+."
Japan with Sue Perkins,"To be fair, international distribution of Anime is overwhelmingly controlled by Sony. There are many companies I would prefer over Disney but having more players get into the industry is not a bad thing in this case imo."
Japan with Sue Perkins,Kodansha is a book publisher. To my knowledge they don‚Äôt have an actual animation studio but they do co-produce anime adaptations of their manga.
Japan with Sue Perkins,Studio Wit and MAPPA did AOT. Kodansha is literally just a book publisher
Japan with Sue Perkins,[removed]
Japan with Sue Perkins,"The quality really depends on the studio doing the animation, some of it's actually pretty high quality."
Japan with Sue Perkins,I mean they release sin city....
Japan with Sue Perkins,Summertime Rendering still isn't available on Disney+ outside of Asia and Oceania.
Japan with Sue Perkins,In Australia we received it weekly on Disney Plus - not everything at once
Japan with Sue Perkins,But they‚Äôre doing great with Bleach and Tatami Time Machine.m
Japan with Sue Perkins,People hate having the entire season up at once ? Why?
Japan with Sue Perkins,Too late.
Japan with Sue Perkins,"I thought it was a John Lassiter thing. Once he got the boot, the Ghibli relationship fell apart."
Japan with Sue Perkins,hope you have still contact to that friend.
Japan with Sue Perkins,Oh! Thanks for the tip.
Japan with Sue Perkins,If you are into anime it's kinda odd you would get Disney+ for watching it. Crunchyroll is just way better and pretty much have all the currently airing stuff.
Japan with Sue Perkins,I can only budget for so many subscription services though. Crunchy Roll would be nice but it‚Äôs not in the budget.
Japan with Sue Perkins,Summertime rendering and black rock shooter releases are absolute shitshows. Bleach is a the exception not the rule.
Japan with Sue Perkins,"Wait, isn't that just distribution rights? Cause here i can watch bleach in Netflix"
Japan with Sue Perkins,"Not the same, because Bleach has a sublicense with Viz."
Japan with Sue Perkins,Disney just don‚Äôt release it. Don‚Äôt think there is an official release date for summertime rendering yet.
Japan with Sue Perkins,Bleach is still not available outside the US. Not even the old seasons.
Japan with Sue Perkins,Most of Hulu‚Äôs anime is sourced from funimation/Crunchyroll and Sentai still. Iirc they are doing bleach there now. But I wouldn‚Äôt say Hulu is anywhere near a Disney anime distribution arm.
Japan with Sue Perkins,"Thanks for the correction! Either way, I know it‚Äôs connected to something I enjoy so I‚Äôm excited to see new content from them!"
Japan with Sue Perkins,[removed]
Japan with Sue Perkins,So what show is high quality?
Japan with Sue Perkins,"wait... I watched the first 13 eps on another site this last weekend - so despite having an English dub already complete, they are still slowrolling USA release? What the actual F?"
Japan with Sue Perkins,"They do the same thing with the Kdramas that they nab. One has showed up on US Disney+ and some on Hulu, the rest got to use the vpn."
Japan with Sue Perkins,"Because Japan still had a weekly release.  Basically Japanese watchers could be up to episode 9, while fans overseas still wouldn't be able to watch a single episode until after episode 12 had come out."
Japan with Sue Perkins,"They explained why, it wasn't put up weekly and was only put up after the season ended which is unusual for anime and sucks."
Japan with Sue Perkins,"Because for the last decade till Netflix and Disney got involved the standard for anime was simulcasting, AKA subbed here and available for viewing same day as Japan (or within a few hours) and it led to a big anime boom and discussions and watch alongs especially for r/anime. Binge releases just don‚Äôt have the same fanfare around them

Look at Jojo‚Äôs bizarre adventure, that series got HUGE on r/anime and other subs thanks to Jojo Fridays and the monster discussion threads and since it was weekly releases it was easy to form the routine to follow it for a casual watcher

This most recent iteration Part 6, had been Netflix exclusive and dropped in the binge model format with episodes ever few months and the show is now basically dead in terms of online discussion

Another example Edens Zero is the new manga from the maker of Fairy Tail, it was getting some decent hype as an interesting potential watch and then it went to Netflix and now you can barely find western discussion of it outside its own subreddit. Seven Deadly sins similar situation that show was big in Japan, Netflix model release and it‚Äôs so so much less known in the west

The binge model does not work for anime, fans expect and want simulcasts"
Japan with Sue Perkins,"Irrelevant because the original anime show is released weekly (the vast majority of anime shows are still aired on TV and will therefore follow a weekly schedule as the studios keep producing future episodes). When an episode is already released in the original market, most anime fans will expect same-day availability in the local market.

I mean, why wouldn't they? Why would you want to artificially wait till the show finished before you can even watch it? If you have a binge mentality and like to consume everything in one go, you can still do that by waiting. Given that the show is already aired in Japan, discussions and spoilers will be floating around, and it simply makes sense to immediately makes them available so you can watch it however it wants.

It's also how most anime are licensed in US for streaming."
Japan with Sue Perkins,"Because anime fans don't like the fact that stuff they want to watch and could theoretically watch as soon as it airs is locked behind both a pay and release wall.

So much anime/manga related stuff is already inaccessible if you don't speak Japanese or can't pay for the exhorbidant shipping prices, we don't need western companies just adding more inaccessibility on top of the pile."
Japan with Sue Perkins,A small vocal group really likes to do the week to week discussions and get mad when Netflix dumps shit in blocks for anime. Like it's a minority but it's a very vocal one.
Japan with Sue Perkins,Unfortunately we‚Äôve mostly lost touch after I moved away for college and work. We still try to meet up whenever I head back home though
Japan with Sue Perkins,I traded Netflix for CrunchyRoll.
Japan with Sue Perkins,Are you watching Bleach: Blood Wars or OG Bleach on Netflix?
Japan with Sue Perkins,"That's not true, Bleach is available here in Canada"
Japan with Sue Perkins,"It's worth noting that Funimation signed a big distribution deal with Hulu after they didn't renew their partnership with Crunchyroll. This deal is still being honored even after Sony bought CR and merged the two, but I'm curious how long it will last."
Japan with Sue Perkins,"Just about anything done by studios WIT, MAPPA, or Trigger.  Watching Vinland Saga right now, I'd say that's pretty high quality.  More recently Spy X Family has great production values, as does Chainsaw Man."
Japan with Sue Perkins,I‚Äôm just convinced most western Media companies have their heads stuck in the ground. Honestly I‚Äôm seeing anime become so much more popular than it was just couple years ago. Even common chains like Walmart and target I‚Äôm seeing have manga in stock tho it‚Äôs only basic as you can go. Most anime fans including myself would rather bootleg our anime than wait to binge after it‚Äôs been out for 2 seasons
Japan with Sue Perkins,"from what i understand, it‚Äôs licensing in the US that seems to be the issue. 
some shows or movies that aren‚Äôt available in the US, are available in most of Europe for some reason"
Japan with Sue Perkins,"I think that's a pretty standard distribution model for streaming media, to have an ""exclusive release"" in the original country and then wider. For example, Better Call Saul aired weekly in the US for AMC, but whole seasons would drop later on Netflix in other markets"
Japan with Sue Perkins,It sucks some forget they planned to watch it then just move onto the next season full of anime that are airing week by week.
Japan with Sue Perkins,Awww booo hooo
Japan with Sue Perkins,Seven deadly sins isn't really a good example. It had its fan base then they destroyed anything good about it in season 3. I've seen SpongeBob fights animated better then seven deadly sin fights
The Time We Were Not In Love,"Condal:

>‚ÄúI will say, as a reward to our wonderful audience for following us through all the time jumps and recasts, they are done. We tell the story in real time from here forward.‚Äù

>‚ÄúThe actors are playing these characters until the end. We‚Äôre not recasting anybody. We‚Äôre not making any huge jumps forward in time. We are now in the Dance of the Dragons, and we‚Äôre going to tell that story.‚Äù

S2 should be starting production in early 2023."
The Time We Were Not In Love,I sure hope the dragons are ok and don‚Äôt need to be recast
The Time We Were Not In Love,"For anyone unfamiliar with the books, the rest of the show should take place in about 2 years, compared to the 20+ years we saw in season 1.

Adapting this story would always have led to some awkward time scaling, since the entire prelude to the war was basically nothing more then a brief summary of events in the books. The writers already had to expand the plot significantly. There were entire episodes that were basically no more then a paragraph or two in the source material."
The Time We Were Not In Love,I'm happy with the cast we've ended up with.
The Time We Were Not In Love,"No more recasting, now it‚Äôs time to kill them all offü§£ Let the games begin!!üòé"
The Time We Were Not In Love,Last 3 episode took place within a week and they were the best imo. They felt like classic GoT but they also handled time jumps quite well.
The Time We Were Not In Love,Aegon‚Äôs time jump is the only one that bothered me. King Aegon looks nothing like jerking out the window Aegon and they don‚Äôt even look that far in age.
The Time We Were Not In Love,Well if you kill everyone then you don‚Äôt have to age them.
The Time We Were Not In Love,"Great the current cast had been great, especially Ewan Mitchell."
The Time We Were Not In Love,Joffrey is going have a beard by the time we have season 2 lol
The Time We Were Not In Love,"Did people actually have a problem with the time jumps? I didn‚Äôt really find it jarring, and it‚Äôs clear they needed them to properly set up characters and motivations since we have whole generations involved in these conflicts."
The Time We Were Not In Love,I‚Äôve enjoyed the time jumps. Better than spending an entire season on just the daily life of young Rhaenyra.
The Time We Were Not In Love,This was obvious. The war takes less than 3 years. The only meaningful time jump they could do is an epilogue at the very end
The Time We Were Not In Love,"Why can‚Äôt they just use real dragons instead of cgi. I know there‚Äôs a safety issue, fire codes."
The Time We Were Not In Love,"Can we get less C-sections in season 2? 

I have met my quota for ""watching women in labour scenes"" for the next 10 years."
The Time We Were Not In Love,it's because John Locke finished turning the donkey wheel
The Time We Were Not In Love,"It would have been fine, if they had just aged the people that stayed in the same role. I think the only one they tried to even attempt to age was Viserys."
The Time We Were Not In Love,"My main problem was and still is, Crispy Cole. This man was the same age when laenor and laena were babies and now THEIR babies are teenagers and he still looks the same. They did NOTHING in aging CC. Actually annoying. 

That, and also the fact that they're not developing most characters really well. The timeskips doesn't help, but it's not the only issue. most people haven't built emotional attachments to most characters. CC being Kingmaker was also modified, which is like, the biggest part of him."
The Time We Were Not In Love,"Good, cuz this cast is pure fire."
The Time We Were Not In Love,I still don‚Äôt remember most of the characters names
The Time We Were Not In Love,"I‚Äôm wondering if flashbacks may have been better than time jumps. I‚Äôm a book reader, so it was fine for me. But all my friends and family were confused as hell."
The Time We Were Not In Love,Watch as they secretly recast one of the dragons with a new animal actor.
The Time We Were Not In Love,"Yes, the rest of the show should essentially be GOT paced from here on out. 

But I feel like they did not set up the children ages too well. Some of these youngins have big roles. Aegon the younger (Rhaenyra's first born to Daemon) is like 2 years old in the show right now, but is 10 or 11 by the end of the Dance (2-3 years from this point in the show).

I don't know why they chose to show such young children in episode 8. They have been married for 6 years. If they showed a 5 year old it would have definitely been a better age."
The Time We Were Not In Love,what about the babies that played Daemon's sons? Liars!!!
The Time We Were Not In Love,A time jump wouldn‚Äôt make sense cause doesn‚Äôt the war last approximately two years?
The Time We Were Not In Love,"Taking bets on how many childbirth scenes we get in season 2.  

Im guessing like most shows things will ramp up so like, 2 or 3 childbirths per episode in season 2."
The Time We Were Not In Love,"I understand the time jumps, and why they‚Äôre necessary, but it did make it a little difficult to get into. But with season one‚Äôs ending, I‚Äôm pretty pumped to really dig into the war now."
The Time We Were Not In Love,Would it kill them to put some cg that says ‚Äú5 years later‚Äù or some shit so I don‚Äôt have to start realizing I need to start figuring who people are supposed to be again
The Time We Were Not In Love,"The time jumps were jarring. Could have been better handled.

Doesn't make the show not great. 

I have a bigger issue with all of the childbirth/miscarriage scenes but that's just a ME thing."
The Time We Were Not In Love,"They should have fleshed out each ‚Äútime jump‚Äù into 8 episodes instead of 3 and leveraged the actors for longer periods. I have no emotional attachment to anyone. I enjoyed the first 3 episodes most and felt each section got weaker and weaker every time jump. 

I was so impressed with this show and ended up not caring if / when next season is."
The Time We Were Not In Love,"So the show won't be about just the family get togethers the Targaryens have every few years for a funeral or wedding or succession challenge, and inevitably some horrifying violence breaks out?"
The Time We Were Not In Love,Considering it was a two year long war that makes sense
The Time We Were Not In Love,"Maybe the course of the show was already a known thing and I missed it, but I had hoped they‚Äôd keep doing time jumps and end the series with Robert‚Äôs rebellion."
The Time We Were Not In Love,If you've read the books you'll know why
The Time We Were Not In Love,Just means they're gonna start killing everybody and having to add new cast lmaooo.
The Time We Were Not In Love,What about the Rhaenyras babies? \s
The Time We Were Not In Love,"Those time jumps without any corollary notice of how much time has changed were crazy. I‚Äôm sure it turned a lot of people off the show as well. It may seem dumb, but a simply ‚Äú5 years later‚Äù goes a long way."
The Time We Were Not In Love,Thought Rhaenyra younger kids needed to grow up a bit
The Time We Were Not In Love,Can we work on not making the show so dark??
The Time We Were Not In Love,"After the final shot, you GD right you‚Äôre not."
The Time We Were Not In Love,They could‚Äôve slowed their roll with all the birthing scenes they used instead of sex scenes like in GoT
The Time We Were Not In Love,Aemond has serious Bond villain vibes
The Time We Were Not In Love,"I hope they still do ""time jumps"" even if they don't recast anyone.

One of the many issues with GOT was that they would have multiple story lines going on at the same time, and it resulted in people being able to teleport thousands of miles in one day."
The Time We Were Not In Love,Lies they will have to recast aegon the younger and his brother in the later seasons
The Time We Were Not In Love,"I'm glad to hear this, I felt the time jumps often made the first season feel like a sequence of expositional montages with someone monologing over top of it."
The Time We Were Not In Love,Can they time jump one last time and jump to GoT S08
The Time We Were Not In Love,"Hopefully HBO/Discovery‚Äôs budget and operational issues don‚Äôt impact this show. 

It would be annoying if a show about dragons suddenly has nearly no dragons because HBO can‚Äôt afford it."
The Time We Were Not In Love,"The time jumps were the worst for me. Made it so hard to follow. 

But its not just the major time jumps, its the little micro time  jumps within each episode. 

In this last episode we saw a scene dedicated to her miscarrying, and less than 10 minutes  later (because of a micro time jump) she  completely healed and moved on...as if the kid never existed. -- Like a fetus  was  just a  complete plot  device..."
The Time We Were Not In Love,Can I just request that they stop making the show so fucking dark. Crank the brightness setting up when you‚Äôre editing for fucks sake.
The Time We Were Not In Love,I‚Äôm not gonna lie the time jumps had me so messed up I didn‚Äôt know what was going on
The Time We Were Not In Love,We need a trans dragon
The Time We Were Not In Love,They should try making the plot interesting
The Time We Were Not In Love,Original cast was better.
The Time We Were Not In Love,"Aegon the Younger and Viserys will both need to be recast. 

If they make it to season 3(2026) they will both be around 6-8. When then dance last barely two years."
The Time We Were Not In Love,Damn Aegon the Younger gonna be played by that same baby the rest of the way. Hopefully that kid grows into being a good actor by 2028.
The Time We Were Not In Love,"This makes it sound like there were a bunch of time jumps, but there was only the one major one, right? Major in that it was the only one that replaced actors. I haven't watched the last episode or two, but this makes it sound like there were several big time jumps."
The Time We Were Not In Love,Can they recast the Velaryon wigs? Those things are awful.
The Time We Were Not In Love,"What a finale it was. I'm so exited for the next season(s).

Show this to Amazon so they see how an incredibly good show is like"
The Time We Were Not In Love,Trash
The Time We Were Not In Love,"Good, I know it was necessary for the story but it was probably the worst part of the show"
The Time We Were Not In Love,Had no idea what happed all season. Very strange
The Time We Were Not In Love,Thanks God. The time jumps were very annoying this season.
The Time We Were Not In Love,"They really did not think the time jump through enough. There were no indicators within the show that I can remember. And it was super confusing, could have been done much better."
The Time We Were Not In Love,can we time jump to season 2 IRL. I loved the first season but left me with such a feeling of emptiness. there was so much setup and no payoff. I‚Äôm kind of turned off from evening wanting to watch season 2. :(
The Time We Were Not In Love,Started off strong but the character switches were all bad imo with the exception of Alicent who may be the exact same person I don't know
The Time We Were Not In Love,"HBO and GOT franchise doesn‚Äôt get to tell me ‚ÄúI promise it will be better next season‚Äù anymore.  It‚Äôs their whole grift.  Hinting at shit that‚Äôs going to come and how awesome it will be when it happens.  Explaining why every episode or every season doesn‚Äôt really have to be good. Then they gave us a one episode ‚Äúlong night‚Äù and Cersei is killed by bricks.  

I‚Äôll tell you one thing; ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want it.‚Äù"
The Time We Were Not In Love,What about Aegon the younger?
The Time We Were Not In Love,"Was the season written by 3rd graders? Could the whole arc between the two princes been telegraphed any more obviously?!?! 

Such an elementary demonstration of ‚Äúon the nose‚Äù storytelling. Just plain boring, predictable and lazy."
The Time We Were Not In Love,"SPOILER FOR S1E10

>!I thought they'd have to recast Lucerys at some point since his actor is so young, but Vhagar solved that problem.!<"
The Time We Were Not In Love,"I checked out after the fifth or sixth episode when we kept getting a new weekly bunch of brats, each more unlikeable and untalented in the acting department than the one before. What a bizarre creative decision. Just goes to show some things just don't translate well to the screen, or at least they should have been adapted to the medium better."
The Time We Were Not In Love,They say that‚Ä¶ but someone will probably get recast due to scheduling issues. It happened alot on GoT.
The Time We Were Not In Love,A shame because some the actors they have settled on are downright hard to watch
The Time We Were Not In Love,But how about going back to the first cast
The Time We Were Not In Love,"Milly Alcock is my Rhaenyra...I have given up after that character shift..she doesn't have the same internal fire, a bit miscast.

Edit: I don't read/care about the books"
The Time We Were Not In Love,Recast rhaenyra. Millie was much better
The Time We Were Not In Love,[deleted]
The Time We Were Not In Love,üóëÔ∏è show
The Time We Were Not In Love,Good. Fuck the time jumps.
The Time We Were Not In Love,Time jumps ... 1 of the many reasons I stopped watching this show. I had high hopes.... should have expected this after how GoT ended.
The Time We Were Not In Love,Damage already done. So many people stopped watching
The Time We Were Not In Love,I'm not watching it then. I thought Helen Mirren will be rhaenyra in season 2.
The Time We Were Not In Love,"To late, when you switched actors I switched you off.  Horrible change, idiots."
The Time We Were Not In Love,Not even Mysaria? :(
The Time We Were Not In Love,Soooooo should I give this series a chance?
The Time We Were Not In Love,Horrible fantasy soap opera. The show is a dud
The Time We Were Not In Love,"Hahaha, too fucking late. Pretty much everyone I talked to bailed on it. Idiots."
The Time We Were Not In Love,The time jumps were literally what made me interested in this. I thought we were going to continue to move through generations. It solved the GoT issue of people teleporting around the continent.
The Time We Were Not In Love,I dont know what the hell is going on because the cast keeps changing. Also I dont know what the hell is going on because I cant see anything because the show is too dark.
The Time We Were Not In Love,I knew that young dark haired kid was going to die. They didn‚Äôt think it was worth re casting him for a couple episodes.
The Time We Were Not In Love,I stopped watching after few episodes ‚Ä¶.time jumps such a bs and it was getting so booooring
The Time We Were Not In Love,"Was dumb, the young girl was a great version. Cast her through the whole story. Slow it down,"
The Time We Were Not In Love,"It‚Äôs too late now, they already fucked up the casting"
The Time We Were Not In Love,"I read this book when it came out and have forgotten most of it but isn't this cast of characters just the beginning?  IIRC it moves through several generations of Targaryens, how will they manage this without time jumps?"
The Time We Were Not In Love,sad but understandable
The Time We Were Not In Love,[deleted]
The Time We Were Not In Love,"Oh no, they're going to be forced to actually have consequence and follow through rather than just jump ahead ten years and have the audience make up the rest. 

This is the death knell of the show."
The Time We Were Not In Love,*Atlas Shrugged enters the chat*
The Time We Were Not In Love,"""Duh"" days anyone that read any of the backstory. The Civil War happens over like 5 years"
The Time We Were Not In Love,Hopefully they will film all the seasons quickly before anything changes
The Time We Were Not In Love,If only they would have started with a flash forward
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"""Outrave"" is available on demand here:[https://watch.revry.tv/search/outrave](https://watch.revry.tv/search/outrave)"
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,This seems highly irresponsible but okay
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,NOT a flex.
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"It's funny because Jenna is trying to tell this story to make the production seem awesome or her acting dedication and talent to be top notch, but instead it's coming across as a pretty massive failure by all those involved."
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,">‚ÄúThey were giving me medicine between takes because we were waiting on the positive result.‚Äù

>MGM, the production company behind ‚ÄúWednesday,‚Äù stressed to NME that ‚Äústrict COVID protocols were followed and once the positive test was confirmed the production removed Jenna from set.‚Äù

""Strict"" as in strictly the bare minimum I guess. Totally irresponsible."
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"They clearly knew Jenna Ortega very likely had COVID and were trying to cram in as much filming as they could get away with before her results came back positive and they would have to shut down filming temporarily.

They exposed all of the actors and crew on set, all of their families, and anyone else in the community they came into contact with. And it's one of the worst scenes to film someone who likely has covid as she is surrounded by a crowd of extras, dancing, exerting herself, probably breathing heavier than normal."
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"Cool scene and all, but because of the song, all I can ever think of when I see it is SpongeBob taking Pearl to the prom and everyone doing ‚ÄúThe Sponge‚Äù"
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"You can tell, she looked pretty pale"
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,So they risked the rest of the staff and their families instead of just letting her have sick days?
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"Having been the covid compliance officer on major film sets, this was 100% against the rules."
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,Aaaahhh so we're back to forcing people to work while sick. Lmao. NatUre is HeAlinG
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"I try to not to completely hold people accountable when I don't know the full story. But even if Jenna was stressing that she didn't wanna delay shooting, somebody should have still made that call for everyone else in that shot.

Terribly irresponsible."
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,Companies will do anything but provide sick days.
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"There seems to be a constant escalating string of stories with this narrative about this dance scene and how amazing Jenna Ortega is.

""Did you hear she choreographed it herself?""

""Did you hear she learned it in two days?""

""Did you hear she didn't need tips from Christina Ricci?""

""Did you hear she was super I'll with COVID?""

""Did you hear she flew to Ukraine to fight the Russians between takes?"""
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"Friend worked an indie in Mississippi last year where a producer knowingly held production meetings after testing positive. 30+ people got Covid, the main talent was hospitalized, and the whole production was shut down for a while.

Personally, I'd have sued that piece of shit for every penny he had, but everyone was young and hungry (hence working an indie in a shitty location) so it slid by.

Meanwhile, the show I was working in LA was the gold standard of safety, making all crew test and wait 1 hr for results before coming to stage. Every single day. They spent a fortune on testing but we shot an entire season with almost no issues."
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,Enough about this fucking dance scene already
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,They couldn't wait like 5 days?...
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"As someone who has signed dozens of death certificates for patients of mine who have died with this disease‚Ä¶





What. The. Fuck."
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,Tom Cruise about to lose it on her
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"> MGM, the production company behind ‚ÄúWednesday,‚Äù stressed to NME that ‚Äústrict COVID protocols were followed and once the positive test was confirmed the production removed Jenna from set.‚Äù

Yeah screw that production team. Your lead clearly had covid (she mentioned scratchy throat and body aches) and you exposed all the other actors and crew rather than postponing shooting a few hours to wait for the results. If anyone on that set got covid they should sue"
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"the amount of posts i've seen about this dance scene, i was expecting some huge dance number with insane choreographing and stunts or whatever else craziness

i was pretty surprised it was just a girl dancing a little bit. and people saying it's the best part of the show lol"
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,This is fucked and completely on par with the experience of so many crew members.
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,That is not fucking cool and the actor's union needs to step the fuck up.
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"In case anyone was wondering, this is a good representation of the COVID protocols on movie sets. If she were a crew member she would have been shooed away immediately, but since she‚Äôs most likely #1 on that show they fudge the rules so they can film a little. Seen it happen a few times now."
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"‚ÄúMGM, the production company behind ‚ÄúWednesday,‚Äù stressed to NME that ‚Äústrict COVID protocols were followed and once the positive test was confirmed the production removed Jenna from set.‚Äù‚Äù

While she CLEARLY had Covid. Guess everybody else on set can just piss off, there‚Äôs no way to be responsible with a highly symptomatic individual BEFORE the test results come back!!!!! Right???

Edit: Also, even if the test was negative, if she‚Äôs clearly sick with SOMETHING shooting should be shut down until she‚Äôs better. I hate that the old idea that it‚Äôs okay to go out and expose people to sickness as long as it‚Äôs not Covid might be creeping back."
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,I can‚Äôt remember seeing so many stories about a single scene in a long time. Clever marketing by Netflix!
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"Jenna Ortega filmed the already famous Wednesday Dance Scene in sub-zero temperatures, in the midst of a 2 month long fast while battling a potent mix of the flu and shit from both ends food poisoning. In the midst of these arduous conditions, and on set, as the rhythm boomed and her body moved, Jenna found herself entering a state of meditative bliss, tapping into the primal energies of our realm. Her very being ascended into planes of understanding glimpsed only by the Buddha himself, the dance scene of Wednesday Addams akin to a modern Bodhi Tree of Siddhartha, a vessel for powerful soul energies and the ultimate source of enlightenment, Jenna Ortega herself reaching this ultimate enlightenment as her earthly body sways to the sounds of the Goo Goo Muck, her movements and gaze physical attributes of a higher being, and as the dance ends, and running a high fever, struggling not to shit herself and desperate for sustenance, Jenna Ortega‚Äôs Wednesday Addams dance becomes a rallying point for humanity‚Äôs spiritual actualisation.

Wednesday Addams is renewed for season 2."
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"Well that‚Äôs fucking disgusting of them. She should‚Äôve been resting and not exposing other people. Fuck you, Netflix."
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"This isn‚Äôt the flex she thinks it is, also I‚Äôm so over this dance scene already"
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"I'm getting tired of hearing about Jenna Ortega in Wednesday. My family watched it and we loved it, but god damn give it a rest already. I've especially heard about the ""dance scene"" like it's the fucking Red Wedding."
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,Total bs.
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,She‚Äôs so brave I could shit my pants
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,Goo Goo Muck was a perfect choice of song.
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"Even beyond how reckless and irresponsible this was to do‚Ä¶ why the fuck would you tell people this??? Like, how would the producers not make you keep a lid on that but of info

 COVID protocol on film and TV sets have been a rigorous, as annoying as it can be, process. But it‚Äôs always been clear it has been established to protect actors and above-the-line crew (producers mostly), with little to no regard for crew. In fact, it‚Äôs mostly been my experience that it‚Äôs treated as ‚Äúcrew members can get actors sick, but not the other way around‚Äù situation. 

It was stupid to do this, and just as stupid to tell the press about it."
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,Well‚Ä¶ that is a gross and scary thing to happen. Especially when the final product was Netflix‚Äôs Wednesday.
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"This is an awful, horrible thing to do to everyone in the room. Wtf, is this supposed to be a puff piece bc all it does is make it seem like an unsafe work environment"
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,What a bunch of morons.
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,Weird flex.
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,Tired of seeing articles about this scene. Like wtf
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"I‚Äôm sick of tabloids (paid by Netflix probably) trying to convince me this ‚Äùdance‚Äù was somehow a must see event.

I like the show well enough so far (although it‚Äôs turning a bit too CW- Young-Adult-love-triangle kind of show for me, and some of the casting is‚Ä¶ terrible) but it is pretty obvious they are trying way too hard to convince people to watch it."
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"Jenna Ortega Filmed ‚ÄòWednesday‚Äô Dance Scene while high on a cocktail of drugs.

There's the headline you were trying to say but didn't."
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,We never really know if it is really being watched that much or if they market it enough eventually it‚Äôll be true‚Ä¶.
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"Everyone here acting like dropping your masks at a restaurant table as soon as you sit down (during mask up phase) wasn‚Äôt some massive pretend game of:

‚ÄúOh the virus exists until we have to eat in close proximity and breathing in each others faces‚Äù

Edit: I delivered food for a year in a huge city similar in size to Chicago, and I saw with my eyes how there were these points of double standard that we all pretended didn‚Äôt exist.

Yeah the film crew and producers should have followed stricter guidelines and not put anyone at risk.

I‚Äôm mostly complaining at the commenters pretending like they didn‚Äôt go to a sit down restaurant during the height of the mask phase."
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"That's not a badge of honor!!!

If you're sick stay home!"
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,And I hate how people praised this like: ‚Äú She choreographed this dance herself and executed so beautiful even though she had covid. Queen üòç‚Äù. Like props for choreographing the dance I guess but no one should be praised for risky behavior.
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,Just another reason to not watch this.
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"Weird, as based on the Return To Work agreement the various unions and guilds, including SAG, signed, she shouldn‚Äôt have been on set after testing positive."
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"Why do all modern movies, commercials and music videos have dancing shoehorned into them?"
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,Then some grip got COVID and wasn‚Äôt allowed to come in to work for a couple weeks. And maybe an extra or two died
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"Why do they keep mentioning this? If you're gonna put lives at risk to avoid a delay in shooting, I would think you'd wanna be a bit more hush hush about it. 

The dance scene was excellent but this story is gross. And someday down the line, I expect Jenna Ortega will realize that the people in charge did not do right by her, caring more about the work than her well-being"
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"I‚Äôd be fuckin pissed if I was someone on staff working behind the scenes, probably too many hours. Just so I can get sick for this one week relevant show."
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"This brilliant actress was fucking pissssssed that they did this and knows this is a hit and she's irreplaceable and just exposed them.

People will get fired."
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"I am so over hearing about this dance scene. 

She dances incredibly awkwardly and the scene is cringy beyond belief."
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"Lol! Pretty sure you're supposed to isolate after taking a test, in case it comes up positive. Nice work, Hollywood. My employers would be put out of business if they did this to their employees."
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"This is definitely the studios fault not hers. I work in nursing and had to cause a scene because they said ‚ÄúOh well you‚Äôre not coughing so you can work.‚Äù I get that people think she should‚Äôve said no anyway, but she‚Äôs so new in the scene + being a female that the pressure was too hard to not give in. Plus, there‚Äôs hundreds if not thousands of dollars on the line and countless of other peoples jobs that would get affected. She didn‚Äôt make the right choice, but I can see why she would make that choice. My coworkers came in positive. Only reason I got away with it was because I‚Äôm a dude and told my supervisor ‚ÄúOk I‚Äôll come in but when my coworkers and the patients I take care of start getting sick this will be YOUR fault, not mine and I‚Äôll be telling everyone I come in contact with that I‚Äôm positive and was forced to work.‚Äù 3 minutes later her boss said ‚ÄúYeah stay home.‚Äù"
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"The more I hear about this, the more I'm not ok with it, and I hope every union involved rains hell upon the decision makers for this. Jenna Ortega should never have been on set that day. If that means they have to shut down until she got negative, then that's what they should have done. By having her work that day, they fucked with the health of everyone who was on the set that day. I suspect the only reason that we're not hearing about a mass outbreak on the set is that she and everyone else was vaccinated as that does make you less likely to be contagious. At the end of the day, this is a safety issue, and the producers do not value the safety of their cast and crew."
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,Is this supposed to make me respect the dedication or something?  Because that just seems negligent of crew safety.
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"All I ever see is Jenna Ortega these days. Out with the old, in with the new I guess. Somewhere, Millie Bobby Brown is fuming."
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"Didn't take long for everyone to get back into the ""continue to work even while you are sick"" bs shenanigans again. Disgrace."
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,wow that‚Äôs amazingly irresponsible and the production company should be sued for putting the crew in danger
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,Disgusting and everybody involved with that decision should be embarrassed.
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,Lowkey getting annoyed at seeing this show everywhere on social media.
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"This actress is hacking my social media, all I read is a Jenna Ortega story on every platform"
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,But ‚Ä¶is it as good as andor?
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,So what?
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"Netflix must have paid a LOT of PR firms to push this show.

I don‚Äôt hear about it anywhere except on Reddit and affiliated media with Netflix"
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,">MGM, the production company behind ‚ÄúWednesday,‚Äù

Weren't MGM the studio behind The Wizard of Oz where they forced an underage Judy Garland to take cocaine and smoke? Somethings never change I guess."
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"So long as all the well paid industry jackoffs got sufficiently overcompensated for recycling an idea for the 50 millionth time, all is well."
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"Wow so brave. Seriously, who cares?"
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"This is a pretty grievous violation of the Hollywood Return To Work Agreement‚Äôs COVID rules, and I have a sneaking suspicion we‚Äôll be hearing about a seven or eight figure lawsuit from the unions over this."
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,The press the studio hoped for lol
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,Why would she tell people this? This is a bad look.
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,Why would she admit this
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"Another ""look how hard actors work"" article."
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,Oh my God who the hell cares??
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,Why is everyone so obsessed with her jfc
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,What a hero
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"""*The show must go on*"" is being taken too seriously here."
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,Wait what‚Ä¶that‚Äôs not good
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"This time last year this news would have caused a series of lawsuits. She had all the symptoms of covid but they still allowed her access to the set, allowed people to be in close contact and provide her with medicine between takes, bet $50 it was PAs they sent near her. Then a positive test comes back just in time as they already filmed the scene and now all the cast and crew have been exposed to covid. This just goes to show that the actors can do whatever and the crew has to conform to the protocols. I‚Äôm actually shocked she even revealed this information at all."
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"I thought Wednesday's personality was cringe AF at first but it grew on me. Tbh she kind of seems aspergers in a way. Her disregard for social norms is something people with aspergers do a lot of (either intentionally or they're unaware.) If I were to try diagnose her with something it wouldn't be anti-social personality disorder despite the edgy stuff she says because she does have relationships.

A lot of the stuff she says is consistent with how a schizoid would --be-- but it's not consistent with how she --is-- deep-down. E.g. she pretends like she doesn't care about anyone else when she's still effected by her fight with her room mate. I think she probably does have schizoid tendencies that lower her need for other people. But it's still not completely absent. By the way: schizoid personality disorder is very rare and vanishingly rare in females. I think this is possibly one reason Wednesday is so compelling. It's fictional: but there are people out there with similar personality traits."
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"How far the film industry has come since the beginning sheesh. But it was always a 2 class system with COVID on set. Cast never had to wear masks, crew always did. Now seeing this, holy shit, any general crew member at this point would get 10 days of no pay. And they filmed with her, with no mask, endangering hundreds of crew members."
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,I love how we went from entire studios shutting down for 2 weeks when someone is exposed to absolutely giving no fucks.
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"I'm not a conspiracy theorist. I promise, but a part of me wonders if this is a *genius* marketing strategy.

I don't even care if you find proof that she literally came down with Covid on this exact day of shooting. I'm not a conspiracy theorist, buuuut it would be genius marketing."
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"Most people have gotten the vaccines gotten the booster, and realized that covid is here to stay, and dont care about it anymore."
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,Weird flex but okay
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,Is it okay to not care?
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"I have only seen the dance, it‚Äôs crazy how much of the addams family vibe I get from it. I haven‚Äôt seen anything else related to Wednesday. Just waiting for the right vibe time to watch it, like I‚Äôm not watching it in December maybe in like spring lol"
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,RIP to all those grandmas
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"I had a sudden thought that astroturfing people with articles about the particular dance scene gets people that aren't subscribed to netflix to go look it up on youtube. So I did. 

First result, official Netflix account. 10 million views. I run an adblocker, but I'm going to assume it's monetized. How much money do they pull from that as an easy second revenue stream for only a couple interns posting stories on reddit?"
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"Every company is like this. I work at a HOSPITAL and I've literally told them ""my partner, who sleeps with me every night, had a direct exposure to covid"" and they told me if I don't have symptoms don't worry about it.

Luckily I'm not involved in patient care"
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,This is wildly irresponsible.
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"Filmmaker here, the reality is producers / Studios dont give a fuck about their crews and working conditions on set are at very least full of drama if not injury and malpractice.  The more ‚Äúhollywood‚Äù (big budget) the production the better things tend to be on set but Ive never worked on a film regardless of budget that didnt have at least a few dozen major safety concerns."
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,So she infected everyone around her? Doesn‚Äôt seem that responsible.
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"I think it's perhaps time to stop talking about this fucking scene, Andor threads at least focused on different parts while it's always the same one with Wednesday, as if it was the only thing worth talking about in the show"
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"She seems talented and the dance looks fun, but why is this story everywhere all the time?"
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,Poor young lady - it feels like Hollywood just abuses people until they leave
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,Tom Cruise was right.
Pinkfong & Hogi Dance Dance,"Such irresponsible bullshit.  
I was going to, but know I‚Äôm not gonna watch this  shit.  
Fuck people that mess around with COVID :("
The Fierce Wife,"The shows are being taken off HBO Max and moved to a FAST channel that WBD doesn't own.

* Raised By Wolves
* Westworld
* The Nevers
* Head of the Class
* The Time Traveler‚Äôs Wife
* FBoy Island
* Legendary
* Finding Magic Mike"
The Fierce Wife,Still bitter about Final Space.
The Fierce Wife,Sad to see the butchering happening right now to one of the greatest TV catalogs. What a shame.
The Fierce Wife,"You guys remember when HBO Max was an amazing streaming service? Remember that?

**It was 2021**. Those golden, halcyon days, faded to an amber beauty in the haze of my mind..."
The Fierce Wife,">‚ÄúAll those write offs‚Ä¶ we didn‚Äôt take one show off a platform that is going to help us in any way,‚Äù he added on a recent earnings call.

Except in, you know, maintaining positive relationships with talent and not alienating fans of these programs."
The Fierce Wife,I‚Äôll miss the intro song in Raised by Wolves but I guess that‚Äôs what YouTube is for
The Fierce Wife,"I was going to watch Raised by Wolves, so now I‚Äôm going to pirate Raised by Wolves. Thanks Dave, you‚Äôre doing a great job."
The Fierce Wife,The fact that this is happening fucking irks me. We cant do anything about it really and thats the frustrating part. Were at the whim of the burnt toast that is David fucking Zaslav.  Raised by Wolves deserves so much better.
The Fierce Wife,"Raised by Wolves was one of my favorite shows, first they cancelled it and now I won't even be able to rewatch the seasons they did make

Probably best not to even watch any new shows on HBO Max because chances are likely it'll be gone soon enough"
The Fierce Wife,[deleted]
The Fierce Wife,"This is the exact reason I still support physical media. Unfortunately, a lot of these shows aren‚Äôt available anywhere except streaming, which is an even bigger loss for the audience when they are removed and taken away. The name of the game now is content and cost, quality and artistry are becoming irrelevant."
The Fierce Wife,"RIP The Nevers, I really enjoyed you :("
The Fierce Wife,I‚Äôm starting to feel suckered into buying the HBO plan when it was 40% off a few weeks ago.
The Fierce Wife,"A real shame Raised by Wolves didn‚Äôt get to finish it‚Äôs story. It was weird, but in such a bold and beautiful way. 

Really would have loved to see it through to the end."
The Fierce Wife,The Warner Bros purge continues.
The Fierce Wife,"Okay, realistically, what are the chances Zaslav's fuckery can be undone?

Is there a board of directors somewhere with the power to tell him no? Or better yet, replace him entirely?"
The Fierce Wife,"To forever disappear, except for pirates who will still have access to them."
The Fierce Wife,Doesn't doing all this hurt them in the long run. I'm sure plenty of writers and directors won't work with HBO max now because there's a chance their show will be cancelled and made impossible to watch
The Fierce Wife,It is a real dickhead move to remove these original shows from the service. I didn't really like either show and this still pisses me off.
The Fierce Wife,Last month of HBOMAX for me. I‚Äôm out.
The Fierce Wife,I hope Minx finds a home somewhere else too. I really enjoyed the first season.
The Fierce Wife,The Time Travelers Wife only needed one more season to finish.  Me and my partner are really frustrated this one was canned.
The Fierce Wife,"First they cancel it, then remove my favorite show of the last 10 years. RIP Raised By Wolves."
The Fierce Wife,I‚Äôm just learning that Raised by Wolves was cancelled. I‚Äôm ready to REDACTED to bring it back.
The Fierce Wife,Okay I have been defending HBO until now. What the fuck?
The Fierce Wife,Piracy and data hoarding continue to be superior to feckless and unreliable streaming services.
The Fierce Wife,"I'm done. I canceled my HBO Max subscription, and won't be subscribing again until HBO is owned by someone that isnt a total shithead."
The Fierce Wife,And Hbo max is being removed from my tv.
The Fierce Wife,Raised by Wolves was so good tho they should have given it a better budget for season 2.
The Fierce Wife,"Wait what the fuck, raised by wolves was amazing why are they taking it away?"
The Fierce Wife,Fuck Zaslav for gutting HBO.
The Fierce Wife,"I loved The Time Travelers Wife. Ended up grabbing the book after the season ended, but hated the writing style. Need more seasons. üò≠"
The Fierce Wife,Canceling RBW was a terrible move.   I did not get Max for food and castle remodel shows
The Fierce Wife,Looks like piracy is back on the menu.
The Fierce Wife,Raised by wolves season 2 was really noice.  Sucks the cancelled it. I wanted to see what happened with that ancient black droid chick
The Fierce Wife,Fuck HBO for ending raised by wolves. Damn wont see spac3 Ragnar :((
The Fierce Wife,"Yeah, I bought a few shares of WBD because I thought ‚Äústreaming value is in the back catalog and WB has an extensive one‚Äù

Little did I realize this tool bag was just gonna sell it all to the highest bidder and then blow up the company.

A fool and my money, as they say."
The Fierce Wife,"So now people just can‚Äôt watch these shows? And the talent can‚Äôt make residuals for the work they did?

That‚Äôs‚Ä¶dirty."
The Fierce Wife,"... and put on ad-supported streaming channels, which means that I will not ever see them again. I have entered the stage - and age - where I really can't watch programs or movies with commercial interruptions at this point. And I know that means I will pay more and more through the nose to maintain this status quo.

It's like I tasted the forbidden fruit and can't go back. And even if the commercial interruptions are less than traditional TV on a Pluto, say, it's not enough now. Some of these shows are good, and I will have to accept that I am paying a different sort of price by not watching ad-supported versions."
The Fierce Wife,I‚Äôm out.  Not interested in FAST.  It‚Äôs worth paying a little for premium productions without ads.  It was a good ride HBO but I‚Äôm tired of the changes.
The Fierce Wife,"Really hope someone picks up raised by wolves .. or Ridley Scott makes a film to finish the story.

Unfortunately young actors grow up so may be dead or require some recast or reboot. Which sucks because all the actors were amazing"
The Fierce Wife,"Raised by Wolves having its budget cut and then being cancelled

And Westworld being cancelled. 

This fucking sucks man"
The Fierce Wife,"Yeah, piracy shouldn‚Äôt be prosecuted if tax dodging corporations pull this shit to avoid paying royalties"
The Fierce Wife,Still bitter about raised by wolves :(
The Fierce Wife,"Cancelled HBO max when raised by wolves was cancelled, such a shame this beautiful and interesting world was smuthered for tax write-off, i hope it will return some day"
The Fierce Wife,Raised by Wolves ... from the highest rated show to this ...
The Fierce Wife,Raised by wolves was incredible.  I‚Äôm so upset at the foolishness going on at hbo
The Fierce Wife,I'm going to go ahead and finish Raised By Wolves and cancel my sub. There's zero reason to stay subbed if they aren't going to keep shows. I'll just subscribe vor a month after whatever I want to watch is fully released for now on.
The Fierce Wife,Raised by wolves was rad
The Fierce Wife,Raised by wolves was a great show for sci fi fanc
The Fierce Wife,Piracy is always the solution
The Fierce Wife,"""Welcome to HBO Max! We've got The Wire, and literally just The Wire."""
The Fierce Wife,When HBO Min rebrand coming?
The Fierce Wife,David Zaslav is the biggest piece of shit in the industry.
The Fierce Wife,"This will be the second streaming service I cancel, after Peacock and the Olympics debacle."
The Fierce Wife,"So far it seems like they're picking the less popular shows to dump. Westworld is the exception, but it's not like it was popular enough to get renewed."
The Fierce Wife,can someone eli5 why HBO is removing original programming they made themselves from their platform?
The Fierce Wife,"They found me in the woods cause I was raised by wolves

You wanna mess with me, you are fools

And I'm serious about this craft

You wanna mess with me, you gotta get back"
The Fierce Wife,Why are they taking their own exclusive content off the service? These shows were the selling point for HBOMax and now what? Only White Lotus and when will that get taken off? I haven‚Äôt seen the last couple episodes yet ffs
The Fierce Wife,When?  I haven't watched Season 2 yet.
The Fierce Wife,Feel like I wasted so much time on Raised by Wolves. Hope it gets a new home and another season.
The Fierce Wife,"Take drugs and watch Raised by Wolves. Or not. Same thing. 

So mad it got canceled, this was my favorite fever dream show since Lost, and now I'll never know wtf anything meant."
The Fierce Wife,"Man, just thinking about Raised By Wolves depresses me. So much of that shows first season was so innovative and interesting. Loved the style reminded me a lot jodorowsky's dune. Loved the metropolis references. Then...it all went to shit just in time for it to get cancelled. Im so tired of getting suckered into investing time into these mystery box shows."
The Fierce Wife,Time to cancel my subscription
The Fierce Wife,"While we‚Äôre at it, can we remove space jam 2? Whoever thought that was a good idea should also be fired‚Ä¶"
The Fierce Wife,"Just ditched HBO Max.  All these steaming services are raising prices while content is thinning out, and ads are coming back. ‚úåÔ∏è"
The Fierce Wife,"Making everyone into sailors is how they plan to be profitable? Just ridiculous 

See you on the seas"
The Fierce Wife,Raised by wolves was awesome
The Fierce Wife,"So not only did they cancel raised by wolves, which was a fantastic show left unfinished, but it will also be erased from existence."
The Fierce Wife,And this is why people pirate movies
The Fierce Wife,Can't wait until ten years from now when someone picks up the broken and scattered pieces of the then defunct Max's HBO catalogue  and relaunches it as HBO.
The Fierce Wife,I was thinking of signing up for HBO soon specifically to binge Raised by wolves and west world. üòê
The Fierce Wife,Unless WB's financial situation is critical this is an incredibly bad move. They'll anger the fans even more and people won't trust to pay the sub expecting that HBO original shows will always be available.
The Fierce Wife,Raised by wolves was insane and I loved all of it
The Fierce Wife,"Well, I wanted to finish the show but I guess I can just unsubscribe from hbo and find it on iirc instead. Weird that they don‚Äôt want my money."
The Fierce Wife,All of this sure makes me feel stupid for signing up for an HBO Max subscription. HBO's brand and reputation are really taking a hit from all this.
The Fierce Wife,"Will there literally be anything left on HBO Max when they're done with all this? At this point, it feels like nothing's safe. It's going to be hilarious when the original Game of Thrones series gets removed while they're still making House of the Dragon."
The Fierce Wife,This high key trashy as fuck lmao. How the fuck can you not afford to have the shows YOU made in your own service. Wtf
The Fierce Wife,Please don't remove Station Eleven.
The Fierce Wife,I hope whoever cancelled minx chokes on a bag of dicks. Best show since Firefly to be cut short.
The Fierce Wife,Man hbo has really turned into shit
The Fierce Wife,I liked raised by wolves‚Ä¶kind of. Is there any other way to view that show other than on the app?
The Fierce Wife,Can anyone ELI5 why DiscoBros is removing shows and movies from their service?
The Fierce Wife,"This just sucks for everyone involved, including the audience. Fuck these guys."
The Fierce Wife,"Begun, it has, the great consolidation."
The Fierce Wife,This is why the Streaming Future is bleak.
The Fierce Wife,raised by wolves getting cancelled is one of my biggest tv disappointments in years. to me that show is really cool.
The Fierce Wife,wait... what? So where's it going? Nowhere? Why are they removing their original content?
The Fierce Wife,Serves me right for going against principle and forking over a cool hundred+ for an annual sub after being so impressed by Station Eleven. #NeverAgain
The Fierce Wife,"I was just about to get HBO Max and Apple Plus because my family has burned through the Netflix catalogue. 
But now that they're pulling all their shows?

That's gonna be a no from me, dawg."
The Fierce Wife,So I‚Äôm genuinely curious if the actors/crew members/ writers had royalties in their contracts hoe this would effect them? Wouldn‚Äôt a lot of the deals have to be renegotiated as a lot of these shows are being taken out of mainstream circulation?
The Fierce Wife,"Honestly, thank you for the reminder. I kept forgetting to cancel HBO Max."
The Fierce Wife,"One things for sure, they get rid of Sopranos and we cancel. That much I do know."
The Fierce Wife,"So why should anyone keep HBO Max in 2023? They‚Äôre cancelling good content like Westworld, removing a bunch of content that‚Äôs been on there for years, and selling the rest"
The Fierce Wife,"Oh, neat, a whole new generation of lost media being created right before our eyes. The 1930s studio execs who melted down many actors' and directors' entire silent-movie oeuvres for the silver content in the film stock would be proud."
The Fierce Wife,I love raised by wolfs and they take it away.. why do I pay for services If they keep canceling the shows I like‚Ä¶
The Fierce Wife,HBO Max will be nothing but reality tv by 2024
The Fierce Wife,üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏èüè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏èüè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è
The Fierce Wife,What‚Äôs wild is pirate websites keep things up forever while services you pay subscriptions for remove them when they stop turning a profit.  It seems completely counter-intuitive.
The Fierce Wife,If they want people to pay for these services they need to keep all the content available. People don't want to have to buy Blurays on top of paying for streaming.
Emergency Interrogation Room,**We can never go back to Arizona!**
Emergency Interrogation Room,Boosh!
Emergency Interrogation Room,Someone please encourage me to watch this series. I‚Äôve been wanting to watch it but I can‚Äôt go past the first episode. I want to watch something Archer-like and I‚Äôve read that Frisky Dingo is quite good.
Emergency Interrogation Room,Send a postcard to Strunk and White!
Emergency Interrogation Room,"Okay, once again the mall has become my Waterloo..."
Emergency Interrogation Room,China Town has something for **everyone!**
Emergency Interrogation Room,I sometimes wish we had got more than one season.  But it would have been hard to match the laughs of the first.
Emergency Interrogation Room,And/or kakow.
Emergency Interrogation Room,"The writing is definitely a little more Adult Swim, if you know what I mean, but still really clever and snappy like Archer.

Awesome-X is basically if Archer was dumber and also Iron Man. A couple characters from Frisky Dingo have actually shown up on Archer. Killer Mike is in it and he's great. It got a spin-off, The Xtacles, which got *two* whole episodes. And by whole I mean 11 minutes long. The Xtacles are almost all played by Lucky Yates, aka Krieger.

***Ant Farm Keyboards.*** ***Master Cylinder.*** ***Baddy Bug Lady. Goblin Army. The Dread Lobster.***

**BARNABY JONES!**

Honestly, now I'm going to go watch the whole show tonight.

Also check out Reed's other show Sealab 2021 if you haven't. It's even MORE Adult Swim-y, though."
Emergency Interrogation Room,"If you liked Archer, you'll like this, as it was the precursor to Archer."
Emergency Interrogation Room,"Yes, it feels like Archer, clearly an early prototype, but has the same snappy dialogue you can always count on Adam Reed to produce. Frisky Dingo is a super quick watch, too - like 3-4 hours to do the whole series."
Emergency Interrogation Room,"The first episode is a bit shaky, but the series is honestly one of my all time favorites"
Emergency Interrogation Room,"Whoa! Now this is what I wanted and yes! I‚Äôve been watching a couple Adult Swim-y series(Venture brothers, the shivering truth come to mind and also Seal lab 2021 too) I‚Äôm going to seriously pick this series up and I‚Äôll make sure to watch it, not have it as some background noise while I do stuff. Thanks for the input! It‚Äôs much appreciated!"
Emergency Interrogation Room,Two words: Rapier Ape.
Emergency Interrogation Room,"Don't sleep on Squidbillies.  The art style is grating at first, but then you realized it's perfect for the material."
Emergency Interrogation Room,"I have never really watched more than one episode, as I always forget to.

But ""The Booth At The End"" seems to be just the thing you are looking for. It's all in a diner, and people come in with a wish, and the guy in the booth at the end makes them do something to get what they want."
Emergency Interrogation Room,The Sunset Limited: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1510938/
Emergency Interrogation Room,"Rescue Me? Certainly not interrogation room tense, and I don't know if they would count quite as long, drawn-out, but it always seemed to me that, aside from the fire scenes, it was put together like a play. Like scene one in the firehouse, scene two at Tommy's house, scene three at a restaurant. No cutting back an forth, each scene plays to completion the whole situation of those people in that place."
Emergency Interrogation Room,"""Can you put on Fox News?""

The look of disappointment in Nathan's face, lol."
Emergency Interrogation Room,"My favorite media is something that can make me laugh and cry.  Somehow Nathan managed to pull it off. 

‚ÄúHere I go, diggin in again!‚Äù

‚ÄúGuesssss whoooooo‚Äù ‚ÄúIs this‚Ä¶ Bill?‚Äù That smile."
Emergency Interrogation Room,"I gotta be honest, I don't understand the praise Finding Francis gets.

The premise is interesting, but I think that it just ends up being over an hour mostly of Nathan and Bill kind of aimlessly dicking around in Little Rock until they stumble upon a lead to find Francis. There's some hilarious moments like your mentioned Mud 2 scene, but I thought that the whole thing was overlong"
Emergency Interrogation Room,The whole ending with her recognizing his voice after his disappointment with Frances not remembering his voice was so perfect that I don't think you could have written/staged a better conclusion if you tried.
Emergency Interrogation Room,You should drink your grandson's pee and watch it again.
Emergency Interrogation Room,"That's what made it great to me though. It was just Nathan hanging out with and getting to know a very lonely old man. The Francis thing was never going anywhere, it was safe to assume from the start she was probably married with children."
Emergency Interrogation Room,Me too. I found it to be probably my least favorite Nathan for You episode.
Emergency Interrogation Room,Would you rather fight a Winston-sized Peacemaker or a Peacemaker-sized Winston?
Emergency Interrogation Room,"Oh hey didnt realise this was happening(?). Thoughts on working with Gunn and the rest of the team?

If you could work any adaptation or particular project. what would it be?

Peacemaker and TSS are great awesome.The Peacesquad are all very well developed too."
Emergency Interrogation Room,Do you really wanna taste it?
Emergency Interrogation Room,How was filming the dance number intro? It looks like it was hilarious
Emergency Interrogation Room,"Thank you for doing this AMA! I have a couple of questions for sure!

1. What is your favorite episode of Peacemaker? If your favorite episode is already out, why is that one your favorite?

2. How did James pitch you the character of John Economos?

3. What have been the biggest inspirations to you during your career?

Thanks a ton!"
Emergency Interrogation Room,"Screw it, let's start a few minutes early."
Emergency Interrogation Room,"Does Gunn's directing and writing allow you moments to improvise some lines or shots? If yes, can you talk about one?"
Emergency Interrogation Room,"Favorite memories from New girl?
What do you think Outside Dave's been up to?"
Emergency Interrogation Room,"Have you considered trying to sell your own brand of beard dye? I would re-grow my beard and use it, and I can't believe I am alone in that."
Emergency Interrogation Room,"What's it like going from occasional recurring character (possibly just 1 off guest spot), to a secondary main cast character in Superstore? Did you just keep getting more lines written or was there some formal thing where they told you they were making you a bigger character in the show? Isaac and Marcus killed every scene they were in and you definitely became on of my favorites as Superstore went on."
Emergency Interrogation Room,"OK folks, I have to run to another interview. I had a blast and tried to get to as many questions as I could. Thanks for dropping by and catch a new episode of Peacemaker this Thursday. HBOMax.

FYI, this week's episode was directed by the great Jody Hill! 

PEACE(MAKER) OUT! 
S."
Emergency Interrogation Room,How did you end up in the recurring role on You're the Worst?
Emergency Interrogation Room,Who is your favorite character and why is it Eagly
Emergency Interrogation Room,"What was your day to day like when working on Peacemaker ? 

What kind of Complication did Covid Cause during shooting ? 

Also your character is so great ! Let's get you and Batmite a spin off !"
Emergency Interrogation Room,What aspects of Economos are closest to your real personality and what's your internal story for how he ended up working for Waller?
Emergency Interrogation Room,"I'm beginning to have white spots on my beard. Which products do you recommend, cause yours looks nice."
Emergency Interrogation Room,Is a season 2 in the works?
Emergency Interrogation Room,Did you ever find out if pee-pee was a write off?
Emergency Interrogation Room,"I Know TSSP was forever  ago, but do people still get you and Brian Posehein confused? Because I'm sorry, but I just can't separate you two in My brain."
Emergency Interrogation Room,"If you had to pick one pasta noodle to eat for the rest of your life, what would it be?

Also, I belly laughed at the whole identity mix up in episode 2 of Peacemaker, you were hilarious - I needed that, Thank you!"
Emergency Interrogation Room,I'm rating this post five meowmeowbeenz
Emergency Interrogation Room,Why do you dye your beard?
Emergency Interrogation Room,"Hey Steve, known of you since Channel 101 and TSSP. Nothing I can think of to ask, but hearing of what happened with Officer Jay is .. lame. I loved the TSSP show back when there wasn't any gay characters like that on tv (even if it was meant as sort of a joke how un gay they were, it still felt like representation)

Do you actually drink TAB?

Good luck with ~~Snowpiercer~~ Peacemaker"
Emergency Interrogation Room,"Nice job with Judomaster. Clean take-down.

What is it like on set? I'm loving the serious but silly tone of the show."
Emergency Interrogation Room,What's the best QOTSA song and why is it Song for the Dead?
Emergency Interrogation Room,"I heard your beard died.  Condolences.

Edit: typo"
Emergency Interrogation Room,"Hey Steve,loved your work in the peacemaker,TSS. 
What was your favourite scene to do in the peacemaker"
Emergency Interrogation Room,"Hey Steve, big fan. I've always been a fan of yours since the Sarah Silverman Program, that show meant a lot to me. As a slightly overweight gay guy big into Gaming, Horror, n Nerd shit, I kinda just want to say thank you for depicting a homosexual couple that I could actually identify with. It always bothered me when I was that age, when I kinda knew what I was but still confused. Actually seeing people like me with my interests who were also just gay and that wasn't their entire character trait, or a punchline, helped me figure stuff out, it genuinely meant a lot to me. 

With all the sappy stuff's over onto my question lol. I was just curious, and this is more about the suicide squad, since you were the onset actor for king shark I always wondered if all his dialogue was actually said by you on set. Did you really act the part or was it more of a stand in thing. Like were you actually doing the lines that James Gunn wrote, he directed you, and then Stallone just ADRed over it or  was there improv involved with the character while filming. Always been interested in the use of fully CGI characters, especially when you get an actual actor to do it on set."
Emergency Interrogation Room,What is the character John Economos‚Äôs favorite band?
Emergency Interrogation Room,How does James Gunn have such an amazing taste in music?
Emergency Interrogation Room,My wife recently lost her dad. I am trying to be as supportive as possible and looking for tips on how you would have liked someone to help you during your loss.
Emergency Interrogation Room,"Hey Steve, you‚Äôre hilarious in the show. What was the funniest interaction on set (that ain‚Äôt a spoiler)?"
Emergency Interrogation Room,"If you could only listen to one song for the rest of your life, what would it be? And Spin Doctors' ""Two Princes"" is already taken."
Emergency Interrogation Room,"Will we see Economos in any other DC Films or TV Shows aside from ‚ÄúThe Suicide Squad‚Äù and ‚ÄúPeacemaker‚Äù?
Sort of like how Emilia Harcourt is meant to be in the upcoming ‚ÄúBlack Adam‚Äù Film"
Emergency Interrogation Room,"Very brave stance on kidney stones. But seriously how was doing that crazy intro?

Peacemaker has been pretty great so far but seriously, who goes into someone‚Äôs house and eats their 4 year old olives?"
Emergency Interrogation Room,What was the process like for filming the whole dance sequence in the opening credits?
Emergency Interrogation Room,Would you star in a commercial for Touch of grey hair dye?
Emergency Interrogation Room,What was it like working with Freddie Stroma? So far he (Vigilante) is stealing the show for me.
Emergency Interrogation Room,"You used to do a recurring bit on your IG (which everyone should check out--Steve is an **amazing** photographer), camped out front of spot called Baba Ganoush. Do you still eat there? I'm guessing you had work in the neighborhood?

Anyways, this wasn't *really* a good question. I really enjoyed, in the end of the series, how earnest you got about supporting the plucky, independent restaurant. It tickled me pink.

When you get time, I hope you stop by Nerd Poker's table, again. So happy for you and your successes!"
Emergency Interrogation Room,"Woah Steve, Hold The Line: As a fan of the series Yacht Rock, and your sweet turn as Steve Porcaro, do you have any fond stories from the shoot?"
Emergency Interrogation Room,Do you dye your beard?
Emergency Interrogation Room,What‚Äôs your favorite emergency room in the greater LA area? I live in Calabasas area so any close to me that I could check out?
Emergency Interrogation Room,"Hi Steve, so which did you like more, acting as John Economos or being the motion stand-in for King Shark? What are your personal pros and cons for each of them?"
Emergency Interrogation Room,"I‚Äôm loving the music in Peacemaker, as I didn‚Äôt know a lot of glam metal. What sort of music did James Gunn play on set of SS and Peacemaker to set the mood?"
Emergency Interrogation Room,What's your favorite kind of pizza?
Emergency Interrogation Room,How long did it take to prepare and shoot the Peacemaker intro?
Emergency Interrogation Room,"Any lines from the 3 episodes or the new one that were improvised? 

Who improvised most on set ?"
Emergency Interrogation Room,"Hi Steve! I recently did a rewatch of New Girl, and your character made me laugh out loud every time you were on screen. Do you have any fun memories of working on that show?"
Emergency Interrogation Room,Should I text you whenever go number 1 or 2?
Emergency Interrogation Room,How many seasons do you think the show is gonna have? How many seasons do you think a show like Peacemaker should have? What was doing the Intro like?
Emergency Interrogation Room,Weasel spin-off when?
Emergency Interrogation Room,Actual question: When are you going to do a gallery show/book/whatever with your photography?  Don't be all falsely modest n' shit.  You've got a great eye.
Emergency Interrogation Room,How are your weekends holding up what with the whole Dracula thing? Any improvements?
Emergency Interrogation Room,Why do you dye your beard?
Emergency Interrogation Room,Hi Steve. What‚Äôs the coolest part of being on Peacemaker? Would you ever work with any of the cast again? Are you single?
Emergency Interrogation Room,"hey Agee, hope alls well. Do you think you'd be able to convince Dan to bring back Harmontown? We(I) need it, I dont think its coincidence the world went to shit as soon as it ended."
Emergency Interrogation Room,I know you enjoy photography and your work in that realm has been really great. Would you ever want to DP a project if the chance arose?
Emergency Interrogation Room,"When filming on set, how often do you improvise your lines? Do you just go with what comes naturally once the cameras starts rolling? I heard there‚Äôs not as many ‚Äòfucks‚Äô in the script as there are that come out of John Economos‚Äô mouth ü§£"
Emergency Interrogation Room,"How much does James refer to the source material? Are there any suicide squad runs you recommend (if you‚Äôre a comic book fan)?

How did the beard dye joke come into fruition? Was it because James asked you how you dye it"
Emergency Interrogation Room,Hi! I loved Superstore and was sorry it was canceled. Any funny stories?
Emergency Interrogation Room,"Loved that you and Brian both showed up in Reno 911 QAnon special, given the history of the show, how much of your lines were improvised? any lines that stick out to you in particular?"
Emergency Interrogation Room,"Hey Steve, didn't know you were big into photography, your work is great. Did you take any photos while working on Peacemaker?"
Emergency Interrogation Room,"Hi! You were in one of my favorite shows, Speechless! I know you were only in it very briefly but what was the set like?"
Emergency Interrogation Room,"Hey Steve, I'm your height. Where do you buy shirts? Even tall sizes end up making me look like Britney Spears after a single wash (bare midriff).

Also, have you tried stretchy belts? These things are great.

Will we ever see more advertisements for Baba Ganoush?"
Emergency Interrogation Room,"Hello, Are there any characters that you would like to see from the comics in a James Gunn DC product? besides Bat-mite!"
Emergency Interrogation Room,"Hi Steve! I love the show so far, especially your character. Was there anything challenging about the role you didn‚Äôt expect going in? And do you have a favorite episode of the season?"

Emergency Interrogation Room,"Hey man! I'm loving Peacemaker so far and I can't wait for more. I know you are a musician, What is your go to instrument?"
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"I remember the main problem at the time was the setting.  HBO wanted to chance the setting to US instead of Germany to make it more accessible and for their audience which doesn‚Äôt work story wise.   I think today this issue would be moot.  There have been a lot of internationally set dramas that have found a wide audience.

The other issue was Naoki Urasawa (the original author) wanted del Toro and HBO to write the whole series and go intro production before he would sign over rights to make sure it was made to his vision.   That just doesn‚Äôt fly in Hollywood.   Maybe if it became del toros passion project but nobody is putting up that much time and money without the rights."
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"Fucking A man, totally agree with all of this. The anime is incredible, as is the manga. I‚Äôd recommend it for anyone **especially those who don‚Äôt like anime** as it contains none of the usual tropes one associated with anime. It‚Äôs more comparable to a David Fincher film.

The story is just too good to never be adapted, so we‚Äôll get it someday. But yeah, Del Toro would‚Äôve been an ideal person to oversee an adaptation. He said they were shopping it to networks after the HBO deal fell through, but nothing ever came of it, so idk why no one would be interested in a Del Toro written and directed pilot. It hits the exact same demos of something like True Detective."
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"Here is the opening and ending of the anime, to those that are interested.

Opening - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msTB5r8nUHU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msTB5r8nUHU)

Ending - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ughzNttzA78"
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"Monster is one of the, if not *the*, greatest anime of all time. I highly recommend it. It draws you in with the suspense and tension and then you stay for how amazing and layered the characters are."
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"If you've never watched Monster, please, go watch one of the best pieces of media put out. Don't judge it because it's an anime. It's a long discussion about the nature of evil, the impact of genetics versus society on the formation of the individual, the rippling consequences of evil . . . I could go on. Johan Liebert is genuinely a frightening villain, and for a long time in the anime, I was truly debating whether he was the antichrist. An incredible show.

Edit: I just remembered the final scene and I'm haunted."
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"Now that i think about it, the manga/anime reminds me of Zodiac, Mindhunter and the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo from David Fincher.

It explores a lot of darkness within humanity and the ways in which we judge morality."
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,This knowledge that you‚Äôve given me that this adaptation was in the works but canned has depressed me. Excellent anime and manga in my top 5. Would‚Äôve made a killer series
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"I just don‚Äôt know that the animated Johan translates into live action, for numerous reasons. There are so many incredible characters that I think *would* work in a live setting, but I‚Äôm just not sure you could adapt the twins in a satisfying way."
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"To be honest, I would prefer if Japan itself made the adaption. It's not like they don't have the talent to do it; all they lack is money, but if they were to work with some big streaming service that would give them enough freedom and a decent budget, then it should be fine. 

HBO and Del Toro would certainly do a good job, but they would also adapt it to the western taste. I'd rather have someone like Kurosawa do it.

Anyway, it will probably never happen, but at least we have a great anime adaption."
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,Sounds dumb
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,Considering all the other live action adaptations Hollywood has done over the years a Monster  live action series seems like the one with greatest chance of doing well.
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,Wish someone could do a live action of any Naoki Urusawa's works.
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"I think now more than ever would be the perfect time to adapt it. Streaming services such as Netflix have proved that international productions work, and so if it were to be a German production (or perhaps Czech co-production) it would still likely find a pretty large audience. But I also wouldn't mind an English-language version so long as it's faithful to the setting (like Fincher's The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo). And whereas in the past you'd likely get a whitewashed version of Tenma's character, I'd think these days studios wouldn't forego an Asian lead."
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"IIRC it was an interview with Del Toro in the past couple years, but I think I remember him saying it‚Äôs still on his list of dream projects. With Pluto getting an anime adaptation (*fucking finally*) I could see him revisiting trying to push Monster given the author is in the limelight again. He‚Äôs at the point in his career where he‚Äôs in his right to approach a studio with an IP or concept with genuine enthusiasm from the studio.  

Also yeah today things could be done in the US given the current political climate, but I also think HBO would be more receptive to having the series in its original setting nowadays."
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"Who in their right mind would want it set in America? The setting, the story is German with literal nazi‚Äôs and eugenics."
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,">The other issue was Naoki Urasawa (the original author) wanted del Toro and HBO to write the whole series and go intro production before he would sign over rights to make sure it was made to his vision.

Good for him for having the balls to make that play. Hollywood has a horrible track record for live action anime adaptations, worse than video game adaptations. More mangakas should be way more protective about their IP when Hollywood comes knocking."
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"Yeah, i guess the behind the scenes of this production would be a little more tricker than i expected.

The US setting would be a big No No.

I could see the german couple that did Netflix's Dark making a good adaptation.

Dark had a lot of 1980s Germany scenes in it and there was a lot of good character drama and exploration of the human psyche, alongside some philosophies of what it means to live and die."
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"Honestly, that is also how i tried to convince some of my friends to watch it.

The **anime for those that don't like anime** and that is comparable to a David Fincher film/series, as pretentious as that may possibly sound.

HBO would have been the best network for it, beyond a doubt.

They could probably make 3 seasons of this, 10 episodes each.

The week to week releases as the mystery gets darker and darker would be great to witness in a live-action format."
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"Unfortunately the tv spending spree is coming to an end. That said, Monster would be a much less expensive production than 98% of other anime adapted projects out there. There could be hope if there are people who really want to get it done."
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"
>I‚Äôd recommend it for anyone **especially those who don‚Äôt like anime** as it contains none of the usual tropes one associated with anime.

Haha,  that was me! I wasn't into sci-fi, ninjas, robots, or goofy comedy animes, but my friend showed me the 1st episode of Monster when it came out, and I was hooked. I'm a big Fincher fan too.

That was the gateway for me to get into Urasawa's other works (20th Century Boys, Billy Bat), plus other dark/psychological animes like Satoshi Kon's work (Perfect Blue,  Paranoia Agent)."
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"The character studies in this are incredible. There is this short story told by this old man when he used to be a sniper. He was assigned to kill this businessman. He observes the man from distance, ready to kill him. The man is putting sugar in his coffee and the sniper thinks he'll pull the trigger when the man finishes stirring his coffee and take a sip of it. But the man keeps on adding sugar in his coffee over and over again and the sniper simply can't shoot anymore and quits his job. There is this another story of his man who killed a guy in a park and from that day on birds won't come in the park anyone. Or that story of the old couple going to visit their son.  Even the one-off characters are so layered."
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,One of the captured serial killers reminded me a lot of Ed Kemper too.
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,">To be honest, I would prefer if Japan itself made the adaption.

I feel like Japan would be one of the worst countries to adapt this given the material. Like the entire cast is white besides Tenma and a few minor characters, and the story being set in Germany is a pretty integral aspect of the series (there‚Äôs a whole subplot in the show about neo-nazi‚Äôs that wouldn‚Äôt make sense if they were played by a bunch of Japanese guys)."
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,so do most drama shows when you try to think about them.
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"Good for him making an unreasonable demand? No show will ever get made like that. 

I could see saying that if he simply said ‚Äúno‚Äù to development partners he didn‚Äôt like or trust. But you can‚Äôt just ask people to spend millions of dollars making something before deciding to sign off or not. It‚Äôs unreasonable. At some point you have to have some faith in the people you are choosing to work with."
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,For sure.  I‚Äôm torn now - I‚Äôd have loved to see this a decade ago on HBO with.  But these days Netflix is more likely to pick this up - theyve had more success with international shows and the 3 season maximum is a draw for their model - But I feel like a lower budget Netflix version would make me sad when this should get the HBO Last of Us/Westworld/GoT production value.  But I guess these days Warner/Discover is having their own $$ issues‚Ä¶
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"I think 4 seasons would be ideal, just because there are natural season finale endpoints in volume 4 where >!Tenma is tied up in the loading dock by racists and the building is set on fire!< , and in volume 9 where >!Tenma sees Johan at the library and tries to kill him!< 

It would be so cool because although he‚Äôs the protagonist, Tenma goes in and out of the series a lot while you follow other characters. If they did 4 seasons, they‚Äôd likely have to do one season where the lead character is barely in it! 

It‚Äôs funny, because regarding THAT choice >!Tenma!< has to make at the end, I could see what he decided to do being extremely controversial nowadays and massively hated similarly to The Last of us 2 or The Last Jedi. But I thought it was great!"
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,Well said. Plus every single minor character has a role to play and some payoff. There isn‚Äôt a single episode of filler.
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"Yep. 5 scoops of sugar, same as the sniper."
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"I was mostly referring to the potential team behind it: the writer, director, composer etc. Japan has a lot of talented artists and it would be great if they took part in a potential global hit.

The best option imo would be a collab between Japan and Germany. That would make the most faithful adaption."
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"yeah, i won't deny that"
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"People make demands like this instead of saying no. There was probably some weird clause in the contract giving them rights based on other contingencies but you can weasel out of it by demanding too much.

It‚Äôs way more common than you think."
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,you are bonkers if you think netflix has a lower budget than hbo
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"I don't think the ending would be as controversial as those 2.

The Last of Us Part 2 and The Last Jedi have to deal with the fact that they are dealing and removing past and lovable characters from the story, while the Monster ending would simply end things."
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"I said 10 years ago.  Maybe it‚Äôs closer to 12 now, but yes.

Edit: No a decade was perfect House of Cards was 2013."

Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,">And Rip seriously thinks he is the good guy

Does he? I seem to remember him CONSTANTLY saying that he is not a good man. Did I miss something?"
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,It‚Äôs a prime time soap opera
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"This show is a non-cowboy‚Äôs idea of what it‚Äôs like to be a cowboy, told through the genre of soap opera. Nothing at all about it is authentic to real rural western life."
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,I watched a couple episodes and decided it wasn't for me. It's one of my grandma's favorite shows though and I did really enjoy 1883.
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"I'm Canadian, not even close to being a ""republican"" in politics or morality. 

But my wife and I enjoy this shoe and it's related shows...including Tulsa King.

It's TV. Sometimes simplistic drama, with pretty aesthetics is all you need.

But I'm only speaking for myself, and Yellowstone et al, is a nice wind down show.

Not everything is a pulitizer or Emmy winner, and that's ok"
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,It took me half an hour to realise there wasn't going to be any volcanoes in episode 1. I am not a smart man.
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,Sons of anarchy with horses.
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,I never understood why people watch TV/movies they despise so passionately.  Why do you put yourself through the torture?
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"I don‚Äôt think cowboy wet dream, more like fake macho masculinity ideal wet dream"
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"My father was a true cowboy- he grew up on a ranch riding horses and working cattle all through his childhood.

He can barely make it through a show with all the exaggerated events and falsities."
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"Wait, aren't they supposed to be unlikable? I pretty much unlike every main character, they are despicable and contradict themselves in their own ways but that's the point no? Anyway I love the show."
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"Ok, so let‚Äôs hear more about Jamie actually being John Dutton‚Äôs son.  What are you basing that off of?  Did I miss something?"
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,I‚Äôve thought about watching the spin-off with Harrison Ford. Is it any good?
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"I'm not a cowboy and I love this show, it's awesome.  The flawed yet relatable characters are the best part."
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,You‚Äôre overthinking it man haha. It‚Äôs a guilty pleasure of a show where you can get shot in one episode and get into a fist fight the next. It doesn‚Äôt make sense and really doesn‚Äôt need to. It‚Äôs got all the shit you‚Äôve mentioned along with good scenery and cinematography.
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,Yellowstone is lifestyle porn.
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,Clearly you know zero cowboys. Most of them hate the show. You‚Äôre thinking of rich people who like to pretend they‚Äôre cowboys.
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"To the people that say: ""Have you seen Yellowstone? No, OMG ITZ so freaking good. Its the best TV show ever.""  - I CANNOT UNDERSTAND! (I will forever question their logic)

However, its a very MID tier show that is entertaining."
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,Haha I bet you‚Äôre fun at parties.
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,Just living in Montana I hate this show more than anything.
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"As someone in the horse industry, I really like what this show has done for interest in the cutting and cowhorse events. More interest, more people competing, more money to win...it's really a good thing.

I don't really care to watch it for anything other than the horses."
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"The show was watchable to me.  Wasn‚Äôt expecting anything life changing   The thing I find funny is the most hated people are Californians who come in and buy land while the Star, Costner, is a liberal
Californian that lives on a ranch he bought in Colorado."
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"The cheese of the show is what makes it fun and watchable, otherwise, any direction towards realism would make the show extremely boring because ranching typically don‚Äôt involve murder, shootouts, and political intrigue.

All the characters are terrible human beings, pretty much in line with shows like Seinfeld, It‚Äôs Always Sunny, or Sopranos. They‚Äôre all terrible human beings that you can‚Äôt help but root for.

If I had to guess what makes the show popular, is that it‚Äôs just fun escapism‚Äîthe idea of this last frontier that‚Äôs devoid of urban problems can really resonate with anyone. There‚Äôs no need for woke-ism when the show established that most of the characters are terrible human beings. I‚Äôm not a gun-toting conservative, but I still watch the show and enjoy it for what it is, and I think the show runners are self-aware and understand this."
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"Yellowstone is a show about a family of murderous thugs, who operate an anti-corporatist, eco-terrorist, organized crime ring. 

Republicans seem to think of them as the heroes of the story mostly because they wear cowboy hats and ride horses.

I enjoy the show but it‚Äôs definitely slid from something I look forward to each week into a guilty pleasure soap experience."
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,It‚Äôs Sons of Anarchy for horse girls
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,Rip is hot AF.
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"The show is fantastic. I mean I cannot imagine watching 5 seasons of a show and typing out a 8 paragraph review of the most watched cable TV show only for the entire review to be shitting all over it. 

Really makes me wonder what is on the air right now that the OP thinks is good TV."
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,The fact that you had to write a novel just to say you ‚Äúhate‚Äù a TV show means it has you interested in more ways than one‚Ä¶ ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,I feel like it‚Äôs cowboys if it was the mafia because these people aren‚Äôt good people from what I‚Äôve seen at all
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"Nothing about native Americans living in the Yellowstone area after a hundred years of white man telling us they didn‚Äôt, love white representstion"
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,Tried watching the pilot episode and made it through...barely. I was laughing at how one dimensional and terrible the characters were by the end of that single episode. I could not even imagine trying to sit through a season. How this show is lauded by anyone is beyond me.
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,1882 was good. Yellowstone seems like am expensive soap opera
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"They tried to make a southerner/midwestern godfather but failed to kill the main character (Kevin Costner) because he‚Äôs too popular of an actor. If they killed him off at the end of season 1 it would have been a perfect set up to a shit show power grab by everyone. But I‚Äôm guessing it was network interference that stopped that. 

It‚Äôs a real shame because I watched a few episodes with my grandfather and enjoyed it, but now Ive actually taken the time to watch it and it‚Äôs so repetitive I couldn‚Äôt finish it."
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,It‚Äôs Game of Thrones: Montana.
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,It's 'Sons of Anarchy' with horses... Just enjoy it for what it is... Have a feeling it won't end well for most of them
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"As I've mentioned previously, I really enjoy the actual cowboyin that went on in previous seasons, especially with Jimmy. But newer season are hot garbage in writing and the acting, besides a few members, seems like it's just trying to ruin the show. It's basically just turned Dallas with guns. Ryan Bingham stays the best part of the show."
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,I don‚Äôt think many *actual* cowboys (or rural folks in general) really like the show. I know for a fact that the people in the region it portrays range from extreme dislike to a casual eye roll - but not any that I‚Äôm aware of like the show.
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"Jamie is not Alexa Carrington. If they'd set him up as a bad guy once for whatever reason, and let him take a fall, knocked him down a few pegs and let him redeem himself in whatever way, it'd be better than whatever this is. What gets me is that Jamie shouldn't be as stupid as he's written. And didn't he get back with the mother of his child? I guess not.

I'm also wondering after all these generations, why there aren't more Duttons out there. Let one of them come and be a villain... for a half season or so.

I saw 1883 first, and I enjoyed it, and I have hopes for 1923."
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"Wyomingite here, and I can‚Äôt name a single real cowboy I know that watches that shit, or name one thing on that show that reflects western/ranching life out here other than maybe roping and bunk house shit."
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"It‚Äôs literally Sons of Anarchy on horses. Not that I have a problem with either show, but the similarities between them are pretty obvious. I mean same writer and all. He just traded the cut in for a brand and Harleys for hoses. Still both are great dramas and I enjoy them, but they are a lot alike."
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"Personally prefer 1883.

There‚Äôs a reason why Yellowstone is very popular though. It appeals to two very distinct and extremes:

A) second amendment gun loving doomsday seekers

B) tech bros from the east and west coast that dream of one day having a ranch"
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"The show, and spinoffs, is creator Taylor Sheridan living out his cowboy fantasies...to the point that he took his Yellowstone paycheck and purchased the 6666 Ranch, where he's setting yet another spinoff. 

Guy is living his cowboy dream, and we're all watching it and paying for it"
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,Sounds about as well written as Sons of Anarchy to me.
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"EDIT: A commenter said its inauthentic to real western life so its for people unfamiliar with it. I grew up with cowboy relatives so that might be it.

I kept hearing it's the most- watched show so I watched a few episodes last month. I'm not into  westerns, and I so far dislike every character. It doesn't seem very different from Sons of Anarchy and so on, it just has pretty scenery. At least that was my impression. Don't feel like continuing it."
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"I bailed on this show because of how weirdly it treated Jamie. In season 1 he was ok then in season 2 they made him a pathetic sniveling mess who was scared of Beth. In season 1, Jamie and Beth‚Äôs relationship was fun and Jamie was allowed to tell Beth to fuck off.

Then I hear he is adopted and I have seen fans of that show use it as an excuse for why he is the bad guy and ‚Äúnot really family‚Äù. Adopted kids are still family wtf?

Anyways, justice for Jamie."
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"YouTube has been feeding me clips of the show for a few weeks now, and I know my brother and grandpa who are both right leaning love the show.  

From the little I've seen which is probably about 10 clips, it looks like this is a manufactured power fantasy for rural states, that rugged individualist, pull yourself up by your bootstrap but don't you dare infringe on me and what I have ideals of the once wild west. It's unrealistic, but not more so than Friends being able to afford those apartments in NYC. 

For me it gives me a hero I don't want, it wants me to look up to Costner and his rough crew for being 'hard working' but a lot of this comes across as the TV patting someone else on the back for not living near a major city. Often people are right because they win a fight, I saw a 'good guy with a gun' scene which would have gotten innocent people shot in real life, and I've seen grandstanding several times about the softness of everyone else vs. how they are. 

But I know people love it so I assume they watch The West Wing with the same uneasy feeling I do watching Yellowstone."
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"Couldn't agree more with this review, most overhyped show of the decade"
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"I really, really, REALLY tried with this show and the prequels, but something about the story just felt off.  I really struggled to get invested in any of the characters.  Eventually abandoned it for other shows, just wasn‚Äôt for me, but clearly it works for others."
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"Hot take: you just like hating popular thing to make yourself feel superior. Your criticism is incredibly superficial and shows you did not spend much time actually considering the show. 

A lot of Republicans got brought to the show by their hip, liberal relatives, only to be outraged by a lot of the show‚Äôs content."
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"Essentially it‚Äôs Sopranos for those who have ‚ÄúLive, Laugh, Love‚Äù on their wall in their home."
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,Don‚Äôt you know Kayce was in the military from the first episode? It goes downhill the more over the top it gets though.
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,It‚Äôs a soap opera for your maga aunt and uncle. It‚Äôs a platter to serve truck commercials on. It‚Äôs Costner doing what he does best‚Ä¶act badly. It‚Äôs pure schlock.
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,It's a show for people who want simple melodrama on a ranch. It's soap opera quality with a budget for people who don't want to think about what they are watching. There's no nuance in any character.
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"It's become ""hip"" to hate Yellowstone on this sub, that's when you know a show has reached true mainstream popularity"
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"The show is incredible, you‚Äôre just wrong.

How can you say Beth is unsympathetic when her dying mother told her she was weak before her last breath and her brother caused her infertility without her consent?

Rips character, and yearning for approval of a father that will never be blood son is a great starting point for a character.

And your saying a western gets a little sappy sometimes when love interests are involved‚Ä¶ YOU DONT SAY üôÑ

Taylor Sheridan is the modern day western writer and anything he touches is at *least* good, but IMO great."
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"Couldn‚Äôt get through half of season one. Loved 1883 and so far 1923. 
Edit to change date because I‚Äôm a pinecone. Lol."
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"I started watching this show last week, and finally caught up last night.  I think it's a really good show although some of the story is far-fetched."
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,I call it ‚ÄúSopranos with Saddles‚Äù.
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"I find the writing of Yellowstone dreadful. Watched first two series hoping it would come good. Binged 1883 in the summer, loved it. Almost unbelievable the same guy wrote both lol"
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,Does it confuse anyone else that Beth drives a Bentley? A pretentious British sports car and not an American muscle car or truck.
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,I finished season one already.  It's a bit like a country Boardwalk Empire
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,I just want the family to lose everything.   Rainwater seems alright so if the Native Americans end up with the land I wouldn‚Äôt mind.   Otherwise let anyone but this family keep ownership of the ranch land.
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"show is hilarious, I just can't understand how anyone can take it seriously. Maybe you Americans do since you practically live in a movie, but it's probably the same for you when you watch something like Downton Abbey (which is, it had to be said, total fantasyland even for us)"
Rhyme Time Town Singalongs,"This is not a western or cowboy genre. Its a soap opera with a country aesthetic. And any other show everyone would be tripping over themselves to praise the dark tone and morally grey characters like in Breaking Bad or Peaky Blinders or Walking Dead or GOT, but because people (mostly redditors) have the mistaken idea that this is somehow a right leaning wet dream they suddenly dont like it.

Turns out most normal people like morally grey people no matter the lens. These characters are anti-heroes. Did you get similarly mad at the Sopranos?

Your dislike is noted, the rest is a thinky veiled attack against your perceived political enemies.

I do feel like watching some Cowboy or Chanbara cinema right nos though, so thanks for that"

- Limited series is now scrapped.

Hmmm, I'm starting to think this adaptation is cursed."
Lovestruck in the City,"This is legitimately never gonna get made at this point lmao

Please just get some history nut veteran showrunner an HBO budget and cast Nick Offerman as Daniel Burnham.

Edit:

> In recent weeks, Jeremy Allen White and Jude Law were in talks to star but in the end, the entire project fell through. Was it the deals or was it a top-down message that an expensive period piece wasn't the way Hulu should go? ([source](https://twitter.com/borys_kit/status/1632911131986784256?s=46&t=nfDSG6o3y6zWZ-Y4pfC3bA))

We were so close"
Lovestruck in the City,"Jesus Christ, why has no one in 20 years been able to crack it? Whether as a movie or a show? Huge names have been attached to this yet it keep falling apart."
Lovestruck in the City,This is disappointing news
Lovestruck in the City,Maybe it‚Äôs for the best. Look how long it Y The Last Man to be made and that adaptation was pretty mediocre.
Lovestruck in the City,"Man this project certainly fell apart. Went from having a lead actor, director and a network last year to none this year."
Lovestruck in the City,"With all the crap that streaming turns out, this one can't make the cut?"
Lovestruck in the City,"Feels like every year or two I hear new names attached to this project and then it disappears. Same goes with Blood Meridian. TBF, both seem like they'd be very difficult adaptations."
Lovestruck in the City,This project is cursed.
Lovestruck in the City,Cursed but American God's got made so I'm hopeful still
Lovestruck in the City,I really wanted to see this
Lovestruck in the City,"I literally just finished this book. If they do the Worlds Fair parts, it would make for a boring movie.

Edit: I actually really enjoyed the fair sections, I just can‚Äôt imagine that be very exciting because a lot if it was about choosing architects, floral designs and such. They‚Äôll probably play up the fires and such, though."
Lovestruck in the City,"Had a feeling this was a dead series when Keanu dropped out. 

It seems like a weird project to adapt. A story about the creation of a giant expo and a story about a serial killer, neither of which have anything to do with another.

I'm surprised nobody has decided to ditch the part about the World's Fair and do a film about HH Holmes. It's probably all the parts about the World's Fair and recreating it is what would cause the project to have a giant budget."
Lovestruck in the City,Hard -- in the visual media -- trying to figure out how to fit in 3 episodes on architectural history in the middle of a story about a serial murderer.
Lovestruck in the City,This and ‚ÄúConfederacy of Dunces‚Äù have pissed off the adaptation gods and just can‚Äôt get out of development purgatory.
Lovestruck in the City,"Depending on your definition of progress, there was a lot of it on Scorsese‚Äôs film version. There‚Äôs a couple different drafts of the script floating around online, and probably several other versions that never emerged anywhere. Lot of writers worked on that movie over the years."
Lovestruck in the City,"A real shame, this would be a pretty epic 3hr movie more than a series IMO. DiCaprio would have been perfect too."
Lovestruck in the City,A Scorcese and DiCaprio vehicle sounds like a non-brainer to begin with. Really weird why it didn't go to completion at that first step tbh
Lovestruck in the City,"I remember first reading Devil In the White City because it was an inspiration for the then-upcoming Bioshock Infinite. 

That was ten years ago this month."
Lovestruck in the City,Pretty sure that before Leo and Scorcese Tom Cruise was attached to it as well.
Lovestruck in the City,It has been an emotional journey to follow along the whole time
Lovestruck in the City,Has Robert Eggers ever expressed interest in show running?
Lovestruck in the City,"Nick Offerman as Daniel Burnham?

Speaking of being so close..."
Lovestruck in the City,"Attaching huge names might be the problem. Star power is expensive and difficult to schedule unless it‚Äôs their passion project. Cast some unknowns. Grab an up and coming director. Save a bundle and give someone new a chance. If the production is good and the people behind it are talented, you don‚Äôt need star power."
Lovestruck in the City,"> Jesus Christ, why has no one in 20 years been able to crack it? 

Because the best parts of the book would make for one really dull drama. The best parts of the book was about the architecture of Chicago and the work done to put on the world's fair.

All the shit about HH Holmes is really a pretty forgettable story about a serial killer. 

The only thing interesting that Holmes did is he built an elaborate torture chamber. 

So at the end of the day they only options for story telling is about someone building things."
Lovestruck in the City,The show runner wanted to turn the show into something else. The main cast were pretty good but they didn't have a lot to work with. Alienated anyone who liked the source and didn't attract any of whatever demographic they were aiming for.
Lovestruck in the City,"Setting aside the question of whether you could make a direct adaptation of Y: The Last Man today, not having the Israelis and Amazons essentially got rid of the antagonists from the comics. That adaptation was a bit like making a Harry Potter movie without Voldemort and the Death Eaters, where Lily and James Potter really did die in a car crash.

Whether or not a slow burn quasi political post-apocalyptic story is something anyone has ever been interested in watching is something I think is fairly clearly answered by the fact no other show like that exists. Maybe such a programme (of film) *should* exist, but it's pretty clear they were just using the framework of the IP to trick people into watching/greenlighting what was a fundamentally different story. Sort of like Foundation except people didn't really like the new plotline. I suggest the major difference is, and I haven't read Foundation, that the Lee Pace stuff is kinda necessary for anything in Foundation to make sense, whereas in Y: The Last Man the politics stuff exists in an inherent tension with what the main characters are trying to do. Having a storyline about ""what comes next"" after a world shattering event, is a bit nuts when your ostensible main characters are trying to shatter the foundations of this new world.

They also made specific changes to Yorick and Mann that made both of them much harder to sympathise with. Alas, the specific change to Yorick was destructive to his entire character concept from the comics. Show Yorick knows Beth wanted to end things, whereas comics Yorick is sort of this hopeless romantic, which is endearing... even as the audience knows his mission *should* be doomed to failure (due to dramatic irony).

There are worse ways to make an adaptation, but Y: The Last Man's failure is clearly on how they tried to adapt it, not that they tried to adapt it in the first place."
Lovestruck in the City,"God if there was one comic that seemed to be an easy homerun it was Y last man. I really liked the first episode or two but then they decided to completely stall the story and change shit around. Same thing happened with preacher, yeah let's just spend an entire season focusing on shit that has nothing to do with the comic. TWD started great and faithful to the source material then got bogged down. The Witcher, eugh. 

If the last of us has a lasting impact I hope it's that the people with the money find someone who loves and understands the source material and let's them stay faithful."
Lovestruck in the City,"I finished the book the other month and after a certain point found the Holmes stuff to be an absolute drag on what I really wanted to get back to, which was Frederick Olmsted getting really annoyed over the specifics of park designs."
Lovestruck in the City,"Everyone can have their favorite parts, but if prior to reading the book you had told me I would dismiss much of the serial killer stuff and be profoundly captivated by the 1893 Colombian Exposition I would have laughed at you. But that‚Äôs what happened. The World‚Äôs Fair stuff is magical. And if I was ever offered an opportunity to go back to a time and place, it would be Chicago the year it opened."
Lovestruck in the City,"> If they do the Worlds Fair parts, it would make for a boring movie.

That also seems like it would be prohibitively expensive. They'd need a huge budget for sets and CGI extensions to show off the large scale of structures and workers and show all the progress over time in building the fair. Not to mention of course its a period piece which makes everything more pricey."
Lovestruck in the City,That's literally the only part I care about!
Lovestruck in the City,Disagree greatly.
Lovestruck in the City,"The race to put together the World‚Äôs Fair is the actual story though, it‚Äôs not in the middle of a story about a serial killer. And there‚Äôs a lot of dramatic thrust there, wouldn‚Äôt be hard to structure it in an episodic format. It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs just dudes staring at blueprints, there‚Äôs fires and storms and huge egos and crazy people coming from around the world and people dying under construction failures.

If anything in the book the HH Holmes stuff gets kinda repetitive and feels tacked on. It‚Äôs pretty clear to me that Larson wanted to write a book about the World‚Äôs Fair and the publisher made him include a serial killer hook."
Lovestruck in the City,"And a 20 minute aside on the layout of the fair and the risk of flooding that they had to avoid.


It why I never read Thunderstruck also by Erik Larson it's the same schtick of a bunch of interwoven events occuring and some just aren't interesting."
Lovestruck in the City,"Blood Meridian, too. 

I had no idea Confederacy of Dunces had been through adaptation hell. I feel like that one would require exceptionally gifted writers. The line between hilariously off-kilter and just weird seems like it'd be very fine for this one."
Lovestruck in the City,Throw *Neuromancer* in there too.
Lovestruck in the City,The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay is another great book that has had an adaptation in development hell for many years.
Lovestruck in the City,"At first you had my curiosity, but now, you have my attention."
Lovestruck in the City,But star power also brings in financing and this will be a very expensive period piece.
Lovestruck in the City,"Exactly lol the thing that would be the easiest to make into a television show would be HH Holmes and his murder house, but that's quite literally a backdrop to the story of the world's fair and the enormous feats to pull off its creation  

Might just be one of those things that simply works better as literature  

However, as someone who loves time period pieces I would absolutely watch a mini series about its creation"
Lovestruck in the City,"Yeah, the Holmes stuff is interesting early on in the sense that it's fascinating to watch this guy just sort of glide his way into building this little fiefdom/murder machine but once he has all the pieces of the machine set in place and the initial horror wears off it's mostly just a guy devoid of a soul repeating a pattern over and over again, and so checking in with him almost feels like a chore.

Meanwhile the Burnham side of the book is such an incredible look at what it takes to get something like that done, all the little ways in which it helped shape the century to come in terms of innovations, the labor movement, etc., and really this snapshot of life at that specific point in time. I think a really good show could be made out of it but it would cost a lot and would be pitched at a pretty niche audience, like if a David Simon show about urban development was given a huge amount of money by someone who just wanted to see it and didn't care that they lost a ton of money on it."
Lovestruck in the City,I honestly think his capture and trial would be interesting enough for a movie.
Lovestruck in the City,"Which for some reason seems to be the way most adaptions worked over the last decade. Buy the rights to a beloved IP, scrap everything the fans love and then come up with their own stories within this universe which is glorified fanfic at best.  
The people behind the Halo show stated they didn't care much for any of the existing lore which turned the Master Chief into a completly different character and ignored canon lore established in every prior media. Or the example of Henry Cavill and the Witcher adaption. The script writers stated they wouldn't respect the author and would come up with way better stories themselves resulting in Cavill leaving the project.  
It seems like many showrunners or script writers want to tell their own story but can't get funding for it. So instead they just pitch an established IP and try to squeeze their own script into it and pissing everyone off in the end."
Lovestruck in the City,Same. More than anything I want an anthology series on all the Worlds Fairs. Hell I want to go to a Worlds Fair.
Lovestruck in the City,"the amazing thing is what was done for the fair in such a short amount of time.  It's insane, obviously destined for colossal failure, but they pulled it off."
Lovestruck in the City,Personally I was enjoying the architectural stuff more than the murders. I found it a fascinating story of the challenges involved in pulling off the fair.
Lovestruck in the City,"I haven't read the book, but I wonder if doing something like what Legion did with it's [Jon Hamm narrated asides](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-WWoGOf8fY) would work.  Those were sprinkled throughout the season and were used to reinforce the themes of the episode, but didn't apply directly to the story."
Lovestruck in the City,"Jesus I thought it was just me.

I picked up that book because people were raving about it but holy lord the number of digressions is preposterous."
Lovestruck in the City,"If Blood Meridian was made right, it would be fucking horrifying to watch. Absolutely horrifying"
Lovestruck in the City,"> Blood Meridian, too.

Probably for the best, I don't think I could picture anyone else playing Judge besides Phillip Seymour Hoffman."
Lovestruck in the City,"For a while every star cast in COD had died so it was considered cursed, but I think that has ended"
Lovestruck in the City,Bioshock infinites setting is based on the Worlds Fair so there's that atleast
Lovestruck in the City,"Yeah the murders are just the hook to get a wider audience interested, the real meat is in that sweet sweet Ferris wheel"
Lovestruck in the City,I found myself skimming through the Holmes chapters to get back to the interesting stuff about the fair.  Really cool to visit Science and Industry in Chicago after reading it to get a sense of the scale of it all.
Lovestruck in the City,By the digressions you mean all the murders right? Because those are the real digressions in the book.
Lovestruck in the City,"Yeah I agree, a lot of the asides felt like he was trying to reach a page count. Spread too wide and thin for me. I'd rather have read a In Cold Blood story of the killer."
Lovestruck in the City,Yep. I'm guessing that's why every 2-3 years another star shops it around and then drops it.
Lovestruck in the City,Oh man. He would have been perfect.
Lovestruck in the City,I think Stellan Skarsgard would be great
Lovestruck in the City,But how many marriage proposals were there on it???
Lovestruck in the City,"Looks like *all* the shows at Television City currently (like Bill Maher and Dancing with the Stars) are moving out, construction is starting at the studio. Whether that means they'll return in the future is unknown"
Lovestruck in the City,It was such a thrill to see it in person when I turned 18 during Drew Carey's first season. Didn't get picked but saw 3 entertaining shows in 2008 and 2009.
Lovestruck in the City,They will be producing TPIR until the end of time. It's one big hourly tv commercial with low production cost.
Lovestruck in the City,"No more tourists spilling out into The Grove after filming every day has me torn. On one hand, I will miss seeing those people, they‚Äôre a fun bunch to talk to. They have their tags still on, and are in such good moods. It always gives me a re-appreciation for my city, and they get to have a friendly interaction with a local. Such a positive. 

On the other hand, all that construction is going to be noisy. It *does* make me happy to know how very mad this makes Rick Caruso (mall owner, failed mayoral candidate). Such a positive."
Lovestruck in the City,I got called down to contestant row.  One of the funnest days of my life!
Lovestruck in the City,But....but...it's the Bob Barker Studio...
Lovestruck in the City,The Price Is Wrong ‚Ä¶ bitch.
Lovestruck in the City,"After Covid the price is right has NOT been the same.  As someone that has been watching this show for almost 40 years, I can tell the audience is totally not even a thought anymore.  Gone are the days of home made custom shirts, here to stay are made in China shirts that are picked up at the store on the way into the shooting.  It‚Äôs painfully obvious."
Lovestruck in the City,"Hackman Capital, the current owners of Television City, also bought CBS' other Los Angeles studio lot (The Radford Studios) just over a year ago.  They just announced last week that the Radford lot will be undergoing a billion-dollar renovation of its own.  Lots of television history on those two lots, and not just CBS stuff either.

https://la.urbanize.city/post/1-billion-revamp-bring-new-offices-and-soundstages-radford-studio-center"
Lovestruck in the City,I didn‚Äôt know Brenden Gleeson hosted the price is right
Lovestruck in the City,it‚Äôs moving to Glendale?! BOO GLENDALE!!! Amirite r/burbank
Lovestruck in the City,I shouldn't be but I'm mortally offended.
Lovestruck in the City,im just realizing the price is right uses the same font as the GTA games
Lovestruck in the City,Wonder if this will mean a return to a full audience. I have to imagine it will at this point
Lovestruck in the City,but... it's the Bob Barker Studio
Lovestruck in the City,all the prices are wrong anyway
Lovestruck in the City,Last time I was there they were talking about a major studio renovation so could this just be temporary?
Lovestruck in the City,"What a shame to lose the original location where Aaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman from Breaking Bad) jokingly said he gave his best work. ü•∫üëâüëà

Lovestruck in the City,Vancouver is discountef!
Lovestruck in the City,"I mean, who gives a shit really?  The show continues right?  Maybe in a new studio instead of a relic?"
Lovestruck in the City,"It seems like a lot of Fremantle‚Äôs shows will be taping in the new studio, along with TPIR.  This includes Press Your Luck, Celebrity Family Feud and Let‚Äôs Make A Deal. 

https://twitter.com/buzzerblog/status/1633863193763381249?s=46&t=fhyTSvoEQSS30_U2gcErOw

Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if all of Fremantle‚Äôs shows end up there."
Lovestruck in the City,"IIRC, Maher films on the same stage as Price, so if one is going it was almost certain the other would."
Lovestruck in the City,"I thought when the buyout deal was signed 5 years ago, it said they were to move all production out within 5 years. Unless I‚Äôm misremembering the deal, this was always inevitable."
Lovestruck in the City,Small world.
Lovestruck in the City,[deleted]
Lovestruck in the City,"I watched a recent episode and was shocked by a change.  It used to be that every product shown, from the deodorant to the washing machine, was described in detail.  A commercial veiled as a description to help the constant guess the price.

But now ... not so much.  Brand names aren't mentioned and descriptions are more generic.  At least for the smaller products, that is.  Cars still get the full treatment.

I wonder if the smaller products aren't sponsored anymore.  Like the toothpaste you need to guess the price of so you can win the furniture."
Lovestruck in the City,"> It's one big hourly tv commercial with low production cost.

When I worked in an office, getting to watch TPIR was such a treat, I always looked forward to a workday off so I could see it. 

But now that I work from home and could see it all the time, I really dislike it and never watch it. Not just knowing how much of an advertisement it is, but knowing how ""fixed"" it is (everyone in the audience doesn't have a chance of getting picked, the producers choose who they want to come on stage)."
Lovestruck in the City,Pro tourist and pro construction noise is a rare position to find someone

Lovestruck in the City,Details?  Lifelong dream of mine.
Lovestruck in the City,"It sounds like the older studios and historic elements will be staying put, but the construction everywhere else surrounding it will make it infeasible to shoot shows there at least for the time being. So I am guessing they‚Äôll be back!"

Mystic,Where is that from?
Mystic,Earth's mightiest heroes.
Mystic,I fucking loved Beetleborgs and their toys growing up.
Mystic,"Used to love this as a kid, the music by Clannad worked so well. It was never the same when they replaced Michael Praed‚Äôs Robin with Jason Connery though. Praed wanted to quit so a replacement was needed but they chose poorly."
Mystic,"I first saw this series around 1989-1990, I think it aired on USA PBS stations. IMO it was and is easily the best ""Robin Hood"" adaptation on the large or small screens. Took the slightest dip when Sean Connery's son replaced the original Robin Hood actor, but just the slightest."
Mystic,"They did an audiobook story extension a few years back with many of the original cast members involved. I was lucky enough to have been asked to contribute some lines as background characters. Check it out if you‚Äôre looking for a fix, appreciate its not TV but it‚Äôs another story at least. 

https://www.thedreamcage.com/2015/09/audio-robin-of-sherwood-knights-of.html?m=1"
Mystic,"The Brother Cadfael series is a fairly close match to your wish, but with a bit less swords and horses."
Mystic,"This show was a little before my time. But I watched it years later due to having some interest in the stories. It seemed to take a lot of inspiration from the 1981 film Excalibur. Especially when it got into the mystical stuff.

Spoilers in case anyone cares for a show this old. The second Robin Hood was actually Sean Connery's son.  I also heard there was another Robin Hood show in the 2000s, but never saw it."
Mystic,"It was a part of my childhood as well, which is exactly why I hope it never gets remade/rebooted. I would like a new show with a similar vibe, just not another Robin."
Mystic,"Wow, a reboot of a classic show I remember from my childhood. What a brilliant idea.
I can‚Äôt see how this could possibly be ruined by modern TV or streaming companies. In fact based on all the amazing ideas brought up just in this thread I think it will be the greatest show ever made. 

Now I must go and get this gaping head wound checked."
Mystic,"Maybe it's the fog of age, but I recall the great soundtrack.  Together, we."
Mystic,"Haven't rewatched it recently, but as a kid I absolutely loved the BBC Robin Hood series featuring Jonas Armstrong"
Mystic,"it's time for a great reboot where Maid Marian becomes the new Robin Hood, but better"
Mystic,"You are absolutely right regarding Clannad, btw. Im fact, I'd even say that the songs and sound sequences they produced for the show were absolutely defining. I'd be hard pressed to think of another show whose music was so much part of its identity. For me, the Normans-theme alone (""Strange Land"") is similarly iconic as the Imperial March or the Terminator theme."
Mystic,"True, Connery was a bad replacement. The show, however, maybe even became better, all in all, in season 3. Good scripts, better action scenes and slightly higher production values. A shame they couldn't continue with Praed, they probably would have gotten an additional season with him.

Just started rewatching after 10 years, maybe I'll try my hand at writing the reboot I wish for for myself üòÑ"
Mystic,"Yes, I watched it on Oregon Public Broadcasting back in high school, probably 87 -88 I think.  

Great atmosphere and vibe."
Mystic,"Thanks, I'll check it out. üëç

But still, I say the world is ripe for a *good* new incarnation of Robin Hood.
In my childhood and youth, Robin was always around and a significant influence, in three different versions. In Kindergarten, I loved the Disney film. In primary school, it was Robin of Sherwood (nothing ever came close!), and in high school, the Kostner movie was a cultural event.

And today? Flop after flop. The film with Russell Crowe was pretty forgettable, and the one with Taron Egerton a major bomb. For 30 years, kids have grown up without a proper Robin Hood of their own... time for Herne and the Hooded Man to liberate them. :)"
Mystic,"The Robin Hood in the 2000s struggled a bit during the first season as they were trying to retell the classic stories. One they started to branch out from those stories, it really founds its feet. I highly recommend it. 

If you're in the UK, it's currently on iplayer"
Mystic,"But the look was much more dark, real and dirty than Excalibur. I wasn't happy with the extreme, chromy shininess and colourful light of that film, so I only watched it once. Didn't really connect with the story eiher.

Fun fact: Robert Addie, who plays Guy of Gisbourne in RoS, also plays Mordred in Excalibur."
Mystic,"I understand your concern. 
However, I think a new Robin series- if done well - would have so much potential, and not take anything away from the original.

A reboot would allow for more character-centered episodes and add longer-term storylines to the crisis of the week model of RoS. The seven swords of Wayland, for example, could be explored much further, as does the Herne mythos."
Mystic,"Don't want to further alarm you, but have your doctor check your irony gland, while he's at it. Looks like it might be hyperactive, from the outside.

Amazing ideas such as?"
Mystic,"No fog there, it was great indeed. ""Together we"" was one of the tracks used as a theme for the light-hearted moments with the gang in the forest or friendly scenes in the villages."
Mystic,I'll check it out.
Mystic,"I hope that trend will have run its course by then. üòè
But I was indeed also thinking about the possibility of adding more female characters. 
Always difficult, in a medieval setting. Changing olde England into an equal opportunity feminist utopia would ruin the atmosphere.
But then again, in hindsight, adding Marion to the core group was already very progressive by the showrunners, at least for the times. And the satanic nuns from season 2 made for great villains.

I'd probably give the Sheriff and Abbot Hugo a sinister sister who dabbles in dark magic and court intrigue.

A ruthless female cutthroat might be a believable addition to the Sherwood crew. Maybe a love interest for Will Scarlet.

On the celtic mysticism side, a druidic priestess might serve as an interesting counterpart to Herne, maybe adding a second, conflicting side to the more spiritual episodes."
Mystic,"For those who are too young to have this mystical masterpiece in their vaults

Mystic,"I think it's because the proper modern Robinhood is a series that's about the Crusades, where Robin is a subplot, kind of like a Game of Thrones thing."
Mystic,"Excalibur was slightly hammy, but great fun imo. In the words of Merlin 

"" A dream to some. 

A NIGHTMARE TO OTHERS !!!"""
Mystic,"The swords were frustrating for me as well, I was hoping to learn the whole story. I would watch a show developing the mystic aspect of RoS for sure."
Mystic,Thanks! I remember one used as a tension builder before and during battle. Tried to find it on YouTube but was unsuccessful. These were memories from when I was a child so I don't have much context to search.
Mystic,"You think everything needs to be ultra-epic and on a global scale? Hmm. Maybe politically, with lots if scenes showing the corrupt politics at court, beyond Nottingham. But actually showing the crusades would be too wide a focus, and too expensive."
Mystic,"You'll find all songs on the album ""Legend"" by Clannad."
Mystic,"I actually think the problem is that a modern Robinhood TV series has too *little* going on. 

It would make a great mini-series, but it would either get too soapy or too samey or jump the shark after 1.5 full seasons.

But it a broader period series, the Robinhood focused-episodes would be the most anticipated ones of the season."
Mystic,"Interesting point. I'm just rewatching RoS and I guess I see what you mean. However, I think the concept could still work if it was heavily expanded in the right directions. The Carpenter series took a lot of liberties itself, and these additions were among what I liked best about the show. Robin being the agent of a pagan god. Seven magic swords. A Saracen dual-wielder. Pightish barbarian shamans.

You could add much more in a similar vein to the mix, turning Sherwood Forest even more into a bit of a pagan fantasy world and merging Arthurian aspects into the Robin character."
Mystic,"Thank you for making this thread, so the front page isn't half Rings of Power reviews lmao"
Mystic,"The common thread in every interview seems to be that it‚Äôs visually spectacular - no surprise there. 

The division is at whether the plot, writing and characters are any good, which is more or less what I assumed would be divisive from the very beginning.

I‚Äôll hold my ultimate judgement until after the season finale (keep in mind most critics only got the first two episodes), but until then I remain a bit skeptical that Amazon Studios has what it takes to produce HBO level prestige television.

Edit: Something to keep in mind - it seems like everyone besides LA Times (who got 6 episodes) only saw the first two, which are undoubtably going to be worldbuilding heavy. Considering that a lot of recent Marvel/Star Wars offerings on D+ seem to start off promising and become gradually more divisive in reception, it‚Äôs plausible that ROP is the opposite. There‚Äôs some heavyweight talent on the writing staff which is basically the only reason I have some optimism."
Mystic,I dunno man. Calling a work based on Tolkien ‚ÄúGame of Thrones-lite‚Äù is not the compliment rogerebert.com thinks it is.
Mystic,"I just watched the first two episodes in a fan screening. AMA I guess.

Overall pretty good, with not really impressive writing (especially when compared to HOTD), but some actually decent dialogue I thought.

Absolutely astonishing production value.

Missed some of the warmth of the LOTR films.

I‚Äôve never read LOTR so feel free to disregard my opinion.

EDIT: Also, serious moments were serious (no random quips) and the comedy was still pretty good when adequate. That was nice."
Mystic,Making a judgement off two episodes seems dumb.
Mystic,"So far it all indicates at starting slow and taking its time to building the world.

Rather than just throwing people into the LOTR universe. And I prefer for shows to take their time rather than having 5 minutes if world building and that's it and roll the action.

Also I imagine it will be hard to compact 2 or 3000 years worth of story into several seasons."
Mystic,I find it kind of annoying that everyone frames their take around how expensive it is. It‚Äôs not like you or I had to pay for it. I don‚Äôt see why it matters

Mystic,Seems like its visually spectacular (which you would hope considering the insane pricetag) but so far we haven't got much meaty or satisfying characters or story yet. Lets hope they can deliver some solid character work considering they've only got three quarters of the seaosn left.
Mystic,How long are the first two episodes?
Mystic,"Saw the premiere last night at my local theater and loved what I'm seeing so far. First episode is slow setting things up, but I'm already familiar with the characters, their motives, etc. come the second episode. Can't wait for more next week!"
Mystic,"Thoroughly enjoyed this, very intrigued to see how things play out. The guy on the raft could not have looked more like Vijo Morganstein if they tried. I assume he'll have something to do with Numenor. Also, I loved Frankenstein Gandalf."
Mystic,"How's is bezos Washington Post giving it the worst.


That's oddly funny..fuck Bezo btw.

But I hope this show is good"
Mystic,Color me cautiously optimistic.
Mystic,I rate it 19 out of 20 rings of power.
Mystic,It seems like it's too early to tell if it's good or if it just looks good.
Mystic,Would like to say the Grace Randolph review is pretty funny
Mystic,Why does it just screams‚Ä¶. ‚ÄúThe story is just slow as hell‚Äù
Mystic,"Just saw the first two episodes in a fan screening. As a mild Lord of the Rings fan, I really enjoyed them.

Visually it's absolutely gorgeous. I haven't been so inspired and awestruck by sets and locations like this in years.

As far as writing goes I'm very excited with the direction and setup. I know a handful of people who think Lord of the Rings is boring. I don't think so but I understand why. I'm exaggerating here but they're kinda like watching a textbook of events that occured. It's similar to Peter Jackson's King Kong. There's a lot of characters and they try to inject warmth and relatability into the characters but at the end of the day it feels like it's more about the plot and getting from point a to point b than exploring characters. I feel like to get the full experience and to love the characters completely I'd have to go research their lives.

Rings of Power however already does a lot more groundwork introducing the world and characters in a way that in my opinion isn't boring and builds more of a rapport between the viewers and the characters. Already I feel closer to and care about many of the characters nearly as much as I do the Lord of the Rings characters. I found them very charming. I chuckled a lot and even characters I was unsure about ended up being my favorites. Take this with a grain of salt though, because as I stated I'm a mild fan. I haven't read any of the books and am not bringing textbooks of lore into my opinion.

I keep seeing this compared to Game of Thrones which is just a bunch of tribal marketing in my opinion. The way I see it Game of Thrones is great for all of the politics, intrigue, scheming, and human interactions. And I think Lord of the Rings is great for it's fantasy, wonder, adventure, and beauty. So I think it's completely reasonable to like one more than the other or both (in my case) for different reasons.

Anyways. Ask me anything if you want."
Mystic,"The AV Club just released their review, and they grade it an A-, saying it's ""one of the most captivating fantasy worlda in TV history"".

https://www.avclub.com/lord-of-the-rings-the-rings-of-power-review-1849479930"
Mystic,"so, Prime is the only service I don't have, so I may have to end up sailing the high seas for the premiere of this one, man, why couldn't this be on HBO?"
Mystic,"Its amazing tonsee the massive disconnect from professional critics and audiences. To critics, this show is a masterpiece. To the actual viewers, who make the show money, its a disasterl... mostly. Sitting at high 30s on RT right now and no better elsewhere for viewer reviews. 

Everyone seems to agree that the show is visually stunning. Its amazing looking, but thats what throwing an ungodly amount of money at a show will do. However, most agree that the rest of the show is just bad. There are a variety of reasons given. Bad acting, bad writing, ignoring set lore, injecting real world social views into a world that it doesnt fit into.... then we have actors on social media making things worse, as usual these days when a show was likely doomed to fail to begin with. 

I watched it. Not a fan. I loved the previous entries. I even rewatched and read everything again before. Its something I like to do when things like this come out. I was let down. They ignored the source material. They ignored established lore and changed it. In ky eyes, they solidified that this can not and will not be canon too. 

I was excited at first, despite the bad press. I was let down. I was bored and disappointed. I made it to the second episode and I am done. I wont watch any more. I am one who gave it a bad review. If you are going to base a show on an established world with a lot of rich lore, you need to actually follow that lore. You need to try and add story to the world, not change it. 

Thats my 2 cents on the matter. Agree with it or dont. Watch if you want. If you enjoy it, great for you. Thats awesome. I dont. I think its a polished turd and nothing more. Shiny on the outside but inside, its still just a turd."
Mystic,"I don't like it, struggle to stay awake after 4 episodes."
Mystic,"Far better reviews than I expected.

I had hoped it wouldn't be review bombed. I have friends and family who worked on this show and they all are very positive with the results."
Mystic,"Why is this sub pretending this is already some kind of massive failure? 71 MC is not bad. Hell, it's even slightly higher than House of the Dragon."
Mystic,Why is rottentomatoes site so fucked? RoP and HotD are only showing like 5 reviews
Mystic,So far it's not a disaster is what I'm getting from the reviews. I'm hoping they can pull it off. Please be better than that Nexflix Shannara series!
Mystic,"""It either races through astonishing action scenes, or lingers on a single conversation or meaningful look.""

At least they're successfully emulating that aspect of Tolkien."
Mystic,"From the 'positive' reviews:

>there‚Äôs potential in this adventure‚Äîeven if we can‚Äôt see it yet.

> It's the kind of show that deserves to be seen on the big screen instead of on your phone.

> but I also kept thinking that what I really wanted to do was rewatch the movies.

>It‚Äôs true, the pace of The Rings of Power‚Äôs first two episodes is slow and deliberate

>It may take a while for ‚ÄúThe Rings of Power‚Äù to sort itself out

> The pace, too, is a little all-or-nothing...in the end, the spectacle wins.

>The somewhat flawed series 

> flutters to life in bursts,

> even if some of that exposition lags... even if some of the effects and epic scale diminish a tiny bit."
Mystic,It's better than The Hobbit trilogy at least
Mystic,"To be fair game of thrones season 1 took a while to gather some  to steam 

Problem is you have a very entitled fan base who have decided there is no room for error (which is ironic considering there‚Äôs plenty Peter Jackson changed and everyone loves his version)"
Mystic,Anything has to be better than the Hobbit movies.
Mystic,Damn. Entertainment Weekly had every exclusive leading up to the release and threw it right under the bus once all the marketing money was paid. Gangster. That means they probably tried to be as nice as possible even in a negative review. Can only imagine Bezo's rage reading that review.
Mystic,Hopefully it looks like Lord of the Rings and not The Hobbit.
Mystic,[deleted]
Mystic,I'm not going to write the whole show off based on two episodes but these reviews don't give me much hope.
Mystic,"Someone explain to me how you can spend a billion dollars and fuck up this bad. No coherent story line. 2D characters. No back story. The acting was trash. Everyone is saying that it looks good but you can tell it's just cgi. I'd rather watch Amy Schumers comedy special. 

1/10 would not bang."
Mystic,"I did a double take because I read many of the reviews blurbs in your post before noticing you had sectioned it off as positive at the top and mixed/negative at the bottom. Reason why is many of those positive reviews sound very mixed or maybe backhanded complimentary at best.

I feel confident no matter what happens we should all get out our popcorn for the discussions around this show coming up."
Mystic,"What you're going to see in this thread:

Cherrypicking parts of reviews to confirm this sub's predetermined opinion that the show is going to fail. They said it looks gorgeous? That must mean the content sucks!

It's been hilarious watching the run up to this and HOTD. It's clear which show this sub wanted to succeed and which one it wanted to fail. The Amazon hate runs deep."
Mystic,"Who knew that a mega thread of Rings of Power reviews would have so little comment on this sub. Apparently, reddit is upset."
Mystic,It‚Äôs just never gonna beat the trilogy is it? Why bother
Mystic,Lots of buts in those positive reviews.
Mystic,"Imagine seeing the shit show of the star wars sequel trilogy and thinking ""Let's do that to Lord of the Rings."" Damn, as soon as I saw JJ Abrams being involved with the show runners I knew this show was a lost cause."
Mystic,Karendriel is not a great character.
Mystic,"Most reviews seem surprisingly honest, that it is OK but not brilliant yet - i was really expecting a lot of 10/10 best show ever shill reviews."
Mystic,[deleted]
Mystic,"Ick, I love the Washington Post and subscribe to it, but the critic apparently cannot spell ""appendices."" She spelled it ""appendixes"" twice within 4 words, but I would only spell it that way when speaking about the organ."
Mystic,The last people I would trust to review a movie or TV show is 'critics'... They're always paid shills that are not in line with the general public
Mystic,Sticking to the writings of the master of high fantasy -Tolkien - whose work they were adapting would have helped. But they chose to write their own garbage plots
Mystic,"So the writing for the show is terrible as expected and visuals are stunning as expected. Inorder to keep viewers hooked for a high fantasy show like this, the writing has to be extremely good else casual fans will lose interest. The reviews also point out a lack of interesting characters.This show is going to be a major disaster."
Mystic,"I'm still cautious.

I swear to christ if I tune in and everyone living in middle earth looks like they walked off an instagram photoshoot \*Cough\* Wheel of time \*Cough\* I'm out. Immediately. And never coming back."
Mystic,[deleted]
Mystic,"So at best, a Tolkien effort..."
Mystic,NEVER trust critic reviews nowadays. You'll see a huge variations between critic reviews and audience reviews and the latter is always more on point.
Mystic,The problem  is it's not meant to run forever and they're gonna wanna run it forever.   So it's literally gonna be a show with the story that goes nowhere with a beautiful background and beautiful scenery and beautiful everything and absolute garbage for story.
Mystic,"I havem't seen it, but l'll rate it as a solid 7 unicycles out of 5 fleshlights."
Mystic,"It's September 1st, why can't I watch this yet?"
Mystic,Has it been posted yet?  I don't see it on Prime.
Mystic,"I am a huge fan of LOTR since I was a young kid, I was excited for the show. I found it to be ok, I did not love it nor did I really dislike it. I will watch it, but I lost a lot of my excitement during the first 2 episodes."
Mystic,"Weird wall of text incoming. I took the time to review the sources form above poster my self.

I would entirely quote other parts of the articles and viewed closer into every publication.

**RogerEbert.com**  
This sounds not that positive:  
""ut you can throw all the CGI money in the world at a series, and it won‚Äôt make it more quickly-paced or its characters more compelling. That‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Ring of Power‚Äù‚Äôs major failing in its early go, as its first episode functions as a somewhat dry, derivative prelude, filled with endless scenes of politicking and elves droning on against green screens or elegantly-furnished conference rooms. It‚Äôs hardly the most exciting beginning to the series, with a frustrating amount of place-setting and more two-line characters than you can shake a palant√≠r at. ""  
""Really, what hobbles ‚ÄúThe Rings of Power‚Äù is its teasingly derivative design that evokes Jackson‚Äôs trilogy while also asserting itself as something entirely new. The costumes pay homage to Ngila Dickson‚Äôs lush outfits for the original films, right down to Sauron‚Äôs spiked helmet; Bear McCreary‚Äôs classical score feels appropriately big, but doesn‚Äôt stand out with the same hummable zeal as Howard Shore‚Äôs.""  
Hmm  
""While these first two hours read as a little dry, there‚Äôs plenty of promise in the robust world of ‚ÄúThe Rings of Power‚Äù‚Äîhopefully, enough to overcome the stiffness of its prologue.""  
  
The conclusion pushes back to the point there are so more episodes, lets see.  
  
On the Author:  
""He is also a member of the Chicago Film Critics Association and Critics Choice Association. You can also find his byline at RogerEbert.com, Vulture, The Companion, FOX Digital, and elsewhere. ""  
Fishy in the context you will read further down, isn't it?  
  
Seems every single cast of netflix animation series is more diverse than the main authors shared in US top entertainment magazines world.  
Whom could say they have 5 lbs in square miles of waching machines measured by gallon capacity to offer...  
  
No article on season premiere or more.  
  
  
**Digital Spy**  
Basically ""imprint""  
""HEARST UK ENTERTAINMENT NETWORK  
Digital Spy participates in various affiliate marketing programs, which means we may get paid commissions on editorially chosen products purchased through our links to retailer sites.  
¬©2022 Hearst UK is the trading name of the National Magazine Company Ltd, 30 Panton Street, Leicester Square, London, SW1Y 4AJ. Registered in England. All Rights Reserved.""  
So this is an addriven media ad magazine owned by an entertainment company.  
There are also NO negative reviews what so ever on the site and the format/ theming of the ""articles"" is very similar to each other whatever the content.  
  
So this doesn't even counts as an ""opinion"".  
  
  
  
**Collider**  
Although on the About page they claim to some ""editors"" codex or some romantic description of journalism:  
""Collider is the ultimate source for impactful entertainment news. We deliver the biggest, most important industry happenings, and provide deep analysis and sharp commentary through interviews, reviews, and much more. Since the site began in July 2005, we‚Äôve been dedicated to delivering content that is thoughtful, analytical, and all-encompassing, with a tinge of personality for good measure. ""  
The todays ""article"" of todays is a simple descriptive novel, or a high school writedown of the first episode. A textual Rip off of the episode. There is no analytical part whatsoever.  
Even in the pre-release ""articles"" is any analytical confrontation with the material its only ""descriptively explaining"" of what happens to the challenged american mind.  
  
  
  
**Slash Film**  
This site is a real funny rip off of journalism in this entainment block.  
The Article from the pre-release hype is written by Chris Evangelista who  
""Chris hosts the 21st Century Spielberg podcast.  
His work has appeared in The Guardian, RogerEbert.com, Fangoria, Empire Magazine, and more.""  
  
Is a podcaster, yeah. And he also wrote Feature articles for atleast one of the other sites on this list.  
https://www.slashfilm.com/author/chrisevangelista/  
  
The only update article on todays release evolves on a kind of topic and opinion article on the character Gandalf.   
In the first paragraph they celebrate, that it is all so close the original material, while reverting in the 2nd paragraph to the opposite opinion on their ability of deviate from it: ""The Rings of Power"" is not afraid to deviate from the strict rule set of the books (or films)."" .  
Then they state that the visually different guy from that episode is soooo likely Gandalf.  
The only part there we dont read a sum up of the content of the show is there the article concludes on that a probably Gandalf like Character being introduced here is a good idea. And thats the only spot there there is some kind of argumentation on something.  
  
So here is no review of the show as a whole with pros and cons.  
  
And Suprise the write of todays article Marcos Melendez:   
https://www.slashfilm.com/author/marcosviana/  
Is also writing for before mentioned sites ""His previous work includes writing news and feature content for Collider, CBR, and ScreenRant.""

  
  
**Daily Beast**  
The pre-realease article and author seem to be a bit more reflective here.  
It all seems more like someone really wrote some sort of article. There also critical articles can be found, but it hast to be literally like ultra trash to get negative reviews here. See for yourselves if you want to double check on my text by looking in the authors article history there.  
  
From the About Us:   
""Independent. Irreverent. Intelligent. The Daily Beast delivers award-winning original reporting, fact-informed analysis, and sharp opinion in the arena of politics, pop-culture, and power and reaches more than 1 million readers a day.

Pretty cocky statement, if no sharp opinion or heavy analysis in the arena of politics can be found in the first 3mins on their page.

Mystic,How the fuck do you leave an audience review on this?
Sweet Home,"Nice one. First season was solid, if not amazing. I‚Äôll def watch more. Korea is making some really great shows now-

-DP

-Juvenile Justice 

-Hell Bound

-Squid Game 

-Sweet Home

Etc plus the K Drama shows like My Liberation Notes."
Sweet Home,Wow they got picked up for 2 more seasons
Sweet Home,YES! YES! YES! YES! YES!!!!!!!    i'm so excited!!  i was starting to think this show wouldn't get a 2nd season let alone a 3rd as well!   this news made my day!
Sweet Home,"I can still vividly see the one expression the main actor had for most of the scenes.

I did like the woman turning into a womb/egg. The firefighter actress also impressed me.

Also something completely a matter of taste, but I was turned off by the Imagine Dragons songs blaring loudly in montages."
Sweet Home,I wonder how much will change since they deviated from the webcomic
Sweet Home,Just a little [sweetener](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNpqOHpZD9I) for the fans!
Sweet Home,Fuck yes
Sweet Home,"Wonder what‚Äôs going to happen. The first season was ok, but it was nowhere near as good as the WEBTOON. I still need to catch up with Shotgun Boy."
Sweet Home,Yahhhhhh!
Sweet Home,"Did you see Move to Heaven, it was excellent."
Sweet Home,Hope hellbound gets season 2 too.
Sweet Home,DP was surprisingly great! Watched it at night cause I liked the placeholder picture and finished it in one sitting.
Sweet Home,"If you liked all those, you should check out The Guest. Also in Netflix"
Sweet Home,Check out The Silent Sea and Kingdom
Sweet Home,All of us are dead and alice in borderland too
Sweet Home,"I was turned off by the imagine dragons initially as someone who grew up making fun of them in America. But I shut my ears off a little and tried to listen to the song as an outsider and then the song was kind of cool for those scenes.

&#x200B;

Thats just me trying to enjoy the show as best as I can"
Sweet Home,Sweet Home is an amazing manhwa/webtoon.
Sweet Home,Damn. I was hoping season 2 was already being filmed. I guess we'll have to wait awhile.
Sweet Home,"Honestly I kind of hope this doesn't happen, that show really did not translate the interesting ideas and dramatic concepts that the webtoon had well at all. For example The woman who turned into the giant fetus so that she could still become a monster but not hurt anyone was so much sadder/dramatic and more well done in the webtoon than the show, the show barely explains what's happening and it just comes off confusing/awkward. And how could they remove the tie-in of him playing that video game(which connects him to another person in the building, that doesn't happen in the show). Or also remove that his character that he plays in the video game kind of becoming the base of his consciousness/mutation n that's what he's turning into(which is why his monstrous form wants to protect) instead of that weird Black Wing thing, like, that was so dumb. 

Also if I hear that fucking Imagine Dragons song one more time I'm going to blow my brains out... lol"
Sweet Home,"As he should, I can't believe they even considered doing it without him."
Sweet Home,Damn it‚Äôs gonna be a long wait for season 2. Is this normal for Korean shows? I‚Äôm still waiting for more Uncanny Counter and Extracurricular seasons. Also Alice in Borderland!
Sweet Home,"Happy for those who liked it, but I hated the changes of the WEBTOON."
Sweet Home,"FUCK YES!!!  i love this series so much!  it's my favorite new series since Netflix's zombie series ""Kingdom"" and it's infinitely better (imo) than the recently released Netflix S. Korean series ""Hellbound"" (which i was excited for but was ultimately very disappointed with).  i'm not sure if it's Song Kang or not but i read articles saying that Song or one of the main cast had to report for actual military service in S. Korea.  

i'm just about to start ""Bulgasal: Immortal Souls"" which stars one of the main actors from ""Sweet Home"".  it looks pretty good!"
Sweet Home,"The webtoon is **SO** good, how could the show treat Wook like that?!"
Sweet Home,Any relation to the movie/NES game?
Sweet Home,"ChenWei91, i too thought that they had already started filming.  i'm a bit bummed they haven't but i'm so happy that we definitely are getting a 2nd season of this awesome series!"
Sweet Home,"I haven't seen it fully but watched parts of it with my sister. 

But Imagine Dragons make awful generic music, between this and Arcane, it's like they hit gold with Radioactive and regurgitated the sameish song every few years for OSTs."
Sweet Home,My wife and I are HUGE fans of the webtoon. This show was utter garbage. We will not be watching this if there is a season 2
Sweet Home,"Gipsy, i can respect the fact you didn't end up liking the show but why hope season 2 doesn't happen? you could just not watch it and be happy for those (like myself) who LOVED season 1.

just sayin'.

i do agree w/ you 1000000000% though regarding the annoying Imagine Dragons song though! LOL."
Sweet Home,"Alice is borderland is a Japanese show and season 2 is coming 2022. It‚Äôs up to Netflix whether they want season 2 for extracurricular or not. It‚Äôs not decided yet. And for uncanny counter, it‚Äôs up to tvn. I don‚Äôt think season 2 will come out but let‚Äôs see. For sweet home, as long as they come out with a decent season 2. I don‚Äôt care how long i need to wait. I guess it will come out in 2023."
Sweet Home,"I couldn't agree more. The webtoon just had so much more dramatic weight and developed characters and and sad moments and no point did I feel the same types of emotions watching the show that I felt reading the webtoon just so much more drama there that was just not translated at all. And could they please stop using that same fucking imagine dragons song every goddamn episode, every time it started playing I just kept thinking of League of Legends and I was like ""what is happening""."
Sweet Home,The famicom game/ original movie is the only frame of reference I have for sweet home
Sweet Home,"It might be too hopeful / irrational to think this way but I'd rather for the live action adaptation to end here, the producers learn some lessons on the mistakes of this adaptation, and hopefully by ending it now it will lessen the amount of time I'm waiting for a potential proper adaptation to happen in the future, if they decide to try again. 

Also If you like to show as much as you say I don't know if you've read it but you should definitely check out the webtoon because it's the show but just so much better. Like, for example, in the webtoon one of the characters plays the guitar and she's constantly strumming and practicing the guitar with her own original song as a way to cope. The final chapter, if you read it on the webtoon app, plays that song as you scroll down and it's very emotional and really cool and I've never experienced something like it before. That song has absolutely no appearance in the show unfortunately. But the webtoon both from a narrative perspective and art style  perspective is constantly doing clever things like that n the show could have capitalized on those ideas but didn't."
Sweet Home,I just read an article that uncanny counter season 2 is happening but no idea when. Another article said Alice is coming Dec 2022 - a full 2 years after season 1 so that sucks. I really hope we get a season 2 of extracurricular. That show was a nice surprise!
Sweet Home,"I did a quick Wikipedia browse on the subject, looks like the name and the fact that they're both horror are the only correlations"
Sweet Home,"Well, uncanny counter season 2 was confirmed in early 2021 but since the main character, somun had a scandal related to his past behavior in the middle school, the cast is not decided yet and they are even sure if they are going to do season 2 or not. Everything is not decided yet. Meanwhile, you could watch Korean netflix drama, D.P. Season 2 is decided and they are working on it officially confirmed by Netflix."
Sweet Home,Damn that sucks to hear. I will look into DP. Thank you!
Sweet Home,"I pretty much agree with all of your observations. It's silly but addictive apocalypse entertainment, not entirely unlike *Alice in Borderland* from a few weeks ago. The quality drops indeed around the halfway mark, but by then you're probably already invested enough to just let the drama play out.

As for the source material, IIRC *Sweet Home* is like the OG of survival horror games...?"
Sweet Home,"Yeah, the start of the show was pretty good, the first half had a lot of potential. The CGI is extremely weak though. Three monsters get a lot of love from the digital artist, and the rest, that make a huge number of the cgi characters really don't.

The second half it just falls apart. Too many characters doing too many things at once.

The acting is pretty good mostly, but again, too many characters and it starts to show the actors weaknesses. I think certain characters got too much screen time over others. The show makes a point that Hyun-soo is the lead, yet he's barely present.

One of the Female leads, Ji-soo, is VERY good. Very easy to follow in the show.

The show offers something very unique, but it falls flat very quickly. That feel of isolation, paranoia of infection, and need to survive really drives a solid point for the season. And then they solve those problems.

I didn't like the Firefighters storyline, Yi-kyeong. I cared so little for her that I forgot she even existed.

The Military storyline was also a drag as well. That could have worked for a second season, offering this season more mystery to keep people wondering. And then I think it's episode 6? they fucking reveal the whole fucking lot of it just like that.

Hyun-soo's internal struggle isn't that interesting either. It feels unjustified for how his story ended, in a very Attack on Titan way. That was very disappointing.

Now I am a Webtoon reader and I REALLY enjoyed this Webtoon, but of course I expected some changes. Few of the changes aren't so bad. Eun-yoo was aged up from 10 to.... 20? and seemed to have taken Yuri's spot for that first half of the season. The aging change was surprising, but her character changes were welcome. She's actually quite funny, and not annoying.

The extra unnamed survivors add more to the dialogue and struggles and actually get screen time to flesh them out, rather than give them background stories before their deaths.

I am both glad and disappointed we didn't get to see the ""Face Monster"".

Again, as a fan of the Webtoon, I have to say, most of the characters were cast perfectly.

Han Du-sik, the man in the Wheelchair, man I love him in the Webtoon. I love the actors portrayal and presence in this show. He's awesome.

Sang-wook, the gangster guy, again very awesome in the Webtoon, and the actor plays him perfectly in this show.

I probably wouldn't come back for a second season, but the show handled the concept very well. The show was stated to be an adaption of the story, not a direct retelling of the original story.

A shame, but expected.


IMO 


**Strengths**; 

- Great Cast

- Great portrayals of characters

- Great tension building

- Great environment

- Awesome main Plot drive

- Good monster designs

- Good music

**Weaknesses**; 

- Terrible cgi

- Too many side stories

- Monsters aren't treated as being serious threats

- As a fan of the Original story, some of the changes in characters aren't very welcome

- The new character adds very little to the plot, as they are not heavily involved in the building story

- The Military storyline is extremely weak, and ruins the element of surprise

- The Inmates were hilarious. When they weren't trying to be

- The ending was not good."
Sweet Home,"Producers: We need a song for the action scene

Music Supervisor: I got you fam.

WE ARE THE WARRIORS THAT BUILT THIS TOWN

Havent read the ""webtoon"" or whatever, but the first half of the show is great. Fantastic even. The monster effects are the real star in the first half. I like the stop motion effect they used. It was almost claymation like so it gave monsters like the half head guy a really uncanny valley effect thats super creepy and very very fresh. And if I wanted to continue thats what was gonna keep me going. But then around episode 6 and 7 is when they lost me and the anime shit starts creeping in. 

Some of the characters were great. The old guy in the wheel chair, the gangster guy who gave oldboy vibes in every shot hes in, and the girl with the bat, and the firefighter lady. But the second half of the show is just pure CW pulp. Absolutely obnoxious to the point where I kinda wanted to turn it off, but I was that far so I might as well make it. And whaddya know, its another Walking Dead show. Not interesting. Thank you. Wont see you next season.

They had a chance to tell a really interesting sociological story about people in an apartment building attempting to build a new society out of the rubble the apocalypse. The characters were there. The setting was there. The conflicts and emotional work was there. But now they gotta do all the military experiments, the power anime stuff where the kids turns out to be humanities only chance at killing the monsters, and heel turns. And quite frankly, in the beginning the monsters were like really terrifying shit, but as the series goes on and the logic of what they are and how they work becomes explained it just becomes a confused mess. And I wish they just kept it simpler instead of trying to re-engineer the walking dead for Korea. 

Like the one interesting thing that could have been an episode in of itself was when the kid met the green goo monster. It's brushed under the run in a total of like 5 minutes of on screen time and out side of the main kid this is really the first time we see a ""nice monster,"" cause the other guy is wearing an anime hood and is so clearly evil he might as well have a big neon sign that says ""EVIL."" But nope. Flamethrower him goodbye. So a moment where you can have actual build up, character work about the child and its relationship to this green goo monster and how everyone feels about it is only an afterthought.

So my point is...they gotta fix this shit."
Sweet Home,The deviations from the webtoon were questionable lol. Some of the characters were cardboard cutouts compared to their non live counterparts
Sweet Home,"Honestly, I would really suggest giving the source material a read. While I can see that many people most likely would enjoy the Netflix series if they haven‚Äôt read it I admittedly walked away from watching it feeling like ‚Äúlook what they did to my boy‚Äù lmao. Many other commenters already have summed up reasons that it wasn‚Äôt quite up to par with the original but I‚Äôll add a few I haven‚Äôt seen yet.

Hyun-soo wasn‚Äôt given a notable personality. We see a lot of him in the webtoon obviously, because he is the main character, but even with the way it was directed in this series him continuously remaining how he was at the beginning(numb and cold) aside from small spurts of emotion when it was required for an important scene, and then returning to emotionless eddy immediately afterward was an issue for his character portrayal. Doing this also forced them to remove important dialogue integral to his characters experience. Of course that brings me to the fact that it‚Äôs most likely because they locked him in a room most of the time, and decided to change his love interest. Losing the connection with Ji-Soo, who‚Äôs character personality also felt off as well was a huge blow to his personal development as well as hers. Another aspect of this was taking away that the kid was an otaku, and she looked like a character he loved. It was a small thing but it binds three characters in an indirect yet important way. Why omit it?

Obviously the addition of most of the extra cast members was unnecessary, in my personal opinion. I question if adding the military was a political statement, or if it‚Äôs because Netflix has this problem where it constantly has to make things grittier than the original nowadays. Only good added cast member was Bom, A+ acting and usefulness. 

(SPOILERS)The incorrect deaths. Listen. Two of those characters were supposed to make it to the end. And two of them were supposed to die in a valiant sacrifice, changing a persons view on what a human is able to do when in the face of danger. And then the ache of one of them coming back as a monster...Justice wasn‚Äôt given and I‚Äôm salty. 

As an added middle finger, they choose to not include two humans I enjoyed. They were both magnificent examples to the reader of how humans can truly adapt and change, eventually. If they truly, honestly wish for it. And it isn‚Äôt something that will happen with a monsters wish, it‚Äôs something that will happen with your own will power and not taking any easy way out. I understand time constraints and the worry of not getting a second season but all the same, I feel like they were counting on the likelihood of it not happening with this lazy, standard plot in comparison. I‚Äôm not expecting an exact replication here either, but when it‚Äôs something that impacted all of the characters? C‚Äômon. (SPOILERS END)

I‚Äôll end this here since it‚Äôs getting long, even if my grievances go on, but. Overall, I just feel like the Netflix adaption doesn‚Äôt live up to the hype of what it could have been. It wasn‚Äôt completely terrible but I am disappointed that their ‚Äúartistic licenses‚Äù turned the series into something so substandard and far from the original that rather than a ‚ÄòSweet Home‚Äô, this adaption became a ‚ÄòSalty Home‚Äô."
Sweet Home,"I was honestly hyped for this series. I loved the webtoon and the characters in it. So when watching this it kinda left me short. The monsters were cool and the setting had a lerfect vibe that captured the essence of the building in the webtoon. However, I think they changed the plot too much to the point of it not even relating to it's inspiration. 

The drama didn't develop relationships as much as the webtoon did. In the webtoon, hyun and everyone else bonded over the moments they had together, the drama had none of it since most of the episodes, we had hyun locked up. And I especially hated that they made Eunyoo the love interest‚Äîshe was a lovely kid in the webtoon, honestly, and they took away Jisu's role. 

Jisu is supposed to be the strong female lead but all I see is her bashing the monsters head, we don't get to see the interturmoil the characters feel when facing them. We just get to see them fighting monsters, the psychological part mostly gone.

And hyun is basically a side character! They cut up so many parts of his development for a character not even in the webtoon! 

It's honestly so illogical that the baby of the firefighter is still alive, she's been dumo and thrown so many times, plus the stress of the situation. Those are bad signs for pregnant women.

Anyways, sorry for the rant. I just really hated how the plot went, atleast the visuals were kinda cool and all"
Sweet Home,"I really liked it. I did feel like they stopped using monsters too early in, and didn't make the human monsters monsterous enough until the finale. Like, is sexy black eyes supposed to scare me? I felt a real dread as the finale approached, and I commend them for not fearing killing off a lot of characters. Towards the end, I really felt the impact of those deaths, and I'm really excited to see where next season goes. I do feel like the main character didn't have much of a personality beyond being a protector and pushover, which made it kind of hard to relate to him. I did feel like this would have been wayyyyyy better as an anime. Would have been easier to make the monsters look good, and the anime tropes wouldn't have been as jarring or out of place. 

&#x200B;

Also, as much as I love Imagine Dragons, they overused the song far too much. First and last ep only would have sufficed."
Sweet Home,I wanted to like it but the writing is soo bad. Not a single character acted like a real person.
Sweet Home,"I have just one problem with the show, I‚Äôm my opinion the sword guy died by the worst monster. Like they couldn‚Äôt make a cooler monster to kill him with?"
Sweet Home,"ZukoTheDoggy i agree w/ pretty much everything you wrote.  i liked this tv series very much! it reminded me of DAWN OF THE DEAD.  it definitely had a problem with jarring/poor editing and missing/confusing scenes like when the girl with asthma fell down in front of the old man then suddenly she was at a different place in the very next scene...or

the scene (i forget which ep.) where lead male guy is in the stairwell and suddenly is he's VIOLENTLY pushed(?) or trips(?) over the railing falling several floors....that scene was so bizarre because one minute he's calm and just heading down the stairs and BAAM!! the next second it's like he's been catapulted over the stairwell railing...or

the other one that comes to mind is when fire/rescue woman is spun up in the spider creature's web. one second she's hanging upside down and fully trapped in the creature's cocoon and then BAAM! suddenly she magically managed to get out of said cocoon and is making her escape from the creature's lair.

there's several more instances like that but you get my point. LOL. again, i DO like this series a lot and i hope we get a 2nd season!"
Sweet Home,Im at episode 6 and I really enjoy it so far. Super fun to watch.
Sweet Home,"Was excited by the first half since it followed the webtoons but they trashed the second half just so Netflix could hopefully get a second season. The webtoons is better, doesnt have the unnecessary nonsense in the show and develops the monsters just as much as the characters."
Sweet Home,Lee Eun is so damm annoying I just skip whenever the character is on screen lol
Sweet Home,"I was severely disappointed in this series.  It really wasn't that loyal to the webtoon. I couldn't watch more then 2 1/2 episodes. I was so confused on how this happened,  i never really felt dread or thrill like I do with the manga. I don't really feel attached to any of the characters and wtf is going on with the mafia guy? What the hell happened to the tank goodfella??!? 

They should just give us an anime adaptation.... i would totally love that..."
Sweet Home,"SPOILER****‚ÄîFirst half was great. It had a lot of potential but felt very weak during the second half. They killed off all the interesting characters, leaving only the weak ones left. Prob wouldn‚Äôt come back for another season. Literally the best characters all die. The grandpa, swords guy, gangster, nurse, mechanic literally was what kept me watching."
Sweet Home,"The show was solid but I think they killed most of the interesting characters on the last episode. The Gangster and the Nurse couldve atleast survived, give their relationship more time to grow of theyre plannig a second season. Leader didnt have to die to be honest. Weelchair dude couldve been the emotional last episode death."
Sweet Home,"I was disappointed by the final episode. I was hoping to see Cha go ""super sayain"""
Sweet Home,WE ARE THE WARRIORS THAT BUILT THIS TOWNNNNNNNNNNNNN
Sweet Home,"This show is a fancier The Walking Dead drama that instead has asians killing black-magic monsters/zombies and plays ""imagine dragon - Warriors"" the entire season.

Directors - Why do we play this song so much?
Budgeters - We used 1/4 of our budget on the song sir."
Sweet Home,check out /r/SweetHome
Sweet Home,"I really enjoyed actually, its slow as in places but when the action kicks off it really kicks off.. The monsters looked great to me and has a real Silent Hill feel. Some of the characters are down right painful though and the main guys emo never seems to end.. I hope he finally gets his shit together in season 2.

That said i never watched or read the comics. So for me i came into it fresh and enjoyed the show.."
Sweet Home,"Do you all know what song was on episode 2, not technically a song but it sounded like an OST from either an anime or video game, the part where the beast head was sliced in 2 and he got up and this track started playing.

It has been bugging me as I have been trying to pinpoint where I have heard of it before.

TIA.

EDIT: I figured it out, the song is Jecht's from Final Fantasy X or at least the beginning guitar riffs."
Sweet Home,What happened to the guitarist
Sweet Home,Korean shows suck and this proves it. B-rate shit.
Sweet Home,"So, I watched Alice in Borderland a while back and enjoyes it pretty well. Then this popped up. First couple episodes really held my attention then just didn't. 

I see most of you have the same complaints. Random time jumps. No explanations of a lot of things and events.

My gripe is I want to see more monsters. Maybe its just me but I found it hard to connect with any of the characters, and after awhile there was no evident main character anymore. Like for example, in The Walking Dead, the main character is/was Rick Grimes (yes it has a whole cast but the over all was Rick. With Sweet home my perceived main character started getting less screen time, shitty character development and so on.

But due to the first couple episodes I was expecting a monster filled insanity fest. But instead slowly got a Drama with an occasional scattering of monsters. They had 12 episodes to work with. Yes I'm aware there is source material, but damn. They got monsters and resources in the floors above. But never make/show a real effort in clearing the building. In a situation like the the ground floor is a shit defensible position. Mr. PROTEIN, could have smashed down the walls at anytime and had a buffet.

I dunno, it felt like they just ran outta something midway through.

I am just ranting at this point.  There was potential there, but not now. 

Too much time on Drama. Not enough on monsters or actually explaining shit.

Did like the Doc though. Would like to see him in some US programs."
Sweet Home,"IMO, the CGI looks like it's from the 90's.  The acting is terrible and so is the show."
Sweet Home,"It's not too bad if you haven't read the webtoon.  But if you've read the webtoon, this is a skip."
Sweet Home,"Just finished watching. Really enjoyed it at the start but felt like a slog to finish.

&#x200B;

Not sure if there's some language / cultural barrier to the show but there were a lot of scenes that seemed to abruptly end without resolution. Like a character would be in a major bind or look like they're about to turn or something and then suddenly the scene ends and they're just in the next scene without explanation of what actually happened. There were quite a number of scenes I had to rewatch to make sense of as well. Like in the very first episode where the Firewoman jumps at the tongue monster, it was such a fast cut I had to rewatch it just to work out what even happened. Theres a scene a few episodes later where she seems to be in some kind of trouble but then the scene just ends and shes suddenly back with the group. I found it quite frustrating to watch at times.

&#x200B;

Also did they run of of CGI budget or something in this show? There were a lot of different and varied monsters in the first half which were all fairly well done and then in the second half, particularly the last few episodes there are hardly any. Even when they recreate that first scene with the soldiers at the end they don't even show all the monsters they'd shown at the start. With that scene being a great example of one that had no conclusion and the character suddenly appearing elsewhere without any real explanation.

&#x200B;

I didn't really like where the show went towards the end and it became a bit jumbled without much actually happening. I'll watch it if they release more episodes but I'm kinda feeling the show started as an 8/10 and ended as a 5/10 or 6/10."
Sweet Home,Watched it to scratch that monster / stephen king the mist itch. Came away kind of disappointed but still had fun overall.
Sweet Home,The smoking is pretty distracting and gratuitous.  It makes me never want to visit there.
Sweet Home,The first monster scene gave a heavy Killer Klown from Outer Space vibe. Ie absolute trash lol
Sweet Home,[deleted]
Sweet Home,I'm sorry if this has been asked before. I haven't watched the show yet. Does it have any relation to the capcom game of the same name ?
Sweet Home,"This series wasn‚Äôt perfect but I enjoyed it regardless, will watch second season for sure. The characters grew on me, I feel like too many of them died in the finale. It‚Äôs like, oops we forgot to kill him/her off, let‚Äôs just do it in the last episode.

What I don‚Äôt really understand is a lot of characters were often listening to earpiece (music?), even when they were exploring around the building when they need all the concentration they can get. Was that explained somewhere?"
Sweet Home,i wish this was a video game
Sweet Home,"My opinion of the series is highly positive given the fact that I get attached to male characters pretty easily and as a girl, I found Song Kang (Hyun-su) absolutely appealing (along with Eun-hyuk and Sang-wook of course) so that alone kept me going when the story slowed around the late halfway mark. I would've preferred if there was some backstory to each of the characters and some character development here and there as many characters, main or not, felt like the side players in this overall addictive series. 

It could be the pandemic might've decreased the movie production team's ability to bounce off ideas and editing of the scenes as South Korea was hit pretty hard at some points, so I wouldn't jump on the prognosis that this series needs more work. Of course, how the series compares to its original webtoon is another story as I've read some reviews that criticized the lack of similarities between the two, but as someone who doesn't read webtoons or any source materials of popular series, I can say that I was highly satisfied with the series. Hopefully the both amazed and disappointed crowd (and those in between) get to truly weigh in when season 2 is approved and disseminated in the future. No matter how well we criticize it, this is the first season after all and the production team will likely take the source material far more seriously, reflect on fans' opinions and inputs, and produce a version that will engage both audiences, the webtoon lovers and popular series watchers, at the same time. Hopefully we are able to rally for that season 2 if we would like to see improvements and updates that cater to our tastes."
Sweet Home,"Not sure what to say, I was really disappointed at how it finished but worst was the inexplicable change of tone when the other monster guy appeared.  I never knew how many days in it was , surely more than 15, food was important then not at all."
Sweet Home,"Yeah I was alright with the first 2 episodes and after that the departure from what the webtoon does was so fcuking strange to me.... I was okay with it and felt it was an alternate timeline almost but the ending and the monster that could shift between people was the biggest 'are you god damn serious' moment for me. 

Really wanted to see Hyun's black knight monster mode!"
Sweet Home,"i dropped this series after watching episode 1, I think its unwatchable for me the cgi is really terrible."
Sweet Home,"Yup. I was thinking the exact same thing to myself. Around episode 5 or so the scenese just seemed so dramatic with very little action. I felt like i was watching a 1940s sope oprah. I tried to give each episode another chance because the hook with all the effects was so good. Sadly, i couldnt do it. Such a shame."
Sweet Home,I cant believe I just wasted so much time watching this
Sweet Home,I have so many gripes with the adaptation and I think one of the biggest ones is that they added like 3 different staircases to go up and down the building.
Sweet Home,"I know what I'm about to say will not add much to discussion since I'm not great at elaborating.

The show was decent for its genre, I really liked the special effects they used. They seem to have used cgi only when they really needed it (which is a great technique in cinematography imo). I didn't like the dialogues so much but then again... maybe it's because I live on the other side of the globe and I do not understand how koreans talk to each other on a daily basis.

The ending of season 1 seemed like it could've used a little more work. They obviously just wanted to lay down the foundation for the next season.

One thing to note, which that explains why I'm not so hyped about the next season, is that the season 2 is going to diverge a lot from the ambience set by the first season since it's most likely gonna be an open world experience instead of the trap room. It's gonna feel like a different show."
Sweet Home,"This show finally made me realize what it feels like to be ""that guy"", but if you so much as even sorta enjoyed the first 5 or so episodes, I'd ignore the last half of the show and just read the webcomic. It's been done for a few months now and it's infinitely better.

Also, if you're in it for the monsters, there's a lot more in the webcomics, too (although this is probably a budget thing rather than an artistic choice)."
Sweet Home,"I agree with the sentiments of a few people in this thread. The first half of the show was great and had this comedic vibe to it. It wasn‚Äôt taking itself so serious. Then the second half, the drama went from a 15 to straight 100% all in. It was a little jarring the dramatic shift that was taken in the show. The sub stories were hard to keep up with or to care about at times. I will admit that I never read the web toon, but I just hated that every character that actually contributed to the group or had a story to them ended up dead. I feel like those that are left are all the filler characters."
Sweet Home,I quite liked it. The sentimental values are touching enough for me to keep me captivated throughout S1. Also ... Pyeon Sang Wook .. YUM. So. Fucking. Hot. Was thrilled to see him again in the final.
Sweet Home,Just came here to say I loved it.
Sweet Home,"I don‚Äôt know if I liked the addition of the firefighter and her story overall, but I did really like the scene where she was running from the spider monster, and I feel like that got forgotten about too quickly. I think the series needed more scenes like that and Hyun-Su‚Äôs missions upstairs, just individuals and small groups on short, action-oriented missions

I‚Äôll give season 2 a try if they make it, but whether that improves will decide if I go on to a season 3"
Sweet Home,"It was definitely fun. The monster were interesting, but the effects were pretty bad in my opinion. Some of the shots and color were really great. The use of green was constant in the earlier episodes. There are lots of fun and well done cliches, however, it ends up being pretty average. Like turn you brain off and have some fun type of show. Some of the editing and consistency don't really make sense and it feels like the show writers didn't give much respect to viewer intelligence adding necessary lines. For example the protagonist says something like I wanna kill myself out loud before the next shot of him standing on a ledge. We would already know he was suicidal without him saying it. It dismisses the classic show don't tell rule. Overall, it was definitely fun. 6/10"
Sweet Home,I watched the dubbed version and maybe some things were lost to me because of that but the plot was all over the place and I still can‚Äôt figure out what is going on. The first few episodes I really enjoyed but it got a little long when they moved off the monster angle. It did have some badass looking monsters though
Sweet Home,"The sound track is a miss, seem to be a issue on the sound producer problem. This really ruin the mood of the show, the final thing that axe the show was CGI. Seem visual effects isn't a main concern, which will always put it as 2nd rate. The good thing we're character and concepts. It's really unbearable to watch when the problem is audio and visual."
Sweet Home,"Same premise as Gantz, no?"
Sweet Home,Shit fell off hard.  Dont understand why they couldn't stick to the source material.
Sweet Home,I like shows with a closed setting. It makes the show feel isolated and adds to the scare factor. I liked the monster designs throughout the show. Overall it was pretty good. I'd give it a 9/10.
Sweet Home,"Anybody could explain after hyun soo was pushed down the stairs by the sprinter monster, how did jisoo and jaeheon escaped?"
Sweet Home,"Okay so here's my opinion on the series first of all they added new characters like the soldier and the fire fighter woman,etc 

Second they changed some of the stories on the webtoon like Wook Pyeon being an ex criminal and having a burn mark on his face instead of being a cop and they made jayhun have a romantic feelings for jisu and last is making pyeon and yuri pass away .
 
And in the adaption jisu didn't feel like the main girl and she didn't had much screen time with hyun and they actually made as feel like eun lee is the main girl for hyun. And speaking of hyun lee they made her adoptive and arrogant which has nothing in common on the webtoon version.

They made ihyun a major villain tho he was supposed to be a split personality dude but in the Netflix version they just made him a psychopath and made hyun's monster form have spike wings instead of knight form.

It made me sad that they didn't follow the story line on the webtoon but they will have a second season so i hope it makes up for the epilogue of the final episode of the webtoon version

Everything's good to be honest the visual effects, cgi and music are good but they overused the imagine dragons music tho

I'll give this adaption a 7.5/10 they did good and hope the do better on the second season"
Sweet Home,"I am in the middle of watching it now, I‚Äôm enjoying it! I love creature features and splattergore movies! Bring on the crazy looking monsters and blood! 
The CGI ruins it for me though, it makes the monsters look too fake, it takes the tension away, imagine how good this could have been with old school special effects like in The Thing!"
Sweet Home,If you already have a good story in the weebtoon why dont you just use it with little edits you dont need anything more but no you make new story and want to copy somethings from the weebtoon 90% of the movies created from the weebstoons or comics became a wierd and big miss
Sweet Home,Lol compared to the webtoon they turned Eun Lee into such a fucking bitch in here
Sweet Home,Does anyone know where that silver suitcase/bag is coming from and why she gave it to the female soldier?
Sweet Home,"So it looks like I'm not the only one here, just to reiterate the show strayed from the source material to the point i don't a satellite could find that shit, I lived the webtoon it was amazing sadly the show only followed the plot for all of like 7 chapters then it just shit the bed, it removed story elements and tries to sexualize the characters for no reason. All in all I hated it the CGI made the monsters look not comedic than anything which is sad because I've seen better effects from make-up artist's you'd think with a computer you'd have far better effects since you can make literally anything."
Sweet Home,"I'm laughing my ass off watching the first episode, just because the English voiceovers are reminding me of the French Canadian version of Cheech and Chong movies. (our localized version is a classic here though) I guess it's because the recorded voices don't feel mixed with the scene environment, they really sound 'over' the movie. Guess I ll give it a chance

Were you people watching it in Korean with subtitles ?
I'm surprised no one mentioned the dry VO."
Sweet Home,Man...well I'm halfway through and I'm getting hella confused about stuff in it. It's very frustrating. It seems like it hops around timewise without prompt sometimes. I kinda vaguely browsed the section so as not to get hit by spoilers. I had seen some ppl post about alice in borderland maybe I'll try that next.
Diamond City,"Oh man, Magic City! I remember this one, it's a product of a curious time - when Prestige TV canon was being codified, and every hit TV show spawned clones that tried to ride its coattails but ultimately were all forgotten. That sounds harsher than what I mean to say btw, these shows weren't all bad but we're all destined to be in the shadows of their far superior inspiration shows. Magic City, Astronaut Wives Club, Pan Am - all owe their existence to Mad Men."
Diamond City,Amazing series to this day I just pray they some how bring it back! Almost a decade later talks of a movie never materialize neither.
Diamond City,"Anytime I see John Larroquette in a role, without even realizing it, I'm comparing that role to Dan Fielding."
Diamond City,My favorite episode is when the guy bought the Brooklyn Bridge from the City.

Diamond City,I can't wait for my VCR to get fixed so I can finally watch my Night Court tape.
Diamond City,"the theme song is now in my head

did it actually have an ending? i"
Diamond City,"Night Court was a brilliant series. When it aired after Cheers, Family Ties and The Cosby Show, there was not a better Must See TV lineup on NBC."
Diamond City,Why is it not in reruns? 
Diamond City,"I loved that show.  It was to funny, and John Larroquette deserved every Emmy he won for playing Dan Fielding.  "
Diamond City,"I love Dan Fielding. And when the A story was about Dan, I knew I was in for a good time (""Dan's Boss""; ""Dan's Parents""; ""Giving Thanks""; ""Dan, the Walking Time Bomb""; ""A Guy Named Phantom""; ""The Talk Show"")."
Diamond City,"Along those same lines, no matter what else I see him, Richard Moll will always be Bull. "
Diamond City,"Mine was ""Dan's Boss."" Vinnie the Pooh....I laughed so hard."
Diamond City,"There are so many episodes, I don't think I have a favorite. I would like to rewatch the show by pulling out some of the recurring characters like Buddy and Yakov and watching just those episodes in order.

I think the ""Her Honor"" four-parter is close to my favorite. It's also written by Linwood Boomer, who would go on to create *That '70s Show*

I also love the handful of bottle episodes that are just about rushing through cases. Minuscule overarching plot but some great gags."
Diamond City,"The series finale? It was a finale but was really surreal and bizarre, even for *Night Court*. It kind of showed that the gang was breaking up but their actions in the final act didn't mesh with the rest of the show.

The disappointing finale was the reason Kenneth Parcell (*30 Rock*) wanted to get the cast back together to do a proper series finale."
Diamond City,"It is but is limited. It airs weekdays on Encore Classic (alongside *Murphy Brown* and *Magnum, P.I.*. Uncut and commercial free."
Diamond City,"I loved Phil.. especially when they revealed how rich he was, how the ""New York Harmonic Orchestra"" was renamed the Philharmonic Orchestra because of his donations."
Diamond City,The real star of the show.
Diamond City,"Oh man Dan's Boss... what an episode
"
Diamond City,Definitely his defining role.
Diamond City,I was laughing hard enough I had to hit the pause button.
Schulz Saves America,Why was this show ever marketed to kids? Its the creepiest thing ever.
Schulz Saves America,"I miss the hell out of this show. Not the Adult Cartoon Party though, that one can stay cancelled..."
Schulz Saves America,Billy west did most of the voices on this show. 
Schulz Saves America,shame the creator is a complete ass.
Schulz Saves America,How did this air on Nick?
Schulz Saves America,I might have been the only kid who absolutely despised this show.
Schulz Saves America,It was controversial as it aired. Also probably the single most influential animated series from the 90s along with The Simpsons. It's batshit insanity was groundbreaking at the time. Nickelodeon was trying out original programming at the time and had nothing to lose.
Schulz Saves America,Because kids born when I was are the best...obviously. 
Schulz Saves America,greatest kids show of all time
Schulz Saves America,I mean..when i was a kid a creepy cartoon = at least 30 mins of divided attention but i was born in 1991 so..
Schulz Saves America,Society still had its balls at that point.
Schulz Saves America,Adult Party Cartoon was absolute garbage. It was just being edgy for the sake of being edgy. I don‚Äôt know why they thought the show was a good idea.
Schulz Saves America,Agreed.
Schulz Saves America,SHAMPOOO MANNN
Schulz Saves America,Including Ren after they fired the show's creator :/
Schulz Saves America,did he ever deliver on that kickstarter?
Schulz Saves America,The 90s.
Schulz Saves America,It was a different time. Nick prided itself on being ‚Äúedgy‚Äù or as edgy as a network targeted towards kids could be. Ren & Stimpy was controversial enough that it was relegated to Snick on Saturday nights though.
Schulz Saves America,Rocko's Modern Life and Ren and Stimpy might be my top 2 cartoons of all time
Schulz Saves America,"Taking a look at your post history, it‚Äôs super sad how much of your time is spent on hate. Hope you figure out what makes you such an angry person"

Schulz Saves America,Rockos Modern Life had some DARK and extremely sexual episodes. The gym episode had a panning shot where a dudes arms are ripped off by his bench press and the bar falls onto his neck and he starts suffocating as the camera pans over him. Heffer got milked to orgasm. Shit was wild. 
Schulz Saves America,"I'm super excited for the new Rocko's Modern Life special, Static Cling!"

Schulz Saves America,"TV was cheaper, they had less time to prep, they pumped out 20+ episodes a year. It was more disposable and less lucrative for the actors. All that means it's going to be viewed as lesser."
Schulz Saves America,[deleted]
Schulz Saves America,"I‚Äôm not going to read all that, but the primary reason tv work once hindered an actor‚Äôs ability to work in movies is that tv requires the actor working specifically on that job for 8-9 months. That‚Äôs still the case for regulars in these high budget fantasy shows. It‚Äôs kind of hard to get into movies when you‚Äôve got 2-3 months available to shoot and films take anywhere between 2-6 months to shoot on average."
Schulz Saves America,"I‚Äôm not going to read your whole post, because you wrote an essay instead of asking a question, but here you go:

Tom Hanks was a television star, even though the show he had a lead role in only lasted two seasons.

Bruce Willis was a massive television star.

Michael J. Fox was a television star.

There were a bunch of television stars who made the jump to movies because when movies were star driven, the money in movies was much better.

The people who stayed in television had no movie star power, which back then was defined by the ability to get people in the theatre in the first extended weekend.

So the answer is simple, many television stars became movie stars, and did not go back to television because back then, movies paid better."
Schulz Saves America,"As a rule, the US didn't just treat TV acting as lesser, but the whole medium of television. It's kind of what Newton T. Minow was getting at with *Television and the Public Interest*; he had the belief that television had the *potential* to be brilliant, but that it was rarely exercised in the US, particularly after the death of the television play.

Meanwhile, as mentioned in one of the replies in your original post, in places with less commercial pressure, television could and often was treated with more seriousness and respect. For example, in the UK, the television play format persisted well into the 1980s, with some pretty big names involved such as Ken Loach, Dennis Potter, Nigel Kneale and No√´l Coward, but US audiences of the time might have found a formula where they were adapting scripts by Jean-Paul Sartre to be a bit stuffy.

Further afield, other European countries gave a certain amount of credence to highbrow directing on television; Germany had Rainer Werner Fassbinder with *Berlin Alexanderplatz*, Poland had Krzysztof Kie≈õlowski with *Dekalog* and Sweden had Ingmar Bergman with, among others, *Scenes from a Marriage* and *Fanny and Alexander*. As a result, I get the impression that there would have been less of a stigma around transitioning from television acting to the big screen.

I kind of feel that the perspective that *The Sopranos* invented quality television comes with a certain amount of cultural myopia when other countries were straight-up putting art cinema in a television form onto their screens, but it did have a big enough budget that it was hard to ignore. That said, one could assert that David Lynch was there first from a US perspective, transitioning from an already pretty notable cinematic directorial career into television."

Schulz Saves America,"The movies traditionally held higher prestige. But around the year 2000 CGI was just getting cheap and easy enough that it could be in any movie. That's why the era of superhero movies began around that time. Once CGI got cheap and easy, we were inevitably going to be given lazy movies about people with superpowers that took the form of CGI. We've always had lazy movies, but ubiquitous CGI shifted the balance. 

So cinema got shallower, lost its prestige, and lost its status as being above television. Television filled the vacuum of substantive storytelling."
Schulz Saves America,"In the US. When you sign up for a show you sign up for 7 seasons of a show. Because the TV studios own you for this period of time, it can definitely effect the career of a rising star or a movie star would be reluctant to go back to being shackled to a such a long contract.

Michael J Fox is one such example, the producers wanted him but they couldn‚Äôt get him because he was contractually obligated to Family Ties. It wasn‚Äôt until later they could get him. 

Pierce Bronson was offered Dalton‚Äôs James Bond but also couldn‚Äôt take the role because he was on Remington Steele at the time.

Even with these limitations there are a plenty of people that went on the great success after being on TV back in the 80s. 

Will Smith is probably the biggest example of someone that got super star fame and awards. 

The difference you are seeing now is that an actor can go to television and back because the contracts of many cable or streaming series doesn‚Äôt require the massive 7 year contracts that are required of older network shows."
Schulz Saves America,I love when I come across Robert Redford or Clint Eastwood in their early days.  Redford was the best Angel of Death Ever (Twilight Zone).

Schulz Saves America,"If you like the podcast, you‚Äôll probably like the show. I‚Äôm not sure how well it stands on it‚Äôs own for the average viewer though. They‚Äôre basically filming a podcast which isn‚Äôt terribly exciting unless you are already a fan. "
Schulz Saves America,Not every successful podcast needs to become a tv show.
Schulz Saves America,"Not really a review, more of a show recap."
Schulz Saves America,"I liked it. Pod Save America is one of my favorite podcasts and it was nice to be able to watch a live show instead of just listening to it.

I can‚Äôt wait for Beto next week. "
Schulz Saves America,"This show has potential, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be realized at all. As others have mentioned, not only here but in other reviews as well, it is just the same as the podcast. I think they‚Äôd be better served doing more interviews rather than having the four of them talking as they usually do. Otherwise there‚Äôs going to be no difference between watching this and listening to the pod. In fact, I‚Äôd prefer listening to the pod since I can at least up the speed. "
Schulz Saves America,"This might be un-popular, but to me, it didn‚Äôt really work. 

Besides the quick scene edits that cut out a lot of the hosts and audiences reactions, I thought it was just an echo-chamber of already-known popular leftist opinions, that were overgeneralized without much deep thought. 

I‚Äôm democrat myself, but I‚Äôve heard almost every opinion they stated before, and some of the ‚Äòcomedy‚Äô came off as straight cringe. Also, the misplacement of cuss-words that were used to emphasize their generalized statements were also cringy. Like, ‚Äúinsert commonly accepted leftist opinion here... *fuck*.‚Äù ...audience goes nuts.

"
Schulz Saves America,"I really fucking hate when podcasts do live shows (if they are normally made in studio). It changes the whole dynamic from ""lets have a conversation"" to ""lets say shit to make people cheer"". Made it through about 10 minutes of them pandering to the audience and gave up. "
Schulz Saves America,"I really wish there was some more diversity of thought. They dont necessarily need a right-winger on, but at least some   counter/alternative viewpoints. It sounds far too much like an agreement echo chamber. 

Even Erin Ryan, the one female amongst 4 men, was drowned out for the majority of the show. A person of color also might help. "
Schulz Saves America,Loads of lefties moaning about Trump. 
Schulz Saves America,"Yeah, I don't listen to the podcast, but I decided to give the show a shot because I usually enjoy anything HBO puts out, but I just couldn't get into it. It wasn't bad, I just got kind of bored with it. I could just be tired of politics in general, but I probably won't be watching again."
Schulz Saves America,"It's only a 4 episode run, which I think is good for a try, but I agree. "
Schulz Saves America,"Out of curiosity which others have? I'm only asking because the only other one I personally listen to which got close was the Ringer Game of Thrones pod which was vaguely related to HBO's after show at one point.

If this is successful though a few political podcasts will try. The 538 political show panel I would bet would get something on some ABC property if there is a market for it"
Schulz Saves America,"In fact, successful podcasts usually get a lot worse when they become a live show."
Schulz Saves America,[deleted]
Schulz Saves America,"yeah it sucked. I listen to the podcast on my commute (and skip through the more cringeworthy segments and all the terrible ad-spots) and it vacillates between ""mildly interesting guest or discussion"" to ""aggravating smug centrist bullshit/HRC apologia"".

the HBO show was just that with terrible editing and no concessions to the visual medium. it really embodied the worst of self-congratulatory circlejerk centrism"
Schulz Saves America,"Yup, the reason Pod Save works is because it's the thing i listen to on interminable morning commutes, and these guys are charismatic enough to make current affairs interesting. However, I'm not gonna sit down specifically to watch it, not if there's something else I'd rather be doing."

Schulz Saves America,iPhones go up to 2X and Spotify goes to up to 3X. 
Schulz Saves America,"Well, when I've already been informed by hearing the information over and over all week, then, yes, it's boring to watch it rehashed by a bunch of people sitting on a stage talking to each other about it.



Also, it's affects, not effects."
Schulz Saves America,"I legitimately believe that Pod Save America is just an awful podcast. It toes the safest liberal lines (read basic and flawed) and doesn‚Äôt take any risks at all. 

I‚Äôd rather watch Chapo Trap House be given something to this "
Schulz Saves America,affects*
Schulz Saves America,"And to be fair, the news cycle is 24 hours and often events get resolved in a few days - so why do we need a new news show covering what essentially are stories that are already resolved? If you're not reporting the news as it happens, you're behind. Maybe a daily format would be better. We can look to John Oliver and Bill Maher doing successful weekly re-caps, but what is this show really adding to the conversation? "
Schulz Saves America,"Hearing the information? what information are you hearing that they are talking about? 

effect: a change that is a result or consequence of an action or other cause.

You insulted me on top of not understanding this. Maybe T_D can come and help you because this is sad."
Schulz Saves America,"Well to be fair, i‚Äôm pretty sure they tape these HBO episodes the day before they air (aside from a few pre-taped segments). So the topics they discuss should be about as up to date as anyone else discussing it. Sure they won‚Äôt be discussing the stories in real time as they are unfolding like you would see on CNN or other news networks but that‚Äôs not what the Pod Saves team has ever been about. The point of their shows is to discuss the important topics after most of the facts have come out and everyone has had a chance to digest the story and form their own opinions on them.

It‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre only discussing news stories from last month or a few weeks ago. If the story is still relevant today then sure maybe they will touch on it, but it‚Äôs not like they filmed this show weeks ago and we‚Äôre only just getting to see it now "
Schulz Saves America,"Is it so hard to believe that people get their news from something other than an HBO show?  It's just a filmed podcast, I could see plenty of people who would prefer to listen to a podcast instead of watching one.  Not sure why you have to imply he's a  T_D poster just because he doesn't want to watch a podcast on HBO.

Also, /u/Gato1980  was right.  affect is the verb, effect is the noun, and he didn't insult you by correcting you."
Schulz Saves America,"What information? Everything they discussed in the episode. Politics in general. Information about the candidates running across the country, in my state, and in my district. I watch the news. I read newspapers. And, just to let you know I'm as far from T_D as you can imagine. I'm a gay liberal living in Brooklyn for fuck's sake. And I didn't insult you, I corrected your improper grammar, and your response is still wrong:
>effect: a change that is a result or consequence of an action or other cause.

You used the word as a verb, when it is a noun, which you stated in your reply. Effect: noun. Affect: verb."
Schulz Saves America,yes this is sad
Schulz Saves America,"It is not a show for ""getting news"" is this the talking point for people to insult it? They go through background on some candidates, the voting system, rules that cause some to be unable to vote as felons that other crimes do not get, explain door to door campaigning by going out and doing it, and more.

It is a series about the process of voting itself and behind the scenes of campaigns. Bringing up T\_D is because Obama staffers having a show is going to be prime attacks from very concerned independents that never talk about politics except to say they demand no discussion of politics anywhere and they are just tired of the most important part of your life being talked about.

Also I brought up T\_D because my vote count is quickly being downvoted "
Schulz Saves America,"You did not give one single example of something they did Friday night but you said you gave it a chance? I do not believe you. You keep talking in vague generalities like a student hiding they never read the book for a presentation. And the ""gay liberal living in Brooklyn"" is meaningless if the only problem you care about is that people just talk too much about politics everywhere not the crazy things going on that people should be educated about. It means your appeal to identity fallacy is another tactic to hide that you never gave it a chance and you came here to post negatively about it. Like I thought, the downvotes from the raid accounts have followed like I predicted."
Schulz Saves America,"I don‚Äôt think your comments are being downvoted by T_D posters. I‚Äôve never once posted there and I despise Trump.

I‚Äôm downvoting you because you‚Äôre kind of being a dick and all of your comments could easily be posted to r/cringe"
Schulz Saves America,">It is not a show for ""getting news"" is this the talking point for people to insult it?

I don't go by ""talking points"", I am going by what you have said in your comments, acting as if this show would be the only way to be informed or to obtain information on particular topics.

>It is a series about the process of voting itself and behind the scenes of campaigns.

Okay, and maybe they don't present it well?  You can agree with their politics and not like the show.  I have no opinion on the show myself, I have yet to see it, but the ads for it didn't look too appealing.  I'll probably give it a watch sometime soon though, one episode at the very least.  

>Bringing up T_D is because Obama staffers having a show is going to be prime attacks from very concerned independents that never talk about politics except to say they demand no discussion of politics anywhere and they are just tired of the most important part of your life being talked about. 

/u/Gato1980 made a very innocuous statement and you seem to be reaching quite far by labeling him as T_D poster based on a couple comments.

>Also I brought up T_D because my vote count is quickly being downvoted

Gee, I wonder why...

"
Schulz Saves America,"For the record, I'm a registered Democrat who has volunteered for a local candidate. I downvoted you for being a dick. "
Schulz Saves America,"Okay, here you go, but this is the last time I‚Äôm responding to you because it‚Äôs just weird that you care so much about whether or not I watched this show. I was going to maybe give it another chance, but you‚Äôve killed that chance for me.

1) The GOP tactic for playing the victim. This is news? I think we all know this and have known this for quite some while. It has been extensively reported on during the entire Kavanaugh confirmation.

2) The Kanye West meeting in the Oval Office. This was aired live across the country, so I‚Äôve already seen it.

3) The debate on health care and how Trump makes false statements and gives false information. Again, nothing new here. He‚Äôs been doing it for years.

4) Also, I just didn‚Äôt like the hosts. They all came off as preachy and entitled to me, and the one lady seemed to be there just to say ‚Äòfuck‚Äô every other word. I get it, she was trying to be edgy, but it just came off as awkward.

Anything else? Would you like a live-stream of me watching the program? I‚Äôm sorry but this was nothing special to me, I learned nothing new, and I didn‚Äôt care for the hosts."

Schulz Saves America,Yassssss
Schulz Saves America,"I'm as Liberal as they come, but I find the podcast to be unlistenable.

It's a couple dudes sitting in a room repeating the same basic conversation over and over again while furiously jacking eachother off. 

""Did you hear what Trump did?""

""Yeah!""

""Isn't that terrible?""

""Yeah!""

""Midterms?""

""Yeah!""

""Let's talk about why what Trump did is terrible!""

""*insert obvious, uninsightful take with a zinger that doesn't land*""

""Wow. Isn't that **terrible**?!""

""*I know!*""

**REPEAT**

It is almost self-parody. But people just eat that shit up and I don't get it. 

""Oh, it's my antidote to the current administration."" What? **How?** Even Morning Joe has more insightful discussions. Do you really need someone in your ear giving you no further insight than ""Hey, yeah, this Trump dude. He's the woooorst, right? Am I right, guys? Buy my t-shirt.""? 

There're ways of discussing current politics without beating a dead horse. You will not find any of them in Pod Save America."
Schulz Saves America,Eeeeeeew. Thanks I'll stick to listening to Chapo.
Schulz Saves America,I liked these guys when the podcast came out but I can't do the Trump talk
Schulz Saves America,"Vote republican.

But if someone wants to Primary Trump when the time comes, I would
be ok with that."
Schulz Saves America,Yep! I love all the work they do to get people voting and mobilizing support for down-ballot candidates but their podcasts are paint-by-numbers. The live shows in particular are insufferable because we get to hear exactly how funny they think they are...
Schulz Saves America,Aren't they all ex Obama staffers? It's just liberal anti Trump porn basically
Schulz Saves America,I think I‚Äôd rather stick a pencil in my ear. Their sub is some of the most cancerous shit I‚Äôve ever seen on Reddit. 
Schulz Saves America,"Damn dude, have some self respect. There are much better podcasts out there than that dogshit. "

Schulz Saves America,"Oof, your post history. "
Schulz Saves America,you seem like a total turd
Schulz Saves America,"I'd probably enjoy anti-Trump porn if it was done well. And it probably can be done well. It just has to be insightful and not a complete waste of my time. 

This is not even good porn, no matter how much they blow eachother over their side projects and how much work they did for the Obama admin. 

And everyone I talk to says ""I listen to the Pod every day. It's life changing."" Really? This?"

Schulz Saves America,"Just caught this on HBO and tried to find a Reddit post about it. It's just as bad as it seems, with the audience not even getting when to laugh or why they're laughing at times; the host had to prompt them and explain the joke twice in the 2 minutes I watched."
Schulz Saves America,"It‚Äôs not going to change much. I listen to he pod regularly and it is nothing more than just bland generalizations of the democratic party‚Äôs talking points. There is no debate from either the left or right of their center-left narrative, and they never delve deep into the weeds of any topic. The rest of the series will pretty much be this with maybe a bigger name that they interview. "
Schulz Saves America,"Oh god no, that would be even worse."
Schulz Saves America,"I don't agree. When you look at the other political shows on HBO. John Oliver actually states hard facts and extensive research behind his opinion pieces. Real Time provides many people with conflicting political views, from Cornell West to Steve Bannon, to have a platform. These deal much more with facts, and experts.

The opinions expressed on PSA appeared to have little support to them, other than the emotions of the crowd."
Tornado,Jaime was a champion last night. All the other channels had two or three people manning the weather but he did it all by himself. Really admirable work.
Tornado,"Reminds me of the [George Flickinger incident](https://www.google.com/amp/amp.awfulannouncing.com/local-networks/meteorologist-sports-tornado-virginia.html)  that happened not too long ago.

Tornado,"If their priorities include watching the bachelorette v preparing and receiving warnings for a tornado, they deserve to get caught in one."
Tornado,Damn. Lotta people want to die in these comments.
Tornado,This is insane. We're at a point where entertainment matters MORE than ones own very life....how the hell did it get THIS bad?!
Tornado,And we think we can do anything about climate change...
Tornado,Americans are so stupid and pathetic.  Wow.
Tornado,Is there some technology hurdle that prevents stations from broadcasting a picture-in-picture signal? It seems like a choice on the station's part not to do it. Leave the danged original programming on in a corner if viewers are flooding the station with complaints.
Tornado,I wish weatherman would talk about climate change when doing their jobs. They avoid those words A LOT
Tornado,"It‚Äôs fucking annoying as fuck because literally 98% of people here have cellphones and there‚Äôs an emergency message sent to each and everyone of them every hour.

What kinds of people does he actually think are sitting there watching ""The Bachelorette?""  At the same time, if they can figure out how to troll him on social media, i think they may be able to figure out how to subscribe to a phone system that could text them if they were in immanent danger based on their location.  I do, but I also live in a tornado state and don't have/watch local television."
Tornado,"I understand both sides here.

Being safe is way more important but weathermen/ women cut in way to often now days.  It rains hard and they are interrupting the regularly scheduled program."

Tornado,"No. But your cynicism hides the truth:  there are lots and lots of selfish fucking people who complain about something that saves lives. The fact that there are so many examples of this happening proves the point.  Those Darwinian losers will be their own demise, because it will be their house the fire devours when they ignore the warnings.  It‚Äôs even worse when they expect the news to put other human beings lives at risk because they are inconvenienced. It‚Äôs sick."
Tornado,"It‚Äôs fucking annoying as fuck because literally 98% of people here have cellphones and there‚Äôs an emergency message sent to each and everyone of them every hour.

Tornado,"Or, even better, let's let the professionals give out important information that could save lives from inclement weather, and not worry about the Bachelor, the Bachelorette, various sports programming, etc. That way people can focus on the important weather info instead of having a different, useless show in the corner to act as a distraction."
Tornado,Or don‚Äôt and just save lives.
Tornado,"Yep, especially for the vast majority of people, after the first warning, everything after that is repetitive noise, because the information after that is either evacuate or shelter in place and don't leave.  In either case, after the initial warning, all ""information"" after that is mostly noise."
Tornado,Plus tv weather reports have become obsolete now that everyone has cellphones.
Tornado,"You do understand that their job is to tell you the weather today, tomorrow, and the next 10 days or so.... not teach you science... right? For fucks sakes."
Tornado,There should be more talk about climate change but breaking news coverage of a tornado outbreak clearly isn‚Äôt the time to do it.
Tornado,"I appreciate where you're coming from but there's a time and place for climate change discussions. A tornado warning is not one of them. 

That said, one of my local meteorologists does talk about it when he gets a chance to. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b52XHj0ZSrk)"
Tornado,Great Carbon Suffocation =/= mesoscale events.
Tornado,"I see what you mean, tornados will increase with climate change and have been- it‚Äôs good to remind people that the fear and panic and destruction will become more frequent."
Tornado,Why would they talk about a non-proven hoax though?
Tornado,"I have several older relatives that can barely work a TV remote, let alone a smart phone. These are the people who rely on the news to report these kind of things, and would never have known how dangerous that storm was if not for them. Your comment is simply ridiculous, and might be the single most selfish thing I've seen on reddit in a long time."
Tornado,seriously? wow dude. Saving maybe even a single life at the expense of a minor inconvenience to you? You really must have some priorities.
Tornado,If they have a cable subscription and a moderate understanding of technology they can surely log in to the network website and stream it. ABC offers it. I think all the big networks offer it.
Tornado,They only cut in for severe thunderstorm warnings or worse.

Tornado,"God for-fucking-bid you miss your show so some people lives can potentially be saved, right?"
Tornado,Why not? Should my local newscasters not be teaching me the history and issues of investigative journalism in the modern age
Tornado,I would accept any time. I live in the Philly area and these people avoid it like the plague and I'm just sick of this shit. Now they're working tornado predictions for this area. Tornadoes around Philly and no one thinks anything is a little strange? They make a whole hour news show about weather and nothing about why the fucking news show has turned into the weather channel.
Tornado,[deleted]
Tornado,"Are you trolling? I legimately can't tell. 

> Why not? Should my local **NEWS**casters not be teaching me the history

No, no they shouldn't."
Tornado,"I really don't see your point here. How would them not interrupting television programming change anything you mentioned? Those sirens you mentioned, those would alert the exact people I'm referring to, who would then check the news for pertinent information, probably best they dont have to wait for a commercial on the Bachelorette to find out exactly what's going on and how severe it is. As for your point about warnings constantly going off, well there you are just wrong."
Tornado,It was most definitely sarcastic. I'm a little confused why people thought it was serious
Tornado,[deleted]
Tornado,Maybe because sarcasm is best used in dialog that involves actual voice as opposed to text where it's impossible to gauge someones tone?
Tornado,/s helps
Tornado,"I understood you meant sirens outside. Those sirens dont tell you the path of the storm or tornado, they dont tell you if they have passed your house or not. Guess what does do those things, the meteorologists on the news. TV cant tell people anything a siren cant? I am going to choose to believe you aren't being serious."
Tornado,I find /s undermines part of the point of sarcasm

Tornado,"You evacuate, if you can't figure that out, that's on you, but if I see a tornado headed right at my house 10 minutes away, I'm certain me and my family can be in a car headed out of that storm's path in that time. To say having prior knowledge of a storm's path is useless is just plain stupid. And once again, no warnings are going off every day, I live 5 minutes from Wright Patt AFB, and the sirens almost never go off, but hey let's treat your gross exaggeration as truth. I wonder how I could check on the actual severity of the storm since those pesky sirens never seem to quit going off? You check the weather on TV, and hey I'd be pretty glad I didnt waste 5 minutes of my time waiting for the bachelorette to go to commercial with a tornado barreling down on my house. None of your points make any sense. Just because you dont have a safe place in your house, no one should be warned of the tornado path? Idiotic."
Tornado,[deleted]
Tornado,"Why would I lose power before the storm hits me? It's called early warning for a reason. And the whole point of this thread is people bitching about weather on TV interrupting their program. Anyways, I'm done here, you are just repeating the same nonsense, so no point."
Tornado,I'm ready to be hurt again
Tornado,"From the very beginning, this show has come off like 60% of the effort put into it went to excellent casting, 30% to costumes, and maybe 10% to the writing.

Which is really disappointing - there was always a lot of promise."
Tornado,"Season 3 was such a letdown. I‚Äôd say season 2 was probably the best overall, followed by 1 and then 3. 

I‚Äôll probably still watch this eventually, but I‚Äôm in no rush."
Tornado,"I‚Äôm a huge comic book nerd so I should be into this show, but damn, I fell asleep during some of those season 3 episodes."
Tornado,"I trusted you! 

I'm mad at you!

No, I'm mad at you! 

You lied to me! 

We are all mad at each other!

We all lied to each other! 

But you lied more! 

Fine I'm never talking to you again!

Good! 

Whatever! 

I'm going to go do my own thing now, no matter how stupid it is because I am a dark loner who thinks he doesn't need anyone. 

That's the whole show up to current season. Although sometimes they just refuse to talk about life and death matters for no reason at all, even if they aren't mad at each other at the time.

They attempted a dark brooding adult show but the 30 year olds behave like people who never matured past middle school. Some shows with a lighter tone can pull off teen drama in adults. From this show trying to be dark, adult and gritty it's just nauseous to watch happen. 

The actors are good. They have managed to be characters I like in spite of the writing. Anything good about this show is the individual actors efforts. It is one of the most horribly written shows ever done. 

No effort is ever made to get to a story beat in a natural way. Everything in this show happens because of ""I won't give you the satisfaction of talking to you"" type middle school drama."
Tornado,"Like Doom Partrol, S4 of Titans is being split into 2 parts.

Part 1 starts November 4th (with 2 episodes) and Part 2 will premiere in 2023."
Tornado,Yay can't wait to be totally STOKED for the forst episodes and almost forget that i have to watch it during the week.
Tornado,I'm just here to be sad this isn't Young Justice.
Tornado,Who the hell is this supposed to be referencing?
Tornado,Honestly can‚Äôt be as mind numbing as season 3 was. Surely not?
Tornado,For some reason I assumed this was cancelled after one season
Tornado,"I'm in for another season of cool fights, awesome costumes, the great cast, high production values and cool scenes.

Which means I'm also in for the terrible story, bad writing, dialogue where everyone says ""fuck"" every other word for no reason and a disappointing finale.

Let's goooo, Titans!"
Tornado,This show is the best you can get when it comes to DC on TV. Not saying it is that good. But there's nothing better when it comes to DC on TV.
Tornado,Shame there is no Joseph Morgan in this trailer
Tornado,"Since all my DC CW shows got cancelled I'm looking forward to enjoying another season of this trashy superhero show. It's not ""good"", but it is fun. 

On the teaser itself, the youtube comments are all talking about Brother Blood, who I know little about (His appearances on Arrow and the old Teen Titans cartoon seem pretty different from this). Could be interesting!"
Tornado,"I'm not returning for s4, this show had 3 seasons to become good"
Tornado,"This is a very ""hate-watch"" kinda show. Lots of potential, but constantly let down by shitty writing (like an actual child wrote it)"
Tornado,This show always has potential but never reaches it. Kinda like how you study really hard know all the concepts but just pass instead of doing really well.
Tornado,Their portrayal of Bruce Wayne is nothing short of character assassination. I cannot forgive this show.
Tornado,"Season 2 did me in. Now I just get the ""battle report"" from my sister and it's usually painful to listen to.. painfully hilarious that is. 

Ah, man...God bless Doom Patrol."
Tornado,The cinematography and directing is decent as well. (Unless the color grading bugs you obviously)
Tornado,"This seems to be the case for most TV and movies honestly. The technical work and the acting generally works, but the script is always the weakest part."
Tornado,"> Season 3 was such a letdown.

Season 3 had the highest high of the entire series and then the lowest of lows came through the majority of the rest of the season."
Tornado,Season 3 was easily the worst season. The hell did they do to Scarecrow and Red Hood???
Tornado,"Yeah. I love the show and especially the characters, but S3 has been a *slog* for me."
Tornado,You just described every CW show!
Run On,"I‚Äôm liking Hasan‚Äôs run this week, he fits in like he never left. I actually find myself laughing at the writing again, hopefully he‚Äôs their frontrunner."
Run On,"Jon has his own show on Apple TV+.  

The only reason I could see him coming back to The Daily Show to guest host would be if there was something coming before Congress that he wanted to use The Daily Show as a platform. He came back as a guest to help advocate for legislation to support 9/11 first responders."
Run On,Zero.
Run On,For me zero
Run On,"doubt it.  

The show is looking for a replacement, so pretty sure these 'guest' hosts are an audition."
Run On,"Not likely. A long time ago he said he got tired of it. He doesn't hate the show. He's just worn out from hosting. And you know what? I honestly cannot think of anyone who is both qualified to host the Daily Show AND available. Stephen Colbert could do it but he's got his own show. I'm not sure there is currently someone smart enough, popular enough, and motivated enough to do that job."
Run On,Doubt it.  He's already kind of done it here and there when appearing on The Late Show with Colbert.
Run On,If he wasn't doing a show already... probably
Run On,"Yeah same. I've really enjoyed this week's bits. 

His delivery is a little over the top, but the segments, themselves, have been great."
Run On,"This seems the most reasonable take here, just wishful thinking I suppose. that man helped me survive middle and high school. <3"
Run On,"Yeah, I get the purpose. 

I'm just saying, if they could secure him for an episode its easy ratings and goodboy points. Maybe he'd like a stroll down memory lane, idk just wishful thinking."
Run On,Go back and watch early jon. Over the top yep but it worked and he settled into his own. Part of the appeal of TDS back in the day *was* the over the top nature of what they did. That was the whole point of a lot of the comedy the show created.
Run On,"well also, he got his own show to host on AppleTV, as well as his podcast.  So I'm not sure he has the time to take a week off to host the daily show. (or if he's even allow to with his contract with apple)"
Run On,"(Malvo watching Everybody Still Hates Chris Animated Series and seeing Animated Julius)

Animated Julius:  ""You think I'm playing?"""
Run On,"Man.. a reboot? This could be cool, I guess... but I would love a reunion with the og cast continuing the story with Chris starting up as a comic and stuff like that."
Run On,"Used to watch the OG weekly with my parents. At some point I fell off the wagon. When I got back into it, I was surprised by how puberty hit the main character's actor like a freight train. The kid's voice got so deep. As a kid also hitting puberty at the time, I was insanely jealous."
Run On,There needs to be an episode where he gets slapped.
Run On,Honestly PP+ has been killing it with animation. Could do without the Matt Damon commericals tho
Run On,Lots of comedian in this comment section
Run On,Lmao I went to the Barclays center show last week and ‚Äúeverybody still hates chris‚Äù was one of the first things he said.
Run On,Starring Wil Smith?
Run On,Everybody still smacks Chris
Run On,The teacher in this show was funny as hell
Run On,"No please. No more remakes, reboots, reimaginings, requels, enough already."
Run On,It‚Äôs about time he started doing shit other than appearing in shitty Adam Sandler movies lol
Run On,No thank you please.
Run On,I‚Äôm starting to think the slap was a great thing for him
Run On,Will an animated young Will Smith slap him too?
Run On,How much more of this must we watch?
Run On,Animated? That could be fun to watch. Better than the live action.
Run On,"Glad to announce I will be completely ignoring this.

Also glad to announce, I enjoy the downvotes. Just not a fan of Chris rock."
Run On,"Ooooo, nice."
Run On,"Feel like we said all that needed to be said the first time; good show, wrapped up nicely."
Run On,Too bad young Chris got eaten
Run On,Staring Will Smith by chance?
Run On,Chris Rock came out of SlapGate with a new show and Lake Bell. I say the pain was worth it.
Run On,F is for family and everybody hates Chris crossover ü§û
Run On,I hope this is not pg rated.
Run On,RIP Ricky Harris.
Run On,"""Even in a cartoon... I'm gonna be there"""
Run On,That's 15¬¢ worth of milk you just spilled!
Run On,I only had to read the first few words to know where this was going and I had to walk into a different room to laugh my ass off for a good minute.
Run On,Apparently the reason the show ended there because if he continued it being based off his life his dad would pass away soon :(
Run On,"I just realized it‚Äôs animated. Anybody else remember Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series? Apparently there‚Äôs a lot of that unreleased, but I like the live action versions of stuff the best."
Run On,there was one in the original series where he gets smacked into a different nationality
Run On,"Oh, as the narrator, he's definitely gonna mention something about Will Smith."
Run On,"Ideally, an animated Will Smith enters the room and slaps him once per episode, with no explanation. All the characters will look confused each time, but say nothing and move on."
Run On,Special appearance by Will Smith as Billy the Bully.
Run On,The first frame will be Chris Rock getting slapped by an off-screen hand.
Run On,Who is pp+ what else have they done?
Run On,Some people say that I have a pp+
Run On,That would be a hilarious joke.  I could see Chris rolling him in as a guest star at some point for the laughs.
Run On,Fuck will shit.
Run On,Ok
Run On,"Unplug that clock boy, you can't tell time when you sleep! ^That's ^2¬¢ ^an ^hour..."
Run On,Final episode implied that
Run On,"TPB animated was soooooooo bad. I‚Äôm a diehard fan of the original seasons (s1-7) of the show, and the animated series may be the worst thing I have ever watched. Not hyperbolizing either."
Run On,I think it was that he caught his brother kissing his crush and it made him want to ‚ÄúSlap the black off of Drew‚Äù. And then it followed with a cutaway gag of his brother Drew being carried away on a stretcher with a much whiter face.
Run On,"I mean, he held his tongue so far.

I want him to go fucking crazy on that dude."
Run On,Me. I am the people.
Run On,"Last I heard, another season had been recorded and just needed to be animated"
Run On,Makes sense seeing as how the past 3 seasons have been straight cringe
Run On,"Nah, he was slapped straight into an Asian ethnicity

https://youtu.be/44mTfEcP76o"
Run On,The cut-away gags in Everybody Hates Chris are better executed and funnier than whatever the hell Family Guy throws in every 5 seconds.
Run On,Please no
Run On,Both happened.
Run On,"I heard this months ago, so‚Ä¶"
Run On,Yeah Ik. My nah was just refuting the implication of his comment that u/OutOfBootyExperience was misremembering
Run On,"Productions need to start writing this data access into their contract. It will help them re-sell the show to another network if it gets canceled. Either that, or a third party like Nielsen needs to generate accurate demographic and ratings data for streaming titles and offer this as a service to production companies."
Run On,Anything to screw creatives out of future payments.
Run On,That Hulu showrunner is totally for Y the Last Man lol.
Run On,"I‚Äôm not quite sure why the Netflix creators are complaining. Sure it was an issue in the past but for the previous year the data has been there for Netflix shows. Netflix release weekly ratings charts in viewership hours. If your show missed the charts then it did shit and that is why you were cancelled. 

Hopefully the others catch up and we get some proper data from them. In the meantime we have the Nielsen streaming data. Also released weekly. If your show misses the charts then you can assume it is not being watched by many folks in the US!"
Run On,If the show does well you'll get more money. If your show sucks you won't. Simple.
Run On,"#1 is Infinity Train, #2 is Y: The Last Man and #4 is Dickinson?"
Run On,"Theyll never get full data access, its an overwhelming amount of data about every user and their habits anyway, but youll notice netflix is now releasing very specific stats. Its partially marketing and partially a response to this."
Run On,I don't think it is that simple
Run On,"Been thinking about the following for the last week or so, pretty much as soon as I put 2 and 2 together - I think the settlement for the wronged ladies and the removal of DCCMTT show is close enough to be too coincidental. I bet all the extremely negative press (about the peeping tom and resulting settlement/the now-dropped lawsuit/now wants DNA test) took the show away. The show did jump the shark about 4-5 years ago anyway, but yeah.

What boggles my mind, however, is that this same pervo who watched the ladies in their locker room also supposedly took upskirt shots of the team owner‚Äôs daughter Charlotte, yet no other (or not much) mention of her raising any sort of dust over it. This guy checked her out, yet nothing happened. Unless I am mistaken, ol‚Äô Jerry said nothing. If something like that happened to my own daughter, I‚Äôd be all over that for sure!"
Run On,what else are elderly men supposed to watch to get their weekly erection???
Run On,[removed]
Run On,"Looks like something would have gotten done unless it was some one they new that's why probably they had kelly drop the show afraid the media would get a hold of and ask questions.
It's wonder they don't stop try outs all together."
Run On,TikTok girls
Run On,"elderly men hate TikTok and would struggle with the app if they tried using it. 

a TV show like this or Ms America/Victorias Secret fashion shows are the perfect vehicle for old sad men to get the buzz they need"
Run On,"Skimpy TikTok videos are everywhere lol. Reposted to the YT and Insta TT clones. Plus a intellectually disabled monkey could use TikTok, I mean you can use it."
Run On,I suspect he's going to tear up tournament of champions
Run On,Removing the 5 game limit was the best thing that Jeopardy ever did.
Run On,"I had a feeling this was going to happen once the very first clue he chose was the Daily Double. That left him with little chance of getting out of the first round with a big lead.

If he would have won today with his average daily winnings, he would have passed Jennings. It's a bit poetic that *this* is the episode that he loses.

I'm interested to see how far Emma goes. IIRC, the lady who beat Jennings finished her second game in the negative. I feel like Emma will win at least a few more games.

As a regular Jeopardy viewer, it's going to be a bit weird going back to the merry-go-round of champions and daily winnings in the $10-20k range.

Edit: a lot of people are questioning his Final Jeopardy bet. It was the optimal bet. [See here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/jeopardy/comments/bwju0v)"
Run On,Holzhauer vs. Rutter vs. Jennings is going to be insane. They should forget the tournament and just go straight to a final with those three. Also they should make it like a week long and keep the money earned from prior games in the series on the board. I want to see someone wager 100k on a daily double!
Run On,"I was very upset to get a notification from the New York Times app  very clearly implying he would lose, almost 12 hours before the episode would air."
Run On,So I haven‚Äôt watched a single episode with him on it and only read about it on reddit. I took off work today and figured i'd watch him live and it just happened to be the episode he lost....sorry James
Run On,"Shy of the record is a kick in the pants, but hopefully that ~2.5 million helps console him.  Thoughts and prayers!"
Run On,It made me smile that he was immediately there to give her a high five.
Run On,Jenning's reaction:  [https://twitter.com/KenJennings/status/1135703484697681921?ref\_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet](https://twitter.com/KenJennings/status/1135703484697681921?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet)
Run On,[deleted]
Run On,Plot twist: he did not retire from professional gambling and bet $2 million on himself losing before breaking the all-time record.
Run On,[deleted]
Run On,Sadly my stupid news app spoiled it for me.  So annoying
Run On,Jennings record was longer but Holzhauer's was more exciting; gonna miss him!
Run On,"Goddammit so that leak was right.

Still, congrats to Holzhauer."
Run On,It looked like Alex was going to tear up at the end.
Run On,I‚Äôm annoyed with the internet today. NYT and WaPo had articles on their front page at like 10 am PT revealing he had lost. No effort to not spoil this episode. Sad to see James go.
The Ripper,If they keep it a short series it can be good but if they drag it out like lost. It could get old fast.
The Ripper,"It looks as though they are sticking very close to the original story, at least for the pilot.  H.G. Wells is my favorite author and I really look forward to seeing how they portray him and his opinions."
The Ripper,"I really loved that movie as a kid! If I remember correctly it starred Malcolm McDowell and David Warner. 

Shame this is on network TV 

"
The Ripper,Holy shit the casting is terrible.
The Ripper,"Lucky enough to see this in theaters and have loved it ever since. Still stands up today after watching recently. Just wish they would do a remaster, because the color looked so washed out."
The Ripper,This has been in the works for awhile now
The Ripper,Midseason garbage
The Ripper,"Given my luck with SF TV series I like, it'll be on for one season.

The Original Battlestar Galactica
Space: Above and Beyond
John Doe

The TV graveyard is littered with the casualties of shows I liked.
"
The Ripper,Well it's on ABC so they will drag it out for at least 10 seasons. 
The Ripper,Do you expect anything better from ABC?
The Ripper,This movie was actually my first date in high school.  The girl wanted to see it and I ended up enjoying it far more than her.
The Ripper,So Sam Kinnison didn't die and is actually a member of Jesse and the Rippers?! Who knew. 
The Ripper,That guy in the back with the white polo was so distracting 
The Ripper,Have mercy.
The Ripper,More like John Stay Moist
The Ripper,"While I have no clue if Stamos is actually playing in this video, he is actually a pretty decent musician who can play several instruments. "
The Ripper,Two more graduates of the Sean Connery School of Aging.
The Ripper,The dude in the white tee behind them seems to really be enjoying himself.
The Ripper,well...it was the 90's so lip syncing was the style right?
The Ripper,"I was kind of excited, but this is the most lip-synced band I have ever seen."
The Ripper,Where's Mildew?!?!?!?!?
The Ripper,They really suck at pretending to play. Terrible play-back. 
The Ripper,Loved the faux-mullet on Stamos. 
The Ripper,"Good lord Lori Laughlin or whatever her name is, is still mega fucking hot 20 yrs later"
The Ripper,Put a smile on my face despite the obvious lip-syncing. 
The Ripper,"I don't know why or how, but the drum track we hear is not what's actually being played. There are several parts in the medley where the drummer is doing one thing and the drum track is doing another. Plus it sounded like a lip sync and just pretty fake in general."
The Ripper,Really?.....  Why
The Ripper,"Yeah, I was really confused by the lip-syncing. Based on what I know of Stamos, it seemed unnecessary. "
The Ripper,"I was looking forward to it all week, then when I watched it, tired at 12:30 last night, I remembered that Full House and Jesse and The Rippers suck. "
The Ripper,They're all playing along to a track. I thought that was pretty obvious.
The Ripper,I also have a hard time believing Stamos is playing the guitar. His fretting hand is all over the place and doesn't seem to match the tempo of the music either.
The Ripper,I actually don't hate this idea 
The Ripper,"I'm always interested in seeing more Jack the Ripper stories, but if you haven't checked it out, Ripper Street is somewhat what you're looking for. It takes place after the Ripper murders, but there's a fear that he may return."
The Ripper,Because there's not enough Jack the Ripper movies/shows already. 
The Ripper,I don't think this would suit the Niche appeal of True Detective. This would fall into its own category of show like Sherlock has.
The Ripper,"So, kinda/sorta like [Ripper Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripper_Street)?"
The Ripper,Somebody get HBO on the phone!
The Ripper,No. Enough with period drama. Down with all these dreadful knicks.
The Ripper,"They could scoop DiCraprio's project and do the HH Holmes story, our  bloodier all-American serial killer."
The Ripper,Sounds decent. Let's hope they don't make it as fucking confusing as season 2. Confusing does not equal deep and intelligent.
The Ripper,"I'd honestly like this show to simplify itself, I wouldn't mind a snowy small town, centered around a sheriff. Cut out all the fancy fluff and get an actor that can carry an entire story."
The Ripper,[deleted]
The Ripper,Is that a case-of-the-week show or more serialized?
The Ripper,Good one ? Not really 
The Ripper,The knick is far from dreadful if that's what you're saying
The Ripper,"Nope haha, I was just taking a shower, and thinking of how to make True Detective interesting again, while using amazing actors.. why not change up the time period!"
The Ripper,Knick is boring. Dreadful is penny.
The Ripper,"you are spot on, a change in time period helps a lot.... one cool thing about fargo is season 2 references stuff that happens in the future for season 1, great stuff."
The Ripper,I'm so glad Uncle Jesse is rocking the mullet!
The Ripper,That would be like Uncle Joey without the cut it out hands
The Ripper,"I seem to be the only person who even enjoyed these first two episodes. Not the best TV of all time, but it was a fun two hours. The writing could use some work, but I will watch until the end of the first season or until it gets canceled. I feel like the latter will happen to be honest."
The Ripper,"paper-thin characterizations, seemingly zero historical research on either Wells or Victorian mannerisms and speech -  words and phrases like 'dating', 'single', 'sub-atomic', 'time to process' would be complete anachronisms for a character of the time -  absurd plot holes, and an incredibly cynical outlook on today's world - this era may have a lot of problems left to solve, but compared to the 1890s, we live in a utopia.... "
The Ripper,"... step one: knock the most notorious serial killer of all time out.  Step two: continue bashing his head in.  Step three: you won already.

My god the writing is so bad."
The Ripper,"I quite liked the characters, but the writing was pretty awful and the two parter got pretty boring by the second half. I'll probably not stick with this unless I hear good things."
The Ripper,"The most upsetting thing I saw in the episode was that H.G Wells grabbed a caprisun out of the fridge and had no problem opening it. Also, what 20+ woman has caprisuns without kids. 

I can deal with the sub par acting and time travel, but he can't open a caprison that easily"
The Ripper,"He saw video of Trump and burst into tears...  

We all know that feeling...."
The Ripper,Why was this show set in 1893 at the start?  The Ripper killed in 1888 - why the 5 year gap?
The Ripper,GUNS ARE ILLEGAL IN NYC! Not that people don't own them but it's not like you can just wander around carrying and pulling out a gun like it's nbd. Also burner phones still call 911. 
The Ripper,"How many times can Jack The Ripper continually use the time machine without the key?  At some point, you'd think ""Maybe we should move this time machine to a more secure location.""

This show was ridiculous and (like many other shows) takes a premise best set for a novel/film/limited series and tries to turn it into an on-going thing. Where is this gonna go?  Nowhere!  Just a chase week afrer week after week with no end in sight.

"
The Ripper,How could she die 3 days from the present if she disappeared With him in the time machine
The Ripper,Thought Stroma and Bowman were good and liked the first hour when it basically copied the movie. Lost steam in the second.
The Ripper,G√©nesis Rodr√≠guez reminds me a lot of Gina Gerson. She could be her daughter.
The Ripper,"I have a feeling this show won't last long. I saw it tonight, and thought it was OK. Nothing more, nothing less.

I kind of feel bad for Josh Bowman (Jack the Ripper). Having come off the heels of Revenge and then jumping ship onto this show seems like a misstep to me. I'd like to see him in more quality projects, just not this one because I'm sure he's got talent to show off."
The Ripper,Who's the mysterious man at the end??
The Ripper,"I found the plot aggravating where the ripper had absolutely zero culture shock and automatically knew how everything worked, yet Wells, who actually invented the time machine, was a bumbling idiot around tech.  If you have to do that just for the sake of plot, it means you are a bad writer."
The Ripper,"I think one hour of this show is enough for one sitting, I was bored by the second half. The two hour premiere makes me think they're trying to burn it off. 

IDK, this show is...fine? I like the main actors from other things I've seen them in and the plot is interesting enough, but this has cancelled written all over it. "
The Ripper,Am I thinking of a different show but was there suppose to be a black women who was the great grandchild of hg wells. 
The Ripper,"Having never watched the movie, I think H.G. Wells was adorable and I liked that they didn't dance around the ""will they or won't they"" romance between him and Jane. 

I also thought the inclusion of Jane being a victim was a nice twist that made the story a lot more suspenseful and unpredictable. 

Having watched NBC's Timeless though, there are so many similarities..."
The Ripper,"Too much ""Idiot plot"" for me... The entire plot could have been avoided if they just killed the ripper everytime they had the chance (2-3 times for sure).

But I will still give it a chance."
The Ripper,"i'm on episode 5, enjoying it so far. though i do agree some things may seem a bit of a stretch, especially how easily jack the ripper seems to adjust to the future without much confusion at all. so far i feel the main characters were well-cast, they're all pretty likeable so far and seem to have good chemistry. it'll be interesting to see how the plot unfolds as the season progresses. definitely one of those shows to just sit back and have fun with instead of overanalyze for pinpoint accuracy...i sense a somewhat lighthearted and a bit comedic tone in the writing. 

on a side note i can't help but see buster posey of the san francisco giants in his acting debut as HG Wells. lol. i can see such a strong resemblance from certain angles"
The Ripper,"horrible time travel movie.

doesnt even follow basic time travel things"
The Ripper,"Oh, God! This looks like absolute shit!"
The Ripper,"While I managed to see the full season of this, I thought the series was interesting but at times slow, I liked the way it incorporated Wells other novels into the plot, but it took a long time to get there, and I would have liked to have seen were they where going with this, like War of the Worlds, the Invisible man, and the time machine (Morlocks) would have been the highlight, and no uber ones either?

While I agree that the stabbing scenes got a bit much, people have to understand this was Jack the Ripper, and he was no Saint, but they could have at least finished his story and added a twist, as for the Cast, HG didn't do it for me, he wasn't interesting enough, Jack however was   right at home, and could blend in, the other characters were not as useful either other than a distraction. I was disappointed that the ABC network pulled this so early in the screening, it showed how much they believe in it?

I for one think it should have had a second chance, one with better writers and a decent script, and to come up with an original idea for once."
The Ripper,"I thought it was decent, which I didn't think it would be because of the premise and the trailers. Them getting used to the future was rushed but not a big deal. Suspension of disbelief is high with this show, I understand they can't just capture him right then and there but they should find better ways to go around that."
The Ripper,[deleted]
The Ripper,I thought it was good so far. And I loved the 1979 movie. It all depends on where they take it. 
The Ripper,"I liked it alright. I'm a sucker for time travel, so it's got to be *really* bad for me not to watch. I just don't know why they had to, more or less, just remake the movie from 25 years ago. Use your imagination, people! 

They didn't spend enough time on the characters' reactions to the future. That's always my favorite part of this kind of show. Done well, it's really cool. Like stepping into the Tardis for the first time. "
The Ripper,"a shitty utopia, maybe"
The Ripper,"But not the utopia he had thought, that was the point. Different ways to kill, made easier by invention. "
The Ripper,"Yeah I was really enjoying it up until that scene.  Seriously, how do you not continue to bash his brains in?  Done, problem solved right then and there.  Obviously, that would kill the rest of their storyline but that scene was unforgivable.

The scene on the bridge was also pretty bad.  You have guns, shoot him.

I might tune in next week to see if it improves, but damn.

edit: just looked up the writing staff and aside from Williamson, most of them don't have a ton of credits or anything particularly noteworthy and it shows."
The Ripper,That is a common issue in tv shows and films. So many people don't secure the bad guy. 
The Ripper,Yeah I raged out at this scene
The Ripper,"right? they couldve at least written the machine to be kaput after the second jump in as many minutes, then he can try to fix it and whatever the hell else drivel they want to shove on us"
The Ripper,"> Also, what 20+ woman has caprisuns without kids.

Don't you judge me."
The Ripper,""" Also, what 20+ woman has caprisuns without kids.""

Who DOESN'T drink caprisuns still?"
The Ripper,Also there was a scene where he got confused about which remote did what... but how did he know what a remote even was?
The Ripper,"Well there's a straw with a pointed edge attached and it says insert here with a hole shaped like the straw.

It shouldn't be sorcery"
The Ripper,"> The most upsetting thing I saw in the episode was that H.G Wells grabbed a caprisun out of the fridge and had no problem opening it.

It's a Capri Sun, not a nuclear centrifuge."
The Ripper,"I finally got around to watching it.

What got me annoyed is that the girl (from Texas who owned a gun) knocks out the bad guy, and then tries to escape with the other woman by carefully trying not to wake the ripper while  moving past him.  DOUBLE TAP!  Or kill him!  Tie him up.  Something!  

How is it she's brave enough to try to escape, calm enough to go rescue the other woman, and yet stupid enough not to ensure that the bad guy can't come after them?

All I can think is, idiot writers who are trying to add adrenaline but refuse to end the storyline with a capture.

Stupid writers!."
The Ripper,"Theory is the Ripper killed from 1888-1891. But there's been other theories he killed before & after. No one knew who he was, until for this novel, they discovered who in 1893."
The Ripper,"and we are allowing that paradox, just go a day before in 1893 and tell scotland yard to be ready to catch him the next day (unless the machine was finished that very day which I didnt remember being the case)"
The Ripper,"Because they will eventually come back. 
"
The Ripper,My thoughts exactly.
The Ripper,"Isn't that to show that evil is always ""modern"", while the good is slowly dissappering?"
The Ripper,"I couldnt get myself to sit watching the crap a second hour, bah. I dont even care if the writers somehow learn to do their job, the first hour was torture enough"
The Ripper,That's this show. Vanessa Williams is the great granddaughter or whatever. 
The Ripper,"Maybe you're thinking of something else, I feel like there was like 6 new tv shows this season that were about time travel that had the word ""Time"" in the title somewhere, maybe one of the other ones - including the one that's premiering this week I think? - has the black woman who's a descendant of H.G. Wells."
The Ripper,Technically Parker is black.
The Ripper,"When she first started talking to him she said she was his great great grandchild but near the end of it revealed that she took something with his DNA on it and shock they are related... seemed to be terrible editing? If she's already told him they were related why have a second scene with the same thing told in a different way? It's like someone took two different versions if the pilot, spliced them together and ""forgot"""
The Ripper,"Have you also seen the other new time travel show that also premiered along with Time After Time called ""Making History"" on FOX?"
How To Ruin Christmas,RIP - she was a really charismatic performer.

How To Ruin Christmas,"Whatever it‚Äôs flaws, it was all worth it when Maya screamed, ‚ÄúHow the fuck was I supposed to know that?‚Äù"
How To Ruin Christmas,Jason Bateman being a cat and telling that his revenge would be sweet was fantastic.
How To Ruin Christmas,"Yeah totally agree. Pete was an unnecessary addition at the end. He didn't even have time to get up to speed on the premise and he did not gel with the rest of the episode. Really enjoyed Jason and Maya and the rest of the episode until then. When Jason realized Santa was Sean and said ""aw you roped Sean into this?"" I laughed out loud."
How To Ruin Christmas,"Master Bateman and Maya Rudolph were great. Marshawn Lynch was a nice surprise (‚ÄúOh shit, it‚Äôs the dude from Ozark!‚Äù).

Pete Davidson was kind of ‚Äúeh‚Äù, but the joke was that a celebrity would be brought in last minute with the expectation that they solve the mystery while knowing absolutely nothing. 

Apparently he was sequestered in his trailer for 4 hours, according to Krister Johnson, writer for Murderville, in the /r/murderville subreddit:

https://www.reddit.com/r/murderville/comments/zm8rz7/_/j0e4mai/"
How To Ruin Christmas,"Yeah, but that's the joke, right? The murderer was someone Maya hadn't even met, and Pete was asked to choose the killer with no information at all. There's no way he could have added anything to the investigation, so he was just having fun with it. 

I liked the interplay between the different guests better than the first series where it's just the guest with Terry, but it would probably be better to have them all there from the start. It would be less confusing for the viewer, and hopefully they would actually choose one of the suspects in the end."
How To Ruin Christmas,Jasons bird dance was incredible
How To Ruin Christmas,It was almost worth it though for Bateman's deadpan scolding of Pete for mocking Donna Foccacias name
How To Ruin Christmas,"I absolutely loved the episode and agree that Pete didn‚Äôt add anything. I feel I could‚Äôve done what he did, being I have zero acting talent and what not."
How To Ruin Christmas,It was almost like Pete was walking by the studio while they were filming the ending and just dragged him in for no reason.
How To Ruin Christmas,We said the same thing! It was SO funny but how none of them chose one of the three suspects kinda killed it. I will say I cracked up that Jason picked Santa because it was absolutely absurd. I think the idea of having someone come in at the very end was great but anyone but Pete. His hype needs to be done. If they got Molly Shannon or something that would‚Äôve been awesome.
How To Ruin Christmas,Wasn‚Äôt the joke that because he was brought in last minute there‚Äôs no way he could of known what was going on? I thought it was funny anyway‚Ä¶
How To Ruin Christmas,"The thing about him pulling the wires though is that they were about to get him to disarm the bomb anyway so why didn‚Äôt they just roll with it and be like ‚Äúoh, good job Pete. That did it I guess‚Äù"
How To Ruin Christmas,"Agreed. I loved the special and hope they do more Murderville. But Pete Davidson is just not funny, and this was made more apparent sharing the stage with actors who can actually do improv well."
How To Ruin Christmas,"I think Santa was my favorite thing in the episode. From him dying like 3 separate times, to the mannequin bit with the Orphans... i just lost my shit."
How To Ruin Christmas,"My wife and I were blitzed when  we watched this on Friday and I cannot remember a time we have laughed more post COVID.  We were extremely happy to see Marshawn make a cameo and we loved him pointing out, ""That's the guy from OZARK!""

Might be the alcohol talking but it was by far our favorite thus far!"
How To Ruin Christmas,"I kinda like how it feels like improv between friends and a chaotic mess. Also makes it feel more real, less set up and less rehearsed or prepped for as some shows that fake realism can be. Tho it is better when will arnett is trying not to laugh and the comedian digs in to make him laugh. There‚Äôs few times where arnett or the other actor is trying to drag some improv out of the guest whose stuck but you can‚Äôt win them all in improv.

Throwing Pete last minute was some wild farcical comedy. If you don‚Äôt care if he solves it or not it is funny how lost he is"
How To Ruin Christmas,I think he would have chosen the mint girl if he didn‚Äôt see both Maya and Jason picking outside the box. The bomb thing was absolutely dumb. But it was an enjoyable episode nonetheless.
How To Ruin Christmas,"The ending did piss me off a bit, and I was surprised that having three professional comedians resulted in them all going against the basic fundamentals of improv comedy.

Definitely would have been better without Pete, but I wouldn't have minded them bringing in a third person at the end.  I liked the underlying premise of ""This guy has no knowledge of anything that has transpired yet.""  Marshawn Lynch would have been good."
How To Ruin Christmas,That was literally the entire joke but alright lol
How To Ruin Christmas,Agreed completely.
How To Ruin Christmas,"I like Pete more than the average redditor but he straight up sucked. He didn‚Äôt even try to play along at all, didn‚Äôt say a single useful or funny thing, and then pulled all the wires on the bomb at the end which is just textbook terrible improv."
How To Ruin Christmas,Still can‚Äôt believe no one made a joke at the end about it being an arresting development
How To Ruin Christmas,I never knew in wanted a Jason Bateman Maya Rudolph team up and now I want a whole movie
How To Ruin Christmas,It‚Äôs crazy to think an actor with no range or ability to maintain character spent so many years on a live variety sketch show.
How To Ruin Christmas,He was fine. Is he as good as the others? No but he absolutely didn‚Äôt ‚Äúruin‚Äù anything and imo played off decently with the other cast. It ain‚Äôt perfect but I think it‚Äôs obnoxious to write a whole post about it.
How To Ruin Christmas,"I wonder what the back story to it was in real life. Like was he just chilling near the studio and someone was like ‚Äúhey were filming this come join! It‚Äôs not like you need a script‚Äù or something similar. 

It didn‚Äôt seem planned (not that much is) but in some ways that‚Äôs the charm of it. 

Or maybe it was just horribly planned out. I‚Äôm going to hope there is an amusing backstory."
How To Ruin Christmas,"I did love the idea of bringing in a 3rd person with absolutely no understanding of what has already happened, right at the very end... but agree.  I wish Davidson had taken it a little more seriously, even if I did laugh at most of what he did.  Including pulling all the wires.

That said, though.  We went back and rewatched the others after the special and I do like the way the Christmas special flowed, and felt like it was more of a murder mystery party of friends, than the others did, because of the character breaks and things."
How To Ruin Christmas,"Agreed, I just don't understand how he keeps getting work. I used to think it was a conspiracy that the entertainment industry force feed you certain people, but I 100% believe it with him. He's smarmy and not funny, who are his fans? What does he actually bring to the table? I'll never understand it."
How To Ruin Christmas,"I agree. The episode was great, but Pete Davidson almost ruined it. 

I really tried to give him a chance, but Pete was laughing the whole time and pointed the finger at Will just to seem funny. He wasn‚Äôt even playing the game. When he pulled all the wires, I just gave up. He was an awful addition to the story. 

Referencing the Smartless podcast, what if they got Justin Theroux instead of Pete Davidson? That would have been gold."
How To Ruin Christmas,I don't like Pete Davidson. Don't get what his appeal his. He's not talented in my eyes. Just a run of the mill chum.
How To Ruin Christmas,"I groaned when >!Pete Davidson!< lumbered onto the scene. Didn't add anything of value. I wish it had been someone like Michael Cera as a sort of wink and a nod to Arrested Development, like how they had >!Sean Hayes!< on there as a reference to >!the Smartless podcast!<."
How To Ruin Christmas,"If you've not seen it you should check out Murder in Successville, which is the original version of the show."
How To Ruin Christmas,Pete Davidson ruined it to be honest.
How To Ruin Christmas,"I guess I was the opposite. Pete is pretty well known for breaking at the drop of a hat so you just have to have that expectation and enjoy it when it happens. Especially since Bateman had made several fourth wall breaking comments and Maya broke when she heard Santa was dead. It's one of those shows where breaking can add to the show, rather than detract."
How To Ruin Christmas,"Yeah I wish the celebrities played along, that's supposed to be part of the fun of this kind of show"
How To Ruin Christmas,I died when they asked Jason Bateman to dance and he pulled the ‚Äúca-caw ca-caw‚Äù chicken dance from arrested development
How To Ruin Christmas,"By the end my impression of things was that:

Maya was all in and enjoying the hell out of it

Bateman was over it and contemplating who he was going to kill first, Will Arnett for getting him involved (since I imagine that is how it happened) or his agent because agents.

And that Davidson had been walking by while they were filming and some producer yanked him in off the street for the hell of it."
How To Ruin Christmas,"I loved it when Maya accused the mayor who immediately said, ""the fuck?"""
How To Ruin Christmas,I‚Äôm not the biggest Pete Davidson fan but I really enjoyed the unnecessary addition. It was more so a joke to add someone at the last second who missed the entire case and then have them pick who they think the killer is. Also how could you not break if you‚Äôre coming into the end of the episode?
How To Ruin Christmas,"The kind of ‚Äúcardinal rule‚Äù for improv is the ‚Äúyes, and‚Äù approach. Pete didn‚Äôt say yes to any set ups; he didn‚Äôt play along with the bomb wire. He gave his present to someone who wasn‚Äôt a suspect. He just sat and smiled and didn‚Äôt attempt any effort to get into any sort of character. 
I think a lot of us had bigger expectations because he was on a comedy sketch show, but he either doesn‚Äôt have the chops or he prefers to bring chaos and watch everyone shift to his style. 
It‚Äôs way more fun to watch improv when everyone tries to gel; he gave no gifts/easy lifts to the other teammates and he heightened zero scenes. The ability to keep the bit going is all on Will, Jason, Maya and the supporting cast."
How To Ruin Christmas,"It had its moments, but the whole thing didn‚Äôt feel well put together.  It‚Äôs like they started filming and decided to call Maya and Pete to see if they were free to swing by. 

They should have all been in a group from the start."
How To Ruin Christmas,"Completely agree. I was so disappointed bc Pete seemed to not play the ‚Äúgame‚Äù and instead seemed to want to just f up the story line. 
It made no sense adding him. 
Also they should have brought in Maya earlier in the show."
How To Ruin Christmas,Me and my girlfriend thought him showing up out of the blue was one of the best parts of the episode.
How To Ruin Christmas,I don‚Äôt blame Pete because they brought him on right at the end and he didn‚Äôt have any context. I wish instead of staggering the guests they were all present at the beginning. Or they did separate episodes. Overall thought it was great. Loved Jason‚Äôs nod to Arrested Development with the chicken dance
How To Ruin Christmas,It's the American remake of Murder in Successville in case anyone else was confused.
How To Ruin Christmas,"I feel almost completely the opposite about the episode. I thought everything until Pete showed up was weaker than most of the regular episodes, but when he showed up the chaos it brought was hilarious. I don't think without him there Jason and Maya would have picked the killers they did, and it just raised everything up. There's no way it would work as a normal thing, but for a special episode it was a great ending."
How To Ruin Christmas,"Yeah I wish the celebrities played along, that's supposed to be part of the fun of this kind of show"
How To Ruin Christmas,Everything was perfectly imperfect and the entire special was wonderful.
How To Ruin Christmas,I didn‚Äôt mind Pete Davidson. He didn‚Äôt add anything spectacular but his laugh was contagious as a viewer
How To Ruin Christmas,"That's why it was funny.

No matter who you bring in, if they're only there for the last 5min, they'd act the same way bc they have no sense of the pacing or what the other 2 ppl have gone through the entire time. 

I found that hilarious."
How To Ruin Christmas,I think that was the point a bit. To bring some doofus looking guy in who was clueless and had 30 seconds to make a decision and wouldn‚Äôt take it seriously.
How To Ruin Christmas,"Honestly, just having Pete Davidson in a cast is an immediate ""no thanks"" from me, no matter how amazing it might be. Kermit-looking motherfucker is just awful with stupid tattoos."
How To Ruin Christmas,Before he came in I was sure I'd rewatch it in a year's time. His appearance made it much much worse.
How To Ruin Christmas,"Yeah, WTF why was Pete Davidson even there. He had no context, no frame of reference, he didn't seem like he wanted to play along."
How To Ruin Christmas,Agreed!
How To Ruin Christmas,I agree about Pete Davidson but I was laughing so hard even that couldn‚Äôt ruin it for me. I think Bateman is the perfect type of entertainer to do these things because he is so ridiculously deadpan with his comedy and he didn‚Äôt break no matter what absurd things they made him do. Leslie Nielsen would be proud.
How To Ruin Christmas,"honestly this episode was hilarious - the end was a bit annoying, but everything else was **great**"
How To Ruin Christmas,Who is Johnny blaze based on?? I know that is ghost rider but why put him in this skit/movie?? Am I missing something
How To Ruin Christmas,"Or when Maya said, ‚Äú50 Seconds, MacGruber!‚Äù"
How To Ruin Christmas,I love Jason but Maya was SO fucking funny
How To Ruin Christmas,"I laughed the most when that other officer came in when they're interviewing the assistant and Maya goes, ""now who the fuck is that?!"" This show is lots of fun, and I loved seeing Jason Bateman in it as well! Dug the little AD callback with his quick chicken impersonation. If you can even call it that...I'm not convinced he's ever seen one."
How To Ruin Christmas,"""I never met him!"""
How To Ruin Christmas,"Or when the lady cop showed up and Maya said ""who the fuck was that?"""
How To Ruin Christmas,"Oh god that was hilarious. I laughed a lot this episode - watching Jason having to go through all of the debasing stuff set up and talking about having time to plot his revenge.. Sean laughing, the naked guy."
How To Ruin Christmas,He was such a good sport not hesitating to go full in on playing a cat. But casually vocalizing that he would get Arnete back for it was gold.
How To Ruin Christmas,"When he tried to do mouth to mouth, I almost died"
How To Ruin Christmas,"> He didn't even have time to get up to speed on the premise

To be fair, that was the joke.  But yeah, he didn't go along with anything and that ruined the ending a bit."
How To Ruin Christmas,"I wasn't sure who ""Sean"" was or how Jason Bateman knew him lol"
How To Ruin Christmas,"> He didn't even have time to get up to speed on the premise

That was the joke."
How To Ruin Christmas,"The improv masters were great and all, but the completely natural reaction of ""Oh shit, it's the guy from Ozark."" has to be my favorite bit in the whole thing."
How To Ruin Christmas,"> but the joke was that a celebrity would be brought in last minute with the expectation that they solve the mystery while knowing absolutely nothing. 

They need to send that one back to the drawing board"
How To Ruin Christmas,"""Who's the assistant?""

 ""That one.

 ""oh, she did it.""

And he STILL didn't pick her."
How To Ruin Christmas,I'd watch a full Pete episode for sure
How To Ruin Christmas,"""caw, caw"""
How To Ruin Christmas,it's from 'arrested development' where Will Arnett used to do this dance in front of Jason!
How To Ruin Christmas,"I didn‚Äôt even know who he was and assumed he was a DJ or something since he didn‚Äôt seem like he could act and wasn‚Äôt funny. Possibly an athlete, but like, for poker or something."
How To Ruin Christmas,"It was an easier case than the other episodes by a mile - my partner noticed right away that all the name tags were smudged because they were written by someone left-handed and then I picked out that the killer's name tag was not smudged because they were writing it themselves to replace the one they lost.

But the fact that nobody even guessed one of the suspects was a far better outcome than the prior episodes where they just flounder with a random guess. The Mayor, suicide, and Seattle were great picks."
How To Ruin Christmas,"I LOVE the fact that there are three suspects, three detectives, and no one picked any of them.  It feels like an instant, unspoken agreement of ""if we don't know, we won't pick.""  And Pete seemed to pick up on it, too."
How To Ruin Christmas,"Yes, they really needed someone with improv training. Imagine Amy Poehler or Will Ferrell or even Martin Short in that role."
How To Ruin Christmas,"I will say that this episode also seemed way harder to solve than the others.  I don't know if that was because of the multiple guest stars or what.  I didn't pick up on the mint drink at all.  The nametag smear was an obvious clue, but somehow I forgot all about it by the time we met Jim.  And I think the ""magic hands"" was a real stretch, though she was the only thing I go right and that was only because of how crazy she was and honestly I assumed her cat would have done the licking."
How To Ruin Christmas,"His hype will be done when he stops bagging the top ""newly available talent"" every six months.  It's a damn right of passage at this point.  

Ariana Grande, Kate Beckinsale, Kaia Gerber, Phoebe Dynevor, Kim Kardashian, Margaret Qualley and now Emily Ratajkowski?  The guy's a machine."
How To Ruin Christmas,Right? I though the absurdity of it made it worth the joke
How To Ruin Christmas,"I *think* the plan was to have Maya and Jason try and explain the absolute absurdity they just witnessed and basically have him go on that. THey did it a little bit but I don't think they got what they wanted.

I didn't hate it as most of the others, here. I thought it was funny enough."
How To Ruin Christmas,"Where's that ""could of/could have"" bot?"
How To Ruin Christmas,"True. The absolute funniest scenes in the UK original are ones where everyone breaks character because they're laughing too much. This is my favourite:

https://youtu.be/kphVef2S2bI"
How To Ruin Christmas,"I agree because I've seen this opinion posted everywhere and I think people are taking this obviously silly and fun show way too seriously. ""No one picking a real suspect ruined it for me."" Really?! I was rolling laughing at that and so was the crew in the background, it was a great moment!"
How To Ruin Christmas,"I think you hate Pete Davidson a bit too much if him being there for five minutes ruined a hilarious episode with some insane performances.

I think the ‚ÄúChad‚Äù sketches are dumb, and he‚Äôs not really my cup of tea, but I didn‚Äôt recoil (lol coil) when he walked out. It was more of an ‚ÄúOh, that guy.‚Äù"
How To Ruin Christmas,He was really good in King of Staten Island
How To Ruin Christmas,Jason also did a bit of the chicken dance when he was singing his elf song.
How To Ruin Christmas,"Aww, now I'm going to be forever sad that it wasn't Michael Cera. His personality would've been great for this special."
How To Ruin Christmas,Sean also randomly appeared in a bit with Will on Lego Masters a few weeks ago.
How To Ruin Christmas,And it's amazing
How To Ruin Christmas,I lost it when he just pulled the wires on the bomb. I like Pete. I really don't understand why people hate him so much.
How To Ruin Christmas,"> He gave his present to someone who wasn‚Äôt a suspect.

So did Jason and Maya"
How To Ruin Christmas,">He gave his present to someone who wasn‚Äôt a suspect. 

Can you imagine if the other two had done that?!"
How To Ruin Christmas,"I do, he still didn‚Äôt go along with the scenes. He‚Äôs a talentless amateur."
How To Ruin Christmas,It rhymes with Sean Hayes and sounds like a bad ass athlete
How To Ruin Christmas,The actual name might be familiar if you‚Äôre a ghost rider fan
Teen Mom 2,">I'm all about protecting my family, it is my life's mission. Some people are worth killing or dying for and my family means that much to me.



Gross. Aren't you a big man shooting a 4 lb animal instead of training it probably you stupid fuck."
Teen Mom 2,Can't we just cancel garbage like this period?
Teen Mom 2,Good!
Teen Mom 2,Allegedly does not mean guilty.
Teen Mom 2,I mean he admitted to doing it
Teen Mom 2,Mtv once again reaps what it sows 
Teen Mom 2,"The name of the show makes it sound like a cringe 15 year old drama for young teens but it's more like Sex Education and Euphoria, so if you like those shows, give it a go."
Teen Mom 2,"I grew up loving the original, but the more I hear about this reboot/remake makes me want to stay as far away from it as possible.

Have any Aussie‚Äôs on here seen both?"
Teen Mom 2,"ah, so a cringe 17 years old drama for young teens.

jk"
Teen Mom 2,Hey I'm a 20 year old guy and I thought it was pretty solid.
Teen Mom 2,"We have run out of time but want to thank everybody who has watched and enjoyed the show from the bottom of our hearts. Thank you for your questions, sorry we couldn't answer them all and we sincerely hope we'll see you back at Portland Row before too long. 

Joe, Ruby, Cameron and Ali. x"
Teen Mom 2,"Question for Cameron, Ruby, and Ali: what was your favorite line of dialogue to deliver in season 1?"
Teen Mom 2,Were you allowed to write on or make additions to the thinking cloth?
Teen Mom 2,"Question for Joe, I don't suppose there's any chance we ever get a proper release of the complete The Adam and Joe Show on Blu-ray is there?"
Teen Mom 2,To all: is there any footage of the milk gate? It‚Äôs been described as the funniest moment on set and fans (me) are curious to see
Teen Mom 2,"Hi!! Thank you so much for taking time to talk and share with us!! What an incredible adaptation you've gifted us.

For Joe: What was the most difficult and/or rewarding part of the development/pre-pro process for this series?

For Ruby: I saw that you‚Äôve done trapeze! (I‚Äôm an aerialist too, with a preference for trapeze/lyra). Have you trained in any other apparatuses? Non-spoiler thoughts on *That* scene in The Empty Grave?

For Ali: Your George has earned such a special place in my heart, thank you for taking such great care of him! What are some of your favorite qualities of George? Any you can relate to?

For Cameron: It's like you walked off straight from the pages as Anthony Lockwood, and we're so grateful. What is your process like for getting into character?

General: Cast birthdays? (For astrological sign reasons üëÄ)"
Teen Mom 2,"To the cast & Joe: I've rewatched the show more than 5 times already, if you don't get the greenlight from Netflix for a second season what's the possibility of you switching streaming services? Just asking on behalf of the fandom, we're desperate for more from our absolute favourite cast ever <3"
Teen Mom 2,"Question for Cameron: Having just come out of drama school what were you expecting when it came to getting actual roles? Were you confident in your ability to get a role in this industry or were you like so many other actors unsure of your success?  

Note : You're incredibly talented thank you for gracing our screen with your presence we will forever be in your debt"
Teen Mom 2,"Brilliant adaptation of an excellent series of books. My Q is directed at Cameron, Ruby and Ali:

Q - what do you imagine Lockwood, Lucy and George would do for a living/hobbies when they hit 20 ish and their ability to see ghosts starts to fade?"
Teen Mom 2,For Cameron: the books often mention Lockwood's iconic coat being too long and getting in the way. Did you ever have any problems like that on set?
Teen Mom 2,"As someone who is very conscious of sharp metal objects in close proximity, I get mini heart attacks whenever I see Lockwood or Lucy draw swords within inches of someone standing nearby, or when one of your rapiers stick out behind looking ready to trip someone. 

I'm curious, did anyone ever got hurt on set by the rapiers? Or accidentally poked by your fellow mates?"
Teen Mom 2,"Hey Joe! Was it written in the script to change Lockwood‚Äôs usual pink socks to blue during the party scene to match with Lucy, or was that just an unhinged (in an amazing way) decision by the costume designers?

Show is amazing!!"
Teen Mom 2,"If the problem finally went away or gifts faded and Lockwood and Co couldn‚Äôt be agents, what do you think each character would do for a job?"
Teen Mom 2,"My question is for whoever wants to answer it, maybe Cameron! I just wanted to know if Lockwood's dark eyebags were all natural or done with makeup? ;)"
Teen Mom 2,"for Ruby! - 

your northern accent slayed, were you confident going in or did you have a voice coach?"
Teen Mom 2,"Have you guys read the books and if so what was your favorite? If we get another season are there any particular scenes you are looking forward to filming? Thanks so much for the great adaption, me and my brother loved it."
Teen Mom 2,Why hasn't Netflix been promoting the show at all? It is truly a hidden gem and deserves more promotion and recognition.
Teen Mom 2,"This is a wonderful opportunity! Can't thank you enough for it!!

For Joe; How is the process of getting books adapted into a show? I really want to get into the field as a screenwriter/director hopefully, so I was wondering if you also had any advice for someone who has no idea what they're doing üòÇ

For Ali; I'm so so excited about your character!! I'm Persian myself, so the second I saw your name I was like...can it be? And then you mention ghormeh sabzi and nan khameii and I instantly felt at home. I absolutely love the changes to your character because I've always wanted to see my own culture in a character. And my question is; will there be more cultural exploration for George? Maybe even a nod to kolah Ghermezi (I hope you do know what I'm talking about üòÇ) 

For Cameron; What's something you love about playing your character? And what's the most challenging part about it? Absolutely love your performance btw!

For Ruby; What are some aspects of your character that you're excited to explore and try to act out? Lucy is such a complex character so mad respect for nailing her character!!"
Teen Mom 2,Question for Ali: are we going to be seeing more Franklin in future seasons?
Teen Mom 2,"Question for Cameron. 
Do you see any similarities with you and Lockwood?"
Teen Mom 2,"Hi!! Thank you for the amazing work that you've done in bringing some of my favorite characters and stories to life. Question for Joe: Is there a scene from the books that you really wish you'd have kept in the series, but weren't able to? For Cameron, Ruby, and Ali: What was the most difficult scene(s) to shoot?"
Teen Mom 2,"This is amazing!

Question for Cameron, Ruby & Ali: which scene you cherish the most shooting?"
Teen Mom 2,"to all three of you, how have your friends reacted to your breakthroughs as these iconic characters in a Netflix show that is sure to go down as iconic?"
Teen Mom 2,Question for everyone: what do you think is the musical taste of each of the main three?  And how do you think the Problem affected the musical industry?
Teen Mom 2,"Not show related, but for Ali: being that you're a lit student, do you have a favorite book and/or author?!?!"
Teen Mom 2,"for ruby, cameron and ali: any behind the scenes stories/pranks played/moments?"
Teen Mom 2,"Which of the trio would win an intense game of Monopoly- Lucy, Lockwood or George? üòÇüëÄ"
Teen Mom 2,for joe! what's a scene from one of the other 3 books do you look forward  to adapting
Teen Mom 2,[deleted]
Teen Mom 2,"Hey Joe!

Love this show, 2 questions if you don't mind:

&#x200B;

1. What is your creative process when it comes to building characters and a story? Lockwood and Co was so brilliantly well done and I'd love to learn about your process. Hopefully, the script get's released one day as well :) 
2. How did this show come to be? Were you approached by the author or were you a fan of the books?  It's so rare to find a book-to-show adaptation that was done so well. Would love to hear the story.

&#x200B;

Looking forward to Season 2!"
Teen Mom 2,"for everyone - There was a lot of iconic london filming locations this season, what other ones would you want to film at in another season?"
Teen Mom 2,"Hello! This show definitely has a special place in my heart!

My first question is, what can we do on our part to help and ensure the show gets renewed for a second season (besides (re) watching) ?

Second of all, is there some kind of significance to Lockwood's pink socks? What made you make that decision?"
Teen Mom 2,"Not a question, just a comment, Cam, Ruby and Ali's voices are so soothing. They could honestly record an audiobook and I would buy it.  Lovely trio!"
Teen Mom 2,"Lockwood and Lucy's relationship is more obvious to the viewer than it is to the reader since the book is from Lucy's point of view, so now we get to see Lockwood's side as well.

My question is, when do you think was the moment Lockwood started to have feelings for Lucy?"
Teen Mom 2,"To Ruby, Cameron and Ali: 

You guys have mentioned you've seen a few fan-made edits on the show with songs the fandom associates with the characters playing in the background, what songs/music/genres/artists would YOU guys associate with your characters (after all, you know them better than we could ever!)"
Teen Mom 2,To Cameron: How does it feel to be a heartthrob??
Teen Mom 2,"If the characters at Portland Row were to get a house pet, what kind of pet would it be?"
Teen Mom 2,"To Cameron, Ali and Ruby: Assuming all three of you have read all the books, how do you feel about the character of Holly and are you (if at all) anticipating the introduction of this new member of your little family?"
Teen Mom 2,"I just finished watching the show yesterday.  I absolutely loved it.  I think my favorite thing about the show was that the young adults acted like mature young adults rather than immature/soap opera-esque teenagers.  The three lead actors were incredible, and I never felt like I was watching a ‚Äúshow for kids‚Äù.  


As the show creator can you talk about creating this more mature/serious tone? 


For the actors (you guys were amazing-truly blown away), can you talk about your approach to the characters and finding the balance between portraying teenagers but keeping with the more mature tone?  

(Bonus question was it fun using/carrying the swords?  Did you do any training?)"
Teen Mom 2,"hello, my name is mel, i'm 19, i was a HUGE fan of the book series when i was younger and the netflix show means a great deal to me. thanks so much for taking the time to do this!!

joe: are there any scenes you wish you could've put in the show, but were unable to for any reason? and were there any scenes that you instantly knew you couldn't wait to film?

cameron: as this is your first role, how was your first experience as an actor in a big netflix show like this? and do you have any advice for someone like me who'd like to go into the film industry?

ruby: do you have any of your own little 'headcanons' about lucy - like, any little extra traits that you've given her along the course of you playing her?

ali: how easy was it for you to connect to george as a character, and do you see any similarities and differences between you and him? p.s. i am autistic and i see a lot of myself in george, so thank you so much for bringing this wonderful portrayal of him to the screen!!

all of the characters are so perfect and i genuinely think this is my favourite book to screen adaptation i've ever seen. it stays true to the books, and still manages to put its own special little twist on it, and i really couldn't imagine a better adaptation! thank you so much ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Teen Mom 2,Kinda curious what prop/costume/set piece etc from the show are you all most attached to? And may perhaps take home? Lol
Teen Mom 2,When will season 2 be announced? We're on the edge of our seats! Just give us a hint or something
Teen Mom 2,"for cameron and ruby: did you expect there to be a separate fanbase for ‚Äòlocklyle‚Äô shippers while you were filming, or has it caught you by surprise?"
Teen Mom 2,"Question for Cameron, Ruby & Ali: Which scene was the most emotional to film?"
Teen Mom 2,"Hello everyone! Thank you for taking your time to answer some of our burning questions! The show was absolutely amazing. It gave me chills, smiles, and tears, and it certainly was true to the books! Every detail was immeasurably impressive and the writing and acting was marvelous! Really hoping for a season two! It‚Äôd make my year!

Now, for questions!

* There were some tough and emotional scenes throughout the series. In what ways did you prepare and what was your thought process when it came to these scenes? ( Did you consider the character‚Äôs past? Did you think of something sad? Etc.) In this instance for Joe, what made you decide to write these scenes?
* What moment from the books do you wish would have made it on screen?
* Which of the characters do you relate to the most?
* Which episode did you enjoy filming / writing the most and why? Your least favorite episode writing / filming?
* If the trio weren‚Äôt having to deal with cyclical missions and ghosts and were to live a normal life, what would do you think they‚Äôd be doing?"
Teen Mom 2,"For Ruby, Cameron and Ali are there certain techniques of acting you used to prepare yourself? And is it different reading the books when preparing to a role, do you pay attention to certain details?

And thank you so so much for portraying this characters so perfectly! Must have been hard work also which is much appreciated."
Teen Mom 2,Question for everyone: how does it feel bring the leads in such a great show?
Teen Mom 2,"Loved the show. 
How is it filming with different directors? The show felt consistent, but with different people at the helm it would be easy to see how things could get complicated. Unlike with a movie where usually there's one director leading."
Teen Mom 2,"I loved the show, and genuinely believe it‚Äôs one of the best book to screen adaptations out there. The character-focused storytelling is brilliantly written and acted wonderfully. Here‚Äôs my questions: 

For Joe Cornish: When writing this script, since it‚Äôs based on books, were there any challenges in adapting the source material, and any really fun aspects? 
 
For the cast: How did you prepare to take on these roles? Is there anything you do to help get into character?"
Teen Mom 2,"thank you for bringing the series to life in such a beautiful way! this is a question for everyone: if *you* (the actors and joe) were in Stroud's London, do you think you'd be agents? relic men? or something else?"
Teen Mom 2,for ruby and cameron: how would you describe locklyle?
Teen Mom 2,for everyone: what career or path do you think your characters would follow in a world without The Problem?
Teen Mom 2,"Question for Ruby: What was it like stepping into this relatively unheard of and new franchise, having no idea as to where it would head (its popularity etc) from something as big as Bridgerton, and what about the Lockwood and Co world appealed to you?"
Teen Mom 2,For Ruby: What do you think of Lucy's shades of blue wardrobe color? Do you think it matches her character?
Teen Mom 2,question for ruby: whats a trait about lucy that you can relate to?
Teen Mom 2,"Hi Joe! Huge fan of your work, love love love the Kid Who Would Be King and am really enjoying Lockwood & Co. 

I love how your work always balances a fantastical element with a grounded universe, while still doing a fair bit of world building. I'm wondering how you approach that kind of world building and how you find that balance?

An optional second question! I deeply admire your ability to write stories about kids that don't talk down to them, and are appealing to adults as well. I'd love to know what drives you to write such engaging stories about kids - is that a conscious choice? And how do you approach creating engaging kid characters?

......and will we ever see another Tintin movie?!?!!?"
Teen Mom 2,"Love this, love the show! It was wonderful to see Lucy, Lockwood and George come to life in this amazing book adaptation. I would really love a season 2!  
Question for Ruby, Cameron and Ali: What personality trait of your character did you struggle with the most during rehearsal/filming?"
Teen Mom 2,"Do Joe: Did you have a say in the soundtrack of the show because the songs picked were perfect for the show, a big thank you to whoever selected the soundtrack!"
Teen Mom 2,"Joe! I've been such an admirer of your work and am a young producer who also loves this genre and space! Thank you for this incredible adaptation and for the thoughtfulness and love that so clearly went into every detail of this show!

You're often known for discovering and working with young talent and I was wondering if you could talk more about how you foster and support them on set/throughout production. What are some things thoughtful producers and creators should think about that help create an environment for young or newer talent to grow and offer their best work?

And secondly I really appreciated how much you involved Jonathan in an adaptation like this, down to what I read somewhere was having him and Ali consult on George's new last name or even some of the details on set or the Thinking Cloth. I find it unfortunately rare that creators are so collaborative with authors of IP being adapted and wondered how you figured out how to strike the right balance?"
Teen Mom 2,"Hello everyone! Being especially fond of the swordfights, I want to ask to Ruby, Cameron and Ali: did you enjoy learning to use your rapiers? Was it physically demanding?

Thank you everyone for your time!"
Teen Mom 2,"question for ali,ruby and cameron:what was the moment when you laugh the most while you were filming the scene?"
Teen Mom 2,"Hello, by any chance, do you take interns?"
Teen Mom 2,Do you guys have nicknames for each other?
Teen Mom 2,"hii! what would be on lockwood, lucy and george's shared playlist for their ghosthunting trips?"
Teen Mom 2,"for the cast - what's one actor that you didn't share many scenes with in the show, but that you wish your character would've interacted with more?"
Teen Mom 2,what were first and last shootings?
Teen Mom 2,"were there any scenes that got cut out of final versions of episodes? if yes, could you tell more?"
Teen Mom 2,question for all of you: which book is your favourite out of L&Co series? (if spoilers are not allowed just say which one out of 5)
Teen Mom 2,"I just want to show my appreciation for such a wonderful adaptation of one of my favourite book series! I binged all the episodes in a day which shows how much I enjoyed it.

Okay, maybe a quick question for our rising young stars. How do you see yourselves in 5 years time and if there's anything you wish to challenge yourself in other than acting (for example directing, writing, producing etc... Maybe Joe could be your mentor? Haha)? And also if there's any other or specific film genres you wish to play a role in the future?"
Teen Mom 2,"Question for Ali, Ruby, and Cameron: in the case that Netflix does approve for more seasons, what book are you looking forward to adapting?"
Teen Mom 2,"on some of bts photos there were dogs on sets, what are their names and how did they end up stealing all the spotlight on those pics?"
Teen Mom 2,what was your favourite location to film?
Teen Mom 2,"The netflix adaption of Lockwood & Co was so visually stunning and still did the book series justice! 

What scene was most fun to film? Because of the scene itself, or on-set antics?"
Teen Mom 2,"For Ali, Ruby, and Cameron: what talent would you prefer to have? Touch, Sight or Listening?"
Teen Mom 2,"Thank you to everyone involved in this project! It is a pitch perfect adaptation of one of my favorite series of books. Love the cast, the settings, and the whole vibe of the show! Hoping for more seasons as I would love to see Aickmere‚Äôs Department Store and the Fittes‚Äô headquarters scenes on screen. 

Question for the cast: what was the most challenging scene to film?"
Teen Mom 2,choose my lockwood and co themed tattoo PLEASE
Teen Mom 2,"For Cameron, Ruby, and Ali: What is your favorite song from the soundtrack? 

I love the show so much! I had never read the books, but after one watch, I was inspired to read the books! That's how great the show was! Perfect adaptation! After reading the books, i can appreciate the work that everyone put into the show that much more to bring Jonathon Stroud's masterpiece to life. Best show I've seen in years! And the acting was on point! I'm super impressed with Lockwood's character! He was literally copied and pasted from the books to TV lol. Lucy is a badass and George is hilarious and so lovable. Y'all are awesome! :)"
Teen Mom 2,"To all four of you - 

The show's had a chokehold on me ever since I watched it (as soon as it came out) and I haven't been able to eat/sleep/watch anything else because it's always on my mind! I'm not even exaggerating 

So first of all, thank you so so so so so much for this opportunity, my brain is finally at peace.

As for the question, how does it feel to be a part of something as big as this? You guys have put in your absolute 100% and trust me it shows! Not only have you catalysed the spreading of this fandom, but every single person who has watched the show has only had positive stuff to say about it!"
Teen Mom 2,Why does Lockwood wear pink socks? And are they the same ones or does he have multiple pairs lol?
Teen Mom 2,Is Lockwood jealous of Lucy initially that she can speak to type threes?
Teen Mom 2,"What was it like filming the scene when Lucy is ""possessed"" by Annabelle?"
Teen Mom 2,"Greetings from Ukraine! Thanks for the opportunity to ask you a question! After watching the adaptation, I really wanted to read the books, so I have a lot of respect for the painstaking work on the series.  
Before I ask the question, I just want to express my endless love to the actors who played their roles incredibly. This is the best adaptation from netflix in the last year, if not two : ºD  
Questions for Ruby: did you prepare in any way for the role, I mean maybe read books to soak up the atmosphere, or maybe listen to some playlists like Ali. Maybe you were looking for something on tiktok or aesthetics on pinterest? and did you enjoy the fencing lessons before filming?  
Questions for Ali: (George is my favorite character and the way you played him is just amazing). Do you like George as a character? Do you have any similarities? maybe you found some minuses or pluses in your character?  
Questions for Cameron: When I found out that this was your debut role, it was a pleasant surprise for me, because you completely got into the character of Lockwood and his charisma. Did you read the books or maybe some excerpts? Plus you are very good at using a rapier. If you had the chance, would fencing become your hobby? Is it possible that fencing is already one of the hobbies?  
And a question for all three of you: if you had the opportunity to take a vacation as characters from the show, where would you go/fly and what would you do there?"
Teen Mom 2,"THANK YOU FOR THIS CHANCE! The show is incredible! I love it! Everyday I‚Äôm watching it twice! 
Q to Joe: Did you saved all sets, costumes and stuff for maybe a second season or has everything been dismantled?"
Teen Mom 2,"For Joe: Any deleted scenes that had to be cut due to time that could be shared?

And also, could you by chance go into detail on how the red room scene was done with the blood dripping from the walls? What had to be done to get that specific effect? 

For Cameron: What's a specific character dynamic between Lockwood and any other character that you wish we got to see more of? 

For Ruby: What was your favorite part about playing Lucy? She's such a developed character with a pretty big depth of emotions as we saw. Was it difficult to get that range of emotions without it seeming forced at all?"
Teen Mom 2,"Thank you for doing this! I have a lot of questions but I'll try to keep it to a minimum

For Joe:  Why did you decide to have Norrie get ghostlocked instead of ghosttouched?

For Ali, Ruby, and Cameron: What do you think your character's favorite movie is?

For Ruby: What was the transition like going from something like ""Bridgerton"" to a show like ""Lockwood & Co?""

For Ali, Ruby, and Cameron: In what way do you think you are similar from and different from your characters?

For Joe: Who was your favorite character outside of the main trio to write and why?

For all of you: Do you like to watch fan edits or read fanfiction? If so, what's been your favorite edit or fanfic?

For Ali: What do you think George's favorite dish to cook is?

For Joe: What made you want to adapt these books specifically into a TV show?"
Teen Mom 2,"For anyone: Which scene was the most difficult and/or took the longest to film? 

Bonus random question: what‚Äôs your favorite ghost movie?"
Teen Mom 2,"Question for everyone: what‚Äôs something that you could see the characters doing together that we don‚Äôt see in the books or on screen? Ex: dance parties to relieve stress, everyone piling into the library for a book club, etc"
Teen Mom 2,"To Ruby and Cameron,

Q: How would you guys describe Lucy and Lockwood's relationship?"
Teen Mom 2,"How do I audition for your show? They say to be bold and ask, so I'm trying!"
Teen Mom 2,For Cameron and Ali: Can you guys confirm your birthdays? The internet is going crazy trying to find them out haha
The Challenge,Most people in the US wont care until the majoroty of our coverage is ACTUALLY OLYMPIC EVENTS rather than 90% commercials + commentators.
The Challenge,"I tried watching, but they kept cutting away from what was stated in the programming guide. I distinctly remember having to change the channel like 3 or more times over a short span of time, as they kept moving the broadcast of one event from channel to channel."
The Challenge,"I found them unwatchable this year but for the following reasons. The time delay, the constant commercials breaks that come at any moment, the obsessive focus on star athletes and when star athletes fail the coverage is obsessively focused showing every second of their emotional devastation, the horrible cringeworthy interviews immediately after said star athlete failed, cross country skiing is always on for some reason."
The Challenge,"For me personally, I couldn‚Äôt stand watching an event for 30 seconds only to watch 5 minutes of commercials and combine that with the commentators being absolutely abysmal."
The Challenge,I stopped watching when they split screen ads while people were competing.
The Challenge,"They were talking on the radio about this earlier. Ratings were down about 40% compared to the previous Winter Olympics. They wondered if it was just because it as hosted by China or if it was COVID related. They didn't think it was time zone related as the previous winter olympics was in South Korea. 

I did find it interesting that other TV shows decided to go head-to-head with them. Some did take the 2 weeks off but some didn't. I wonder if they knew the ratings for the olympics would be bad."
The Challenge,I‚Äôm pretty sure the message should be to stop letting NBC be the sole network to show the games. They‚Äôre prime time programming is basically unwatchable and almost everything else directs you to their app or streaming service which is equally terrible
The Challenge,And how about enforcing doping measures and cheating?
The Challenge,"There there. 

Now is anyone up for a bit of football? We‚Äôve got a World Cup this year!"
The Challenge,"When Russia got caught, and then here they are still competing, there is no point and the rules don't matter, so I could care less about Olympic competition."
The Challenge,"I think it's a bit of everything. Olympics in an authoritarian regime that we're pretty tired of hearing about at this point, the cruel joke that is the ""ROC"", the weirdly recent summer Olympics, and the age of streaming.

Edit: Oh and I forgot that for one of the most popular sports (men's hockey) none of the actual world class athletes compete!"
The Challenge,It has literally nothing to do with it going to a tyrannical government and almost all to do with NBC coverage being garbage. Atleast for America
The Challenge,I think the real  message is  not many people really care about the Olympics anymore.
The Challenge,I‚Äôm over the olympics regardless of where they are at. Everything is just too complex and ridiculous to be fun. Just endless drama about steroids and people crying and the athletes complaining. Even the summer olympics had plenty of that.
The Challenge,NBC is just going to blame China and covid rather themselves. I feel like most of America didn't even know the events started until a week in. Also I feel like if it doesn't snow in a city....that city cant have the WINTER Olympics.
The Challenge,Ratings have been falling for virtually everything on television this past decade because Nielsen doesn't measure the expanding streaming market.
The Challenge,The more probable reason for low viewership is that the summer Olympics were just a few months ago.
The Challenge,"Well that but also because NBC is stupid and the ""games coverage"" had nothing to do with the games but rather just a bunch of blathering idiots talking about crap no one cared about with constant ads and then like a reference to a game every hour or so. There wasn't any real coverage of actual games going on. Just highlights"
The Challenge,"Tbh I think it has fuck all to do with people being upset that it's in China.

Most people I know didn't even know that the games had started. They were competing against the superbowl. The advertising sucked. They got rid of the pro hockey players which is by far the biggest sport and biggest name stars of any of the winter games. And somehow Russia is still here and still cheating. Plus it's the winter games which just aren't as interesting to begin with.

 So why the hell would we expect anyone to care ."
The Challenge,"A major factor is that there have been three Olympics in a row with incredibly inconvenient timezones for North American and European viewers, so you have to *really* want to watch them to tune in."
The Challenge,"They should send a message to NBC that their schlock human interest stories about rich kids learning to ski at age 2 and the jingoism and patriotic propaganda is garbage, and maybe they should show three or four minutes of sports between ads"
The Challenge,You can't watch it free and there's ads when you waste peoples time no one will care.
The Challenge,The IOC are corrupt as fuck and governments need to be boycotting the Olympics anyway.
The Challenge,World Cup in Qatar coming up‚Ä¶will be interesting to see ratings given the egregious human rights abuses that went on to build the stadiums there.
The Challenge,Sorry NBC s coverage is garbage. Reverb the online videos are a nightmare to find and watch
The Challenge,"This is a gigantic reach. How many people are actively protesting China vs don't care about skiing, snowboarding and curling?

People have so many more options of things to watch now it's so easy to tune out anything you don't care about. For a lot of people niche winter sports probably fall into that category"
The Challenge,"I don't know how this factors in, but everybody I know didn't watch a second of broadcast TV coverage, but watched the shit out of the coverage on Peacock."
The Challenge,"I will call out china‚Äôs government as much as the next person, but let‚Äôs be honest: the low ratings are more of a critique on the Olympics, and the way they‚Äôre broadcast, than they are of the Chinese government.

You can barely even watch them, they‚Äôre so inundated with ads."
The Challenge,"That is not the message. It‚Äôs the market saying fuck all these over produced, overly dramatized, overly politicized sporting spectacles that enrich a bunch of executives."
The Challenge,"I think this article missed the entire point...
The IOC is the cancer

Olympic medals no longer stand for excellence, the stand for total corruption and greed.


The fact that the olympics have become a propaganda machine for nations with current ongoing genocide within its border is actually only a symptom of the larger malignancy at work here. 

If the goal is to celebrate humanities finest, the goal has to be overarching and all encompassing 

The games need to be sustainable, the facilities need to be built with a plan in place for them to be of continued value
To the community, they have to by constructed under humaine conditions, paying a living wage to the people building them, and the facilities should have a reasonable environmental footprint...

Its a joke really  I did not watch this year  not 1 minute, and im proud to have voted firmly with my viewership."
The Challenge,"NBC's coverage is awful.

I don't know where to watch it and I'd rather consume it on demand.

It seemed like cheating was ok this year. 

I hate all the inspirational ads that pretend this isn't another thing where a bunch of rich people are making millions off of poorly compensated amateurs."
The Challenge,Honestly I tried watching there were too many commercials. They completely lost me before the half pipe snowboarding event even started.
The Challenge,I feel like the problem was less that Beijing was holding it and more that NBC did their standard dreadful job of airing it.
The Challenge,[deleted]
The Challenge,"Another Olympics thread in r/television full of people who never have any intention of watching the Olympics taking the opportunity to pat themselves on the back because *this time* they didn't watch for a noble reason.

There are plenty of reasons ratings are down, but the impact of the Games being in China is massively overrated in this sub (and on Reddit in general)."
The Challenge,"totally what happened, people didnt want to watch because of the tyrannical regime hosting them. Talk about a spin so hard Araki would be proud"
The Challenge,People just don‚Äôt care. It has nothing to do with sending a message to China
The Challenge,"I mean there wasn‚Äôt really anything good about watching these games.  The games were on the other side of the planet so watching it was delayed by 12 hours already the results got out so you know who won long before it was on tv. When it WAS on tv, you had 2-3 minutes of commercials to every minute of the damned events and they would just jump over to another event with no warning. I was watching snowboarding, went to get a drink and figure skating was on, like wtf happened!?!!  The commentators were fucking awful, like this wasn‚Äôt even the C team, this was the people that responded to a Craig‚Äôs list ad.  Add to that the abyssal shit about China hosting a game about international fellowship while holding entire ethnic groups in fucking concentration camps."
The Challenge,Are we sure this is the reason and not that people just don‚Äôt care about the Olympics? I have no idea why anyone would spend much time watching them.
The Challenge,"The Olympics have become a money machine. There should be a 15 or 20 moratorium. Then, pick 4 or 6 sites to use for each Games. Quit selling to the highest bidder."
The Challenge,"western media: china REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

actual people that watched it: jesus christ too many fucking ads"
The Challenge,Is it really China to blame? It didn‚Äôt seem like people really gave a shit about the Tokyo Olympics either.
The Challenge,For the first time in a long time I did not watch any of the events. Didn‚Äôt even look at medal scores
The Challenge,"I always used to love the Olympics!  Watching athletes who are the very best at what they do was thrilling and enjoyable.

Then.................. it turned into a medal competition between countries and that was the focus.  

Add to that the shitshow that is the IOC, the doping scandals and how they are handled, the focus on the ""stars"" instead of all the competitors, the awarding the Games to various countries that should never have them -- I haven't watched in years."
The Challenge,"I mean, NBC does a terrible, horrible job covering the Olympics, but I don't know I would go as far as calling them a ""tyrannical regime."""
The Challenge,"Maybe I am being dramatic, but I intentionally did not watch the Olympics for the first time in my life. It just felt wrong for so many reasons."
The Challenge,"I can't help but shake that this feels like Amero-centric horse manure. The author himself admits that the dismal ratings he's talking about fall entirely on North America, where not only were most events going on while people were asleep (even night owls would be hard pressed to enjoy these games live without sleeping all day as a result) but there wasn't the sort of Must Watch Event that draws in so many NA viewers that they have it live at 4AM in Beijing like Phelps's races.

Olympic ratings in the US are more about the commercial appeal of NBC's business plan and Team USA's results. People tired of the soap opera effect that NBC made by building ""celebrity"" Olympians from 1998-2014, and none of the rah-rah nationalist narratives they like to build up were any compelling."
The Challenge,"Wanna fix the Olympics?  Here's what you do:

1. Execute the IOC board.  With extreme prejudice.
2. Ban Russia.  Forever.
3. Permanent host cities.  Have five or six cities in rotation.  This eliminates the problem of useless and unused venues once a Games is over.  Athens still has baseball fields from the 2004 Olympics; baseball and softball are unknown in Greece.  Imagine rotating between LA, London, Tokyo, Paris and Sydney every four years for the Summer Games.  Or between Vancouver, Peyongchang, Torino and Oslo for the Winter Games.  Large, infrastructure-laden cities in wealthy democracies (and the US) that have the means to construct and maintain the venues without bankrupting the nation (insert Athens 2004 joke here).
4. Execute the FIFA board.  For spite."
The Challenge,"Can we address the elephant in the room? Nobody in America cares that it was in China. Like, they might care a little, but the people who are refusing to watch the Olympics because of totalitarian regimes are already not watching. There are millions and millions of people that would have watched it in years past that are no longer watching it because the product is complete shit. The coverage is terrible. The commercials are incessant. The outcomes are already know if you bother to Google search for 10 seconds and we have a plethora of media that is specifically tailored to our interests and probably dozens of streaming shows are looking to catch up on. Why should I watch the Olympics? If they want interested viewers maybe they should make more compelling coverage. You can just air the Olympics these days and expect people to care."
The Challenge,"The Olympics declining ratings over the last decade might be exactly why it was hosted in China again in the first place. The 2008 olympics were a massive success for china for a number of reasons. 

>[""Hosting the 2008 Summer Olympics was a symbol of China's rejuvenation,""¬†writes historian Zheng Wang. ""Through the extravagant opening ceremony, the Chinese government showcased China's historical glory and new achievements ... unassailable evidence that China had finally 'made it'.""](https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/21/asia/beijing-olympics-2008-2022-soft-power-dst-intl-hnk/index.html)

While its yet to be seen if the Winter Olympics has had the same success, hosting the Olympics in China creates a mutually benificial relationship for both the IOC, by granting wider access to the massive Chinese market, and the CCP, by using the Olympic coverage to project soft power domestically and abroad, that other countries may not have or need.

>[Lee Jung-woo, an expert on sports diplomacy and international relations at the University of Edinburgh, said the 2008 Games ""enabled China to demonstrate its emerging economy status.¬†The 2022 Winter Olympics could help them to revamp their image from a world factory to a world power.""](https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/21/asia/beijing-olympics-2008-2022-soft-power-dst-intl-hnk/index.html)

I wouldn't be surpised if we see more of this. The IOC will go where the money is and countries like China have much more practical reasons to front it."
The Challenge,"Yes blame China, I'm sure the gazillion of commercials, sob stories and ""personalities"" had nothing to do with it."
The Challenge,"Found myself scrolling reddit with Olympics on in background and not paying any attention at all.  They should have rules, interesting facts demonstrations accessible via QR on the screen to increase viewers engagement."
The Challenge,The IOC‚Äôs corruption is only surpassed by FIFA- maybe. The olympics are a rigged joke.
The Challenge,Pretty sure everyone hates NBC more than we hate China.
The Challenge,"> The challenge is to be sure they never go to tyrannical regimes again.

Really? Or are we just seeing the ongoing plunge of TV viewership (in the US) in general?  https://variety.com/vip/fading-ratings-how-far-broadcast-tv-has-tumbled-since-2015-1235124641/

Having a plethora of other things to watch on myriad streaming services means that people aren't stuck with having to watch the olympics. Honestly, were it not for the occasional reddit blurb or Russian doping scandal on NPR, I wouldn't even have known the olympics were happening."
The Challenge,They don‚Äôt understand that we are in the age of the highlight. Nobody will watch a broadcast when you can watch the winners on YouTube in 3 minute bites.
The Challenge,"Yeah, that's a load of bs.  People aren't not watching the Olympics out of moral outrage, they're not watching the Olympics because they don't give a shit about the Olympics. [Tokyo 2020 was the least-watched ever](https://www.sportsmediawatch.com/2021/08/olympics-ratings-nbc-lowest-ever-viewership-summer-winter-tokyo/#:~:text=The%20Tokyo%20Summer%20Olympics%20averaged%2015.6%20million%20viewers,million%20for%20the%20PyeongChang%20Winter%20Games%20in%202018.) until now, and Japan isn't a tyrannical regime.

I live at a former Olympic site, it's always huge here and yet not a single person has seemed interested in it this year despite our town trying to milk it like it always does.  The Olympics just aren't that important to people anymore."
The Challenge,Coverage just sucked. Absolutely horrific. Probably intentional to make China look bad.
The Challenge,I forgot the Olympics even existed.
The Challenge,Yeah. Fuck the Olympics. I‚Äôm going to watch the World Cup next.
The Challenge,The Olympics was on?! I had no idea
The Challenge,"for me it was a combination of

* being in a country with a despicable government
* filled with cheaters and drugs
* in the middle of a global pandemic
* and at the cusp of ww3"
The Challenge,"I stopped watching 25 years ago for all the reasons listed.  Too many commercials, focus on ‚Äústars‚Äù of the day and their struggles etc.  You never get to see much actual sport happening.  With the change to every 2 years it feels like one never ending waste of time.  And then all the issues with the $$$$ and corruption."
The Challenge,"In Australia it had really good views, the focused on the technical aspects. I really enjoyed the ice skating commentary, you could tell that the presenter love the sport and new her stuff."
The Challenge,"As much as I agree with not normalizing tyrannical/genocidal countries, I feel like that is burying the lead when:

* Much of the Olympics was only available through Peacock.
* The commentating/editing was offputting and didn't focus enough on just showing the sport. Also the level of ""human interest"" stories would make the NFL draft blush.
* All the ads.
* The fact that there just was a summer Olympics like 6 months ago.
* And finally the world is trying to claw out of a pandemic, facing inflation, steeped in a housing crisis, stuck with supply shortages, on the brink of war, etc. We all might be a bit distracted."
The Challenge,The IOC clearly demonstrated that neither genocide nor the drugging of children were beyond the pale for them.  Talk about total moral bankruptcy!
The Challenge,Or maybe we just don't give a crap anymore about niche sports.  I wouldn't have watched it no matter where it was held.
The Challenge,"It's not the venue, it's the coverage."
The Challenge,"Let me tell you it has nothing to do with China. 

It‚Äôs a mixture of this late stage Covid where the economy is dogshit and people are too busy trying to survive, mixed with terrible NBC coverage filled with ads, and the cherry on top is more and more people opting out of network TV in general so you‚Äôve lost a big chunk of those ‚Äúlet me see what‚Äôs on the TV while I cook and clean, oh look the olympics‚Äù people. 

In the age of streaming it‚Äôs so much easier to just look up highlights for your favorite event later"
The Challenge,The real message is that NBC coverage is fucking awful and has actively stopped people from watching.
The Challenge,do they really think its bc its held in China? i wouldnt have given a shit if it was held anywhere elsw
The Challenge,"Speaking strictly from my own experience, I don't know anyone in meatspace or otherwise who cares about the Olympics, at all. I feel like whatever cultural relevance the Olympics had has been long overshadowed by how many problems it brings with it and how much bullshit is involved to even watch it."
The Challenge,"IOC: We're sorry

Also IOC: 2036 summer Olympics will be in Dubai"
The Challenge,"tyrannical regimes? US ratings must be down too then

Only the world's largest 10x more funded aggressor 


400+ military bases in nearly every country on earth


Don't throw stones from glass houses"
The Challenge,Has nothing to do with China The games are just trash. Not surprised to see more propaganda though.
The Challenge,something tells me we wouldn‚Äôt see an article like this if the games were in saudi arabia
The Challenge,Anti China propaganda detailing the effects of mass anti China propaganda.
The Challenge,Lol dude if you‚Äôre an American you cant get on a moral high horse over a government killing Muslims
The Challenge,I hope something similar happens with the Qatar world cup.
The Challenge,Damn so I guess the US is out on hosting??
The Challenge,Isn‚Äôt the US hosting in a few years? I doubt there will be this outcry when that happens.
The Challenge,The fact they were in China was not a consideration in my lack of viewing
The Challenge,Since the Olympics are forever being politicized it might be best to retire the whole idea.
The Challenge,"The ratings have nothing to do with the host country, and everything to do with the fact that the Olympics sucks and no one cares about it."
The Challenge,"As long as the Olympics make money, the IOC won't give a damn about anything else.  And while networks will pay for broadcast rights and corporations will pay for ""official"" Olympic status, it doesn't matter if *nobody* is watching at home."
The Challenge,So CANADA is off the list then.
The Challenge,"Sports with no fans is not interesting. Thats the takeaway. I watched some hockey games, snowboarding, and some other sports and the lack of crowds sucked the soul out of the place."
The Challenge,"Also, the broadcast strategy and execution totally sucked.  Every night on prime time, we got figure skating.  Not everyone likes figure skating but when we all get home from work and turned on the Olympics, we got figure skating 9 times out of 10.

Also, the minute I saw Peacock was mentioned, I was immediately out.   I‚Äôll never pay for peacock so if they want to put the cool events behind a paywall, I‚Äôll just watch something else.  I don‚Äôt know if NBC even did this, but I hate peacock so much that my perception is reality.

Lastly, the commercial load was an absolute disgrace."
The Challenge,"As much as I love the optimism that it was because of the human rights issues I think the combination of people cutting the cord in record numbers and NBC's reputation for their godawful olympic broadcasts are the main reason. The last olympics people didn't realize how bad a broadcast could be, this time around people were very aware especially with the summer olympics being so fresh in everyone's mind."
The Challenge,"The continually decaying quality of coverage by NBC over the years is as much or more to blame for the ratings.  I'm not giving China a pass on their human rights record or the Communist regime, or all the stuff we know about that nation's government by any means.  Plus - I think here in the states, there is a definite Olympic fatigue.  Fatigue over the coverage, fatigue over the marketing..."
The Challenge,We just had an olympics and NBC is awful at it.
The Challenge,"If the IOC pledge never to hold the Olympics in tyrannical regimes again, boy are the 2028 Los Angeles Summer games gonna be in trouble"
The Challenge,"TV rating were low as fuck but it was NBC's most streamed winter games ever....

https://www.axios.com/beijing-winter-olympics-viewership-record-low-fall-5c63c7f1-ff34-49df-943a-f7d896a2930a.html"
The Challenge,I watched a lot of it. It was fine... people just love to complain.
The Challenge,Olympics are as meaningless as the academy awards now.
The Challenge,Fuck the Olympics. I won‚Äôt watch a single second of it.
The Challenge,"Meanwhile, 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, for which thousands of slaves died on its construction sites."
The Challenge,I think I watched this one the most out of all of them ü§£
The Challenge,"I think the ratings being low had nothing to do with ""tyrannical regimes"". I didn't watch them because the presentation in the US is terrible. It's all cut up and strewn with commercials."
The Challenge,It‚Äôs definitely not because of ‚Äòtyrannical‚Äô regimes.. no one cares about Winter Olympics and a handful of people care about the regular Olympics.
Black Ink Crew New York,I just hope they brought in good writers and it still has the ‚Äòmature‚Äô feel that Netflix show had.
Black Ink Crew New York,Petition for Colin Farrell to wander off the NYC set of Penguin and onto the Daredevil one for old time‚Äôs sake.
Black Ink Crew New York,My optimism for this show has been dwindling as more news comes out. I‚Äôm glad punisher is back but not bringing back foggy and Karen is kinda ridiculous.  They were really important to the Netflix series. Daredevils cameo in she hulk didn‚Äôt really give me a lot of confidence in this show as well.
Black Ink Crew New York,[deleted]
Black Ink Crew New York,Now we wait and watch for Deborah Ann Woll and Elden Henson to appear in New York.
Black Ink Crew New York,Foggy and Karen better be in this show. And we all know there is only two people that can play them or else there will be keyboard riots.
Black Ink Crew New York,You know punisher is going to come in and commit a bunch of offscreen deaths with intense grunting so Disney can keep that pg rating. I also can‚Äôt imagine a more ruthless villian than s3 bullseye- lots of silly over the top fights with no danger incoming.
Black Ink Crew New York,"It's funny that I would have been so jazzed about this show about three years ago.

Now, with the state of the MCU and how badly the Kingpin character was fumbled in Hawkeye, the very idea of this show fills me with dread.

Especially after the news that Jon Bernthal's Punisher will be returning - how on Earth is that going to fit into the Disneyfied MCU?"
Black Ink Crew New York,Stoked to watch it in 2027 on my Netflix Disney combo cable package
Black Ink Crew New York,No Karen no foggy? What gives?
Black Ink Crew New York,i don't care anymore honestly. whats the point if they aren't bringing back all the cast members.
Black Ink Crew New York,"Just please don't do the Electra storyline again, that seems to be the only thing they believe Daredevil did."
Black Ink Crew New York,"Here's what I want from this Daredevil series that might be unpopular: I want it to be episodic. I don't want a single epic storyline that spans eighteen episodes, I much prefer tight half-an-hour case/villain/drama of the week stories peppered with occasional small story arcs involving major antagonists, in the vibes of The Mandalorian S1.

Explore the streets of Hell's Kitchen, expose the plight of the common people and working-class citizens, show their lives in a world where the existence of Superheroes has become mundane yet interesting all the same.  It's okay to not have bloody street fights, erotic scenes, and gruesome spectacles, but don't lose the mature theme and introspective angle that the old show had.

May the devil truly born again."
Black Ink Crew New York,Tough for me to get excited about the show if it's going to be missing the gritty/dark themes that made it great
Black Ink Crew New York,"It is funny to see Daredevil fans now argue, ""No Karen is a dealbreaker!"" when you know, her character was controversial during the original run.

And honestly, the only thing I can remember about her and Foggy was the constant, endless, you can't be Daredevil conversations. 

I am nervous about the Disneyifying of the show, but I can't get too worked up about those two not being there."
Black Ink Crew New York,"I‚Äôm not excited from anything marvel related anymore. They keep saying they will push boundaries and make something fresh  but it‚Äôs the same stuff.

I‚Äôll just wait and see what they make"
Black Ink Crew New York,I have a bad feeling about this
Black Ink Crew New York,If you liked the Netflix version save yourself the pain and avoid this lol.
Black Ink Crew New York,I need all the cast member :(
Black Ink Crew New York,"Don't plan on watching until they confirm Foggy and Karen

If they're not in it then you're already fucking it up. Even the 2003 movie knew you can't exclude Foggy Nelson from Daredevil!"
Black Ink Crew New York,"Im in panama and disney plus has all of thr marvel shows on it, unedited!

I hope this means more blood and maturity"
Black Ink Crew New York,"Normally I'd be super excited, Daredevil is my favorite MCU show, but these latest MCU shows havent been too hot. They're pretty soulless and lack any of the drama the Netflix shows brought."
Black Ink Crew New York,"Oh‚Ä¶..on Disney+‚Ä¶.. Yeah, I can‚Äôt wait ‚Ä¶.. I‚Äôm sorry, I don‚Äôt mean to be a Debbie Downer, but these Disney+ shows are fucking garbage. I have almost no interest in this. Some of the Star Wars stuff, mainly Mandalorian, are cool, but the Disney+ Marvel shows have been a fucking nightmare. Wanda/Vision was cool, I‚Äôll give them that, but everything else up to and including She Hulk has been disastrous."
Black Ink Crew New York,"It still cheeses me that they‚Äôre subtitling a show about a famously Catholic character ‚ÄúBorn Again‚Äù. Is he going to show up to a tent revival, get re-baptized, and start speaking in tongues?"
Black Ink Crew New York,People are hoping it‚Äôs trash so bad lmao
Black Ink Crew New York,"Oh, with Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner right?"
Black Ink Crew New York,I hope they don‚Äôt do another season where the ‚Äòsuper hero‚Äô isn‚Äôt super for 90% of the season again. The last season of daredevil that I watched should have been called Kingpin considering the show seemed mostly about him with occasional scenes where daredevil was sad and broken in a basement.
Black Ink Crew New York,Shame Foggy and Karen aren't returning.
Black Ink Crew New York,"Oh good more Superhero drivel. It's like Hollywood thinks all audiences are idiots. Let's see, there will be a big event that makes it ""hard"" for our protagonist, it's going to look impossible or he's going to quit, then in the end he triumphs!

There saved you $50 and 2hrs."
Black Ink Crew New York,I didn't watch it on Netflix and I'm not gonna watch it on D+.
Black Ink Crew New York,Does anyone actually watch daredevil?
Black Ink Crew New York,Glad the show is filming - that news site is eye poison! just ads as far as the eye can see.
Black Ink Crew New York,This show going right or wrong will define whether or not I continue to give a fuck about the MCU.
Black Ink Crew New York,Who's the news caster?
Black Ink Crew New York,Born again? I thought he was catholic.
Black Ink Crew New York,"I remember when they were filming the end-credit scene of Spider-Man: Far From Home in NYC. My office was literally around the block and I went to lunch early to watch them film. By that time the main cast was gone and they were just filming with extras, but it was super cool to see. It was also super cool watching the film for the first time, trying to figure out which scene it was that they were filming. Color me shocked when I realized! üò≥üòÇ"
Black Ink Crew New York,"‚Äú it starts.‚Äù

-Timon"
Black Ink Crew New York,Is this supposed to be based on the Frank Miller comic run of the same name?
Black Ink Crew New York,I still want Karen and Foggy back.
Black Ink Crew New York,"Am I alone in that I didn‚Äôt care for Foggy or Karen? I get they were integral to the Netflix show, but also, their storylines felt like they ran opposite from Dare Devil/Matt Murdock after the first few seasons."
Black Ink Crew New York,Will the series still be 18 + rated?
Black Ink Crew New York,I wonder how many dumpsters he's going to wake up in this time around
Black Ink Crew New York,Give me Foggy or give me death!
Black Ink Crew New York,Is Charlie cox finally going to face off against stilt man? Cox loves him some stilt man.
Black Ink Crew New York,[deleted]
Black Ink Crew New York,"The writing is credited to Matt Corman and Chris Ord, neither of whom worked on the Netflix Daredevil series."
Black Ink Crew New York,"Lucky for you, they brought back NONE of the Netflix writers and hired rejects from the Arrowverse instead!"
Black Ink Crew New York,"Yeah a lot of disneys content is missing maturation. Mando and Andor did ok. That‚Äôs about it. The rest as been pretty bland and the marvel stuff has been especially forgettable. 

Anyone rewatch any part of moon knight? Me neither."
Black Ink Crew New York,I‚Äôm hoping (and expecting) a new direction. We saw Matt dragged through hell multiple times in that show. It‚Äôd be nice if this took inspiration from his more swashbuckling runs. He ended Season 3 in the absolute best place he‚Äôd ever been in.
Black Ink Crew New York,Lol. That's wishful thinking. This is a Hollywood super hero movie. The writing will be insulting.
Black Ink Crew New York,No chance
Black Ink Crew New York,"I saw a great clip that Bernthal said he won‚Äôt play Punisher for Marvel unless he‚Äôs sure they will keep his brutality and violence.  

They got him in this show."
Black Ink Crew New York,"They‚Äôre going to ruin the Netflix Daredevil *and* Punisher, it‚Äôs inevitable.

Did you see what they did to one of the best villains ever, Kingpin? Completely ruined the character in Hawkeye."
Black Ink Crew New York,"You're adorable.

Disney's Marvel is about being inoffensive and squeaky clean while shoehorning in ill timed humor.

We already saw Kingpin's character mercilessly trampled on in Hawkeye. 

This series isn't going to be anywhere near as gritty as what was showcased by Netflix."
Black Ink Crew New York,"I was thinking about this the other day but it is wild how ""childish"" all of the Marvel stuff has become over time.

Looking back to the origins of the whole thing like Iron Man, Captain America 1+2 etc there was some mature stuff but most of the content now has a very PG feel to it.

Where most series mature over time to tackle darker and more serious conent with their audiences (think Harry Potter) Marvel seems to be regressing to the lowest common denominator 

Not everything needs to be broody and pouty but watching Thor be a punching bag himbo of jokes for a few franchises in a row now is just annoying"
Black Ink Crew New York,yah I got news for yah
Black Ink Crew New York,Aw I wanted the same writers who wrote She-Hulk. (Sarcasm FYI)
Black Ink Crew New York,"Bro, they made a moon knight show where he blacks out when any of the good stuff happens and in episode like 3 he manages to have a completely bloodless knife right."
Black Ink Crew New York,"I‚Äôm a little scared bro, they brought in a writer from CW‚Ä¶ ü•≤"
Black Ink Crew New York,I wouldn‚Äôt be so hopeful.. this is going to be another shitshow
Black Ink Crew New York,You're gonna get She-Hulk writing at best and you are going to love it!
Black Ink Crew New York,Did you see daredevil twerking with she hulk? We‚Äôre not getting a mature show like Netflix . Disney won‚Äôt make this TVMA.
Black Ink Crew New York,I‚Äôm just glad Ben Affleck has work after losing the Batman role.
Black Ink Crew New York,Don‚Äôt have much hope for that. All their tv shows have had grit.
Black Ink Crew New York,"Its going to be woke shit. Just look at the other disney+ marvel shows. The punisher is coming back to tell people off for using the wrong pronouns.

The MCU went terminal after endgame. This will be no different"
Black Ink Crew New York,Are they shooting Penguin in NYC?
Black Ink Crew New York,"I mean, he was in the Affleck movie. He could come in from there given the multiverses."
Black Ink Crew New York,She hulk was also a pos‚Ä¶
Black Ink Crew New York,"Same here. I just don‚Äôt have faith that they‚Äôll keep the really gritty tone of the Netflix show, and that was a huge draw for me. I‚Äôm still willing to give it a shot, but I‚Äôm not holding my breath"
Black Ink Crew New York,"I feel like it'll just be daredevil does as an MCU show full of superheros. None of the gritty character drama, relatable and fun supporting cast etc"
Black Ink Crew New York,For me it kind of depends on how much court room and legal focus there is. Obviously you'd assume it's a factor considering it's Daredevil but if the story focuses more on other aspects maybe it'll work.  I def don't want to recast and also will be annoyed if there's a lot of legal drama story but no foggy or Karen.
Black Ink Crew New York,Yes
Black Ink Crew New York,"Everything is canon, but also they don't give a shit about continuity, so who cares."
Black Ink Crew New York,Especially after how Woll was treated by Netflix it would be super bad optics to recast Karen.
Black Ink Crew New York,I saw an article that said they wont be returning pretty definitively
Black Ink Crew New York,"I just remember Elden‚Äôs acting was off, like really off. Especially when he had to do scenes with the rest of the gang"
Black Ink Crew New York,According to Debroah Woll she won't be back and it looks like Froggy won't be either.
Black Ink Crew New York,"I'm definitely a little concerned that they've grabbed the ""cool"" characters like Fisk and Punisher, and decided to pass on Foggy and Karen. They were the heart of the Netflix show, and it'd feel super weird to have all these other returning actors but not them."
Black Ink Crew New York,They aren't. This show is gonna suck
Black Ink Crew New York,I don't understand why people are so bothered about these characters. I felt like their storylines had run their course. It even felt as if the writers were pulling narratives out of their arses to keep these two involved.
Black Ink Crew New York,"I truly hope not.  They are the only badly written parts of Daredevil.  

Foggy didn‚Äôt fit the show at all.  Really hope they replace them somehow."
Black Ink Crew New York,"Not quite sure why these two characters were so loved, I literally stopped watching the show because they whined to much"
Black Ink Crew New York,Truly I want Jessica Jones back but I'm also like......can you imagine a Disney+ Marvel show handling her well? I can't imagine Disney+ or the movies letting her speak about Killgrave bluntly or even calling what happened to her at his hands rape.  And you kind of need to be able to have those discussions to do her justice as a character. Then again the films talk about Nebula having forced surgeries performed on her so maybe they'd be willing to go darker? I want to be optimistic because I liked most of the Netflix stuff but I'm not holding my breath either.
Black Ink Crew New York,"Jesus wept. A guy makes a cameo in a tonally different series (it was Christmas themed, for fucks sake) and it was ‚Äúfumbled badly‚Äù? Because he wore a Hawaiian shirt and didn‚Äôt beat anyone to death with a car door in the, what, about 15-20 minutes of screen time he had? And it ‚Äúfills you with dread‚Äù. Chill the fuck out lmao it‚Äôs a comic book show."
Black Ink Crew New York,I‚Äôm not sure how you could call Kingpin a fumbled character when he was barely in that show and is pretty much confirmed to be returning.
Black Ink Crew New York,"Honestly, I'd be ok with the Andor treatment- three episode mini-arcs that lead into each other. Seems perfect for a character like Daredevil"
Black Ink Crew New York,You‚Äôre in luck. Leaks say that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre doing
Black Ink Crew New York,I think this is why I love Season 1 so much. Many of the episodes felt like self-contained stories while still contributing to the main story arc.
Black Ink Crew New York,"I‚Äôd prefer something between what you describe and the structure that was applied to *Andor* (i.e., broken into arcs comprising duologies/trilogies, with a limited number of thoughtfully placed solo episodes to bridge the divide between them). 

It worked really well for *Andor* and could easily serve as a viable template for any number of series wanting to strike a balance between contained arcs exploring different corners of the world, and building a coherent mythology with an ongoing serialized story."
Black Ink Crew New York,"Well you just might be happy because that's exactly what strong rumors suggest they're planning to do. And I think why it's the reason it's the only one to have 18 episodes. This would be the first Disney+ Marvel show that they seem to be treating like a proper TV show and not an extended movie. Which is why despite all the doomer comments by people in here, I'm still looking forward for the show. It's also a plus that they hired an actual lawyer to write the courtroom scenes."
Black Ink Crew New York,">Don't plan on watching until they confirm Foggy and Karen

The two worst characters played by the two worst actors on the show üíÄ"
Black Ink Crew New York,"It's the name of a Daredevil comic book storyline, although they kind of already adapted it for season 3."
Black Ink Crew New York,"People want it to be good, netfoix daredevil seasons 1 and 3 are probably my favourite things to come out of the mcu. The warning signs for it being terrible are everywhere though."
Black Ink Crew New York,"I'm *hoping* it's great, just *expecting* it's trash. In my opinion, Disney+ shows so far have been extremely weak. Only exceptions are Andor and to a lesser extent The Mandalorian."
Black Ink Crew New York,Jennifer Lopez‚Ä¶
Black Ink Crew New York,That describes nearly every story in human history though.
Black Ink Crew New York,"Yes, it was very popular"
Black Ink Crew New York,Probably not. Elements of Born Again were worked into seasons 2 and 3.

The Sound of Your Heart,"Tbh, I was glad they got rid of the subtitles."
The Sound of Your Heart,"I loved that they actually made the whole suit for the big guy and he did Kathleen right by the video game. No CGI used at all. 

Also, who didn't know Henry would do that????"
The Sound of Your Heart,"Actually they ended up using CGI for the final cut for better movement for it, and ended up using the suit as reference. So what you ultimately saw was CGI."

>Dear Adam Curtis: I wish I could adequately tell you how much your work has changed my life - my thinking, my visions, my academic work.  I share your work with my students - and while some of it is beyond them (it is hard to know history when it is kept from you...) - the ways that you connect dots in space and time challenges them so much, they are almost always silent when the film ends.  This film is central to a transformation in the thinking of freshman and sophomores in my Social Psychology class - when we talk about How We come to Know our ""Selves""...and the attachments to STUFF that are not organic at all.  You inspire me so much - I admire this work - ALL of this life work you have done.  You are a diligent, vigilant, dedicated public servant, my friend.  Thank you for ALL of this.  Thank you for taking these risks and sharing these masterpieces with the world.  It is a better place because YOU are making in it!

The Sound of Your Heart,"not completely? but not in ways they likely intended. the bbc has a long history of right-wing editorial stances, most notably in recent history having to do with trans issues, but the star power was always skewed the other way, so this didn't really come up. they're happy to keep platforming jk rowling and graham linehan to spout utter nonsense, because they were big(ish) names and raised a stink about being ""cancelled"" otherwise. now, suddenly the shoe is on the other foot and it's a problem? weird how that works out"
The Sound of Your Heart,"The BBC

He has addressed the irony of this in several interviews

I also recommend the Power of Nightmares and HyperNormalisation

Just not in my top 10. Also explicitly excluded is The Simpsons (which would have been included if they'd stopped after season 7, but at this point they've sucked for almost four times as long as they were great).

The Sound of Your Heart,Lost..
The Sound of Your Heart,Oooh. Band of Brothers. That's worth considering.
The Sound of Your Heart,Please tell me you don't mean the Netflix House of Cards.
The Sound of Your Heart,What is Fleabag? I feel like I've heard of that before.
The Sound of Your Heart,Great list ‚Äî a number of these would also be in mine
The Sound of Your Heart,"Not the sopranos and then you go pick some of the corniest shit ever seen on tv. I'll give you The Wire and Breaking Bad. But the Mary Tyler Moore show? Bobs Burgers? Monty? Freak's and Geeks? You think those are better than Better Call Saul, The Sopranos, Succession, Game of Thrones, It's always Sunny and Curb? No way"
The Sound of Your Heart,"Interesting then that The Wire and Breaking Bad are on most of the lists posted here, and yet you're literally the only person to mention Andor."
The Sound of Your Heart,Andor. The most boring Star Wars has ever been. They made a series about a character from a spin-off movie. Disney is clueless on what direction to go with Star Wars
The Sound of Your Heart,"Fuck. I forgot Twin Peaks.

Sorry Doctor Who. Hit the bricks."
The Sound of Your Heart,"It's a British comedy/drama written by & starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge. ""Fleabag"" is the main character and we never learn her name. The show is basically about her coming to terms with choices she's made in the past. Season 2 in particular is probably the best season of TV I've ever seen.  

There are only twelve half-hour episodes in total and it's on Prime so I would definitely recommend it."
The Sound of Your Heart,The Mary Tyler Moore show was absolutely groundbreaking. It's hilarious even today.
The Sound of Your Heart,Sorry our tastes differ. Thanks for the insults. Freaks doesn't have an apostrophe. Most of what you mention will disappear in a decade but Monty Python and Mary Tyler Moore will still be remembered as classics.
The Sound of Your Heart,Oops
The Sound of Your Heart,I am one of those who think Andor is overhyped and I cannot even finish half of it so you do not have to preach to me. I am just joking that the sub loves it so much they will put it as a top 10 greatest.
The Sound of Your Heart,[deleted]
The Sound of Your Heart,"You can never be too sure nowadays with how far standards and intelligence have dropped. Personally Andor mid, but mid is good for Disney Star Wars."
The Sound of Your Heart,"Ok. Now I know your opinion. I'd say Monty Python and Mary Tyler Moore are more legendary and will stand the test of time better. It seems very important to you to ridicule that opinion, so, whatever."
The Sound of Your Heart,[deleted]
The Sound of Your Heart,"It just seems like a dull conversation. You don't want to engage, just to strut about proclaiming your opinion is superior and mine is stupid. Duly noted. Bored now."
The Sound of Your Heart,"FX is the king of sleeper hits you wouldn‚Äôt have even considered   

I‚Äôll give any of their shows a try at this point."
The Sound of Your Heart,Oh shit it‚Äôs Lip from Shameless. That guy‚Äôs a damn good actor. Definitely down for a watch.
The Sound of Your Heart,"We found that one of the reasons we felt such anxiety the whole season is that you would have a phone ringing in the background nonstop. Like god damn, someone get the phone!"
The Sound of Your Heart,"*Yes, chef*"
The Sound of Your Heart,"So, like working in a restaurant?"
The Sound of Your Heart,CORNER!!!
The Sound of Your Heart,"""69 all day, Chef!""

\*edit\* it clearly shows here I wrote ""chef"" but for reason it came out ""boss"" ...huh"
The Sound of Your Heart,"Carmy‚Äôs jacked. If he spends all his time and energy at the restaurant, how is he so jacked?"
The Sound of Your Heart,"Great show I binge watched it in one sitting. Jeremy Allen White is exceptional, I hope this gets him more roles. Matty Matheson is my hero and plays a great part."
The Sound of Your Heart,That ending had me in tears. >!Everything after he made the connection with Mikey and the sauce cans was some of the best TV I‚Äôve seen in recent memory.!<
The Sound of Your Heart,"Let it RIP....You don't have to agree with me, but Jeremy Allen White's acting in scene where he talks about him and Mikey..is some of the BEST piece of acting I have ever seen"
The Sound of Your Heart,Agreed.   Episode 7 when the shit hit the fan ....reminded me  of my pharmacy when everyone wanted everything  at once. I left and finished the Episode in the other room .  This is almost like a less dysfunctional version of Shameless... another Jeremy Allen-White  program  that was on Showtime
The Sound of Your Heart,"This has been compared to Uncut Gems in terms of making the viewer uncomfortable and stressed. That was one of the first movies to incite that uneasiness in me. I'm not sure I am ready to do that to myself again.

*edit : After all your lovely comments I went and watched the first two episodes. Holy fuckballs. This show is absolutely fantastic. I.have no doubt the drama will be heavy as well when they get into the brothers death, but the pacing, acting and dialog are killer.

Thanks all for setting me straight! Might be my.second favorite show of 2022. I mean, Better Call Saul will always have my top prize. Although I am a bit biased because I got to film with Bob last year. Look for me in the Gene scenes in Ep 10, July 23rd ;)"
The Sound of Your Heart,"It's a great show, cousin."
The Sound of Your Heart,"Definitely one of the best things to come out this year. Short and sweet, they knew what they wanted to do and did it."
The Sound of Your Heart,Episode 7 gave me the only panic attack in my life that I actually enjoyed. Felt so real.
The Sound of Your Heart,"Its a really great show but I couldn't watch it.

Its like the other great show on FX is the old man, and that's like secret agent stressful, the Bear is like my shitty job stressful I can't deal. 

Great show, not for me."
The Sound of Your Heart,Brought back so much stress and latent PTSD from my line cook days. Love it. Favorite new show.
The Sound of Your Heart,My favorite thing is Hulu promotes the show as a comedy.
The Sound of Your Heart,"Ok, I thought it was just me and my anxiety issues that made this so stressful to watch.  I had to get up and pace because I almost couldn‚Äôt handle it.  I hung in there because Jeremy Allen White is SO FUCKING GOOD.  That monologue in the last episode.  Jesus Christ.  I‚Äôve been thinking about it for days."
The Sound of Your Heart,"For anyone who likes The Bear, I recommend a recent Stephen Graham film called Boiling Point.It follows the same 'nightmare day at work' feel in a restaurant, and is entirely done in one take."
The Sound of Your Heart,Lip just can‚Äôt get out of Chicago.
The Sound of Your Heart,Did anyone else get boyfriend vibes from Marcus and his roommate Chester? I feel like they are more than just friends
The Sound of Your Heart,"Wife and I binged the whole show on Sunday, it's great"
The Sound of Your Heart,Heard.
The Sound of Your Heart,"‚ÄúAny of you incel, Q-anon, 4chan, Snyder cut motherfuckers wanna get out of line now?!?‚Äù"
The Sound of Your Heart,This show gives me anxiety. It's somehow fantastic lol
The Sound of Your Heart,"Great show, but I don't get the ""cousin"" thing. I've never heard people call each other cousin like that. Is that a Chicago thing?"
The Sound of Your Heart,"As someone who has worked in restaurants for 10+ years, this is the closest a show has ever gotten to accurately depict what it‚Äôs like to be in the kitchen. Plus, Ayo Edebiri is a fucking star."
The Sound of Your Heart,"Episode 7 ‚Äúthe review‚Äù is the most amazing, loud, weird, and emotional and thought provoking episode on current tv. 
Highly recommended!"
The Sound of Your Heart,"It‚Äôs really quite a show.

I worked for a chef recently who came from the 3* world and the personality similarity is shocking. It really captures the feeling of some different parts of restaurant service amazingly, though there are some details that aren‚Äôt *quite* right.

I also lost my best friend 18 months ago and those notes have resonated pretty highly with me, I‚Äôve cried a few times in the first two episodes."
The Sound of Your Heart,This show is well done but I had to bail because it‚Äôs just so anxiety inducing to watch
The Sound of Your Heart,"One of the best shows anywhere right now. Just a great show that really gets your heart rate up. Totally know this family, totally understand the dynamics. Totally gets the work place. It's just too real that's what makes it so good. The writers, producers and directors need to be given a fuck ton on money."
The Sound of Your Heart,Episode 7 was one of the best episodes of television I have seen in a long time.
The Sound of Your Heart,How does it compare to films like Boiling Point.
The Sound of Your Heart,Just wrapped it up in 3 days‚Ä¶it is genuine and an adrenaline ride. Loved it and would highly recommend!!!
The Sound of Your Heart,This show is really good! Have 1 more episode to go.
The Sound of Your Heart,"Man, I really tried to watch it.  The conflict is too stressful for me.  I don't understand why, as the rightful owner of the restaurant, he didn't threaten to fire all those disrespectful chucklefucks halfway through the first day.  Instead he just kept screaming ""Please!  Please!"" all the time.

When I correctly predicted some mobster type would show up to shake him down, because no way they wouldn't take the opportunity to add to the drama, I decided it's not for me."
The Sound of Your Heart,Still waiting to watch it in Canada
The Sound of Your Heart,"Unless you‚Äôre in canada and can‚Äôt watch it, even though it was advertised that you‚Äôd be able to."
The Sound of Your Heart,This is not the first time I‚Äôve seen this exact post title posted on Reddit. This is a paid spam/shill account.
The Sound of Your Heart,Article is almost unreadable due to the constant movement of the text as more and more ads get pumped onto the page. What a disaster.
The Sound of Your Heart,I want to give this show a try but I'm worried it's just misery porn.  Does it have levity and humanity or does it just leave you feeling bad?
The Sound of Your Heart,"I‚Äôve watched a few episodes and the acting has been terrific, but I‚Äôm trying to figure out the point? Like‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs the arc?  This might be like Mad Men. Everyone loves it, but nothing ever really happens."
The Sound of Your Heart,"Yeah I'm not sure who binged this. They're either stronger than me, or have never worked BOH."
The Sound of Your Heart,"This is funny bc my friend and I started watching it this weekend and 5 minutes in I said, ‚ÄúThis is giving me anxiety, I can‚Äôt watch it.‚Äù I just had to up my Lexapro. I‚Äôll give it a whirl after it kicks in."
The Sound of Your Heart,"I‚Äôm 5 episodes in. 7.5/10 for me so far, it‚Äôs good not great. Maybe that opinion will change by the end"
The Sound of Your Heart,I know what you mean. I really enjoy it but I‚Äôm tired after watching. It‚Äôs really intense.
The Sound of Your Heart,"If you love the character [Neil Fak (Matty Matheson)](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm8274309/) do yourself a favour and check out his show ‚ÄòJust a Dash‚Äô on YouTube. It‚Äôs his hilarious and surreal cooking show that demands to be seen.

The Sound of Your Heart,Feels like I‚Äôm watching the Gallaghers all over again. Love it!
The Sound of Your Heart,Watched it in 2 days. I want 50 more episodes.
The Sound of Your Heart,"It‚Äôs a great show. We‚Äôll written and superbly acted. But I really have to give the entire crew props for their long camera shots and one shots. 

There are some really long scenes in this show without camera edits or cuts, whether it‚Äôs focusing on one character doing a several minute monologue, or in one case they do a 10-15 minute one shot following various characters around during the chaos of a dinner service, all in one take. From a technical perspective it is incredible to watch."
The Sound of Your Heart,Is this an ad?
Hindenburg,"I had no idea this was a thing. Not for the first time, I‚Äôm glad I bought Buffy on DVD all those years ago. "
Hindenburg,"Wow, those eclipse shots on the remaster are killing me. It looks like they were looking up for no reason!"
Hindenburg,"I‚Äôve just rewatched Buffy and said to my partner how HD really shows up the dated CGI etc, blaming it on the original film. How wrong was I? I had no idea it was remastered and that was the cause."
Hindenburg,"What a crime, it pains me that a lot of people will experience the glory of Buffy for the first time with this butchered version."
Hindenburg,It's a real twist of the knife learning that they did a better job with Charmed. 
Hindenburg,"Jesus, Xander's plastic face at 12:44 is a nightmare."
Hindenburg,Oh my gosh they CROPPED IT to get a widescreen aspect ratio! What?!?!
Hindenburg,"If you want to see a quality back to the neg restoration, check out this job done on pee wees playhouse [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8sBhnJhI7E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8sBhnJhI7E)"
Hindenburg,Geez everything is daytime in the remaster
Hindenburg,"So they just released the Once More with Feeling musical on vinyl for the first time. Mondo had a blue splatter version that sold out in 60 seconds while all the other versions have been selling like hot cakes. Can someone please explain why there hasn't been a blu ray/4k restoration of the series so far? The demand is clearly there even if it's already on Hulu. All we want is the complete series on a proper restoration. Come on, Whedon and Fox. "
Hindenburg,"this is depressing. I was just thinking of starting a rewatch of the show on my commute, but it looks awful. An HD Remaster would be great but if it's done like this, guess I have to buy the DVDs (again). What a shame!"
Hindenburg,"Damn this is really infuriating.

Also baffling."
Hindenburg,"I remember seeing the video about how had the HD version was. I didn't think it could get worse, but this utter travesty is proof that it can."
Hindenburg,Which version is currently showing on hulu?
Hindenburg,"Netflix in Canada still has the original up, AFAIK. I really hope they don't switch to the remaster. Honestly the original still holds up pretty well, considering it was always supposed to be a bit campy and tongue-in-cheek.   


Also the TNG remaster looks absolutely fucking awesome. I have to agree."
Hindenburg,What's a real tragedy is that this is a 20 minute video as opposed to a 5 minute read with video clip examples.
Hindenburg,The channel is great despite the name in case anyone is wondering. 
Hindenburg,"At this point I can't take any YouTube titles seriously.

""Worst Ever""

""Tragedy"" 

""Disaster""

""Why X is the Absolute Worst""

Like fuck's sake not everything is the Hindenburg."
Hindenburg,Didn't watch. Can I get TL;DW?
Hindenburg,Christ...5 minutes ito the video and this fucker is still setting up the premise. What is wrong with people? You‚Äôre not THAT entertaining.
Hindenburg,Shit like this is why I'm not a fan of any remastering.  There are too many fuck ups and when that happens the originals go away and you can only get the fucked up version.
Hindenburg,"The budget allocated to the remaster process has to be related to expected demand for the content, no?

I was never a buffy watcher but if it had such appeal and demand then surely they would have given it the X Files treatment and not a quick cash grab for streaming services? "
Hindenburg,All I could hear is a guy trying to sound like Agent Smith.
Hindenburg,It‚Äôs not a story a Vampire would tell you...
Hindenburg,Wow that sounds great tv 43 169 tv means 4k cropped
Hindenburg,Well I just panic purchased Buffy DVDs off eBay
Hindenburg,I'm in the same boat as you. I own all the DVDs and had no idea this was even a thing. This is a fucking travesty.
Hindenburg,"I'm glad I still have Once More With Feeling on VHS recorded off of the air.  

I don't think I still have a functioning VHS player, but I'm glad I have the tape.  "

Hindenburg,"In English, doctor! [We ain't scientists!!](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SB-gCJfA3Vk/maxresdefault.jpg)"
Hindenburg,"Well to be fair, the CGI is still pretty dated on the non-HD version as well. "
Hindenburg,"What about people who experience the buffy of Glory?

Oh, six days ago. Well I've written it now."
Hindenburg,"Different companies and one cares more than the other. Paramount/CBS remastered Charmed and as a whole Paramount is really fantastic with TV remasters as shown with the HD versions of Twin Peaks, Star Trek, Twilight Zone, and others. Meanwhile Buffy is owned by Fox, who barely cared about having proper HD releases of theirs modern shows, let alone also doing a good remaster for an old show."
Hindenburg,"He's a putty man. 

That smoothing filter they use makes anyone with wrinkles into a monstrosity."
Hindenburg,"They did this with *a lot* of programs which were ""protected"" for future widescreen use. I still prefer the DVDs for shows like Friends because of this. Even though the picture quality is obviously better on the HD versions, a lot of the framing is just off."
Hindenburg,"And without rhyme or reason. There was a thread I was following that showed how a scene was cropped in an episode, but during a recap, it would show the full frame. It's like no humans were involved in the remaster. The 16x9 versions from the Europe broadcasts with all the equipment in the frame look better than this. "
Hindenburg,"I watched this a while back, but I don't think that's what happened.  They filmed it in 16:9, but knew they were going to crop it, so on the edges of the 16:9 shots are a lot of people, camera equipment, etc.

When they did this remaster, they just used the original 16:9 footage, obviously never noticing or caring that it was showing things which were never meant to be showed.  Which is even worse than cropping."
Hindenburg,Whoa
Hindenburg,...I did not know this was coming to vinyl. This revelation made my day. 
Hindenburg,I was lucky enough to get the splatter version! I was so excited. But it seems Whedon must not have a say in this since i doubt he would have allowed for all the crews hardwork to get butchered as it was. Also id definitely argue that Buffy has one of best and strongest fanbases of almost of any tv show. So for whatever reason Fox must not give two shits about any of it. 
Hindenburg,I recently started a rewatch on hulu. And it seems to be the original version. Since when i started i was actually kind of annoyed I couldnt get an HD viewing. But it seems Hulu spared me from witnessing a crime.
Hindenburg,"Hulu is not showing the HD remaster, thankfully. I hope it stays that way."
Hindenburg,"As soon as I watched the video i was wondering this, thanks for asking 5 hours ago ;)"
Hindenburg,"Netflix took Buffy off about 6 months ago, but I can confirm it was the original. I did a rewatch last year. "
Hindenburg,[deleted]
Hindenburg,"I dunno, if anything the title could be more hyperbolic. That's how bad the buffy remaster is."
Hindenburg,"Worst, most tragic disaster of a comment ever. "
Hindenburg,Are you suggesting that the Buffy HD Remaster is *not* the greatest tragedy in the history of Western civilization?
Hindenburg,"Somethings are.

The Hindenburg for example."
Hindenburg,"Yeah exactly.
I mean, the Hindenburg was pretty bad. But it wasn't nowhere near the Buffy Remaster."
Hindenburg,Absolute the most disturbing comment on Reddit! You would never believe what he wrote!!!!
Hindenburg,**DESTROYED**
Hindenburg,"Buffy the Vampire Slayer has been remastered in HD from the original film reels, but a lot of mistakes have been made in the process. Changing the aspect ratio has left crew members and lighting rigs visible, filters changing the lighting to make a daytime shot into night have been removed and in some cases there is severe cropping and zoom-in- likely due to an automated and unsupervised process.

This is in contrast to the fantastic Charmed, X-Files and Star Trek remasters.

Their [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/BuffyHD/) has a lot of good comparison screenshots if you're interested in seeing some examples. "
Hindenburg,"Using the original material but didn‚Äôt re-apply the color filters from the original. 
Cropping the picture in a really bad way, especially when there‚Äôs a legit 16:9 version of the material. 
Filter makes faces look like mannequins. 
Redoing the effects in a worse way than they did in the 90s. 

Those were the worst for me. "
Hindenburg,"The Star Trek remasters were all handled exceptionally, in my opinion. 

The X-Files remaster was excellent, with the exception of messing up some of the fonts (the logo for example)."
Hindenburg,"The Wire remaster is excellent, but that's mostly because David Simon insisted on personally getting involved "
Hindenburg,"There are many good remasters. He mentions a lot of them. *The Wire* remaster for example was good, and you can even still choose between watching the original and the remaster on HBO."
Hindenburg,That‚Äôs like saying Baumgartner Restorations is equal to the lady who did Ecce Homo.
Hindenburg,"I was just reading the other day about the Sailor Moon remaster. Cleaning up the color clarity and little janky animations of a 25 year old show? Great! Except in the process they goofed up and made it so every now and then there's frames where someone's talking but their mouths aren't moving, when that *wasn't* an issue before.

And I know personally I've decided against buying the remastered Blu-Rays of stuff because reviews say the remastered blu-ray actually looks worse than the much cheaper DVD."
Hindenburg,"I was really close on pulling the trigger and buying The Shield blu-ray  last christmas. But there were no reviews of it before launch, and the people on the Shield subreddit said that they don't really see much high-definition to begin with, and it may be because they packed in too many episodes per blu-ray disc, and the bitrate quality suffered. So what's the point?"
Hindenburg,"Both Buffy & The X-Files were shot on film and there's enough present on the negatives to go to 16:9.  The issue is that TXF blocked for 16:9 when they shot it, and BtVS only blocked for 4:3.  As a result, shots that would otherwise look good without additional work in TXF would require removing cast/crew/equipment from BtVS.

That said, they could've gone the Star Trek route and not changed the damn aspect ratio."
Hindenburg,"I don't think so. Take the old Disney animated films, which I'd guess sell really well yet the remasters are awful. Compared to the Looney Tunes shorts remasters which are really well done but are much more niche."
Hindenburg,I dont know what the other guy's problem is. The show had a cult following but it was a WB network show that moved to the UPN network. Presumsbly smaller than a Fox show. My earnest guess is they went with a cheap route and figured the fanbase would buy anyway. 
Hindenburg,"dude you are not allowed to say that on reddit, buffy is the greatest thing ever and we all want to suck joss whedons delicious dick, while he makes up some of his brilliant ""natural"" dialogue where everybody just cracks jokes in any situation without any reason  "

Hindenburg,"Yeah, it seems like the worst of both worlds. "
Hindenburg,Clearly you didn't watch the video
Hindenburg,"Nope, as the video says, in many shots rather than using the full frame of the original film, they cropped the 4:3 frame that was cropped out of the 16:9 film to get a result that shows _less_ of the scene than you‚Äôd see on the original 4:3"

Hindenburg,"Good to know! Thanks. It‚Äôs clearly not how business works but I wish professionals who were fans of Buffy did the remaster...or ya know, anyone who cares about their work. "
Hindenburg,"Ah damn. Glad I finished it before that, then."
Hindenburg,"IIRC, while the series was filmed in 16:9, they blocked shoots for 4:3, so crew/equipment/etc are visible in many shots.

Hindenburg,"> The Star Trek remasters were all handled exceptionally, in my opinion. 

The TNG remaster was exceptional, and it's too bad that it is the exception and not the rule. But the cost vs return of it didn't equate to profit, unfortunately. It's why we won't get a DS9 remaster. "
Hindenburg,I watched The X-Files for the first time about 2 years ago. I was blown away by how good it looked.
Hindenburg,"Those are the exception, not the rule. A great remaster takes a lot of time and money. Unfortunately, the bottom line tends to win out because they know fans aren't inclined to spend hundreds of dollars in a properly remastered series.  "
Hindenburg,Its more a cost of doing it vs. expected sales. I was asking if Buffy was a small audience show (despite the acclaims) which would mean no point in spending a fortune remastering it. Compare it to Star Trek (built in huge global demand) and X Files (smash network TV hit) which have a bigger expected sales number and therefore justify the expense.
Hindenburg,"That got me thinking. 

As we've moved forward in time since the heyday of VCRs, are we even recording on them any more? 

Does't the R cease to be correct at some point? "
Hindenburg,"That's what I thought originally as well, until I caught one of the widescreen reruns a couple months ago and a joke which relied on visual information at the bottom of the screen was missing its punchline."
Hindenburg,"I know you had to dig far into my first post to see this so I'll repost it.

> I watched this a while back, but I don't think that's what happened

Oh wait, that's right, that's literally the first thing I said.  It's been a while, I might be remembering wrong, but I think this is what I remember happening.  And apparently, from other responses, I was half-right.  Sometimes they cropped, sometimes they just used original footage which left in stuff which should have never been in the shot."
Hindenburg,"Well, looks like I am going to spend money soon."
Hindenburg,"Yes but other shots were violently cropped for no apparent reason. Plus often crew/equipment in shot could have been painted out rather than cropped, if they had any interest in quality."
Hindenburg,"> But the cost vs return of it didn't equate to profit, unfortunately

I felt that it was because they were pricing them at over $100 per season when they came out. No one was buying them at that price."
Hindenburg,It never before occurred to me that VCR stood for video cassette recorder.
Hindenburg,It's possible they do both
Hindenburg,How long ago could you have possibly watched it?
Hindenburg,"I posted this 20 minutes after the video was uploaded. You're thinking of the [one from 4 years ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F28XcxHxH6k), which highlighted many of the same issues in seasons 1-3; a new video was made because all 7 seasons are now finished, as explained in the video. 

re. the cropping- as you say, sometimes they used the 16:9 it was filmed in, and there are a couple of scenes where crew or lighting rigs are visible. But other times they zoom and crop the 4:3 to 16:9 without adding anything, even though it was clearly available. Examples: [1,](https://www.facebook.com/BuffyHD/photos/a.728353297266961/789315251170765/?type=3&theater) [2,](https://www.facebook.com/BuffyHD/photos/a.1077963388972615/1078035828965371/?type=3&theater) [3.](https://www.facebook.com/BuffyHD/photos/a.1077963388972615/1083899531712334/?type=3&theater)

There are more examples in both videos or on the FB page: [https://www.facebook.com/BuffyHD/](https://www.facebook.com/BuffyHD/)"
Hindenburg,"If they were smart, they'd rescan the negatives at a higher resolution, and re-apply as many FX shots/filters as possible, but _not change the damn aspect ratio_ and they'd still have a good product when compared against the original interlaced TV broadcast."
Hindenburg,"Yeah that was a big part of the problem. I think the execs are still too focused on seeing short term profits. Are they truly appreciating how long of a tail a great HD remaster of a classic like Buffy or DS9 could have? Even if there was a high initial cost to the remaster, it would turn a profit eventually. It's been 20 years since they went off the air and people are still talking about them; the demand is there. But if they just leave them as SD or with horrible remasters then eventually people will stop tolerating the poor visual quality (relative to other more recent shows) and their popularity will fade to nothing. "
Hindenburg,"I think this was the original video I watched about it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F28XcxHxH6k

Posted 4 years ago"
Hindenburg,"That's better than what they did, for sure. But a good editor could take the extra native film real estate and use it to give an even better result than the original ratio."
Hindenburg,"I really wanted them, but it was ridiculously overpriced. I never ended up buying them after they came down in price; I just rented them from the local library in HD."
Hindenburg,"Wow, more of you thinking things. It got us so far the first time."
Hindenburg,"Personally, I'm hoping the show will eventually start moving away from doing a historical event every week.  Having the team constantly go back in time to foil whatever Flynn is trying to change is going to get repetitive quickly, even if that was spread over two episodes instead of one.  There does seem to be some sort of overarching storyline they have been hinting at (ie Rittenhouse), so hopefully that becomes more of the focus as the show goes on."
Ranczo,Damn a lot of people still watch GOT
Ranczo,Poland with Trailer Park Boys in the top 10 lmao
Ranczo,"Hey FYI  - the French show ""The Bureau"" is by FAR the best espionage/spy/thriller TV show out there. Makes shows like Homeland look amateurish. I would highly recommend it."
Ranczo,I'm glad to see that *Dead to Me* made the list.
Ranczo,Surprised Dark isn't on here. Most overlooked show of all time.
Ranczo,"This is fun, would be fun to see this every month (or if you could do it, make a site that automatically updates  each day)"

VIVA LA MERDA"
Ranczo,"Wow, ""Hollywood"" so high. Too be fair the first episodes were interesting but then it turned to a cringey cheesefest if there ever was one."
Ranczo,"Damn feel like I really need to watch Money Heist now. Happy to see The Last Kingdom on that list, it‚Äôs such a good show."
Ranczo,"I'm surprised The Last Kingdom was that high.  I've enjoyed the show, I just didn't know it was that popular."
Ranczo,"Kirin Ga Kuru - does anybody know how to get hands on those NHK taiga dramas with english subtitles? 

There was once one about Yoshitsune and ""Tales of the Heike"" on youtube, but unfortunately it was pulled after a time so I could never finish it. It was a bit overly long but I found it still very interesting, and learned a lot about Japanese history."
Ranczo,Proof that popularity and quality are not always related. Peaky Blinders LMFAO.
Ranczo,"Had no idea Westworld was so popular, am always surprised when it gets renewed each year since nobody really talks highly of it. As someone who loves the movie and really enjoyed season 1, the show turned to absolute shite after it embraced its embarrassingly simple and shallow themes on feminism 101 and introduction to socialism, and the dialogue is atrocious. So much wasted opportunity for a fun and genre bending sci fi show. I was hoping it would be canceled and then rebooted properly in ten years."
Ranczo,Never heard of Money Heist
Ranczo,"Right lol I've seen a lot of people on reddit try to push a ""no one cares about GOT since they ruined it with the last season"" narrative but it seems like a lot of people are still watching the show even a year after it ended."
Ranczo,Doesn't this just mean people are looking up Game of Thrones on Wikipedia? Seems like the type of show where there would be a lot of people looking up stuff about it even if they hate it or aren't watching it.
Ranczo,"Well now I‚Äôm intrigued, never heard of it. Thanks for the suggestion, I love well made espionage shows"
Ranczo,"Dark is a great show that I would not recommend to most people. It is like watching Primer, which is also a good movie but not something I would recommend to people."
Ranczo,Dark is on there for Germany.
Ranczo,You are welcome :) [https://wikirank.net/#tvseries](https://wikirank.net/#tvseries)
Ranczo,"Thanks, we plan to prepare detailed description in the next research and submit the paper to scientific conference/journal soon.  On the other hand, if some of ""overclockers"" will known how we do that, they will prepare additional ""cheat codes"" ;)"
Ranczo,"That link took me to some alternate world where Wikipedia ain‚Äôt in American, I dint like it."
Ranczo,you should look it up on wikipedia
Ranczo,"reddit just likes to act like they're smarter than the rest of the population to make themselves feel better. They do the same thing with the movie Avatar. ""There is no cultural impact it's a trash movie blah blah blah"" lmao"
Ranczo,"That's because, despite what many Redditors will have you think, most people watch TV for the journey and not the destination. A few stinkers at the end don't erase all the prior successes of a TV show in the same way that, say, a bad film ending makes the entire film bad."
Ranczo,"I think anyone who finishes the show is so disgusted by it, that turning on it is inevitable."
Ranczo,"Yeah pretty much which also explains why 'Hollywood' is so popular since it also features some old hollywood stars, not surprised if people are looking those up. It doesn't really mean 'a lot' of people are still watching it but it's a safe assumption I guess. Most shows don't really need to get wikipediaed."
Ranczo,It‚Äôs by far the best one if you can get past the game subtitles it‚Äôs great. Ultra realistic
Ranczo,"I always recommend Dark. 

I warn against Primer."
Ranczo,Yeah but even there it's #10. Should be much higher in general.
Ranczo,What movie? There is only the animated series.
Ranczo,Yes. It's a wonderful show! I need to start my rewatch before season 3 comes out.
Ranczo,"Do it, you won‚Äôt regret it. I just finished another rewatch of S1 & S2 in preparation and am contemplating doing it. I‚Äôve tried to start other shows since I finished my rewatch about five days ago...but the quality of Dark is so good it feels like others can‚Äôt compare right now."
Tiny Pretty Things,Nobody is watching this show for the writing.
Tiny Pretty Things,"I don't know what it is, but I really enjoy messy teen dramas with (potential) murder mysteries. 

Pretty Little Liars, Tiny Pretty Things, Elite. 

Are they completely ludicrous? Yup. 

Am I gonna continue to watch them? Yup."
Tiny Pretty Things,"Agreed, it was sooo bad but so goooooood. I‚Äôll legit be disappointed if it doesn‚Äôt get picked up."
Tiny Pretty Things,"I agree, it was really awful...but I also watched the whole thing. The dance scenes were the thing that kept me around. It was absolutely ridiculous."
Tiny Pretty Things,"I started it because Dance Academy is one of my favorite shows, and I couldn't even make it through the pilot...I do plan on trying again with lower expectations though."
Tiny Pretty Things,"You said it in your headline, it's very entertaining, no matter what you think of the quality.  For me the dancing and the gratuitous nudity more than made up for any plot holes.  Most shows have the plot holes without the bennies. ;-)

And I agree that ""Bette"" was by far the best actor in the show and has a ""made for the camera"" face.  If anyone breaks out from this, it will be her."
Tiny Pretty Things,This show really was pretty little liars but make it ballet üòÇ
Tiny Pretty Things,I‚Äôm still scratching my head about that ending tbh.
Tiny Pretty Things,Do that many teenage boys really care about ballet? About half the school is made up of male dancers.
Tiny Pretty Things,"Man, I don‚Äôt know how you can possibly criticize this show... without mentioning that totally clusterfuck ending episodes where the storylines didn‚Äôt make any damn sense at all, suddenly one person loves another one out of nowhere, a nearly falsely committed murdered is just walking around without a worry in the world, we can‚Äôt even tell whose side anyone is ok because they kept switching allegiance out of nowhere, most of those relationship storylines are nearly dropped and tossed out the drain and everyone‚Äôs just dancing around performing on stage while people are getting pushed off buildings and getting stabbed lol. The characters are terribly written (safe Bette and the teacher whom I thought was a quite compelling character) and one of them is suddenly killed off for whatever reason. I thought ‚Äúeh, this show is actually pretty meh and the murder shit got me hooked‚Äù but those last two episodes just caught me off guard, like wtf happened? All in all, I‚Äôm definitely up for a season 2."
Tiny Pretty Things,I literally just googled this because I was thinking the same thing. I‚Äôve never found it so difficult to get through a series. And I love ballet stuff.
Tiny Pretty Things,"*Let's talk about the elephant in the room here too, the fact the everyone's naked goddamn near half the time*

A friend of mine worked on the show as part of the production crew. He enjoyed the experience."
Tiny Pretty Things,It was so terrible! I especially noticed how terrible all the actors were. And how completely far fetched the plot was. Absolutely horrendous. But I watched it until the end.
Tiny Pretty Things,"I just wanna say that Pretty Little Liars writing was better than the writing in this show.  Of course, it's been years since I've watch PLL so maybe I'd change my mind if I saw it now but this show's writing was just terrible.  Lol.  Some of it didn't even make sense or things would just happen out of no where, like people getting together that didn't even have a lead up to them getting together. 
Also that moment where it's so randomly noted that the choreographer is what's her faces father was so wtf?? ü§£

So many moments throughout the show.  I did finish it though, couldn't stop watching but I'm also a dancer so I loved the dance aspect, had it not been about dancers I would not have watched.

I did like Shane though, he was fun and that other kid.  I can't remember everyone's names tbh.  Lol


The MOST annoying part of the show is that bitch Bette that everyone defends for no reason.  She is so horrible the entire show and they make it out like she's actually a good person... um... no.  I wanted to see someone knock her lights out lol"
Tiny Pretty Things,"I thought that the series would be bad BUT that I would enjoy watching it. I really wanted to. But honestly, it isn't good, not even for guilty pleasure. 

The story is bad and almost all the actors too. The book is better, I don't really get why they didn't just copy it. It could have been a good-easy to watch TV show with the book story."
Tiny Pretty Things,I really liked Dance Academy. Thanks for mentioning other decent ballet shows.
Tiny Pretty Things,"You can just say you enjoyed it, you don't have to act above it. 

It knows what it is and you know what it is (since you ended up watching it all and even say it entertained you). 

Don't put a front, just enjoy what you enjoy."
Tiny Pretty Things,"I have only seen the trailer for it on Netflix but from that, I could tell it was just a pretty little liars lookalike in a ballet setting. IDK why anyone would  expect:

>the step by steps of chorography, the development of dancers or the other intricacies of dance

Based on the previews, all the teens and the aforementioned PLL similarities, I did in fact expect a terrible plot, a lack of logical thinking and an overabundance of nudity and sex scenes.

Thanks for watching and writing this up so I know my suspicions have been confirmed and I can comfortably skip this. I will say though, as someone else commented, there are people who enjoy this type of teenage mystery/PLL clone so I guess the networks will keep churning them out until they go out of fashion. At any rate, the audience for this is most likely not the audience of Dance Academy."
Tiny Pretty Things,Whatever
Tiny Pretty Things,https://discord.gg/Q9kg8CFp
Tiny Pretty Things,"I agree with everything you say including the bad acting, in the first episode there's a scene of Oren eating a burrito and I swear he bites into it the most awkward way possible."
Tiny Pretty Things,The fact that Nabil was crying more than the parents....lol
Tiny Pretty Things,"I really think the cop was inaccurate as well. I mean, for the most part they were doing interrogations outside the station and releasing information to literally everyone. Usually cops, at least on tv, conduct conversations with possible suspects or witnesses inside the station in an investigation room. Another thing, the cop only talked to the minors??? I haven‚Äôt seen a scene yet where the detective talked to the principal, if anything, the principal should be the main suspect bc the dancers were her responsibility and it was her business Cassie got hurt in. Another thing, why wouldn‚Äôt the dancers bring up the fact to their parents that a detective is sussing them of a murder attempt? Also, I understand detectives are assigned cases, but literally what‚Äôs this cops deal? She had no other case to do? Why do she fact check each student by revealing what the last person said? That‚Äôs not how interrogations work and if so, that‚Äôs dumb bc now all of the potential suspects can change up the story bc they know what the detective is thinking. It‚Äôs also her lack of seeing the pedophilia for me? I know it‚Äôs a dance school but literally everyone is naked majority of the time. The detective didn‚Äôt think the fact that these minors were out pass curfew MOST nights doing who knows what and that they were half naked majority of the time that she shouldn‚Äôt have raised questions abt the authority in that place??? Like come on. That‚Äôs the first thing you check in to for a crime like that. Another thing, I‚Äôm not sure if the investigation was open, if not then she shouldn‚Äôt have been pursuing those kids so openly bc it wasn‚Äôt in her right. But, why wouldn‚Äôt she close the roof off for further investigation on the crime scene? She could‚Äôve found evidence that she missed like that hoodie NAVAEH found right below the roof. Why didn‚Äôt she look deeper into the kids lives to find a motive? She‚Äôs steady going off of ‚Äúshe said, he said‚Äù. Like these are teenagers you‚Äôre investigating, you gotta be smarter. 

And cassies parents literally didn‚Äôt exist like what, someone just tried to kill your daughter and you still let those ppl near her while she‚Äôs unconscious. If anything nabil filled that role. 

And why didn‚Äôt navaeh show the detective the picture of Cassie and the dance teacherüò©???? That was such an obvious lead."
Tiny Pretty Things,Can still leave hate‚Ä¶.
Tiny Pretty Things,Elite is pretty well written and acted though. It's way better than most teen dramas.
Tiny Pretty Things,"Might I dare say, √âlite (before that terrible 3rd season) and Pretty Little Liars (up to a point) are way better put together shows than Tiny Pretty Things. In fact, √âlite is pretty great (before season 3 of course). 

The key is consistency and cohesion. The show can be over-the-top or just straight up absurd, that's not a flaw (well unless that's not what they were going for), many shows are, but if it lacks consistency and simple logic to the point where the viewer is questioning everything the show is putting in front of them, then that's when it's *bad*."
Tiny Pretty Things,Idk. I think pretty little liars was definitely better written and provided a more riveting storyline (specifically in the first few seasons. The latter seasons were definitely way worse).
Tiny Pretty Things,"The show is meant to take place at an elite dance school, so approximately half the students would be boys, yes."
Tiny Pretty Things,There's plenty of male dancers.
Tiny Pretty Things,"The three last episodes were a train wreck! A car crash, more police investigation, suddenly June's mom is back, Oren and Neveah fall in love, Nabil is heartbroken and quiet again so his character progress was for nothing, and Cassie wakes up saying some random stuff. Just way too much"
Tiny Pretty Things,wait u found this through google? im amazed. lol.
Tiny Pretty Things,üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Tiny Pretty Things,"Same here! I just wanted a good ‚Äúbad‚Äù show to watch, and this was just plain bad."
Tiny Pretty Things,"If you're considering Flesh and Bone now, don't. It's not good. Worse, nothing in it resolves. Truly a waste of time."
Tiny Pretty Things,it's soooooooo bad though. üòÇüòÇ i might've enjoyed it ironically but i can't write a post telling people i found it to be good.
Tiny Pretty Things,"maybe i should start watching the trailers/previews for shows, ü§î i usually just read the synopsis and look at the poster then jump right in."
Tiny Pretty Things,If you want a good teen drama with a murder mystery to watch you should check out Elite.
Tiny Pretty Things,And what are the pretty little things? I'm still trying to figure out the relevance of the name to the show....
Tiny Pretty Things,"Tbh the only teen dramas that doesn‚Äôt feel like a guilty pleasure is euphoria,skam, and skins that‚Äôs it. Those are the essential trinity of teen dramas imo"
Tiny Pretty Things,"2 years late comment but I watched the show recently and you are definitely right. 

I don't mind messy shows especially since they can still be entertaining. 

However, those other ""teen drama"" have all been better put together overall. 

It's a shame because it would have been nice to see those dancer-actors improving more to the point of appearing in future contents but it's been 2 years and I don't think I saw them appearing anywhere in general (except for the couple of named actors)."
Tiny Pretty Things,Yep! I put in ‚Äúthe writing is so bad on tiny pretty things‚Äù and here i am!
Tiny Pretty Things,"I literally just googled why is this so bad, and your post is top of the list. My wife is watching it, I try and play on my phone in the background, but I have nearly put my phone thru the TV. Genuinely deathmetal at the TV after the tenth sex scene this episode. I think its truly irresponsible to have this much casual teenage sex and not mention protection at all. But the thing that killed me the most? Sniffing coke in a sauna! A god damn sauna! Clearly have never done drugs ffs I wish they had the writing might be more on point. Yeah I'm soo efing mad at this for no reason üòí"
Tiny Pretty Things,Do you think it is still worth watching even if I don‚Äôt personally mind it not having a resolution?
Tiny Pretty Things,That would do it. I myself will not watch anything without a trailer and/or reading a critic or 2. There are so many shows and movies out there that I just wouldn't be able to decide otherwise. And it has the bonus of taking out the absolute trash. Or at least it lets me know it's trash I'll enjoy.
Tiny Pretty Things,"Oh I know about Elite and I've watched every episode of that hot mess. Some of the plotlines were a bit over the top but I think over all, it held up pretty well."
Tiny Pretty Things,SPOILER: Ramon tells Cassie he‚Äôll destroy the tiny pretty things she loves.
Tiny Pretty Things,"I disagree, well kinda. I'll agree that most teen dramas aren't necessarily great, but i'd throw a few more worthy ones on top of those, like √âlite, L'amica genaile (My Brilliant Friend), Freaks and Geeks and My Mad Fat Diary. 

But either way, gald to see you mentioned Skam. Not many people here know about that one."
Tiny Pretty Things,üòÇüòÇ
Tiny Pretty Things,"If you have a particular interest in ballet and go into it with lowered expectations, then maybe. But only maybe."
Tiny Pretty Things,"I'm a few episodes in, a lot of the dialogue and some of the acting is just dire; I don't mind the dancing scenes but there isn't quite enough of them to overlook the worse parts of the show; the dream/nightmare sequences all the characters seem to have are odd. Not sure if the dancing scenes are actually any good technically or anything but I enjoy them; just wish there was more performance scenes as opposed to rehearsal. Will probably finish the season eventually."
Tiny Pretty Things,Can someone help me understand why the cop is so invested in finding out what happened to Cassie?
Tiny Pretty Things,I watch it because I like ballet but the show itself is awful and dry. The personalities of characters seem very off and forced.
Tiny Pretty Things,"Only on the 2nd episode. But my guess is that her ""lady friend"" ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è and how she died reminds her of what happened and how she could do anything for her now she's trying to do something for Cassie. She's probably doing vicariously and to help her conscience"

Tiny Pretty Things,"Legitimately I refused to watch ""The Good Place"" for the longest time because I thought it was in continuity with The Good Wife and The Good Fight and I had no interest in an overblown political drama."

Tiny Pretty Things,"Yeah I loved the idea, and the people involved and their previous projects, but for some reason Quarry just didn't stick with me. Watched it all but hardly remember it."
Tiny Pretty Things,I dropped it after like 4 episodes. Best thing I got out of it was knowing Alice Pagani existed.
Tiny Pretty Things,"Yeah I do. It was awful. Sadly, all Netflix Italy productions are lame.

Amazon Prime Italy's productions, on the other hand, are really strong."
Tiny Pretty Things,Oh yeah she‚Äôs stunningly beautiful. Like if Finn Wolfhard were a girl but more beautiful obviously.
Tiny Pretty Things,"If you like that sort of series opening, you should check out at least the first episode of ID: Invaded.  The main character wakes up in a mysterious dimension with no more context than the viewer has.  Without spoiling too much of the mystery of the first episode, I think I can mention that it's a sci-fi crime series, sort of similar to Psycho-Pass."

I'm just confused what training these ICs go through. I feel like it went from them not being a thing to being everywhere so I'm just confused like what qualifications/training they have?"
A-Teen,I always think how weird it was for Kaya Scodelario to be shooting those scenes in Skins at 14/15
A-Teen,I deliver her packages every so often. Very nice woman
A-Teen,"I don‚Äôt get why some people are so bent out of shape over this. It‚Äôs literally the same reason we have things like OSHA, child labor laws, and HR. To ensure employees are safe and feel safe, and also to prevent the need for a lawsuit against a company. It‚Äôs alright if sex isn‚Äôt real on screen‚Äînothing else on screen is. It‚Äôs ok. Be a better actor."
A-Teen,"I don't know why almost every time ICs (which should be a fairly mundane part of filmmaking) show up in these headlines like it's the most controversial job, it's always either a female actor saying ""How useful and helpful!"" or a male actor saying ""My ability to be immersed in the scene was ruined!"" Strange, can't put my finger on why this is."
A-Teen,Ics exist because some guys get creepy. Sean Bean might be a nice guy--but that's why.
A-Teen,"For some odd reason, I've yet to see a female detractor of intimacy coordinators"
A-Teen,We had an Intimacy Coordinator on the movie I worked on this summer. In over 30 it was the first time I‚Äôve seen one. Heard she got 5k a week +++. Not a bad job
A-Teen,"Jesus Christ, lots of weirdo losers in the comments today. As a person with stage acting experience, an IC isn‚Äôt weird to have, it‚Äôs super normal and helps set boundaries as a neutral party. If a super famous actor has a sex scene with an actor that hasn‚Äôt worked much, they could easily be cohered into something they aren‚Äôt comfortable with. Having a neutral third party run these thing is good"
A-Teen,"Intimacy Coordinators are thing where if you don't have them and everything works out, you never really see the need for them at all, but if you don't have them you can really see the difference in how creepy and awkward things can get.

There has been a culture of rape and awfulness in Hollywood for so long, where people of all ages, shapes, genders, and occupations have been preyed upon by people in positions of power within the industry, and any pushback on something like this just, to me, seems to stem from that wave of people not wanting their free sex exploitation to go away. Not everyone is Sean Bean and has seemingly innocent and artistic intentions. For every one of him maybe doing things right, there are fifty predators taking advantage of young actors who don't want to lose their jobs."
A-Teen,"Jesus, this is a new thing?  For teen actors and actresses it would be so uncomfortable to speak up.  All I would say to people complaining about this is imagine she is your daughter, you would want her protected."
A-Teen,"Is this a response to that weird Sean bean article I saw the other day?

I was surprised I saw almost no one commenting on that bringing up the fact that not everyone probably wants to just ‚Äúgo for it‚Äù with essentially just their coworkers. 

Intimacy coordinators aren‚Äôt just there to help get a good shot, they‚Äôre there to keep the actors comfortable and safe"
A-Teen,"If ICs can head off even a portion of the abuse that vulnerable women (and men) in Hollywood have suffered, then they are worth their cost. As far as the recent complaints about ICs go... Well... You're actors. ACT. A film/tv set should never be a place people are going for sexual gratification. 

Personally, Seyfried looks so much like my stepdaughter, I've never been able to keep my eyes on the screen when there's even a hint of nudity or intimacy from her."
A-Teen,It blows my mind that something like this is such a new thing.
A-Teen,I need a documentary on intimacy coordinators in my life
A-Teen,What's an intimacy coordinator? An acting coach for onscreen nudity?
A-Teen,Just because she got paid doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not manipulative and uncomfortable and that she shouldn‚Äôt talk about it.  And it‚Äôs not an excuse for us to be asholes about it.
A-Teen,"Ever since I learned about intimacy coordinators a couple years ago (I think after Normal People came out?) I feel a bit weird watching intimate scenes in older movies/tv which I am sure did not have intimacy coordinators. Especially with young actors. I think even 5-7 years ago most sets wouldn't have hired intimacy coordinators....I never really thought about it, until then, but now I think about it a lot...ooof

If anyone is curious about what an intimacy coordinator is for, Vice made a great video in 2020 about the emerging profession and growing presence on sets:

[**Sex Scenes Are Awkward and Dangerous ‚Äî Intimacy Directors Are Trying To Fix That**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79prP_M-xEo)"
A-Teen,"Good intuition on her part cuz if she said no then she wouldn't have been hired. People put in those roles early in their career ARE being exploited, they'd just shop around for someone who was comfortable revealing their bodies"
A-Teen,"God damn.  After the avalanche of stories similar to this one, you‚Äôd think a person would become numb.  It hasn‚Äôt happened‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs depressing and angering every time you think about it."
A-Teen,Sounds like a good idea
A-Teen,"are there gonna be males coming out with such stories, I wonder? Lots of male teenagers in underwear in these shows, I can imagine they'd feel the same way"
A-Teen,"Actresses when they‚Äôre [younger](https://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report-amanda-seyfried-says-she-s-most-comfortable-when-she-s-naked-1519371) say ‚Äúohh I have no problem being naked onscreen, it‚Äôs liberating!‚ÄùWhen they‚Äôre older they admit they regret it now or were [pressured](https://ew.com/movies/amanda-seyfried-uncomfortable-scenes-teenager/) into doing nudity. üòî

eta: this is not meant as a knock on these actresses, but as a comment on the sad irony of actresses appearing to embrace nudity."
A-Teen,"Why don't we just stop making useless sex scenes? Problem solved. Everyone wins.
Not only is it usually horribly acted, it's just terrible."
A-Teen,"I'm going to go the puritanical route and say that nudity and sex scenes in shows and movies are almost always unneeded. If I'm watching a movie about aliens, I don't need a 5 minute shower sex scene."
A-Teen,"I always fear that actors take advantage of actresses in intimate scenes too. For example, if they were supposed to fake intercourse but instead the actor goes and really violates her but there's nothing she can do since it is her career on the line if she wasn't as recognized as an actress."
A-Teen,"Imo the problem with intimacy coordination is that it became public knowledge and more common during metoo, so it has been packaged with the most bizarre and exaggerated consequences of that movement like no eye contact policy on sets. So it got a bad rap because of that."
A-Teen,"Maybe this is just my dumb male brain but I don't really understand how the Intimacy Coordinator is going to fix anything. Like, Amanda Seyfried says she wishes she had a intimacy coordinator as a teen because some of the scenes made her uncomfortable and she wanted to keep her job. However, the intimacy coordinator doesn't work for her. So when a young actress doesn't want to do a scene because it's uncomfortable, the intimacy coordinator is just going to go to the director and be like ""we need to rework the scene"" holding up production. This will put pressure on young actresses to just do the scene even if they are uncomfortable to prevent holding up production, right? Nobody wants to be the lone thing holding up the scene. Maybe I'm missing something but I don't get it. Is radically different for the production crew if instead of saying ""everybody hold up Amanda says she is uncomfortable doing the scene"" they said ""everybody hold up the intimacy coordinator says Amanda is uncomfortable doing the scene?"""
A-Teen,Cool coat
A-Teen,... We're getting a new headline like this every day and have for a full week.
A-Teen,[deleted]
A-Teen,[deleted]
A-Teen,Her body her choice #EatTheRich
A-Teen,What the fuck is an intimacy coordinator? Can someone link a video of one in action?
A-Teen,[removed]
A-Teen,Intimacy coordinators? What does that even mean? Fake sex therapist?
A-Teen,She‚Äôs a great actress but let‚Äôs be honest she gets a lot of her roles because of how attractive she is. It might be time to take sex appeal out of Hollywood.
A-Teen,Hey here‚Äôs an idea. How about we leave intimate scenes out of movies? Problem solved.
A-Teen,Oh no being uncomfortable at your job is the worst
A-Teen,Makes sense. I wonder why some of these crackhead faces and ugly girls end up on screen. Guess the old jokes are right.
A-Teen,"You hear this sort of thing quite a bit but I doubt it's actually all that accurate.

Amanda Seyfried *now* doesn't actually need an intimacy coordinator. If she's in a film and feels uncomfortable, she can simply point out that the film's financing probably depends on her presence and they can either deal with her reluctance to do a scene or shut down the film.

All those anonymous actresses that are in the same position Seyfried was when she was 19? They're disposable. If they're not willing to do an explicit scene, they probably *are* losing their job and being replaced by an actress who is willing to do the scene."
A-Teen,"ITT: plenty of people who didn‚Äôt actually read the whole Sean bean quote and just the made up headline from the front page the other day. 

*Nice.*"
A-Teen,Collecting her money tho isn‚Äôt she
A-Teen,*Sydney Sweeney enters the chat*
A-Teen,"Ah I see, so you made your money, consented at the time but now want to talk about how you were the victim. That‚Äôs the most 2022 thing possible."
A-Teen,"I Don't Really Like to Read Titles that Have All But a Few Words Start With a Capital Letter.

-

If I write like that all the time then I won't keep my job either."
A-Teen,"The only one that can let you down in that situation is yourself. She should only blame herself. She didn't ""have"" to do it, she choose to do it!"
A-Teen,"We all wish we had intimacy coordinators when we were teens, but you learn lessons and move on."
A-Teen,"And 24 hour news cycle continues, with fucking boring, distracting drivel."
A-Teen,"lol, that job would backfire in Hollywood in one second"
A-Teen,Don't sign up for a role if you can't fulfil it
A-Teen,She doth protest much... Word is she knew Epstein and worked for him but receipts are scrubbed.
A-Teen,Well she was feeling comfortable in it?
A-Teen,I was thinking more Veronica Mars she had a lot of risqu√© early scenes
A-Teen,Intimacy coordinators are the only solution?
A-Teen,I recently did a rewatch after not watching since original run. There is a lot more uncomfortable shit than I remembered!
A-Teen,big love worth watching? i love bill paxton but that subject matter is a huge turn off for me personally
A-Teen,which seen? I have not watched the show in years.
A-Teen,Link?
A-Teen,"I assumed she was talking about her role in Alpha Dog (she's spoken before how she didn't want to do the movie, that it was a nothing character but her reps were like it's a great cast, it'll be good for your career). It was shot in November 2004, which would make her 19 at the time, and there is a scene where she skinny dips with Anton Yelchin's character in a pool."
A-Teen,I gather she is probably referring to her time on Big Love?
A-Teen,"She talked about this back when she was doing [press for Mank](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/29/movies/amanda-seyfried-mank.html). 

>She recalled a job she booked when she was still a teenager, where the director asked her to appear nearly nude onscreen. Without anyone else on set to advocate for her, she reluctantly agreed to take her clothes off.  
‚ÄúI have been put in very insane positions,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI was walking around with no underpants on and a T-shirt, and I didn‚Äôt want to be, yet I didn‚Äôt feel like I had any power to say, ‚ÄòNo, this makes me uncomfortable.‚Äô‚Äù (She wouldn‚Äôt name the project.)

I think it‚Äôs Alpha Dog, filmed when she was 19, which makes the director Nick Cassavetes."
A-Teen,"There is an article like this every week, if not every day."
A-Teen,"oh god no

what Sean Bean headlines"
A-Teen,Quite likely. I like Sean a lot but his take was definitely a product of an older generation. I understand what he said is probably true but I think it's more important to protect people than it is for sex scenes in movies to look hotter. That's just me.
A-Teen,"We all have different takes, experiences, emotions and levels of comfortability. Imagine that."
A-Teen,"Eh maybe, but it's not like Bean started the conversation - women have been talking about the need for intimacy coordinators for a long time. Only a few months ago Alicia Vikander spoke about feeling uncomfortable performing sex scenes without an intimacy coordinator years ago when she was younger.

EDIT: also, Sean Bean only spoke about it because intimacy coordinators are becoming more ubiquitous (because there is clearly a need) and wants to give his stupid take...or because he is doubling down on something he said/did before that he knows is wrong."
A-Teen,It's weird to me because I've never heard of an intimacy coach but now I see the term everywhere.
A-Teen,"It is, but female actors need protection especially as sexualisation is not going to stop anytime soon."
A-Teen,the take away is that they these coordinators should be there if the actors involved want them (and when only one of them wants one they should be there)
A-Teen,[deleted]
A-Teen,Did you read the article?
A-Teen,"I've worked with multiple intimacy coordinators, it's honestly the best for my department (costumes.) Many of them started out in stunts, so they understand the choreography of a scene, working with a director to get their vision across, as well as a history working with actors. Before intimacy coordinators, if there was a sex scene, the director would maybe have talked to the cast about the emotional story arc they were achieving, but no one would talk to the cast about the logistics of filming the scene. There were countless times where I would have to ask the director or the operator what they were planning on seeing or not seeing, so we could figure out what type of modesty wear would work so the actors wouldnt have to be naked on set, or what shots they would have to be naked etc. It was usually myself who was seemingly having the logistical conversation about nudity with the actor for the first time. I would try and talk to them the day before at least if not earlier in case we had to build anything that we didn't already have.

Basically, my two cents, is that many times, the director/dp/cast felt uncomfortable talking about the logistics of sex/ rape/ nudity scenes, so no one really talked about it, and everyone just kind of assumed that everyone else were professionals, and we would figure it out. Now with the intimacy coordinator, they have separate conversations with the director, the cast, the cast and director together, and costumes/HMU. They're basically working as a logistical AD making sure everyone has what they need, there are no surprises, and that everyone is supported. It's really great."
A-Teen,"I first heard about ICs from the production of Normal People in 2020, which lead me to watch this 2020 [video from Vice News about intimacy coordinators.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79prP_M-xEo) Which led me to this 2017 [NYT article](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/15/theater/need-to-fake-an-orgasm-theres-an-intimacy-choreographer-for-that.html).

Every new profession's gotta start somewhere. Sounds like it had grassroots beginnings among stage choreographers who felt strongly about consent/advocacy, and studied intimacy and consent.

From what I know, IC have been around for over 5 years, but they are just now reaching mainstream productions (which is why you are hearing about them). It's also worth noting, as someone else pointed out to me on this thread, that ICs are also used in dance productions, too."
A-Teen,"I hope they hold some power and good training and industrial standards on who does it and hiring. 

But I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if some dodgy productions we‚Äôll discover few where they‚Äôre bad in a ‚Äòliability safe guard‚Äô sense, or worse hired by creeps who make sure they turn blind eye to things or used to trick actresses into thinking things are safe. One of those things that‚Äôs bare minimum to defend but needs improvements and safeguards to make sure it works"
A-Teen,"Apparently it comes up occasionally where a well meaning producer/director hires a ""intimacy coordinator"" who pretends to know what they are doing but is just hitching a ride on the bandwagon because there are no qualifications or standards.    

These people tend to leave a bad impression on actors and filmmakers which is where I think some of the resistance comes from -  because they haven't worked with a good IC"
A-Teen,4 years in gender studies probably s/
A-Teen,She‚Äôs been talking about it recently I believe! It seems like it was a real free for all on the Skins set.
A-Teen,That show was mental. Struggle to decide in my head if it was more wild than Euphoria
A-Teen,Wait did Effy have sex scenes on that show at that young?
A-Teen,"Every time do you use harden? Smooth brained downvoted, didnt even look at the lvl50 metapod and got pissy they didnt say it first, lol."
A-Teen,I think the lawsuit reduction is why we went from no ICs to IC's on almost every production.  The addition of someone who has a mid range salary protects you from a multimillion dollar lawsuit.
A-Teen,Hmmmm. It‚Äôs a mystery.
A-Teen,I think they just make that much of a difference for the actors.
A-Teen,"Not *just* that. IC exist for a myriad of purposes:

1. Building trust between actors - which ultimately makes for more natural romantic scenes because both actors are more comfortable touching each other. All actors could use this - if an actor is creepy, that should be unacceptable and they should be fired tbh.
2. Helping choreograph the sex scenes so that they are tasteful/realistic or at least (and this is most important) both actors are consenting to the amount of nudity and choreography on camera. You hear stories all the time about women actors who are told one thing before the scene, and then the movie comes out and they are showing more nudity than they consented to. On set, the IC is ensuring that what the actors agreed to is being respected. Choreography ahead of time also helps ensure the shoot will go to plan.
3. Intimacy coordinators plan for the actual filming of the scene so that the actors are comfortable on-set - this means covers for genitalia (which all sets have, but some sound very awful) in nude scenes and providing robes and such in between cuts. It also means ensuring the set is closed and only the minimal necessary crew is there to shoot the scene. IC really set the tone for the set."
A-Teen,"It's not only that but guys can be pretty oblivious to woman's discomfort. Yeah, building authentic intimate moments is great. But what if it's only authentic for one party?"
A-Teen,Or he gets creepy and doesn't know it.
A-Teen,Or maybe he had an acting partner who was around his age so they did not feel coerced. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
A-Teen,"Some guys *****and girls

I'm sure it was just casual for you to forget, or is casual misandry just the norm on soyddit?"
A-Teen,Probably a coincidence eh
A-Teen,Weird right
A-Teen,The reason is women don't care about sex scenes so they're really not going to care about industry developments that have the effect of reducing sexuality in sex scenes.
A-Teen,It's because only the MEN care about the art.
A-Teen,"Yeah...this is why now I feel a bit weird watching intimate scenes from like 5+ years ago - especially with younger actors but older actors too...it just makes me wonder how much agency they (especially the women) had in making those scenes, whether they consented to everything, if they felt uncomfortable."
A-Teen,People only care if it's their own daughter though. That's probably the problem
A-Teen,"I suspect that they were embraced so quickly by the industry because they pay for themselves.  It reduces liability and bad press and makes your actors happier.  I think it's also made the sex scenes better, bridgerton was HOT because of their intimacy coordinator."
A-Teen,"I don't know of a full documentary, but **Vice News** did a really great short mini doc/interview about intimacy coordinators (they interview/follow one in particular), which I shared in the comments a couple times:

[**Sex Scenes Are Awkward and Dangerous ‚Äî Intimacy Directors Are Trying To Fix That**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79prP_M-xEo)

**CBS Sunday Morning** also did a video, which I haven't seen:

[**How intimacy coordinators oversee romantic movie, TV scenes**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgsSojjaeK4)"
Moominvalley,"Neat. I used to love watching this back in the early 90‚Äôs on CBBC, a little creepy, but great."
Moominvalley,"I've been binging this since yesterday and it's even better than I remembered from my childhood. The playlist that I've linked might direct you to the final episode, but all episodes are available, at least the first season that got dubbed from Japanese to English"
Moominvalley,[removed]
Moominvalley,"I randomly get compilations recommended to me on YouTube of this show. I don't know why I never watch the show before, but it looks really bizarre in a calming way."
Moominvalley,I can't watch the Moomins unless they speak Swedish with a Finnish accent.
Moominvalley,"I watched the Norwegian dub as a kid, myself. But no, I think you would have to pay for it unfortunately. But I found myself really enjoying the English dub, too"
Moominvalley,"Well that awakened something in me I wasn't expecting, that is my childhood in a nutshell and I cannot wait to see it, just for the nostalgia. :D"
Moominvalley,This is the first remake/new version of a children's show where I think the new one is better animated. Lot's of new children's shows use poor CGI or computer drawing to save expenses. This one clearly didn't.
Moominvalley,"I used to watch the old version as a child, the modern take on it is just lovely. My kids just sat and relaxed watching it. It's tv Valium!"
Moominvalley,"Gutsy's youtube channel also has [a behind-the-scenes video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Xy5wttiUqA) that names the UK voice cast. Taron Egerton is Moomintroll and Rosamund Pike is Moominmamma. :) 

It began airing in February on Yle TV2 in Finland and Yle Teema & Fem in Sweden.  In the UK it started airing on 19 April [on Sky One](https://www.sky.com/watch/title/series/cb72686f-2d2c-4c4a-b1cb-1ca425e9fe7a/moominvalley/episodes/season-1/episode-0).  Japan got it on NHK in April as well. No word yet on a network in the US picking it up. (sigh)."
Moominvalley,Most of the 3D rendered versions of previously drawn cartoons look terrible. This looks lovely.
The Return of the Condor Heroes,Wasn‚Äôt aware that was in doubt.
The Return of the Condor Heroes,"Casting director: ""So, do you have any experience playing the character of Ellie from The Last of Us?"""
The Return of the Condor Heroes,[removed]
The Return of the Condor Heroes,This is shocking news
The Return of the Condor Heroes,[removed]
The Return of the Condor Heroes,Awesome. Have to admit i prejudged before watching and didnt think id like her in the role but im 5 episodes in and she has been doing spectaculor
The Return of the Condor Heroes,"She‚Äôs great for this role, so I‚Äôm glad she‚Äôs sticking around. She‚Äôs playing a pretty specific role so I hope they can find other parts for her to play that suit her strengths."
The Return of the Condor Heroes,"Lol, this is so dumb (that it had to be said). Makeup, haircut, not chest binding her anymore and so on can EASILY make her look older like the time jump in the games. Not to mention they won't film for a while and we have all watched GOT and know how fast teenagers visually age into adults. She's 19 already (Ellie's age in part 2) and I suspect, like with the chest binding, she was aged down for this season anyways."
The Return of the Condor Heroes,Almost like she's...the star of the show...
The Return of the Condor Heroes,[removed]
The Return of the Condor Heroes,Wow the main character of a TV show will be on said show again?! What has the fucking world come to that people need to report on something so trivial and obvious.
The Return of the Condor Heroes,It‚Äôs absolutely insane that people say she shouldn‚Äôt
The Return of the Condor Heroes,"Like this was even in doubt.

At this point, anyone still questioning her in the role is not to be taken seriously.  At all."
The Return of the Condor Heroes,"The suggestion that Bella should be recast is so ridiculous. Spend a whole season building up the relationship between Joel and Ellie with Bella and Pedro, and then switching her out for some random in the second season. You just wouldn't buy that relationship at all... it scares me some seriously think that's what should happen"
The Return of the Condor Heroes,Can't wait for Bella Ramsey learning UFC to take on Ronda Rousey
The Return of the Condor Heroes,"    Lead Actor returns for season 2.

Shocker."
The Return of the Condor Heroes,Why was this even in question?
The Return of the Condor Heroes,"Didn't think there's any doubt, still fantastic news! I love Bella."
The Return of the Condor Heroes,Newbie question - do I need to have played the game to watch this?  Haven‚Äôt been a gamer since the Xbox 360‚Ä¶
The Return of the Condor Heroes,I was wondering about that. Nice to have it confirmed.
The Return of the Condor Heroes,obviously. She was phenomenal.

The Return of the Condor Heroes,"In other news, water is wet and the sun is hot."
The Return of the Condor Heroes,There is precedent of her leaving a show she was the lead character of I‚Äôve heard
The Return of the Condor Heroes,No way
The Return of the Condor Heroes,Those who have played the second game are aware of JUST HOW MUCH she will be returning.
The Return of the Condor Heroes,"Bella can definitely act the part. The costume and makeup departments are what I would worry about. Bella doesn‚Äôt need to look exactly like TLoU2 Ellie (she doesn‚Äôt look exactly like TLoU Ellie), but there are certain things she does need to have. 

She needs to be more intimidating. TLoU2 Ellie is way more intimidating than TLoU Ellie. Bella will need to look quite a bit older and be more muscular. Most of that can and will be done by costuming and makeup. Bella can undoubtedly handle acting older and more intimidating."
The Return of the Condor Heroes,Of course she will - she hasn't gone back in time to create the necessary means for the cordyceps virus to jump to humans and give birth to Joel yet.
The Return of the Condor Heroes,"This just in, actors want work."
The Return of the Condor Heroes,quite honestly i thought they we‚Äôre going to cast someone to play an older ellie
The Return of the Condor Heroes,"Would be incredibly shit I'd she wasn't, so jarring when shows do that to main characters"
The Return of the Condor Heroes,Obviously.
The Return of the Condor Heroes,Duh?
The Return of the Condor Heroes,Duh
The Return of the Condor Heroes,well no shit
The Return of the Condor Heroes,Didn't know I had to worry about this?
The Return of the Condor Heroes,Oh thank god for a split second I thought they were going to cast Chris Pratt. Glad that's cleared up

The Return of the Condor Heroes,Is this a spoiler? I haven't finished the show yet.
The Return of the Condor Heroes,No shit‚Ä¶

The Return of the Condor Heroes,It would‚Äôve been kinda weird if they got someone else no?
The Return of the Condor Heroes,"Its her biggest role she ever had. ""Water is wet"" would be more of a surprise"
The Return of the Condor Heroes,I heard Cordyceps and guns will also return but it hasn't been officially announced yet.
The Return of the Condor Heroes,[removed]
The Return of the Condor Heroes,Shouldn't that have been the first thing they decided and she agreed on- when casting for season 1?
The Return of the Condor Heroes,She should start smoking and drinking to give herself a more rugged look.
The Return of the Condor Heroes,"she played great but story is years apart, she won't change her body appearance that drastically to make sense compared to the games. she's a 20 y/o looking like a 15 y/o."
The Return of the Condor Heroes,Why wouldn‚Äôt she? >_>
The Return of the Condor Heroes,"She's been great as Ellie so far, can't wait for season 2."
The Return of the Condor Heroes,Ok now do Henry Cavill
The Return of the Condor Heroes,"Never knew it was up in the air. Either way I‚Äôm excited. She absolutely killed it. >!now I just have to start preparing myself emotionally for season 2, cause it‚Äôs gonna be rough!<"

The Return of the Condor Heroes,Isnt the best actor but eh
The Return of the Condor Heroes,I found the show quite boring. And not because its slow.
The Return of the Condor Heroes,Who is upvoting this? What do you consider news?
The Return of the Condor Heroes,Wh-Was this in doubt?
The Return of the Condor Heroes,I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll return for season 2

The Return of the Condor Heroes,Spoilers!!!
The Return of the Condor Heroes,No shit sherlock
The Return of the Condor Heroes,I wasn‚Äôt sure if she would pull it off but damn she was amazing.

The Return of the Condor Heroes,"Is this show that great it matters? It's not terrible, but it's also not amazing either (it's good, but - fill in the space here).."
The Return of the Condor Heroes,Yeah obviously haha. She is outstanding.
The Return of the Condor Heroes,"File this under ‚ÄúNo Shit, Sherlock.‚Äù"
The Return of the Condor Heroes,I don't think anyone every doubted this.  The performance is going to win so many awards that Bella will need a room just for the trophies.
The Return of the Condor Heroes,no shit
The Return of the Condor Heroes,I should fucking think so
The Return of the Condor Heroes,LOVED her in Cathrine called Birdie!!!
The Return of the Condor Heroes,"She‚Äôs such a great actress. I can‚Äôt wait to see what she does next, after The Last of Us. She was honestly my favorite GOT character."
The Return of the Condor Heroes,Good cause the overall story is about Ellie first and foremost and we need a strong anchor there through the series.
The Return of the Condor Heroes,Duh
The Return of the Condor Heroes,[removed]
The Return of the Condor Heroes,"well shit, i would hope the main character returned for season 2 lol"
The Return of the Condor Heroes,She is a fantastic actor!
The Return of the Condor Heroes,"That's a shame.

>!""Left Behind"" just showed me that she is incapable of carrying an episode, let alone a whole season.!<"
The Return of the Condor Heroes,I'M SHOCKED!
The Return of the Condor Heroes,"I think she should for continuity‚Äôs sake, but I never really grew to love her. I thought she was fine but the episodes without Joel and just Ellie were the weakest of them so I am a but worried for season 2."
The Return of the Condor Heroes,good to hear. was listening to the prestige podcast recaps of season 1 and they say that in Part 2 Ellie is going to need to be more physical so they were considering whether she should be re cast
The Return of the Condor Heroes,"Terrible idea imo

Part 2 Ellie is a very wiry, densely muscled and jaded woman. She's 19 but has the grizzled demeanor of Joel.

Bella actually make a pretty good pt 1 Ellie, but absolutely not for pt 2

Bella fans are mass downvoting anyone who says this so bear that in mind."
The Return of the Condor Heroes,Please no
The Return of the Condor Heroes,Lead actress returns for second season of show she stars in wow such news please delete this.
The Return of the Condor Heroes,"Shame... 

She's a great actor for sure, but she doesn't feel like Ellie to me still. Think I'm too biased due to the games."
The Return of the Condor Heroes,...This was in doubt?
The Return of the Condor Heroes,In other news the sun Winn indeed rise tomorrow
The Return of the Condor Heroes,"As long as they cast Pedro Pascal again, I'll watch it."
The Return of the Condor Heroes,[deleted]
The Return of the Condor Heroes,"That sucks , she isn‚Äôt very good"
The Return of the Condor Heroes,It's so obvious that if she wasn't queer people wouldn't be so ravenously her fan. Its so cringe to see the virtue signalling.
The Return of the Condor Heroes,"IMO they should get an actress that looks a bit older, and is taller, to play older ellie IMO."
The Return of the Condor Heroes,"She is perfect for young Ellie, but I would have liked a more mature looking Ellie for season 2, she looks like a child"
Stepping Out,"Comparing their season 1‚Äôs to each other, I‚Äôd say Dark is slightly better. However, I think 1899 has more potential than Dark did after 1 season."
Stepping Out,">Can '1899' Step Out From the Shadow of 'Dark'?

It should & even tho the series had it's flaws, it's still a good watch. Loved the twist at the end even though I kinda saw it coming with all these futuristic devices they were using & constantly talking about ""simulation""."
Stepping Out,"I can't watch 1899 without yelling ""Jonas you're screwing things up again"" at the captain."
Stepping Out,"The show is going to have to undergo a huge overhaul in Season 2 in terms of character development, because right now all the show is is an decent mystery with characters you barely know and don‚Äôt care about.

The two leads, Eyk and Maura, are so paper thin and have literally no type of personal arc or journey in the show whatsoever. Maura remembers more about her past, that‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs the only way they grow or change through the show. Eyk is the captain who lost his family...that‚Äôs it. We‚Äôre never given any reason to care about them other than ‚Äòthey‚Äôre the good guys‚Äô. I mean seriously, why should I root for Maura? Why should I root for Eyk? Would any of you honestly be sad if they both died at the end? 

It‚Äôs insane that such poor character writing comes from the same people who did ‚ÄòDark‚Äô, a show where every character has so many layers of good and evil to them and is constantly thrown into situations where their morals are tested. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a single character plot line in this show that‚Äôs as compelling as both of the love triangles in Dark Season 1. Nor is anyone faced with a moral dilemma as interesting as the one Ulrich deals with in Season 1 involving the fate of a little boy. 

I don‚Äôt think all hope is lost though, and I‚Äôll watch season 2. But if they think they don‚Äôt need to make a conscious effort to improve the character development and give us a reason to care about the leads, the show will stay in the shadow of ‚ÄòDark‚Äù."
Stepping Out,"FWIW I struggled to finish season 1 of Dark and then abandoned it, whereas I can't wait for season 2 of 1899."
Stepping Out,"I was very excited coming into this, but I gotta say, I think it's the fastest my interest in a show has ever plummeted to zero once the true nature of the world was revealed. There are no stakes whatsoever. At least Dark had rules, there was a logic to it. This was just random shit happening."
Stepping Out,"Coming out of the finale, my thoughts were that if you've seen 'Dark' and all of 'Lost', you don't have much to gain by watching '1899'."
Stepping Out,It‚Äôs not as good as Dark but very few shows are. It‚Äôs still a good watch taken on its own merits
Stepping Out,If I knew there was an incredibly popular series on television that chose to name its spin-offs with years like ‚Äú1883‚Äù and ‚Äú1923‚Äù I think I might come up with a new name for my new show so as to avoid confusion.
Stepping Out,"Given that they revealed the nature of the simulation so quickly, I‚Äôm thinking maybe the 2099 reality is another level of the simulation program, a bit like ‚ÄòThe Thirteenth Floor‚Äô movie. 

Level 1: The ship in 1899.

Level 2: The father in the monitoring room/ the black pyramid landscape.

Level 3: The spaceship in 2099."
Stepping Out,Warum ist Jonas!!
Stepping Out,Nice to see a thoughtful critical take getting upvotes.
Stepping Out,"Why do you think there are no stakes? It‚Äôs revealed that >!the spaceship is on a survival mission.!<

‚ÄúJust a bunch of random shit happening.‚Äù Are you sure about that? You think Friese wrote a pointless arc? You think it‚Äôs a coincidence the >!spaceship was also named the Prometheus? You don‚Äôt think maybe there‚Äôs some correlation between the simulation and reality?!<

There are a lot of questions to be answered, seems kinda weird to judge the show before you even know what‚Äôs actually going on, but hey, you do you"
Stepping Out,"Those were your thoughts? Mine were ""dark absolutely exploded the narrative connections in s2 and 3, can't wait to see what they do with this series."""
Stepping Out,"Netflix's ‚Äò1899‚Äô was first announced [in 2018](https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/netflix-dark-creators-1899-baran-bo-odar-jantje-friese-1203027167/), whereas Yellowstone's first Spin-off '1883' was announced [three years later in 2021.](https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/yellowstone-prequel-series-paramount-plus-taylor-sheridan-viacomcbs-deal-1234901944/)"
Stepping Out,The father in monitoring room is part of the 1899 simulation
Stepping Out,">!My understanding was that the spaceship is just another ""level"" in the simulation, I'm sure there was some dialogue to that effect!<

All I'm saying is that as I was watching the show, as soon as that twist was revealed, I no longer had any interest in what's happening. Because >!nobody is really dead, none of this is really happening (an actual line of dialogue).!<"
Stepping Out,"‚ÄúI called it first‚Äù is a nice moral high ground to stand on, but 1883 came out first, 1923 has already been announced, and audiences are fucking dumb."
Stepping Out,"Don‚Äôt think he was in the same simulation level. He was aware of the 1899 simulation, can monitor the people on the ship, control their environment & stay out of the endless loops that 1899 people went through."
Stepping Out,">!I don‚Äôt believe there has been any dialogue saying the spaceship is another level to the sim. People speculate it‚Äôs another level because the final scene is the zoom in on the pyramid in Maura‚Äôs eye. But just before that, the last thing we see is Ciaran type: ‚Äúwelcome to reality‚Äù to Maura. So it‚Äôs either A) spaceship is reality or B) spaceship is level 2 of the sim. We don‚Äôt know yet.!< But either way, I don‚Äôt believe any of the story is random, Friese is a brilliant writer. But hey if you just don‚Äôt like the show that‚Äôs fine too"
Stepping Out,No he specifically says he is when they have her strapped to the chair before she meets with Daniel in that kids room. ‚ÄúYou have put all of us in here with you‚Äù
Stepping Out,"I think that Maura has created a multi-layer simulation system.


Given that the father‚Äôs world is not affected by the 1899 simulation shutdown/loops/virus, that he retains his memories & more importantly control the 1899 simulation, I think that points out to a second and higher level in the program."
Stepping Out,Do we know that? I honestly thought it all collapsed once she left. Good point
Stepping Out,"I don't know why this specific phrase made me laugh so much, but it did. The: ""I just accidentally shot it right every other time"" "
Stepping Out,"I laughed.  
Came to the comments.  
Apparently I'm in the minority.  
Whatever fuck y'all. I smiled which is more than most shows ever get."
Stepping Out,"Adopting the classic SNL tactic of ""If the bit doesn't work, Just break character and laugh"".

Seth should just change the format of his entire show to revolve around ""A closer look"" - by far the strongest part of his show. It's the entire reason I watch these days. "
Stepping Out,*Uh oh... I'm doing something called BREAKING!*
Stepping Out,"I might be the only one here with a different opinion judging by some comments, but I actually enjoyed this bit. I like seeing people laugh and enjoying themselves, say what you want laughter is contagious. I think the end payoff joke they were going for if they didn't have that blunder would've been ""No, there is no counterpoint. Hollywood discriminates against women on every level no matter how you slice it"", but they just never got there"
Stepping Out,oh god her laugh when she shoots herself with it... that got me! üòÇüòÇ
Stepping Out,"I honestly thought this was hilarious, I felt like it really brought out their personality and it just seemed genuine. "
Stepping Out,[deleted]
Stepping Out,I really love it when this stuff happens.  Watching Jimmy Fallon try not to bust a gut during the Cork Soaking skid was one of the funniest things I've ever seen.
Stepping Out,"I don't understand you guys. The bit was super cringy, but as the title says, that's not why it was posted. It's contagious laughter material. I guess the haters in here either didn't make it that far into the video or don't feel empathy. Probably the latter because we know what that means and we know that's why a lot of people spend all day on reddit anyway."
Stepping Out,Amber is very good. i love the Amber says what spots
Stepping Out,Coming to the comments to let everyone know you didn't find something funny is reddit's version of virtue signaling. 
Stepping Out,Is there a subreddit for this kind of stuff?? I'm cracking up.
Stepping Out,This isn't funny at all. 
Stepping Out,"Oh, I really wish the woman in the middle would have shot the cannon backwards by mistake at the end.  That would have been perfect."
Stepping Out,Wow this is terribly unfunny. 
Stepping Out,"This was a horrible skit right from the start. The entire skit revolved around Amber being the ""confused, clueless"" character, and it wasn't even revealed until around the third question that she interpreted the topic ""wonder woman"" as ""things women wonder"". Even the breaking into laughter wasn't funny. I couldn't watch the whole thing."
Stepping Out,Haha milk?
Stepping Out,"Nice PSA style comedy skit. Kinda too much information in the middle, but whatever."
Stepping Out,The Jimmy Fallon school of comedy.
Stepping Out,That was shit. they were breaking character over a situation that was slightly amusing at best to an outsider. The bit wasnt funny to begin with and them dying of laughter for no real reason wasnt funny either. 
Stepping Out,I would've loved to watch the whole thing but I couldn't. Why do they break down laughing? Nothing about this is funny. 
Stepping Out,I attended a taping early this year. I can just imagine how this played out in the audience
Stepping Out,Holy shit you are all terrible
Stepping Out,Ooph... that was not good.
Stepping Out,That was **brutally** humorless
Stepping Out,This is zero funny. Even them breaking character is nothing compared to SNL's
Stepping Out,"It would have been great if when Ally shot the confetti canon, she accidentally shot herself too."
Stepping Out,Wow.... That was awful.
Stepping Out,"I always think of when Dara √ì Briain loses it on one of his quiz/panel shows. ""Pwivate Bwosing at your service!"" I'm on mobile or I would link to it."
Stepping Out,So am I the only one who thinks the skit was good until they started laughing?
Stepping Out,This was really awful
Stepping Out,This show sux
Stepping Out,Felt flat.  Got a single chuckle out of me.
Stepping Out,That was cringe worthy bad. Not even a little funny. 
Stepping Out,They turned a really really lame skit into a funny one. Her final point would have been so awful without the laughter. Wonder Woman is a freaking super powered Goddess who is very far from a typical woman. I certainly hope she's not a new standard for women to compare themselves to. It's like all men being compared to George Clooney and Ryan Gosling. 
Stepping Out,What the hell did they find funny about that?
Stepping Out,"I didn't find this even remotely funny, just really cringey."
Stepping Out,"Does no one really give a fuck that they're abusing this platform to moralize to their audience? Even if you agree with their politics, how can anyone even enjoy this? They're just taking the audience members' biases and feeding it back to them to get laughs and reinforce dogma by treating any opposing opinions, regardless of their quality or nuance, as just wrong by ignoring the complexity of the issue.

You might want to say, ""Lighten up, it's just for laughs"" but I'm not buying it. I don't think you'd say that if he was doing the same thing from an anti-abortion standpoint. There are plenty of ways to laugh without feeding you moral talking points that seem convincing but are actually misleading when divorced from all meaningful context."
Stepping Out,"Every single one of these skits on late night with Amber are horrendous, she needs to stay off camera"
Stepping Out,Finally someone laughing at modern snl
Stepping Out,"That was just a long ad for Wonder Woman. How much is WB spending on viral promotion for this movie? It's not even that good of a movie! But, oh, apparently female empowerment is all that's needed to make a movie perfect now."
Stepping Out,I liked this one. Though I never realized how important it was to people to see lead roles that look like them. To me it's usually about the character and the writing rather than their gender or skin color. 
Stepping Out,"I don't mean to be an ass, but other than her shooting herself, everything else was far from funny"
Stepping Out,That white girl is really attractive
Stepping Out,"So there's a point... and then there's no counterpoint, just playing dumb. 

And there needs to be a counterpoint, OK? Otherwise rename the segment. "
Stepping Out,"I don't understand how Seth Meyers is a thing, how he's so popular or how he even got on SNL to begin with. Seth Meyers is not funny, I've never laughed at a single thing he's‚Äã said.

Stepping Out,Why did I feel a little... awkward watching this? :/
Stepping Out,SNL is still considered funny? 
Stepping Out,That was hard to watch...
Stepping Out,"I couldn't even make it to the part where they break character, the road leading up to it was so cringe-worthy."
Stepping Out,That forced laugh is so awful

Stepping Out,Go look at OP's post history. u/chartis is a big time progressive who is most likely posting this in a failed attempt to get more people appreciating diversity in comedy. /r/television posts usually don't make the front page without at least a bit of liberal propaganda.

Zero to Hero,"You don't feel that way in the game because you've been mowing enemies for the past 16 hours of playtime by then. You're desensitized to the violence by that point. 

Joel has less action in the show, which makes the last scene more impactful. That's great writing to be honest."
Zero to Hero,"He definitely was a mass shooter in the game, but when you‚Äôre controlling him you empathize. When he‚Äôs autonomous and you have to sit and watch him do it, you see it more objectively. It was fascinating for me how differently I felt about events as a player and a viewer."

What makes love stories interesting is the individuals involved and their growth within the story. 

Murder is bad? Yes. This is a shit story. Violence begets violence? Yes, this is a base level concept that many stories use but builder deeper themes and characters on top to become great. TLOU2 is basic shit."
Zero to Hero,I think this is just putting to bed the cope a lot of fans are feeling over certain scenes potentially being changed.
Zero to Hero,Co-wrote*
Zero to Hero,[removed]
Zero to Hero,Joel is absolutely the bad guy in this situation. We understand and feel for him cause we are watching his perspective but if we watched an entirely different character up until they are brutally murdered by this stranger Joel at the hospital we‚Äôd absolutely look at him as the villain. He made a selfish (understandably) choice.
Zero to Hero,"I'm not sure I understand the distinction you're making. I'd say The Last of Us 1&2 absolutely acknowledge and question the impact of how someone responds to their emotions/instincts, and the alternatives to acting off instinct or emotion. The games (and this first season of the show) are constantly questioning the morality of characters actions, especially when their reasons for acting may be sympathetic or instinctive.

What exactly is it you think this IP has critiqued that even has a solution? What has it not encouraged a dialogue for?"
Zero to Hero,"I was taught this quite effectively in GCSE English in the 90s. We read a piece of prose about a military officer getting chocolate for his daughter on his way home from work during a terrible war in winter.

It was a wholesome, but boring, story.

After we'd finished reading it the teacher asked us what the ""snow"" could be. It was worded in such a way it wasn't obvious. Then they explained - he's on his way home from the Concentration Camps. The ""snow"" was the ash of corpses he'd ordered be burnt.

The story and it's allusions suddenly made MUCH more sense. It was a 'wholesome' story but with one hell of a fucking kick.

We were all stunned. This guy who we'd all decided was a wholesome dad going about his day and getting his sweet daugther a chocolate bar during this terrible war. Turned out to be a fucking Nazi Deathcamp leader.

It was a real eye opener and has stayed with me for 25 years."

Zero to Hero,"The podcast is genuinely unbearable, he sounds incredibly pretentious."
Zero to Hero,The game's fanbase has been arguing about it for 10 years now.  Is there a particular reason you think the show will be any different?
Zero to Hero,"I thought Joel was straight-up evil in the finale, but you don‚Äôt think his actions were ‚Äúnegative?!‚Äù"
Zero to Hero,">Nobody watching is going to be unsympathetic to the calls made by the characters here

Yes, that's called protagonist bias and some of the most interesting media being made lately is about confronting that and recognizing that other perspectives outside the one presented to you as the most sympathetic are just as valid. 

It's always interesting to me how many struggle with that while being simultaneously angry that the media confronting that... is about that. ""Why are they trying to tell me violence and revenge are bad?"" They shout as they miss the point entirely and defend Joel as if those he's murdered don't have equally valid lives and families.

That's not to say that those who want a shallow reading or story of good guys v. bad guys are wrong for wanting that but it does feel weird to be angry at the story for digging deeper.

EDIT: You deleted your reply so I'll leave my response here: 

>to possibly save a bunch of people who are essentially abstract concepts

But this again misses the point of protagonist bias.

You are asking the narrative to spoonfeed why someone should care about faceless people when the point is that you should care regardless.

The value of the cure is in its possibility, not its certainty. Life doesn't have value because you are told how and why those lives are sympathetic."
Zero to Hero,"Highly disagree, >!there was an actual plan for the cure this time!< so fuck him and what he did"
Zero to Hero,I‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt understand what you‚Äôre saying. Can you explain this to me again while not sounding like a psychopath?
Zero to Hero,"It‚Äôs honestly so similar that it‚Äôs hard not to. 

Same thing happens with book adaptions except most people on reddit play games more than they read books. 

The last of us hbo subreddit has a show or game spoilers thread though if you want to be able to discuss in peace.

/r/thelastofusHBOseries"
Zero to Hero,"For those who have played the second game, it‚Äôs next to impossible to even discuss the finale and what might be next with those who don‚Äôt know the story.

Given their context and details, the spoilers are nearly unavoidable. Easier to simply say nothing than even try to be vague or play dumb‚Äîwhich is it‚Äôs own kind of frustrating for fans wanting to talk about it.

Not sure how people will go in Season 2 without knowing some of the bigger plot points.

Though, if you do, props to you. It will be quite the feat."
Zero to Hero,"They follow the game story dot for dot when making this story which isv extremely rare. It means you can actually join in the conversation with the players too. After all, the show is made for people who didn't play the game and that's pretty neat because now we're both enjoying the content. That being said .. I love 2 way more than 1 so buckle up!"
Zero to Hero,"You know, having ADHD isn‚Äôt always great, but I forget things so easily I basically can‚Äôt be spoiled.

Zero to Hero,"I think it can easily be the morally right thing to do.

Murdering people who are already incapacitated is not morally right to me. killing the doctor is not a morally right thing either.

But I wouldn‚Äôt sacrifice a child to save humanity who has adapted to the new world order.

I would allow her to sacrifice herself though. That‚Äôs the other thing Joel is guilty of, but so are the fireflies."
Zero to Hero,There are plenty of ethical arguments that what the Fireflies tried to do is horrible. Not saying its some settled debate but wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if other people with medical training wouldn‚Äôt be appalled by the operation itself and the way it was handled.
Zero to Hero,"It's the cost of love. As a parent, I would do **anything** to protect my children. The love a parent has for their kids is so primal. I didn't understand until my first child was born. Something just switches in people."
Zero to Hero,"No, what‚Äôs selfish is asking someone to sacrifice their ‚Äúfamily‚Äù member just so your bloodline can continue"
Zero to Hero,The game made it more of a ‚Äúit‚Äôs you or me‚Äù situation. The show presented it as him mowing down crowd‚Äôs without resistance.
Zero to Hero,"Right but you are killing them in your mindset and my mindset was completing the game. As you said, a function of the game is plowing down henchmen albeit with limited resources.

In the show, we get a stronger notion of how unhinged/determined Joel is when it comes to protecting Ellie. We also get a distinction on who it is he‚Äôs killing.

I don‚Äôt recall a point in the game where someone is sincerely begging for mercy and incapacitated. When they begged then it was either a cutscene or a ruse iirc. 

The weight of it just feels heavier watching it for me."
Zero to Hero,"I would say, to amend Mazin‚Äôs statement, good stories are built around tension, and that can come in the form of inter-character tension, like tlou, or intra-character tension, like lotr."
Zero to Hero,"Well, there was also the ‚Äúdestroy evil on middle-earth‚Äù part too haha but yes I agree."
Zero to Hero,"Yea that seems like a nothing statement to me. It basically amounts to ""can you turn the themes of your stories and internal struggles of your characters into marketable taglines catered to people who engage with media on a surface level"".

Cause ""It's worth killing everyone to save the person you love"" is the absolute shallow end. It's what conservative preppers dream about when they buy guns."
Zero to Hero,">I wish more people actually debated this right here instead of all the excuses about how what Joel did ""isn't actually that bad""

Lol, that is the debate. You feel differently than those people. You sound like you're just wishing everyone agrees with you tbh

This type of story is going to fracture opinions and split ideals. Some people will justify each action Joel made, not realizing it, seeing the lines he is crossing. Others will be horrified and want him to stop. Some will be cheering him on like he is dad of the year, and others will never look at him the same way.

It's a complicated story that has a ton of varied responses from viewers. That's it's strength imo"
Zero to Hero,Isn't Druckmann listed as the only writer for the first game?
Zero to Hero,neil is the sole credited writer for the first game
Zero to Hero,"Everyone in that hospital was actively conspiring to murder Ellie.  They weren't exactly innocent themselves.

Joel wasn't necessarily ""right"" but it's meant to be ambiguous and I do not understand why people act like it's black and white."
Zero to Hero,">The game's fanbase has been arguing about it for 10 years now.

Eh. Ish. Like, people talk about it being morally complicated, but... it's not, really, it's more a bit of spice in the characters. Would anyone ever believe Joel might choose differently? People see it as something that humanises him far, far more likely than they see him as a monster for it. Would people have actually preferred he let shit play out otherwise? I doubt it.

And even if we go with the now clearer idea the cure would work, for example, how much of a difference that would make to this world isn't exactly clear cut. In making such a big deal of the human factional conflict and inevitable grimdarkness of everything in this world, and minimising the gameplay sections (ie the bits where we actually see how dangerous the infected are), the show has made the fungus a secondary problem, so the supposed stakes don't quite stand up. If everybody got immunised tomorrow, it would change very little for a long time."
Zero to Hero,"I mean idk.. taking so many lives like he did definitely is bad but am I crazy for feeling like he was justified in doing so? I'm not saying it was right what he did or moral but I wouldn't go as far as to say that it was pure evil. They attack him and Ellie(loves her like a daughter) with stun grenades, knock him out with a rifle, say they are killing his daughter without her consent for a chance at a cure that might not even work and if he tries to go to her they will kill him. Everyone he kills minus the 1 doctor has ARs and are actively trying to kill him to stop him from getting to Ellie. Killing the lead surgeon who was defenseless was the only real issue I had with what he did. That and obviously lying about what happened to Ellie. Marlene would have eventually come after Ellie and was pointing a gun at Joel threatening his life.

If he had left and nothing positive came out of Ellie's murder(yes that's what it would have been) it would have haunted him to his deathbed and completely destroyed him that he didn't save her when he could have just like he didn't save his own daughter. I really believe the situation would have gone completely differently had the doctors given Ellie the choice and let her help Joel understand that this is what she wanted. He would have had closure and Ellie would have had agency over her decision. That and trying other alternatives before moving to something so drastic"
Zero to Hero,There‚Äôs nothing evil about saving a little girl from being murdered. Joel did nothing wrong.
Zero to Hero,"TIL defending your children is considered evil.

There‚Äôs a saying that eludes me right now, but it‚Äôs something like any parent would rather let the world burn than lose their child."
Zero to Hero,"While I don‚Äôt think killing people is a thing I could do, I would never allow the use of a kid in the way they did either.

In the game the killing is far easier then actually seeing it in the drama though. 

Still there is no question in my mind that fireflies were wrong unless they specifically asked Ellie which they did not."
Zero to Hero,Need a cure for the 2 groups of infected he ran into throughout a cross country expedition?
Zero to Hero,It's more that people just outright post spoilers
Zero to Hero,Are you sure it followed the game dot for dot??
Zero to Hero,I hate spoilers. It takes the excitement and surprise out of watching a show.
Zero to Hero,Then why is everyone bitching about spoilers?
Zero to Hero,"I think it's fascinating because Ellie makes it pretty abundantly clear that given the choice, she would absolutely sacrifice herself and Joel knew that. To me, it's even doubly selfish that he *knows* what path she would choose and he took that choice away from her. And he *knows* what he did was wrong, otherwise he wouldnt have lied to her. Joel is a broken selfish man and it's engaging as fuck."
Zero to Hero,"I feel like they knew they were going about this the wrong way too. By sedating her and immediately going for the surgery, they purposely robbed her of the choice so she couldn't say no, so they wouldn't have to put down a screaming child. That's absolutely monstrous, even if the outcome was a positive for humanity."
Zero to Hero,"> But I wouldn‚Äôt sacrifice a child to save humanity who has adapted to the new world order.

I think that's an incredibly naive thing to say since you haven't lived through an apocalypse. Would people who think it's normal to see their loved ones killed by infected feel the same way as people who post on reddit from the safety of their own homes?"
Zero to Hero,It's one thing if they were 100% sure they could make a cure out of killing her. But they seemed more desperate and clinging to the last illusion of hope they have. There is also the fact that the fireflies won't give the cure for free and will use it to gain power and replace the government.
Zero to Hero,It‚Äôs more than just the bloodline of the ff it‚Äôs all bloodlines potentially
Zero to Hero,You mean like mankind has been doing for millions of years with war? Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians are offering their children up right now to try and preserve the tribe.
Zero to Hero,"Most of the people he killed had assault rifles and were actively trying to kill him.  The only really ""unjustifable"" kill, at least onscreen, was the guy who tried to put down his gun."
Zero to Hero,Retcon
Zero to Hero,100% agree. They did great with that. Humanizing the enemy. It was impactful with the kid that Ellie paralyzed and Joel killed. Having him beg for his life and call out for his mom was brutal.
Zero to Hero,"Yeah, and I don't mean to be overly-critical. I'm not a writer and I didn't study it, and sometimes these quotes are taken out of context."
Zero to Hero,"> Lol, that is the debate.

No, it's a different debate. Instead of asking if it's morally right for Joel to doom the world to protect his family, instead the debate is switched to ""Joel was actually saving the world"" or ""Joel knew the cure wouldn't work!""

Stuff like ""the Fireflies mishandled the whole situation"" falls under the original debate. Things like ""Well the cure wasn't likely anyway"" is moving away from the original debate to just flat out saying murder is okay because the cure would fail"
Zero to Hero,"Yes.

Game Director: Bruce Straley

Creative Director: Neil Druckmann

Written By: Neil Druckmann

https://www.mobygames.com/game/60922/the-last-of-us/credits/ps3/"
Zero to Hero,"If you go by the game credits, Neil was in charge of the story and is credited as creative director and Written By, and Bruce Straley handled the gameplay side. If you go by what people online say, Bruce reigned in some of Neil's narrative choices to improve it to the story we wound up with in the final product. 

Where the truth lays? I don't know. But yes, Neil is credited as the sole creative contributor.

Edit - Not sure what I said to upset people; the credits are what they are."
Zero to Hero,"No one‚Äôs acting like it‚Äôs black and white and being a bad or good guy is completely subjective. In the story that‚Äôs being told here Joel essentially took away the chance to have ‚Äúliterally‚Äù saved humanity because he couldn‚Äôt handle losing Ellie. His actions are absolutely understandable but he still fucked over others to have his way. The hospital/fireflies weren‚Äôt conspiring to murder Ellie, what a dumb and absolutely ridiculous way to phrase them trying to make a cure that could save mankind. Putting aside whether it would work or the logistics of it the point is they had noble means and Joel is the opposite. His actions were selfish and could have ultimately doomed the world. It‚Äôs not black and white but he‚Äôs absolutely ‚Äúnarrative term here‚Äù the bad guy in this situation and even by saying that I understand his motivations and actions. You can still root for and respect the bad guys actions. It‚Äôs not at all ambiguous, it‚Äôs a moral debate. I don‚Äôt think you understand the term ambiguous."
Zero to Hero,Why the downvotes?
Zero to Hero,"> Would anyone ever believe Joel might choose differently?  

That's not the question posed, it's whether Joel was justified in his actions or was he completely and unwaveringly selfish or even both. You're not supposed to question whether he should've made a different decision (I don't think he ever would and that's why in the game you aren't given the choice) but question whether he is justified in his actions (which I do not)."
Zero to Hero,"I don't have much sympathy for the Fireflies at all for the reasons you give, but also because I have zero confidence in them to actual accomplish anything. They are NOT a competent resistance group, the Fireflies and I have no faith in their ability to generate a cure. Even if they managed to, how would they distribute it?

Killing the surgeon was easily the most questionable thing Joel did (and certainly will come back to haunt him depending how close they follow the second game in the future), but frankly, the surgeon was something of a dumbass. I was laughing at the guy when he was put down.

""How did you get in here?""

He just did a John Wick and slaughtered all your mooks. Did you not hear the gunfire?

""I won't let you take her!""

Again, he just took down a dozen guys and is here with a gun. You're giving his daughter to him or...oh, never mind, he just shot you."
Zero to Hero,"I gotta agree, have you ever seen anything about a game called Lisa: The Painful? Similar premise, but I feel it does a better job with the toxic love question. While also giving the daughter character agency to maker her own choices"
Zero to Hero,"You're insane if you really think that 

Like I get rationalizing Joel's act because you love Joel but saying he did NOTHING wrong at all is just outright evil shit."
Zero to Hero,"he only slaughtered countless men, including several that were trying to surrender and pleading for their live. He shot the doctor in the head without flinching, when he didnt have to. He shot and killed Marlene, who was also actively trying to reason with him. 

""nothing wrong"" lol"
Zero to Hero,And he robbed countless of lives from being saved and cured with a vaccine.
Zero to Hero,"Evil is a strong word, but everyone is the hero of their own story and the villain in someone else's. Loads of people aren't going to give a shit how much Joel loves Ellie (who they would happily point out is not actually 'his'), while their own children and millions of others are dying. To them he is the bad guy. Maybe even evil."
Zero to Hero,"People think crossing an arbitrary border to save your child's life is evil, why the surprise here?"
Zero to Hero,That's not his child!
Zero to Hero,"Your comment is funny I'm not taking that away. But it wasn't for those infected. It's for the future of mankind. Everyone will get to stop worrying about being bitten by infected and start actually rebuilding civilization.

Without cordyceps stuff. Fedra will losing its power they have for so long. Firefly will finally have a ground to stand on. And now they will have the argument on bringing control back to the people."
Zero to Hero,I'm sure Sam and Henry and Tess would have appreciated it.
Mystery,"Neeson:

>‚ÄùNo, I‚Äôm not,‚Äù Neeson said when asked if he‚Äôs interested in returning. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs so many spinoffs of ‚ÄòStar Wars.‚Äô It‚Äôs diluting it to me, and it‚Äôs taken away the mystery and the magic in a weird way.‚Äù

>""It was nice to do that little bit with Ewan, after 25 years, 24 years. I appeared in the last episode. I had 2 lines to say, and it was cool and I loved it. But that's it."""
Mystery,Star Wars is being hurt by lack of direction and mediocrity.
Mystery,"The only Star Wars spinoff I've liked is Rogue One and Andor. 

Andor was one of those where I couldn't *believe* anyone was able to get the script approved."
Mystery,"I just don't understand why they insist only doing stuff from the start of the clone wars to just after the fall of the empire. Give me some Old Republic stuff like Mandalorian wars, the ancient sith lords, or the creation of the jedi order."
Mystery,Or maybe it's that the ratio of good to shitty movies/shows is like 1 out of 5 being generous.
Mystery,Number of spin-offs isn't the problem. Terrible scripts are.
Mystery,Liam Neesons though‚Ä¶.
Mystery,"Honestly, the last movies were hideous in comparison with the spin offs."
Mystery,There's different camps of Star Wars fans. Original trilogy vs original 6 vs disney Star Wars
Mystery,"ITT: Lots of misdirected anger.

The guy is right, and there's nothing wrong with him saying so.

Edit: FYI, if you're writing me a five paragraph essay of fan drivel, I'm not going to read it."
Mystery,"I can see where he's coming from, but when your spinoffs (Mando, Andor) are considered better than the trilogy that recently came out, you gotta get behind what's still making you bank."
Mystery,They are being hurt from shit stories and terrible writers
Mystery,"He then closed out the interview by promoting his next film.

#Tooken 8: The Tookening"
Mystery,"He's not wrong.

It's why DC Comics tried to streamline things for new readers with The New 52, and then Marvel later tried the same thing with Marvel NOW!; when there's too much of something, people get fatigued trying to keep up with everything.

You could always say ""don't watch everything"" but that's not how the brain works."
Mystery,The ‚Äúmystery‚Äù was taken away with ‚Äúmidiclorians ‚Äú
Mystery,"Agreed. And he isn't saying all ""spinoffs"" are bad, which would be unsupportable (see: Andor). An overabundance of varying quality, definitely."
Mystery,"I mean I kinda agree 

Mainly if your content isn‚Äôt AAA maybe it shouldn‚Äôt be made 

Like bad batch is great but some episodes are kinda filler and think obi wan and boba Fett shows don‚Äôt need to exist"
Mystery,He should know. He was a part of the beginning of the end.
Mystery,He's right.
Mystery,Andor
Mystery,"Andor was ten times better than the last 6 movies.

I think it's the opposite.  The terrible movies are ruining the franchise.

Even bobba fett was better than the last few movies."
Mystery,"Wasn't he in the midichlorians Star Wars episode that literally removed the mystery of the force?

And didn't he have that bullshit story line about Anakin?  Ok, just checking."
Mystery,I agree with him for the most part. Andor was out of this world.
Mystery,"Hes right, but also....

Do another movie where your a grizzled old veteran that has to begrudgingly do one last job or save someone that's in trouble, and in the process you redeem yourself."
Mystery,Says the guy who did ‚ÄúTaken‚Äù and dozen other  of the same formulaic films of a guy seeking revenge.
Mystery,"I hate to break it to him, but the prequels diminished the value of the franchise."
Mystery,"Says the guy from: Men in Black International, Daddy‚Äôs Home 2, The Huntsman, Ted 2, Taken 1-2-3, Anchorman 2, Wrath of the Titans, The Chronicles of Narnia, The A-Team, Les Mis, Arthur the King, Excalibur, and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm missing a few spinoffs, remakes and sequels. He is well versed in running stories into the ground."
Mystery,Says the man in the first spinoff.
Mystery,Bro there‚Äôs too many Liam Neeson movies if anything. Three of them came out last year alone and I bet they were all basically the same
Mystery,"He's right. I used to really enjoy the movies occasionally. Even saw the prequels in theaters. Then they kept coming, one after the other and every dumb mother fucker in the world is out here trying to act like they are the biggest fan in the world. It got so annoying that I can't enjoy any of that shit anymore"
Mystery,It‚Äôs become the Empire
Mystery,I don‚Äôt mind the expanded universe of movies so long as they are not shit and lately the complaint is that the movies and spinoffs have been nothing but social justice shit.
Mystery,Totally agree
Mystery,"Yeah, sorry Liam, but nah. Projects like Rogue One, Mandalorian, Bad Batch, and Andor show that there is plenty of time for great stories in this universe. It's not an issue of to much content, but an issue of flying space Mary Poppins cameos of Princess Leia's reanimated corpse and Jar Jar Bigalow ""Mee-sa Senator now"" being regurgitated into the screen. The issue isn't volume, it's quality."
Mystery,"""Being hurt""?  


No, the damage was done a very long time ago. Now its more like kicking the pulverized remains of a long dead horse"
Mystery,"people here complaining about diluting star wars, sayin disney is at fault.

meanwhile i was reading these same stories in the 90s, in comic and/or novel form, because the star wars EU existed.

the only difference is now they are turning the stories into live action. hell episode 9, which i greatly dislike, is still very much Dark Empire from the 90s.

Fuck if they dont need to go ahead and make Shadows of the Empire into a live action series.

crime lords vs sith lords. lets go!"
Mystery,I happen to agree with Mr Neeson on this...
Mystery,Whatever made Andor happen - keep doing that.  Best Star Wars material out there.
Mystery,"Stars Wars succumbed to the Marvel-ization effect a while ago. I feel the same way about a new star wars IP as I do a new superhero movie: oh, ok."
Mystery,"‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù always struck me as a story about Anakin Skywalker and how he turned away from good and then was redeemed by the love of his son. 

That story has been told."
Mystery,"Well Star Wars fans have proven that they'll watch and like any old crap, so it doesn't really matter."
Mystery,I agree and also like the some of the spin offs.
Mystery,Space Jesus isn't wrong
Mystery,"Think the sequel trilogy did that, mate."
Mystery,When does Taken 6 come out?
Mystery,I think it‚Äôs diluting for me that Neeson has made multiple films with the same plot for the last 15 years.
Mystery,Clearly not a fan of Andor being better than his entire role.
Mystery,"No, it's been hurt by Disney having ZERO outline for the Sequel Trilogy.  Rian Johnson's Episode 8 was a mess, then Episode 9 was an abomination.  ""Somehow, Palpatine returned.""  

Say what you will about Geroge Lucas' writing skills, but ""Somehow, Palpatine returned.""  Is just about the most idiotic sentence in any Star Wars movie... scratch that, ANY movie where a villain came back for unexplained reasons."
Mystery,"I disagree, I think fleshing out the galaxy beyond the skywalker saga is a good thing.

I think people are conflating some of the quality issues of some of the content with the need for said content. I would prefer Disney spend more time curating quality Star Wars spin-offs rather than green lighting every half assed project, but I don‚Äôt think spin-offs themselves are the issue."
Mystery,Isn‚Äôt this the guy that shared screen time with JarJar Binks?
Mystery,"Respectfully, I disagree."
Mystery,Boooo ‚Ä¶ explore the Galaxy.
Mystery,"Yeah, well, you know, that's just, like, your opinion, man.

I think its fine, its more the varying quality that is the problem, not the quantity."
Mystery,"I have to disagree with him - especially when it comes to the shows.  For this IP or any other, it really comes down to the quality of what is being produced, not the number.  If it is good, then people will watch it.  For ***Star Wars*** specifically, the ""universe"" is so large I am enjoying the more micro looks into it."
Mystery,"Ehh sounds like an old man complaining bout kids on the lawn, I wanna see every story of that universe and now I can. Sure some are misses but at least they tried."
Mystery,Jar Jar.
Mystery,"I don't know, many people are actually liking some of the things they have done. Many spinoffs in the movie department were really good, like rogue one and solo, many were great successes like the mandalorian and andor. Fans love those (maybe some not so much at the start like it happened with the episodes one though three) but the misses on Disney plus have been much less, the bigger ones were in the last trilogy.

The only thing that really was going to hurt the brand was focusing entirely on the Skywalkers. Fans loved and live through the extended universe for years until they had some live action stuff again. And that was the beauty of Starwars how they could make different stories in the same universe not make everything about the same people all the time."
Mystery,It is funny because the spinoffs are the only thing that I enjoy.
Mystery,Yeah it started around 2001...
Mystery,"You were in one of those spinoffs, Liam! XD"
Mystery,"Yep star wars stopped being special a long time ago but there was money to be made so can't really blame disney for squeezing every penny out of it. If you could of told 12 year old me there would be multiple star wars tv shows and movies I would never be even quasi interested in, I don't think I would of believed you, but here we are."
Mystery,I mean...the movie he was in started that.
Mystery,"Hard to agree when Andor is hands down the best piece of starwars content out there.

I know people who don't watch any starwars content that loved Andor."
Mystery,"Yes, but I knew Disney was going to get that 4 billion they paid George Lucas for the franchise back and then some.

There was a video of a guy or someone freaking out when Star Wars Episode 49 or some such came out. I figured that was where it was going to go."
Mystery,Pretty sure midiclorines s/p are the ones that took the mystery away.
Mystery,I love Qui-Gon!
Mystery,"Lol. jar jar binks. There are only 3 star wars films, anything else ruins it."
Mystery,Wrong
Mystery,Wrong.
Mystery,"After reading the comments, I just wanted to say I enjoy the prequels; especially ROTS!"
Mystery,Honestly‚Ä¶ Rogue One is the only Star Wars movie I like and would watch again.
Mystery,Oh please bring back the midiclorian bs‚Ä¶
Mystery,Humbly disagree.
Mystery,"I love Liam, but Star Wars shat that bed the first movie he was in. At first i was annoyed at them ruining my childhood. Then I realized I'm a grown ass man. Maybe it's ok that Star Wars don't cater to me as a grown ass man the way they did when I was a kid."
Mystery,Yep.  This cow has been milked dry
Mystery,"From the man, in the movie that gave us a boring genetic reason for jedi to exist."
Mystery,"No, because there was no more story to tell after the first trilogy."
Mystery,The damage was done with the prequels.
Mystery,"Yeah, fuck that. Andor was great. Rogue One was great. Keep them coming."
Mystery,No one tell him about where midichlorians came from
Mystery,"I feel like the original appeal was a rag tag group of filmmakers and actors got together to tell a story about a rag tag group of underdogs adventuring around space, with lots of space battles and laser swords. But it's grown so beyond that now that it's so exceptionally mainstream. That's probably why The Mandalorian and The Clone Wars are so popular among fans because they are the closest to capturing that spirit."
Mystery,"I love The Mandalorian and the original trilogy. I haven't seen Clone Wars or Andor yet. Otherwise, I think the franchise has been more misses than hits."
Mystery,"I think he has a point. Lot of garbage in the star wars universe. But there's some true gems. Andor is truly remarkable and if you love star wars, then this series acts as a love letter without unnecessary fan service. It's fantastic story telling within the star wars universe with compelling and interesting characters."
Mystery,That‚Äôs because he didn‚Äôt get a part in a good show. Like Andor‚Ä¶
Mystery,I swear I read this as Leslie Nielsen.
Mystery,‚ÄúWe have to explain the reason behind Han Solo‚Äôs last name.‚Äù
Mystery,"‚Ä¶He says from the set of Taken 13. /s 

But for real, they should‚Äôve stopped after the prequels, at least there was a point to those ones."
Mystery,Isn't this one of the main criticisms leveled against the prequels when they came out? George Lucas has the same problem I do where he has too much anxiety when it comes to explaining things and so he over explains instead of letting the audience infer things. A big reason the first 3 movies were good was because of his ex-wife who edited them.
Mystery,-said a person who's never read a star wars book
Mystery,No its being hurt by idiots making the decisions and poor writing
Mystery,"If only Qui Gon had a young daughter that had been kidnapped whilst on holiday in Coruscant with her best friend, and then he had to use his talents to track her and bring justice to the evil ringleader of the trafficking gang. That would have worked as a spinoff series!!!"
Mystery,You mean bad star wars. Andor is a masterclass in how NOT to fuck up the universe. I say more spinoffs
Mystery,"True, I literally did not even care about the spin-offs only the main trilogy movies."
Mystery,"I totally disagree with Neeson here. If they made fewer Star Wars spinoffs they wouldn't suddenly be more magical. Instead of regular soulless cash crabs it would just be somewhat rare soulless cash crabs.

Hack writers and creatively bankrupt people don't magically become more talented by doing less work."
Mystery,"That's a very reductive take on what is a grand fictional universe ripe to tell many different kinds of stories in.

Lack of mystery and magic doesn't happen because of spin-offs, it happens because of unimaginative writers.

But there is a bit of truth to it, of course. You can't keep telling stories without chipping away at the mysteries of the IP. That's just how it goes.

However, I have never believed that to mean that more stories shouldn't be told."
Mystery,I've got the perfect solution: don't watch the spinoffs.
Mystery,He‚Äôs right and he should say it.
Mystery,"Well, I don't know. Maybe he has a point, but for me the reason it has been hurt has more to do with the lack of talent and vision, particularly in the sequel trilogy."
Mystery,10000% agreed
Mystery,Solo is the best Star Wars movie and I'll die on that hill.
Morning Express,"Forensic Files is a classic. However, it ended like in 2011 after 14 seasons and the famous narrator Peter Thomas died in 2016 at age 91. It is all re-runs. Same episodes over and over again.  Someone really need to make more episodes and bring back Forensic Files. "
Morning Express,"You're not wrong. I've noticed this, too. Here is their TV schedule:

http://www.ontvtonight.com/guide/listings/channel/69047084/hln.html"
Morning Express,I remember when it used to be an actual news channel.  In high school our civics teacher had us watch it for a few minutes a day for a project.
Morning Express,I literally have had this same thought 
Morning Express,"Has there been an episode of forensic files where the science was proven wrong and the ‚Äúcriminal‚Äù exonerated later?

Kind of like that guy Texas executed for burning his family alive when it was really an electrical fire. Apparently most arson ‚Äúscience‚Äù is horseshit."
Morning Express,"Oh man I didn't know he died üò¢ your right, maybe they should make new seasons of the show. It could be cool üëç"
Morning Express,Jeez! Why not rename the channel Forensic Files then... I'm wondering if they just don't have any other programs to show or if that's the only thing that attracts viewers...
Morning Express,"My world history teacher has us watch CNN Everytime we come in, so I can relate lol"
Morning Express,üòÇüòÇheyyy Kyle 
Morning Express,I believe [Joyce Gilchrist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joyce_Gilchrist) appeared in a couple of episodes. 
Morning Express,"If Forensic Files is right up your alley, check out the cable channel Investigation Discovery (ID).  The whole channel is dedicated to shows just like Forensic Files. There is a real life murder/serious crime and there is reenactment, interviews with police officers/forensic that was involved with the case, and show how the criminal was captured. Investigation Discovery produce their own shows so each individual show has a theme for the crime: Swamp Murders, Blood Relatives, Evil Twins, Deadly Woman, Fatal Vows, Fear Thy Neighbor, Obsession Dark Desires, Homicide Hunter, etc.  

"
Morning Express,I've noticed more and more channels are doing this kind of thing lately. [ION TV](https://iontelevision.com/schedule) will spend the entire day playing back to back reruns of CSI or Law & Order.
Morning Express,who dis ??
Morning Express,"wow, thanks, didnt expect an answer lol"
Morning Express,"Hey bro, sounds real cool! üòéüòéI'll check and see if I have Investigation Discovery and i do, I'll binge watch everything it has ;) üòÇ üëå"
Morning Express,I'm pretty sure some people would love that... Probably that's their way of fighting back Netflix and Hulu by putting on the same shows like that.
Morning Express,[deleted]
Morning Express,"TF...? Ya username is kylebb and I just randomly said ""hey Kyle"" because I thought you had a nice name "
Morning Express,Omfg. Please. No. Not. That.
Morning Express,Np ;) üòÇ
Morning Express,i know quarantine is weird for everyone but youre thinking about Home Improvement too much.
Morning Express,"I don't think so, Tim, but I will admit that the post gained more credit the further I read.

On an unrelated note, I once met the actor who played Mark.  It was at some event for kids and I was wearing a Far Side shirt; the one with the guy pushing on a pull door.  He said ""Hey, I have the same shirt."" and I said ""Me too."""
Morning Express,"I don't think so, Tim."
Morning Express,"As a huge, huge fan of the show I appreciate what you've done here."
Morning Express,"No, but he was a cocaine trafficker."
Morning Express,"Comedy is all about juxtaposition. What's funny about the exchange in this scene is that Tim breaks several social conventions in his interaction with the Beach Boys, who are effectively playing five straight men to his jester. The audience is literally laughing because he's not interacting in an appropriate way. In a sitcom, such behavior ought to be expected. So no, he doesn't have Asperger's - he's a comedy character."
Morning Express,"You're forgetting the need for symptoms to be causing clinically significant impairment in daily functioning. 


That's a pretty big one right there."
Morning Express,I always love psychological assessments of sitcom characters. I think you maybe on to something. I'd say he's rather high functioning but you could be right.
Morning Express,"That's certainly a weird thought, but one you clearly spent time on. 

If we put aside that most of his behavior can be explained by the fact that it's a sitcom - Tim has a lot of friends, and has no trouble maintaining his friendships. You have to remember he's a middle-aged man, so having a group of friends (Al, the hardware shop guys, even Wilson) that size is pretty good. He's interesting in cars *and home improvement*, so it makes sense that his friends are also interested in that - that's how adults make friends. 

I also don't think having a set morning routine is enough clinical evidence for any sort of disorder. Most people have a routine. But Tim doesn't cease to function because he couldn't use his red cup or because he put on his pants before his socks, or something. 

All in all, Tim IS obsessed with cars, but he's also very outgoing, has no trouble talking to people, has lots of friends, and isn't basically debilitated by things being off-schedule or out of place for him. 

Your theory is an interesting one, and I appreciate that it wasn't just like ""Tim likes cars, is he autistic?"", you clearly put more thought into this theory than other people would have, but I think it doesn't hold water in the end. 

Regardless of whether or not Tim is on the Autism Spectrum Disorder, I LOVE your theory about Jill."
Morning Express,I think you‚Äôre reading way too much into it.
Morning Express,[deleted]
Morning Express,Well I feel like I have asperger‚Äôs now
Morning Express,"I don't think so. I believe that his character was basically a grown child, and a parody of masculinity, rather than an adult. When I was a kid I had like 2-3 friends too rather than a huge group and AFAIK i'm not autistic (i'm just an asshole).

he doesn't express any sort of hyperfocus tendancies. He's just 'laughable idiot TV dad"".

He doesn't withdraw when overstimulated, or lose his shit entirely when things don't fit his plan."
Morning Express,I'm pretty sure he was just supposed to be a 90s standard idiot sitcom dad who we're supposed to laugh at and feel better about ourselves in comparison to him.
Morning Express,"MFs haven't cleaned the house or stayed hygienic in weeks, y'all worried about the wrong Home Improvement"
Morning Express,"One of the more valuable understandings I came to as an undergraduate was the degree to which our compulsion to label things is, to a large degree, opposed to our ability to experience them directly.

This is not a new thought, and many philosophers and academics in the humanities have explored it at great length, but it's still not something that seems widely appreciated. When we label something, we change our relationship to the thing we're labeling, even though that thing hasn't changed. This can have good and/or bad consequences, but in all cases it increases the distance between us, and the thing. It's an additional level of mediation. 

Which is to say: be selective in what you seek labels for. Parsimonious, even. And make sure those labels serve a worthwhile purpose. Because it's easy to apply labels, and often very difficult to remove them. They can make you feel that the world is more ordered and comprehensible...but they also necessarily reduce the nuance and diversity of that same world.

Each individual has to decide for themselves if the change from ""Tim, that wacky character that I really liked"" to ""Tim, that character with Asperger's that I really liked"" is a positive one for them. 

(Or likewise, the change that too many of us have made lately from ""Bob, my friendly neighbor with different political views"" to ""Bob, that fascist nazi fuck"".)"
Morning Express,Awesome breakdown. I think you‚Äôve made a pretty good case.
Morning Express,Have you ever been around somebody with Asperger's?
Morning Express,"Holy crap, that is one hell of an interesting read on the subject. I remember this episode well - my family watched Home Improvement regularly in those days, and (given that my parents were surfers back in the '60s) also considered The Beach Boys to be something close to sacred, so this episode was a big deal to us. I remember the joke about him rattling off '60s car songs particularly well. 

Some 20 years after this episode aired I found out I had asperger's. 

That revelation led me to re-evaluate a lot of things, though I must admit Home Improvement was (perhaps understandably) never one of them. 

This is a neat post. Thanks for writing it out."
Morning Express,"Tim Taylor is not Asperger's. He's just a moron. If he were Asperger's, he'd know a lot more about the tools, and it'd be a lot safer with them. Gigantism and self-destructiveness are not Asperger's traits, they're moronic traits."
Morning Express,He had dumb 90s sitcom syndrome.
Morning Express,I just had a thought: Jill was a milf.
Morning Express,"It's just typical boomer humor about ""men be like this and women be like that."" that Tim Allen built his whole comedic act around even before he had a sitcom."
Morning Express,"Tim Allen's entire gimmick was that he was a thickheaded American male. 

Every episode was the same because sitcoms are predictable by nature."
Morning Express,Question. Why would you put that much thought into a 20 year old sitcom?
Morning Express,"This is actually interesting to read. I guess show's with caricative characters quite often brush against actual things without noticing. I guess they just thought he'd be unique, without noticing that technically, he'd qualify. 

I wonder how you can apply this kind of analysis to other comedy characters. I'd love for a real couples therapist to take a look at Doug and Carrie. Even though it'd probably end with her leaving him almost immediately. It was hard to watch when he was a complete dick to her. It was funny when it was soft stuff, but sometimes he'd go out of his way to lie to her and make her miserable, just to do something stupid."
Morning Express,"I don‚Äôt know enough about Home Improvement or Asperger‚Äôs Syndrome to agree with you, but it‚Äôs a sound theory.

Can you tell me what‚Äôs up with Daniel Faraday from Lost? He seems ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù, but I‚Äôm not sure what the health term is.

Oh. Why does he have a different last name than both of his parents?"
Morning Express,Damn I have aspergers
Morning Express,"This isn't Asperger's -- this is the typical conservative male. 

I can understand your confusion. The two groups share many overlapping attributes."
Morning Express,"I think all you managed to do was reduce Asperger's to someone that's really interested in one topic. You do realize that's how names like Baker and Mason became family names, right? Some people have solitary interests.

No offense to the Beatles, but I don't know their catalogue beyond movie soundtracks that used them. Since I'm not a fan, but know they are famous, I could see an interaction like the one you're talking about. If he played one of his songs, but I only knew one of the Lennon songs, does that make me autistic as well?"
Morning Express,"I will always be upset that Tim Allen used the name of the lead singer of Brainiac in this sitcom, because fuck Tim Allen's cokefiend snitch-bitch ass"
Morning Express,Isn't the show scripted?
Morning Express,"Hmm.. the question you've raised is an interesting question and I appreciate the thought put into it.  I don't think Tim Taylor had Aspergers, though. But I do think that he stopped maturing emotionally at age 11, when his father died. We all have an emotional age and for some people when they go through trauma, that's when their emotionally maturity becomes stunted. This would explain the immaturity in a lot of facets of his life like: his hobby fixation, his inability to follow direction, his interactions with his wife and sons, and his bullying of Al.

While this is just a scripted TV show, art does imitate life and his personality type is not that uncommon."

Morning Express,"Well, when all you‚Äôve got during the quarantine is time, some of it is bound to be Tool Time."
Morning Express,I think you may have Asperger's OP
Morning Express,Is he? I think this is pretty cool.
Morning Express,Day 14 Without Sports makes people a bit crazy.
Morning Express,I love that story!
Morning Express,How do you know this is OP‚Äôs name
Morning Express,"[It was hard work, but somebody had to do it!](https://media.giphy.com/media/FaIDQOgN69FXq/source.gif)"
Morning Express,"To add to this, sitcoms have limited locations and cast for practical reasons (explaining his lack of friendships and activities) and dialogue is written for comedy or to further the plot, asking how Wilson is would never fit. 

I had fun reading this but I imagine it could be applied to most sitcom characters."
Morning Express,"I would argue that Tim's behavior does cause significant impairment in his daily functioning. Every week of his life revolves around a fight with his family, his friends, or his coworkers, usually resolved by him taking time to understand and process others' feelings. And if not that, it's in issue with endangering himself and his health due to lack of common sense in household repairs or work."
Morning Express,Yeah wasn't the whole thing that Tim was lime a super successful tool salesman prior tp starting the show?
Morning Express,[Thanks](https://media.giphy.com/media/4NnQZhyty3KaRPL8lF/source.gif)!
Morning Express,"Just because someone comes up with a ridiculous idea out of sheer boredom you don‚Äôt have to lie to the poor guy and tell them their stupid take is good.

That‚Äôs how we get people on American Idol who can‚Äôt sing worth shit and don‚Äôt believe it when they‚Äôre told they suck because nobody has ever been honest with them till that moment."
Morning Express,[Oh ok! Thanks!](https://media.giphy.com/media/jUpbLiWxLrI6KNI4g3/source.gif)
Morning Express,Yeah I was sort of thrown by this. Its shown pretty regularly that he has a group of guy friends he hangs out with but he has a wife a job and 3 kids so the focus is there
Morning Express,Remember that time Everybody Loves Raymond was huge and it was literally just four people verbally abusing each other for 30 minutes each week because they were all too stubborn to change their minds or admit they're wrong while the kids hid in their rooms and the son-brother got treated like shit?
Morning Express,I‚Äôm pretty sure OP has just fallen for the network sitcom trap where every character is a cliche and becomes flanderized.
Morning Express,"A boy at school has been bullying me. Will you teach me to box?

Also I accidentally did something to the coffee table while you were out of town."
Morning Express,No she‚Äôs white trash
Morning Express,Someone skimmed the post
Morning Express,[Thank you.](https://media.giphy.com/media/TU4jbmO24lrUI/source.gif)
Morning Express,"Perhaps. I'm kind of a stickler, but that's because I'm a licensed psychologist who works in an autism research lab lol."
Morning Express,"I‚Äôve been watching the show recently and while I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs autistic, I do think he has ADHD! I actually found this thread while looking for threads  whether *Al* is autistic. I expanded on both in another comment if you‚Äôre curious, OP :) I love analyzing characters like you have here; my husband and I do it constantly!

As for me‚Ä¶ well I likely have both XD"
Morning Express,Hopefully Tim didn't catch [Key Lime disease](https://streamable.com/uy8x0)!
Morning Express,"> that Tim was lime

He what?"
Morning Express,Or how people with completely useless opinions are able to broadcast them on a public forum.
Morning Express,[Yikes!](https://media.giphy.com/media/1yk0u4nmnETJ9Ur0VP/giphy.gif)
Morning Express,"You haven't watched american idol in a while, I see"
Morning Express,"I never found that show very funny. I always felt too sad for Raymond and his brother to laugh at them. 

They were both very messed up and traumatized because of their mothers constant negative comments and bullying behavior.

 I usually felt sorry for them rather than finding the situations they got themselves into funny."
Morning Express,"No, I read his attempt at bullet point analysis of Asperger's as well, but they don't apply strictly to someone with Asperger's. They are tertiary behaviors."
Morning Express,"Watch the show and get back to us, let's get some professional input in this thread!"
Morning Express,TIM WAS LIME
Morning Express,"Like.  He was like a super successful salesman.

That's a pretty obvious typo if you ask me, but thanks for calling me out I guess"
Morning Express,"Disagreeing with his conclusion is different than saying he‚Äôs boiling everything down into one character trait. He listed several in his post. If you read them then there‚Äôs no reason to claim he‚Äôs only focusing on interests. 

Pick an argument, scatterbrain."
Morning Express,It's hard to analyze the past through the bias of today. As someone who grew up in the 80s/90s Tim's behavior was pretty prototypical machismo.
Morning Express,"Glad they did, because I read it earlier and missed it entirely.

'Tim was lime' made me smile."
Morning Express,"Maybe you should actually look at the body of his arguments, rather than just the fact that he made multiple. All of them are surrounded around the fact that he fixates on a singular subject. Or are we going to pretend like the sitcom character grunt noise is a legitimate trait comparison to someone with Asperger's?"
Morning Express,"I **love** *The Daily Show with Jon Stewart*, but I think we're projecting this Neo-Cronkite image onto Jon Stewart. According to Stewart himself, he's not a journalist. He's a comedian. His lead-in used to be a show about puppets making crank calls. He's there to make people laugh.

And if we ever get to the point where we absolutely *need* a comedian like Jon Stewart to keep us informed, if we get to that state where *all other media* just doesn't work, then we're totally and royally fucked. While the 24-hour cable news networks are quite bad, PBS and the BBC do terrific reporting. Plus, newspapers still exist and still do great original reporting.

Finally, if Jon Stewart doesn't want to do the show, he shouldn't have to. He's a person, not an indentured newscaster."
Morning Express,"Jesus Christ, imagine if such passion was actually focused on real policymakers.  

And if your answer is there's none worthy of it, maybe you should wonder about if it's easier to do something or mock others for trying.  Remember your TR, folks."
Morning Express,"You can mail it to him.

The Daily Show With Jon Stewart

You could also send it care of Comedy Central or Stewart's agent/lawyer/publicist. I'm sure their details can be found using Bing.

Although, I hope this letter doesn't change his mind because, to borrow from his retirement announcement, I don't want a show with a restless host."
Morning Express,This pretty much verifies every single stereotype I have of Fake News fans.
Morning Express,"What a shit letter. Why don't you just fly out to New York and offer to suck the guys dick? What's with you jerks and the celebrity worship? Do you all lack fulfilling lives? Jew Stewart isn't even funny, just another smug liberal shit stain like most of you. "
Morning Express,[deleted]
Morning Express,"> I'm sure their details can be found using Bing.

Do you work for Microsoft?"
Morning Express,The most important thing that those of the Jon Stewart ilk do is identify the topics about which we voters need to seek out and become informed.
Morning Express,"I guess OP doesn't realize that the show was meant to be humorous and not factual.  

OP, get a dose of the real world will ya?"
Morning Express,He should run as a Republican? Democrat? Libertarian? Green Party? or create a new political party?
Masters Of The Sea,"Kevin Smith's worked with her before and seems to be a big fan, so that makes sense."
Masters Of The Sea,Why isn't SMG continuing in the role?
Masters Of The Sea,I totally thought that the show was over lol
Masters Of The Sea,"Honestly, I know it got a lot of complaints due to He-Man not being in most of it through the first half...but it was a pretty well-done series.

It held true to the spirit of the 80s show but wasn't, y'know, Filmation crap just made to sell toys. 

I'm happy there's going to be a second season."
Masters Of The Sea,"Just keep it inside

Learn how to hide

Your feelings"
Masters Of The Sea,"I know I'm in the minority, but I'm really looking forward to the new Skeletor story arc after his final scene in the previous season. Seems creepy/badass."
Masters Of The Sea,Jewel of Wilson‚Äôs foul domain
Masters Of The Sea,"Give me some quality live-action He-Man already, damn!"
Masters Of The Sea,"Skimmimg through the article, I thought for a second that William Shatner was doing the voice for Skeletor, imagine that."
Masters Of The Sea,"Seeing as she‚Äôs literally married to He-Man, I‚Äôm not surprised."
Masters Of The Sea,Didn‚Äôt fans hate the last one of these shows that they made?
Masters Of The Sea,This show is still on?
Masters Of The Sea,"Amped they're continuing this! I thought the S2 finale could have been much better paced, but overall I really enjoyed this."
Masters Of The Sea,I really enjoyed the first season so I'm happy they are making more. Don't really have an opinion on the voice acting change.
Masters Of The Sea,"I'm going to get downvoted to hell but dear god I loathed both seasons of this show.  And Teelah was the most god awful protagonist.  She had to be coerced and pulled from one scene to the next, was joyless and just uninteresting to watch.  And that's not SMG's fault, the writing was just bad.  

To the show's credit I was interested in Evil Lynn and Orco's episode.  The animation was top notch.  

But He-Man got sidelined even Skeletor got sidelined.  And for the most part the show was a joyless slog that damaged one of my childhood heroes.  But this show wasn't for me as an 80's kid.  It sold itself as being for me, but it was a complete bait and switch."
Masters Of The Sea,Super
Masters Of The Sea,"Definitely an upgrade. Though I don‚Äôt think her husband had a great He-Man voice. A good Adam but he lacked that booming bass from the 80s show.

Edit: Melissa Benoist as Wolverine‚Äôs daughter:

https://youtu.be/YJku_F1cXow"
Masters Of The Sea,She was super girl right?
Masters Of The Sea,Didn‚Äôt they already ruin this franchise?
Masters Of The Sea,"Is this a new, new series or a continuation?"
Masters Of The Sea,I'm honestly surprised this show is getting another season. The first was a monster turd.
Masters Of The Sea,Awe that sucks! I thought she did a great job! I hope it's just a scheduling conflict
Masters Of The Sea,How has this not been cancelled yet?
Masters Of The Sea,"My take is it just needs to be a ‚ÄúHe-Man‚Äù show‚Ä¶ like the original was‚Ä¶ 

And then, at least, all us OG He-Man fans would love it. Because we loved that show. 

You can always make a different show, centered around a different character, and still call it ‚ÄúHe-Man.‚Äù You can do that, it‚Äôs a free country, but then you risk alienating the people that liked and enjoyed the original show. 

Maybe you can have greater success without the original fans‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs possible‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs not the direction I would have gone with the IP."
Masters Of The Sea,"The actual star of He-Man, Teela is getting an new actor? 

Somehow, some way, we shall be okay."
Masters Of The Sea,"This is such a lowkey powerhouse piece of IP. New toy line, two animated series and a live action show all in the last ~5 years."
Masters Of The Sea,‚Ä¶..and it‚Äôs cancelled
Masters Of The Sea,Idek what another season would be about. Teela is the most powerful being in history and STILL has He-Man for backup
Masters Of The Sea,this dumpster fire gets a season 2? and yet netflix cancels good shows? what kind of power does kevin smith hold over netflix?
Masters Of The Sea,Okay but like... give that the first part was awful why even bother.
Masters Of The Sea,Why won‚Äôt Sarah Michelle Gellar reprise the role? I really love anything that she‚Äôs involved in.
Masters Of The Sea,I like Melissa and I like the symmetry ofThe Vampire Slayer being replaced by Supergirl
Masters Of The Sea,"Netflix cancels shows people give a shit about, but greenlights one of the most derided misfires of the last decade? Oof. If even SMG didn't want anything to do with it you know this shit is even more DOA than the first series."
Masters Of The Sea,Good. She was miscast.
Masters Of The Sea,"Bruh, Masters Of The Universe series does Netflix have?"
Masters Of The Sea,"I don‚Äôt think SMG was good in the role, but I also don‚Äôt think the show was very good period."
Masters Of The Sea,Would anyone even care?
Masters Of The Sea,"Please don‚Äôt destroy my childhood, I can‚Äôt go through another Footloose situation"
Masters Of The Sea,I wouldn‚Äôt touch that project with a 50 ft pole either.
Masters Of The Sea,This show was utter garbage
Masters Of The Sea,Netflix canceled so much. Why are they making this trash?
Masters Of The Sea,"That is going to continue?
Bold move from Netflix."
Masters Of The Sea,Boooo
Masters Of The Sea,Are we doing another He-Man-less He-Man cartoon again?
Masters Of The Sea,Why not the show as a multiverse then you can have both women as the character?
Masters Of The Sea,I always wonder if those actors whom rejects roles still filthy rich or what got on their minds to pass important roles.
Masters Of The Sea,"That show, it's fans & haters. Lol"
Masters Of The Sea,"I thought that the season was told out of order. They second half of the season should have been shown first, with minor tweaks to have it flow better, and the second half be second. It'll give us fans some time with the characters before killing them off. Then kill them off in the fifth episode for some shocks value and then continue with how the episodes in the first half but now the second half. It works out wonderfully and the series might have actually been better."
Masters Of The Sea,"I hated this show and say that with full confidence after watching too many episodes of it. I'm utterly shocked it's getting another season or that Netflix will waste money on it versus other shows like Mindhunters, etc."
Masters Of The Sea,‚Ä¶ and hosting me too like some brain-dead AOL-er
Masters Of The Sea,Whatever her projects and films I'm always support her.  She's the greatest super girl.
Masters Of The Sea,Had no idea this was in the works
Masters Of The Sea,"Plus the voice actor for He-Man is her husband, they met while working together on Supergirl."
Masters Of The Sea,"They are friends, and he likes giving his friends work."
Masters Of The Sea,"She doesn‚Äôt like to work. 

I don‚Äôt mean that in a disparaging way. 

She comes and goes as she pleases within show business, choosing carefully when she works and when she doesn‚Äôt so that she can take care of her family. With her already producing and starring in a show, she likely just doesn‚Äôt want to work on a second one at the same time."
Masters Of The Sea,They did not say.
Masters Of The Sea,I‚Äôm assuming she will be busy filming season 2 of her new Paramount+ show.
Masters Of The Sea,Maybe she watched the first series
Masters Of The Sea,"if it isn't scheduling conflict or her being too buzy , maybe it's because of the reaction to her character in season 1 as she was mostly the lead instead of He-man and grown men took that personally."
Masters Of The Sea,You didn't catch the final episode's teaser?
Masters Of The Sea,"I'm kinda surprised it was renewed.  I have no strong feelings about it (watched the first episode and a half, decided it wasn't for me), but it was an odd choice to try to harness the nostalgia of He-Man fans, and then write He-Man and Skeletor out of the show in the first episode, lol.

People tried to pretend online that the backlash was just about sexism, but like Ghostbusters 2016, the backlash is probably just because you made something that sucks."
Masters Of The Sea,"Genuinely, compared to Transformers War For Cybertron it was a fucking masterpiece."
Masters Of The Sea,AND HE PRAYS!
Masters Of The Sea,I just wanna link [this legendary cover](https://youtube.com/watch?v=C7Q10bfWEMQ&si=EnSIkaIECMiOmarE)
Masters Of The Sea,A lullaby the breezes whisper..
Masters Of The Sea,"I didn't hate having Teela be the fous but I DID hate turning Skeletor into Joker and giving him the same exact abusive relationship with Evil Lynn.

We get it Kevin, you love batman and Mark Hamill but come up with something original."
Masters Of The Sea,I think it was over hated and I loved some aspects of it.  I do kinda question the direction it took though.  Who takes a show called HE-MAN and decides to make it mostly about the female side character?  Its odd.  Like a Barbie reboot that focused entirely on Ken.  But it was still overall enjoyable.
Masters Of The Sea,I didn't watxh the original  but the show was 80% good but the 20% that was bad really slowed down the show. Like you would have this great story then we would stop and focus on 1 issue or character and pause everything else. Made the show clunky. I am sure there is a version with a little editing it would be really good.
Masters Of The Sea,I loved it.
Masters Of The Sea,"No, just noisy Internet people."
Masters Of The Sea,Yes we did
Masters Of The Sea,"They wanted to flesh out the side characters so they took away He-man and Skeletor for the first half of the season and ""killed"" them off. Anyone with a half a brain knew they were coming back but half brains complained about wokeness because Teela was the main character. He-man and Skeletor come back in the second half of the season. The whole thing was done really well. Outside of the Fisto jokes that were cringey and get old quick I enjoyed it."
Masters Of The Sea,They watched it and talked about it. It doesn't matter if they liked it or not.
Masters Of The Sea,Hard to say. A certain portion of the internet definitely complained the loudest (many after not watching it or only watching the first episode or two) but if it got picked up apparently Netflix was happy with the numbers. So not sure it wasn't more noise than anything.
Masters Of The Sea,"It's nice to see people can finally dislike the show on this sub without being downvoted to oblivion and called sexist. I'm glad people have chilled out a bit.

I had a more mixed reaction to the show. Teela was a real drag and although Evil Lyn started off great, her character and arc fell apart after she supplanted Skeletor as the main villain. The side characters (including Adam which is weird to say about a He-Man show) were handled well though, so I think the show has some untapped potential if Smith forgets about the culture war and just writes a good show. I am cautiously optimistic about a second (or third? Who even knows with Netflix's release strategy) season."
Masters Of The Sea,"> nd for the most part the show was a joyless slog that damaged one of my childhood heroes. 

Watching old He-Man cartoons as an adult damaged the show/character for me."
Masters Of The Sea,The show is utter trash. Just awful.
Masters Of The Sea,"No one without a paper thin agenda is going to drag you over shitting on a Kevin Smith production

Although, i‚Äôll give credit where it‚Äôs due, the Clerks cartoon was pretty good and probably the last decent thing he worked on."
Masters Of The Sea,Not sure if I totally agree with it being an upgrade.
Masters Of The Sea,Yup
Masters Of The Sea,sounds like a continuation
Masters Of The Sea,Was also hoping it would start fresh. But no.
Masters Of The Sea,Maybe her role in Wolf Pack?
Masters Of The Sea,The new He-Man show was mostly derided by a few weirdos on YouTube and their fans who didn't watch it; it's great.
Masters Of The Sea,"Huge fan other both MotU and SMG and I have to agree. Not the only one in that series either. I loved how much it celebrated the original toys and show but somehow it all came together as a meh show. Still glad we‚Äôre getting more, though."
Masters Of The Sea,The Tron one hasn‚Äôt been renewed yet.
Masters Of The Sea,How so? It was extremely successful for them.
Masters Of The Sea,See if it works out for 'em
Masters Of The Sea,They love losing money
Masters Of The Sea,Read the show title again...
Masters Of The Sea,"You do know that they quickly brought him back to life, right?  Like who didn't see that coming.  And it was actually cool seeing the other characters try to get by without relying on He-Man for awhile."
Masters Of The Sea,"He-Man was literally in the majority of the episodes lmfao

He was only absent from like two or three of them"
Masters Of The Sea,Forgot that Adam was voiced by Mon-El. Clearly Smith loved Supergirl.
Masters Of The Sea,"One could even say they‚Äôve collaborated on multiple things.

Edit: I see you edited your comment to reflect their marriage."
Masters Of The Sea,I wanted them together in the show badly. Then I found out they‚Äôre married IRL and somehow my universe felt complete haha
Masters Of The Sea,Who doesn‚Äôt?
Masters Of The Sea,"Good for her. If I was successful enough to pick and choose what I worked on, I'd absolutely do stuff like this or being in awful movies for a free vacation. I'm never going to get mad at an actor for prioritizing a good time over their career.   
EXCEPT FOR YOU, TAYLOR LAUTNER! You thought you were too good to be Shark Boy again, but we all know where you came from, you coward!"
Masters Of The Sea,"No one likes to work.

I also don't mean that in a disparaging way."
Masters Of The Sea,"I have so much respect for that, and the way that somehow she and Freddy Prinze Jr have been able to keep their private lives mostly private.  Seems like one reason they are a successful couple. 

Married 20 years and they both look amazing and seem to have the right idea about work in general."
Masters Of The Sea,"Oh thank God.

I thought she had done/said something horrible. 

This was a much more benign explanation."
Metamorphosis,This guy molested his younger sisters and still got his own tv show. Fuck this guy.
Metamorphosis,"I've read a couple articles and they always quote his 2015 statement. This part always stands out to me:
> I became unfaithful to my wife

That ""became"" is so passive and weasel wordy. Like it was some slow transition that he didn't even notice‚Ä¶"
Metamorphosis,It‚Äôs always the ones you most suspect
Metamorphosis,"‚úì Molested his sisters, a friend of theirs, and a babysitter  
‚úì Actively cheated on his wife  
‚úì Abused a pornstar the he was cheating on his wife with  
‚úì Multiple real-estate fraud charges  
‚úì And now possession of child pornography while his wife is pregnant with his seventh child

But don't worry. I'm sure God will give him and his family the strength to get through this. /s"
Metamorphosis,"His parents are pieces of shit too. They knew he molested his sisters and other girls for years.  They hid this shit and did nothing to protect the victims.  They humiliated his sisters by forcing them to continue living with their abuser as well as blaming them for tempting him. They threatened the other girl's family to prevent her from going after him. They continued to have him around hundreds of children in their home (they have tons of events where there's tons of kids running around). They blamed his wife for him cheating on her with sex workers, keep in mind his wife can not say no to sex and has to be joyfully available at all times.  They moved him on to their property after his home and business were raided by the feds and homeland security.  They've known he's a pedophile since he was a teen and have excused him repeatedly and had his pedo ass living on a property with multiple children. These people need to face the consequences of their involvement in this."
Metamorphosis,"Was really hoping when he was arrested it wasn't CP (for his kids more than anything).  But I can't say I'm surprised, this has been a while in the making (the raid was in 2019). Hope he rots in jail."
Metamorphosis,That smirk for his mugshot really captures what a genuine piece of shit this sub-human is... let him burn
Metamorphosis,"That is a ROUGH 33. He's a few months older than me but legit looks 10 years older. Guess the ugly from his inside spread to the outside.


Glad this pest is arrested and off the streets. He's been a known abuser for years. This is a long time coming. What a disgusting POS."
Metamorphosis,"Anyone who can smirk in their mugshot, when they've just been arrested with possession and distribution of child pornography, is a complete sociopath.  

But, what else can we expect from a man who molested his siblings and a baby sitter...and then escaped punishment.  A man whose parents enabled and held him up as the golden child and fundie heir apparent? A man who chose his bride and waited until her daddy said she could hold his hand? A man raised in a cult where women are gas lit into submission, obedience, deference, and patriarchal needs?  A man born into a family that LITERALLY taught their daughters that it was THEIR FAULT if a man saw them and lusted after them?  A man who stood on the capitol steps, screaming about family values, while simultaneously meeting up with women he met on Ashley Madison?  A man who spent thousands to have affairs where he, allegedly, beat up women, while he forced his young wife, with young kids, to turn trash into treasure to save money?  I'm frankly shocked that he's the only Duggar son with dirty laundry."
Metamorphosis,"It's really disgusting that TLC gave this abusive family a tv show/tons of money when they were beating those kids and molesting them (and obv neglecting them) behind the scenes, and no shit this is how it all turns out."
Metamorphosis,"Suddenly ""19 kids and counting"" Holds a whole new meaning."
Metamorphosis,His wife is a walking sunk cost fallacy.
Metamorphosis,"""19 Kids and Counting"" seems like a really poor choice as name for the show in hindsight"
Metamorphosis,So where are the Q people ready to destroy criminals like him? Crickets.
Metamorphosis,"The Daily Mail has consistently referred to him as ‚Äúsex pest Josh Duggar‚Äù. Almost every story, ever since his first known offenses. You might hate the Mail for good reason, but they sure got that tagline right."
Metamorphosis,I hope he‚Äôs never done anything horrifying to his own children.
Metamorphosis,"Strangely enough, 19 kids and counting is also the name of his sex tape."
Metamorphosis,"Wait, I thought that they were Christian fundamentalists! *How can this be???!?*"
Metamorphosis,Can't say I'm surprised.
Metamorphosis,This has got to be some of the least surprising news I've seen.
Metamorphosis,"Who the fuck smiles in their child porn arrest mugshot

Oh, right, psychopaths."
Metamorphosis,"Surprisingly absolutely no one.  

&#x200B;

Also the Duggers saying they are thankful of our hopes and prayers.  I hope and pray that this guy and every other Dugger whose acted similarly goes to prison."
Metamorphosis,"This POS family owns the land right above my house. I hope they lose it fighting his legal battles, they are the worst neighbors."
Metamorphosis,"Who‚Äôd ever have guessed that a star from the ‚Äúhuman zoo show‚Äù would have turned out to be a piece of shit.

Never saw that one coming!"
Metamorphosis,Color me not fucking surprised
Metamorphosis,Can we be done with Reality TV as a society yet?
Metamorphosis,"Geez! This dude has like 6 kids and I guarantee his wife will stay with him because in their ""cult"" a wife is always submissive to her husband even if he is a deranged sex criminal."
Metamorphosis,Famous chomo in prison. He will suffer mightily. He‚Äôs done.
Metamorphosis,"Hey Oprah, how much of Discovery tv do you own? TLC supports this child molesting family. 

Do something about that -"
Metamorphosis,Why would anyone watch TLC? They make a star out of a man that molested his sisters... And continued to put him on AFTER he was OUTED. That channel should be permanently shuttered. Also that fat fuck and her fat fuck pedophile husband.
Metamorphosis,"Never forget that Mike Huckabee vociferously defended Josh Duggar after it was revealed he molested 5 girls. Josh Duggar was also outed on Ashley Madison and assault allegations were brought against him by a pornographic actress. 

If the Duggar children all followed their parents by having 20 kids and so on for a couple of generations, Jim Bob Duggar would have 400 grand kids, 8000 great grand kids and 160,000 great great grand kids. In 5 generations the Duggars would be a family with 3.2 million direct descendants. Fuck the Duggars and fuck TLC."
Metamorphosis,"Fun reminder that our friend Ted Cruz has a photo with him, but that's none of my business"
Metamorphosis,Gotta live these hypocritical religious fruitcakes.
Metamorphosis,I remember the first time my wife watched this and I was disgusted and said those parents are fucking those kids over with that bullshit repression.  Here we are.
Metamorphosis,The worst josh of them all
Metamorphosis,[deleted]
Metamorphosis,You can't judge a book by its cover except in this case.
Metamorphosis,‚Äú19 kids and counting‚Äù is what was on his arrest warrant too
Metamorphosis,You have to wonder how many of his sisters he sexually abused...
Metamorphosis,Didn‚Äôt they cancel his show after what happened a couple years ago?
Metamorphosis,"Wow, never would have seen that one coming, I wonder what the numerous warning signs along the way might have been pointing to ü§î"
Metamorphosis,Once a predator always a predator...
Metamorphosis,The title of that show has become much more menacing now.
Metamorphosis,"Such a sad situation. Not going to joke or taunt because innocent lives (and probably more we don‚Äôt know about, plus those exploited in the images) were damaged. His parents, his church and TLC all share guilt. They are all disgusting."
Metamorphosis,"In 2003 his Dad had him talk to a state trooper about his issues. It was the first time a law enforcement officer was made aware of sexual assault against his siblings. The officer didn‚Äôt do anything with this information.

Perhaps unrelated, but the officer is now serving a 50+ year prison term for child pornography. 

Christ on a cracker, these people are all fucked."
Metamorphosis,"‚ÄúI have secretly over the last several years been viewing pornography on the internet and this became a secret addiction and I became unfaithful to my wife,‚Äù Duggar said in a 2015 statement. 

Child pornography you mean..."
Metamorphosis,"More like ""19 Charges and Counting""."
Metamorphosis,Under 12 years old? Thats as sick as it gets
Metamorphosis,Once a diddler always a fucking diddler lock this menace up for life. Then make sure his weirdo wife isn‚Äôt in on it too.
Metamorphosis,"This dude needs to be chemically castrated. Not only so he will stop knocking up his wife and adding to their cult, but so hopefully the urge to molest kids gets reduced. Fuck this guy."
Metamorphosis,So many republicans involved in child porn and rape. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre projecting or something.
Metamorphosis,fuck this guy 1000000000000000000000000000x over!!!
Metamorphosis,This headline makes it seem like that‚Äôs the number of kids he‚Äôs abused.... which it might actually be.
Metamorphosis,It's ***always*** the people you most suspect.....
Metamorphosis,"Dumb question, would two charges mean two photos?"
Metamorphosis,"Sick. 
Boycott TLC."
Metamorphosis,So this surprises who?
Metamorphosis,"American Pedo - the new hit TV show. 

Only problem is that you dumb fucks would probably make him your next Republitard president."
Metamorphosis,Degenerates hiding under the religious bullshit.
Metamorphosis,So he molested 19 kids and counting so far
Metamorphosis,I don't understand humans at all.
Metamorphosis,Put him to death by firing squad.
Metamorphosis,Shocking.
Metamorphosis,What an unfortunate show title...
Metamorphosis,Wow. Who didn't see this coming??
Metamorphosis,"No!  Another pedophile christian!   I‚Äôm shocked, shocked I say!"
Metamorphosis,TLC has always been a weird channel as far back as I can remember anyway.
Metamorphosis,Every time I see this headline I think it‚Äôs saying he molested 19 kids and counting.
Metamorphosis,19 Rapes and Counting
Metamorphosis,Is anyone shocked?
Metamorphosis,Stop calling it CP. It‚Äôs child sex abuse.
Metamorphosis,And so begins his run for Florida Congressman.
Metamorphosis,It‚Äôs always the ones you suspect the most‚Ä¶
Metamorphosis,"Shocked the guy that got a stern talking to instead of criminal time after admitting to touching 4 siblings does something sexually sketchy again.


Pedophiles never change. Their pedos for life and will always be a threat. You can‚Äôt change these thoughts. They can live with them or do therapy, but they‚Äôll always have it and some can‚Äôt work on it enough to prevent action. Hence why they need firmer charger and harsher punishments."
Metamorphosis,Hang him
Metamorphosis,A right Nonce
Metamorphosis,That fucking grin.
Metamorphosis,He had balls to show up on TLC after molesting his younger sister what and idiot
Metamorphosis,"Can‚Äôt say I am shocked. Of course, being the sick fuck he is, he smirks in his mugshot. SMH."
Metamorphosis,"I think most people saw this coming a mile away. 

Molests sisters, violent behavior with sex worker, rehab for porn sex addiction and he is narcissistic and arrogant as fuck. Just a matter of time until he went down the rabbit hole. 

I would put these creeps away FOREVER, but since we have the opposite trend in society currently, I hope he at least gets enough time for his littlest children to grow old enough to be aware and speak up against him if they are forced to be with him."
Metamorphosis,About fucking time. Lock him up and throw away the key.
Metamorphosis,No surprise.
Metamorphosis,Is he high in this photo? The Duggar‚Äôs are cringe worthy. I read that the girls were only allowed to wear loose skirts. Was that so it would be easier to rape them?
Metamorphosis,"Aside from how fucking dumb this asshole is, people should be fined for having more than two kids.  We don‚Äôt need more."
Metamorphosis,"Here‚Äôs what I don‚Äôt understand‚Äî

Don‚Äôt people who download stuff like this realize their digital fingerprints are all over it?"
Metamorphosis,Feel terrible for the wife and kids.  Everyone seems to be tickled pink this guy is going to jail...but their whole lives just changed too.  I really hope for the better
Metamorphosis,#REPUBLICAN
Metamorphosis,"My thoughts and prayers to his family. Wait, I‚Äôm an atheist and my thoughts are that all the girls are removed. Not just children but grandchildren. That people now know that evangelical Christians are the actual satanic child sex cult. And that we need less religion and more laws protecting children with zero statue of limitations. 

You should know that in a lot of states you can sue your abuser in civil court if the abuse is fully remembered as an adult as it ruins lives. The statue starts when you remember the extent, (most people remember a few incidents but it took me until I was 42 to remember it was over a 12 year period, multiple times a month because I was finally diagnosed with DID). Please check out the laws. I am tracking down my millionaire abuser brother to break his bank."
Metamorphosis,Castrate him then lock him up
Metamorphosis,Anyone tried crossposting this to Conservative?
Metamorphosis,I hope one of his prison mates takes care of him like they did Jeffery Dahmer.  Kids are tortured to make the stuff he jerks off to.
Metamorphosis,"When will church people ever learn that all that shit christian programming is all just crap made up to sell programs to their uneducated, simple minded, gullible losers of an audience. Stop supporting that crap."
Metamorphosis,[removed]
Metamorphosis,One bad apple out of 19 isn't too bad.
Metamorphosis,"That article read as if it was written first in Chinese by an AI program and then translated into English by another AI program.

""Court documents allege that Duggar used the internet to download child sexual abuse material. He possessed this material, which the court says depicts the sexual abuse of children under the age of 12, in May 2019.

Duggar is being charged by indictment with receiving and possessing child pornography."""
Metamorphosis,"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! 

Is anyone surprised?"
Metamorphosis,Who would have known that the title of show was referring to the victims?
Metamorphosis,"Sick fuck, look at his shit eating grin. It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs saying ‚Äúlol u idiots, I haven‚Äôt done anything wrong‚Äù"
Metamorphosis,I really really hope he gets his shit push in
Metamorphosis,"19 Counts, Not Kidding"
Immortal Love,"For me, Omar will always remain one of the most beloved gangsters ever portrayed, with the utter genius that is Michael K. Williams. 

May he rest in peace and in power.

Excited to read his life story; here‚Äôs the scoop on how he got his facial scar:

‚ÄúIn his upcoming posthumous memoir Scenes from My Life, The Wire star Michael K. Williams wrote about his life in 1991 when he was in the midst of a successful modeling and dancing career and about to head to London on tour. But on the eve of his 25th birthday, a friend called to invite him out to a club in Queens to celebrate. By midnight he was drunk, showing off his moves on the dance floor.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's when Williams stepped outside for some air and spotted a group of men encircling an acquaintance from Brooklyn.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe shouted at them, and the friend told him to go back inside.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat happened next would change Williams' life forever.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen he eventually went to leave the club for the night, Williams encountered one of the threatening men, who was now standing alone.‚Äù

""In a flash, he smacked me across the face,"" he wrote. ""I put my hand to my forehead.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen I saw the dark liquid on my fingers.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe guy hadn't been slapping me. He had been cutting me open.""

The man had been holding a razor, cutting Williams ""from my forehead, across the bridge of my nose, down my right cheek almost to my jawbone."""
Immortal Love,I had forgotten that he passed and got sad again
Immortal Love,"Omar is such an incredibly iconic character: endlessly quotable, charismatic & layered. That performance will stand the test of time & will still be talked about decades from now"
Immortal Love,"Poor dude, he went through so much pain. I feel bad for everything he went through. We lost a great artist too soon."
Immortal Love,That boy was beautiful
Immortal Love,You should see his turn in Community. It was friggin awesome. Seriousness in a comic show. Unbelievable.
Immortal Love,"I don't care about many actors but Williams always stood out for me. He was uniquely gifted and brought such humanity and unexpected humor to his roles.

Omar's amazing, but his work on Lovecraft Country and, the seemingly overlooked ""Hap & Leonard"" is very compelling. He gives such a well rounded and authentic performance in the latter, that he turns what could have been just an average show, into something well worth watching.

I miss him, while I actively root for most actors to die, lol."
Immortal Love,"I can understand the feeling.  I have facial and other scars.  I was self-conscious for a while, but as I got older, I realized the scars were a map of stories.  Mr.  Williams was a brilliant actor and will be missed."
Immortal Love,The framing of scars as *automatically ugly* is rather strange. I do not see why many people push this nonsense.
Immortal Love,It was just so heartbreaking with the message of The Wire for him to die of a drug overdose.
Immortal Love,I met the man a few years ago. Extremely kind and humble.
Immortal Love,He was beautiful. This loss still feels so enormous.
Immortal Love,What?!  No way my dude. It shows character.
Immortal Love,"Honestly that scar looks awesome. Like dang. Bit of an awkward story how he got it, but that doesn‚Äôt make him look ugly at all."
Immortal Love,I remember the first time I saw him was in a Purge film and thinking he was Wesley Snipes.
Immortal Love,He was a great actor gone way too soon.  Fent taking a ton of recent greats it seems like
Immortal Love,"I reviewed the book and think it's a highly worthwhile read. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhTkL63iFDw&t=181s"
Immortal Love,His name still rings out.
Immortal Love,Omar comin‚Äô!
Immortal Love,Gave him a buck 50.
Immortal Love,I must have missed the news when it happened.  I had no idea.
Immortal Love,"Rewatching boardwalk empire and 1) chalky white is that dude. 
And 2) he was vastly underutilized."
Immortal Love,"The courtroom scene is absolutely legendary, one my favourite scenes of all time"
Immortal Love,"I miss him so much 

I still whistle his little tune 

And ‚Äúwhen you come at the king you best don‚Äôt miss‚Äù"
Immortal Love,Oh no doubt.
Immortal Love,Heeeeeey Yo!
Immortal Love,"Absofuckinglutely right: beautiful in body, heart, mind, and spirit.

A tragedy he is gone too soon."
Immortal Love,"His Legos speech was classic Community.

""As someone who spent the majority of my time in prison, what happened with Legos? They used to be simple. Oh come on, I know you know what I‚Äôm talking about. Legos were simple. Something happened out here while I was inside. Harry Potter Legos, Star Wars Legos, complicated kits, tiny little blocks. I mean I‚Äôm not saying its bad, I just wanna know what happened."""
Immortal Love,Hes fantastic in Boardwalk Empire too.
Immortal Love,He had some powerful appearances on the Law & Order shows.
Immortal Love,You mean you root for them to die on screen? Not in real life correct?
Immortal Love,Wut?
Immortal Love,"Don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre being downvoted, I agree. The scar essentially helped him with his career. We probably would‚Äôve never known about him had this incident not happened. 


He even said in another interview:

> ‚ÄúI knew that I did not want blood on my hands. And I honestly believe that because I let it go, I didn‚Äôt harbour any ill feelings, I didn‚Äôt react in a negative way in revenge, I believe that something happened inside, spiritually.

>>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs why people look at this [scar] and see a thing of beauty. Had I taken the other route, I think it would have made me ugly ‚Äî from the inside.‚Äù"
Immortal Love,"the way you see someone, and the way someone sees themselves, is frequently quite different."
Immortal Love,Awkward? That‚Äôs really not the right word to use ..
Immortal Love,"Idk about that, the entirety of season 4 revolved around him. Still one of the best characters on the show"
Immortal Love,Omar coming was the best
Immortal Love,"Same as you, 'cept you got the briefcase."
Immortal Love,"FWIW, this is from one of his lines on The Wire"
Immortal Love,"Lol, reminds me of Bill Watterson and the whole commercialisation of all IP."
Immortal Love,"All of this!! Michael K was just luminous onscreen, with a glow of authenticity simply like nobody else.

He is much missed.

And very fondly remembered for his many gifts."
Immortal Love,I loved him in the night of as well.
Immortal Love,Him and Michael Shannon were a big part of the reason I kept watching after that show started to go a little off the deep end.
Immortal Love,"The Wire highlights how drugs destroy lives and the streets of Baltimore, Michael K. Williams still did hard drugs and died of a drug overdose."
Immortal Love,"That‚Äôs a really thoughtful statement from him, and I appreciate it. Shows a strength of character."
Immortal Love,"Yeah, I totally agree with that. Sometimes people are harsh on themselves when others don‚Äôt see a problem. Happens quite a lot."
Immortal Love,"Yeah, like what's ""awkward"" about a violent encounter??"
Immortal Love,"I say awkward because if someone asked me how I got a scar, or something similar; say a tattoo, and I had to start with ‚ÄúI was drunk,‚Äù I‚Äôd personally feel awkward myself. Because those three words automatically make people think ‚Äúoh you were doing something stupid is all‚Äù"
Immortal Love,"[You kinda butchered that](https://youtu.be/P3i36ybA8Ms?t=149), but I forgive you. It's what Omar Little would have done."
Immortal Love,Immortalized forever in our hearts!!
Immortal Love,"I loved it,too. It was on CW  Seed for a time."
Immortal Love,"I really liked it at the time, sad it didn't get a chance to continue.

He's currently lead on Harrow which is also worth watching if you like procedural style shows, it's on Hulu here in the US."
Immortal Love,"Certainly it was good enough for more then 1 season for sure. Think the cast was unusually good in Forever.     

There are several shows featuring a sad vampire detective:       

\-Moonlight from 2005      

\-forever knight 1990      

The old tv show Highlander (1992) has a similar idea"
Immortal Love,"Absolutely one series I was sad to see get cancelled so early. Like I remember the numbers being pretty poor and got it, but it really had some potential."
Immortal Love,"I loved that show. The main actor Ioan had a show where he played a forensic pathologist, I gave it a chance but I didn't like the show at all :/ The difference of quality after watching him in Forever is really noticeable, this other show was on Australian channel ABC"
Immortal Love,"Glad to see some love for this, I really liked this show,  thought it had potential!"
Immortal Love,Yea I watched that show. I really enjoyed it. I will rewatch that show from time to time.
Immortal Love,Loved it. Still annoyed that it was cancelled
Immortal Love,"Yes, whenever those 'which show was cancelled too early' threads pop up, that's always mine

I thought it had legs to carry on, really liked it"
Immortal Love,"I remember, it had a good concept but it was corny as heck"
Immortal Love,Great show with a brilliant cast and a lot of potential. Easily still one of my most disappointing premature cancelations even eight years later.
Immortal Love,"""Loan""?"
Immortal Love,I'm waiting for a new season of Harrow and originally gave the show when it started airing a chance because of forever
Immortal Love,"I recently rewatched Forever Knight and Highlander, I watched them both as they aired back in the day. Highlander holds up for the most part, largely since it seems to know what it is and doesn't take itself too seriously. It has its off moments but overall it felt just as fun to me as I remembered it being. Forever Knight, though, has not aged well at all, IMO. Kind of the opposite situation where it tried to be serious but just missed the mark entirely, and wasn't even back to ""so bad it's good"" territory for the most part.

I haven't seen Moonlight, though."
Immortal Love,Corny but how can you not love an immortal Sherlock Holmes
Immortal Love,Unfortunately they still haven't announced whether or not Harrow is getting a fourth season. It's been sitting in limbo for over a year since the last season ended.
Immortal Love,Exactly. I wish they would continue it or at least do some sort of special if it won't continue.
Immortal Love,"I find the show to be very humorous, the randomness you are complaining about is what I find so interesting.  It's never predictable.

What I love about the show is its subject matter.  Each character is struggling to overcome their short comings.  Season 2 and Season 3 Jane storylines were just such great examples."
Immortal Love,"Everyone, please sign my petition to launch people who call things ""overrated"" into the sun. We can make the world a better place!"
Immortal Love,"Everyone has different tastes, if you don't like a show why force yourself to watch 3 seasons of it."
Immortal Love,"If is not for you, it is not for you, and that is all right."
Immortal Love,"I'm sorry Doom didn't work for you and I'm glad you found something you did like. 

For everyone else reading- I wouldn't recommend Doom Patrol for Peacemaker fans. The latter is  humor for people who  are tired of Marvel's superheroes.
Doom Patrol is an absurdist show that doesn't take itself seriously, ever. It never shies away from going balls to the wall insane. A lot of times it follows comic book logic so that's why you shouldn't overthink it much.

It's not even about superheroes, it's about fuck ups who the best thing they've done so far was save a town -from themselves-.
I love Doom Patrol's characters and the show spends a lot of time working out their issues because that's the heart of the show. If you don't like the characters you're never going to like it.
I wouldn't compare both shows because imo they have nothing in common besides being DC."
Immortal Love,"It's because of expectations.

You're watching Doom Patrol now because people told you for years it's the most incredible show ever. Most of us got blown away when we saw it because we had *no idea what to expect* at the time.

That's where everyone is with Peacemaker, we're discovering it together and it's outperforming what we all thought it would be."
Immortal Love,"idk .. i liked it, it was different, it was better than some shows dc shows i‚Äôve watched"
Immortal Love,"The first season was great, the second was fair, the third I can't even bring myself to finish."
Immortal Love,I loved s1 but s2 was fucking trash. And I quit after 2nd ep in s3. It looked exactly like the same crap that was s2. I guess it just got old.
Immortal Love,"TL;DR: I watched three episodes and here‚Äôs my (somewhat negative) take. I saw people comparing it to Peacemaker, so I gave it a try for the first three episodes. But I found the whole thing so inconsistent with its world logic, writing and humour, that I had to stop.

In terms of logic, it bugged me that in the first episode a town‚Äôs Main Street got messed up a bit and made national news, but when the whole town disappeared off the map, no one gave a damn. There‚Äôs even a bit where the FBI just shrugs it off. Something like 8000+ people. Then add that to the fact that the portal that sucked all those people in (despite only showing us about 10 of them), and all of the buildings of a whole town, failed to pull in the very people standing 10m away from it. While I know these are nitpicks, every episode for me had a bit of a WTF?? moment that failed to meet logic. So you‚Äôre going to drive to South America without passports and nobody sees the problem with that? You‚Äôre able to teleport/fly to a very specific place in a different continent from a photo taken decades ago‚Ä¶ to the very street?? And Cyborgs dad one minute saying he can‚Äôt have the ship and giving a big lecture, but suddenly changing his mind when it‚Äôs convenient for the plot. Why is there nobody protecting the machine that gives superpowers?? It just kept happening‚Ä¶

Then the humour bugged me. Taking Peacemaker, and much of Marvel as an example, Doom Patrol fails to understand a very simple idea: make certain characters funny instead of forcing slapstick scenes where they aren‚Äôt needed. Brendan Frasier is funny in the show because his character is - that‚Äôs where the comic relief should be. But there are multiple scenes where the writers just felt all over the place. At the end of the Nazi guy episode, the girl is sat on the plane, she‚Äôs had a rough time coming to terms with who she is and the episode seems to be concluding with her writing some philosophical thought about power on the plane window‚Ä¶ cool, nice way to end the episode‚Ä¶ then it cuts to a guy with an extra dinosaur head and a leek as a hand, completely undercutting the tone they‚Äôd just tried to set moments ago. Cyborg is wrestling with independence from his dad; the goop woman wrestling with controlling her curse; Neil Caffrey wrestling with the decisions he made in his past‚Ä¶ oh is that all too heavy? Have a donkey fart‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs like they handed the writing over to a five-year-old when they wanted humour.

I really wanted to enjoy the show as the premise seems interesting - but the types of things above made me walking away annoyed after each episode. I honestly don‚Äôt know how writers can be so inconsistent these days. I‚Äôm sure there are many people who can see past glaring plot holes and enjoy the childish humour, but unfortunately I‚Äôm not one of them. Definitely overrated in my opinion."
Immortal Love,I loved it at first and it just got worse and worse. May I just also add that the poor girl who plays Dorothy can‚Äôt act through all that crappy makeup. And speaking of crappy prosthetics Cyborg looks like shit especially when compared to the movie version.
Immortal Love,"I wasn't into it, I liked the appearance of some characters on Titans but this show really didn't do a lot for me

I stopped watching about 4 or 5 episodes into the first season"
Immortal Love,"Doom Patrol, The Leftovers, Lost and Infinity Train are all the same damn show just different aesthetics.

They‚Äôre all about dealing with loss and trauma and the main characters may as well be dead and they‚Äôre trapped in purgatory or whatever because nobody else in the universe outside of their bubble really gives a scrote about them."
Immortal Love,"Yeah, you really have to look at the show as a lot of damaged people dealing with their own traumas with the whole comic book thing as a backdrop to that.  I wouldn't even really compare it to *Peacemaker* as I don't think of *Doom Patrol* as really being a superhero show in the same regard."
Immortal Love,"Especially things like doom patrol, which are pretty damn niche anyway."
Immortal Love,"> f you don't like a show why force yourself to watch 3 seasons of it.

sometimes if a really well reviewed show comes along, I try to force myself to see if it gets good (I love Star Trek TNG, but the 1st season is rough, 2nd not bad, then it gets GOOD)"
Immortal Love,"I watched the first 3 episodes of Breaking Bad and didn't get into it.  As the seasons progressed I kept hearing how amazing it was, so years later I pushed through the slow initial episodes and found that it really was a great series, it just took a little while to get into it.  I'm guessing OP had a similar motivation, it just didn't turn out as well."
Immortal Love,"Because if I said I only watch three episodes someone would say you gotta watch it all. I gave it a good try, unlike many people, and was waiting for something to come together."
Immortal Love,"That's not it. I didn't have any expectations going in, never really read about the show, and just put it on because I just needed something to watch."
Immortal Love,"Yeah, I could go on and on about the inconstancies in the show, and the lack of logic for even the most basic decisions. Stuff just happens for no reason, and it kinda works for Mr. Nobody because of his powers, but every other season is like that also, and people just don't react to it the way a real person would. Like later in the show Larry meets one of his kids all grown up, and his kid doesn't even bat an eye about how his dad is still alive and covered in bandages. He just invites him over to his house later, it's fucking weird. 
And I agree that the show flip flops far to much between comedy, and seriousness. It's like the show has ADD and thinks it can't keep its self entertaining without something stupid happening."
Immortal Love,"Both shows have a lot of dark humor and characters dealing with realistic drama associated with their flaws, so I'd say they are comparable.  Obviously still very different in other ways, though.  Doom Patrol is more slow, more surreal, and less actiony after all."
Immortal Love,"Doom Patrol, Peacemaker and Umbrella Academy provide good contrast to endless Marvel blockbusters and Arrowverse nonsense.  Harley Quinn animated series was fun too."
Immortal Love,I said 3 seasons that is 30 episodes not 3.
Immortal Love,I said 3 seasons that is 30 episodes why force yourself to watch that many of a show you don't like?
Immortal Love,I‚Äôm glad I stopped after the three episodes then.
Immortal Love,[deleted]
Immortal Love,"My point was, if I had stopped too soon I would not have found out that it eventually got really good.  Sometimes people will stick with a series that they don't like because they're waiting for it to turn that corner and finally get good."
Immortal Love,"I really don't understand this line of questioning about why I would watch something, even if I didn't like it. It's really none of your business why, but I can at least say I gave it a try, and a good try."
Immortal Love,[deleted]
Immortal Love,"You would think he would act with some surprise, maybe ask some questions. Hey dad, what's up with the bandages? How are you still alive after 60 years? Just basic stuff. I don't care how weird your world is, if your dad shows up dressed like a mummy after disappearing for 60 years, there's going to be questions."
Immortal Love,"> Breaking Bad

Would you have kept watching Breaking Bad if after watching the first 30 episodes left you feeling the same way the initial 3 made you feel?"
Immortal Love,"You must have more spare time then me. I love Doom Patrol, and glad I put in the time to watch it, but with so much good content unwatched I'd never spend that amount of time on a show I either disliked or felt meh about. I don't care about hype, especially internet hype, I want a good story if after the first season I don't feel like a show is giving me that or at least getting better as it goes along.

Depending who you talk to or what online community your in people will hype what they like, their taste might not be yours. I tried reading War and Peace it's a classic, it wasn't for me after 250 pages I was done. It's not the length, I loved LOTR which is a couple hundred pages longer. It's a matter of taste, do people who love W&P have better taste then me, no they have their taste and I have mine. If the only thing you have to talk about is a show you're not enjoying you should look for people who enjoy what you like to watch.

I really like Vox Machina and Disenchantment that doesn't make them great shows but shows that fit me. Ponderous dramas are usually not my cup of tea I don't care how much hype they get if after a 3-5 episodes I'm not enjoying the story I'm out. I have a TBW list of about 40-50 shows."
Immortal Love,"#**Reasons why I love FMA: BH**

1. IT IS THE BEST

2. IT IS NOT NOT THE BEST

Any questions?"
The Golden Pillow,The real drama is gonna be in this thread.
The Golden Pillow,"Milly Alcock was wasted on stage. I don‚Äôt think they expected to win at all. Honestly, all three of them seemed smashed."
The Golden Pillow,Paddy deserved a nomination.
The Golden Pillow,Why do awards shows hate Better Call Saul?
The Golden Pillow,"The best show of 2022 ""insert show you liked"" there is everyone's answer."
The Golden Pillow,"All these streaming services and HBO has House of The Dragon, Succession & now The Last Of Us. They‚Äôll keep winning Best Drama everywhere for years to come. It‚Äôs like boxing against a god for their competition, they have a stranglehold on the prestige TV business."
The Golden Pillow,"S'all (not) good, man :'("
The Golden Pillow,"hmm... i thought it'd a lock-on win for Better Call Saul.... it's much better acclaimed no?

Hopefully Odenkirk can win best actor. 

PS. a little sad, i looked around and found this video. 

https://youtu.be/VUCXfsnUMy8

we're all animals of broken dreams...."
The Golden Pillow,"There was no consensus for them in drama category so they ""spread the wealth"" with each drama category having a winner from different shows."
The Golden Pillow,House of the Dragon and Better Call Saul reminds me of Elden Ring and God of War Ragnarok. Both were great. In the end don‚Äôt let awards affect your choice on which is better to you.
The Golden Pillow,All in all a great year for television!
The Golden Pillow,Maybe Better Call Saul just doesn‚Äôt appeal as much to non Reddit types lol
The Golden Pillow,Great show. Better Call Saul was better.
The Golden Pillow,"Was not expecting this at all and judging by their reactions neither did they lmao. HotD was the highlight of my week while it was airing and made me rediscover my love for the books again, very happy to see them win something for season 1!"
The Golden Pillow,"Wow was that awkward. The crowd went silent as everyone was looking around because they didn't even know who was there... Moments later the couple of cast members start walking down the second level from the cheap seats.. and as they are talking no one claps.. at all! It was painful. 

Severance should've taken it. Highly recommend for anyone that hasn't seen it."
The Golden Pillow,"I haven't seen Severance so can't comment of that but happy that HOTD won!!

Golden Globes are so chaotic, everyone's wasted lmao"
The Golden Pillow,"I have seen Euphoria, House of the Dragon, and The White Lotus! Congratulations to all 3 of them for winning the Golden Globes!"
The Golden Pillow,House of the Dragon MAH BALLS ON YO FACE
The Golden Pillow,"Honestly was surprised as everyone. BCS was my pick, but I'd have been happier with Severance winning. HOTD is still a good show and well executed, just more been there don't that, not exactly pushing the envelope."
The Golden Pillow,"Dragon was great, but c‚Äômon, Better Call Saul deserved it!"
The Golden Pillow,Must not be a lot on tv now a days I liked the first season but it was boring for a lot of it almost felt like a chore to watch the show progress
The Golden Pillow,Worst legal mind I ever knew.
The Golden Pillow,"I dont think HotD deserved it this year, I think it probably will deserve it in the future, but right now as good as the first season was it still had a lot of teething issues in its pacing and plot. I would have given the win to a show full stride in its prime like Better Call Saul or a show that managed to hit a perfect first season like Severance or Andor."
The Golden Pillow,"I‚Äôm gonna say it. 

Deserved"
The Golden Pillow,"My hot take is that I don't think Better Call Saul's last season was its best, and it shouldn't just automatically win because it's its last chance.

I think BCS is undeniably the better series, so far. But I think HOTD season 1 >>> final season of BCS.

The real issue here is that BCS got repeatedly snubbed during all of its best content."
The Golden Pillow,Better call Saul got snubbed.
The Golden Pillow,"Yeah, I hope for BCS or severance."
The Golden Pillow,"Was anyone else as bored by this show as I was? Loved GoT, but I don't get the appeal."
The Golden Pillow,I much prefered Better Call Saul personally.
The Golden Pillow,"Andor: Am I a joke to you?

(I haven't watched the newest Better Call Saul season yet)"
The Golden Pillow,"Better Call Saul is better, but I liked House of the Dragon too."
The Golden Pillow,"Didn‚Äôt feel like this show was strong overall. Effects were good, Padi‚Äôs acting was amazing with a few others .  Some of the writing seemed a bit weak"
The Golden Pillow,Well deserved
The Golden Pillow,Better call deserved it  but I liked house of the Dragon more
The Golden Pillow,Well deserved and unexpected.
The Golden Pillow,Better call Saul got done dirty
The Golden Pillow,It was‚Ä¶ fine? Felt like an inoffensive super cut of a season of better tv that doesn‚Äôt exist.
The Golden Pillow,"House of the Dragon is A-tier‚Ä¶ quite great.

But Severance? Better Call Saul? Those are S-tier. Severance should have won over House of the Dragon, no question. Andor is also S-tier, and should have been nominated over House of the Dragon."
The Golden Pillow,"It's not a bad show by any means, its a decent show but that's it. There was so much inconsistent characterization and writing this season in the second half of the season, I really don't understand how it won over BCS or Severance. It's also a joke that HotD has this award while GoT never won this award despite seasons 1-4 being far superior than HotD. But, that's awards shows for you I guess...no point in expecting better."
The Golden Pillow,"The golden globes are the FiFA of awards. Bribery and pandering.

It's a good show, but I don't know why the globes are still taken seriously."
The Golden Pillow,House of the Dragon was fine but best drama of the year? That‚Äôs craziness. Season finale was mid
The Golden Pillow,Andor was robbed
The Golden Pillow,"Guess I'm one of the few that was whelmed by HotD.  It was alright, but by the end of the season, I felt like I was ready for it to be over.

And Andor wasn't even nominated? Lol.  Golden Globes are a joke."
The Golden Pillow,It was fine. I feel like Julia and Interview With A Vampire got overlooked last year.
The Golden Pillow,Severance was right fucking there!
The Golden Pillow,Literally the other 4 shows nominated against it were better than this
The Golden Pillow,LETS GOOOOOO
The Golden Pillow,Severance was robbed
The Golden Pillow,Were there no other entrants?
The Golden Pillow,"Severance should have won. Still trying to wrap my head around the popularity of Andor. At least HotD has good acting even if it is overrated. The acting on Andor ranges from mediocre to plain awful. And there's no real story, just a bunch of meandering filler."
The Golden Pillow,"Better Call Saul is always the bridesmaid 

Strangely, I don‚Äôt mind HotD winning. I liked it very much after hating the later seasons of GoT. Brought back gripping fantasy drama that it‚Äôs famous for. Just wish BCS had won something in previous years :/"
The Golden Pillow,Can‚Äôt believe this beat Better Call Saul. HotD was a pile of hot garbage. Picked up for the last few episodes but otherwise it was a snooze fest.
The Golden Pillow,Well I'm okay with hotd I was afread to gave it to euphoria or Wednesday or Lotr
The Golden Pillow,"People like HotD

People also like BCS

I've yet to meet anyone who thought HotD was better than BCS."
The Golden Pillow,Deserved.
The Golden Pillow,The idea that this was anywhere close to being the best drama is insane.
The Golden Pillow,Tough competition this year but well deserved win.
The Golden Pillow,"Can we please stop downvoting people saying they don't agree with HotD winning or that it isn't a great show. Y'all have no problem shitting on Disney, comic book, or RoP types of shows. So let people have their own differing opinion."
The Golden Pillow,I mean it was good. Wasn't amazing. Its an awesome family drama that is gripping to watch. Besides that I would chosen something else.
The Golden Pillow,"I really felt largely indifferent about house of the dragon. None of the characters captured my interest (there were no Neds, Jon‚Äôs, Robbs, Hounds, Jamie‚Äôs or even Cersei level characters and there was absolutely no one who even remotely came close to Arya or Tyrian). It‚Äôs a show set in a world we are familiar with but it just absolutely failed to make me care about anyone or anything going on in the story (at least during the first season). I am glad if people enjoyed the show but I can‚Äôt be the only person who thought it paled in comparison to game of thrones season 1."
The Golden Pillow,No we all know it‚Äôs payed from the beginning and it‚Äôs a fake award
The Golden Pillow,So happy. Quality triumphs
The Golden Pillow,The globes are rigged. HOTD is not the best drama series. Not by a long shot.
The Golden Pillow,"My mind is actually blown over the nominations and the winners. Rhea Seehorn not even nominated?! House of the Dragon wins after the horrible decision to swap actors half way through the season, the incredibly dark scenes and over all meh feel to the season. 

Kevin Costner over Bob Odenkirk?! 

I also wish I could understand the hype behind The White Lotus. I watched it and found it to be one of the most boring tv shows I've seen in a long  time. I didn't care for a single character, no one seemed interesting, and the big scene was super meh. I must just be missing something."
The Golden Pillow,The show was decent but not that good. It wasn‚Äôt even as good as the other fantasy blockbuster show that came out at the same time (Rings of Power). Just a violent soap opera seen through a fantasy filter.
The Golden Pillow,Not a fan of HOD. What am I missing?
The Golden Pillow,Mid show
The Golden Pillow,"HotD is a decent 6.5/10 show this first season. Best drama show? Not by a long shot. Undeserved.  

Better Call Saul deserved this win."
The Golden Pillow,The fact that Better Call Saul and Severance didn't win anything should tell you all you need to know about the Golden Globes.
The Golden Pillow,Better call Saul should have won
The Golden Pillow,"I'm a nobody. Here's my opinion. 

HoTD: Awesome return to that lovely writing which got me hooked to this fantasy world in the first place. It's also just so much more cinematic now. And the plot structure is really experimental (for a tv show) given how much time can pass between episodes.
Only issue I found is: the characters do start to feel a little one note. They are well developed, almost all of them but just tonally they've got like a singular mentality to them. Maybe it's a sign of good writing that you know what a characters gonna do but it's also starts to feel a little too predictable. 

Severance: Started out strong. I loved the concept. Then got bored in the middle. Never felt the need to continue after that.

Better call Saul: I've got a love-hate relationship with this one. Sometimes I think it's leagues above Breaking Bad and anything else competing, and then other times I realize I've grown tired of really long stories like this. They require a lot more intellectual and emotional investment over years as the seasons release for me. Personal issue I know but it does hurt the pacing. Didn't continue it after season 4."
The Golden Pillow,The most overrated show. Constant time jumps and changes. Didn't care about any of the characters. Of course it wins because it's in the Westeros universe üôÑ
The Golden Pillow,"Severance and Better Call Saul were so much better lol do these voters even watch the ""for your consideration"" screener copies they're given?"
The Golden Pillow,Awful.
The Golden Pillow,"It deserved to win, screw BCS. Also, how dare did they not at least nominate Paddy Considine for his performance as Viserys?"
The Golden Pillow,"House of Dragon wasn't even as good as the first half of GOT. Is it getting an award just because it was component after the shitshow of 2nd half of GOT?

Over Saul and Severance?"
The Golden Pillow,Correct
The Golden Pillow,Am I the only person in the world who thought House of Dragon was painfully bad? Extremely monotone and drab. Not sure why everyone loves it. And I‚Äôm saying this as someone who read ASOIAF and loved GoT.
The Golden Pillow,I'm waiting for the obligatory post about how Ansore should have won instead.
The Golden Pillow,Deservedly
The Golden Pillow,I regret enduring six episodes of the show. House of the Dragon is not good.
The Golden Pillow,Check that box.
The Golden Pillow,Seems like every award show these days are pay to win. No way it was the best drama of 2022. Maybe best horror lol
The Golden Pillow,Oh this will go over great with r/television
The Golden Pillow,"I still can‚Äôt figure out why brutal murders constantly happen right in front of the king and he doesn‚Äôt do shit about it. Makes no sense, this show has such terrible writing we stopped watching after the time jump and the best actress disappeared and was replaced by someone that looks nothing like her. 

 And seriously if they really wanted to the king could have his own children. The random horrible addds nothing to the show abortion scene was the last episode I bothered with. 


the writing on this show is atrocious it‚Äôs like season 1 is GoT season 8. Makes no sense"
The Golden Pillow,I guess incest is more popular than I thought.
The Golden Pillow,What a sick joke
The Golden Pillow,Well deserved. Some of the most fun I had all year watching a TV show. Entertaining fan community too. A little nuts but entertaining
The Golden Pillow,"I know I‚Äôm in the minority here, but I‚Äôm just not a fan of ‚Äúset up‚Äù season trend like S1 of HOTD and Severance. Both had so much potential, especially Severance, but the pacing was just way too slow for me. They both felt like they stretched 3-4 episodes of material over a whole season."
The Golden Pillow,BCS is stupidly overrated.
The Golden Pillow,It‚Äôs Severance all the way. Robbed. House do the dragon didn‚Äôt come close and honestly better than Better Call Saul.
The Golden Pillow,"Complete nonsense. Better Call Saul was the best thing on TV last year by far. 

For one it‚Äôs not set in fantasy dragon world üôÑ I‚Äôve never really ‚Äúgot‚Äù the whole game of thrones thing. It just seems like boring medieval shit to me. Interspersed with *lots* of softcore porn for the teenage boys to enjoy. Guessing that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs more popular. Boobs."
The Golden Pillow,HBO probably sponsored the event itself
The Golden Pillow,Wow every episode had me asleep. Was more of a sitcom than anything. No comparison to how powerful GOT was.
The Golden Pillow,Tbh I thought it was sorta boring.
The Golden Pillow,That award was Bought. Love GOT but this was terrible
The Golden Pillow,"Should‚Äôve been Saul but I‚Äôm biased. I liked this show a lot more than I expected, though."
The Golden Pillow,"Severance was robbed! 

I mean, I didn't expect it to win, and obviously HotD is the more popular show and in no way bad. But Severance really was the best new show of the year."
The Golden Pillow,How was Matt Smith not nominated?
The Golden Pillow,I wanted to hate HOtD just because of what happened with GOT but I have to admit I really liked it. Some of the scenes/happenings at the end of the season were awesome.
1920. Wojna i milosc,The post belongs in r/im14andthisisdeep
1920. Wojna i milosc,This would be a great copypasta if it weren‚Äôt so god damn long.
1920. Wojna i milosc,"> The message of the episode appears to be that the solution to you being offended by your neighbour‚Äôs racist statue is to circulate a petition to ban it. I am glad that Benny vandalising the statue was portrayed as a bad thing. However, I view Angie‚Äôs decision to circulate that petition as being just as bad as Benny vandalising a statue, as Angie was trying to suppress freedom of property, just like Benny was.

> The constitution clearly protects your right to put whatever you want on your front lawn. Obviously, it is against the law to incite violence or disclose people‚Äôs personal information without their consent. With that being said, if the racist man were to put a sign on his front lawn that had, on it, a death threat, that would be against the law, he should be arrested. However, all he did was place a statue on his front lawn. If you find that offensive, don‚Äôt look at it.

Bruh did you just side with the motherfuckin' racist from the George Lopez episode!? Lol fuck outta here! 

I'll tell you what... Instead of vandalizing the status and sending out petitions, George, Benny and Max should've beat his fuckin' ass that's what they should've done."
1920. Wojna i milosc,"Another bad message we see a lot is that it's impossible to avoid an unplanned pregnancy.    There are shows where doctors get pregnant accidentally.    While it COULD happen, I think a doctor knows better."
1920. Wojna i milosc,[deleted]
1920. Wojna i milosc,"I didn't read this marlon brando has an infamous clip that's watchable on youtube that goes into why hollywood has always had the ""wrong message"""
1920. Wojna i milosc,"""9. Hurt feelings justify aggravated assault (HIMYM).""

Unfortunately, that is pretty common in TV."
1920. Wojna i milosc,Yes
1920. Wojna i milosc,This is the weirdest thing I've read all day. 10/10
1920. Wojna i milosc,"I don't side with people, I side with ideas. I think that it is a good idea if property rights are protected for everyone, even racist people. 

If you feel that a lawn ornament should be banned, because it is offensive, who gets to decide what counts as offensive? Who decides which lawn ornaments are and are not allowed? There probably exist homophobic people who would consider a gay pride flag offensive, while you would consider their homophobia offensive. 

[https://youtu.be/TYlaOzMuTHo](https://youtu.be/TYlaOzMuTHo) 

A racist statue is offensive, but it doesn't deprive anyone of rights. George said that need to deal with this stuff or it spreads. What does he think will happen? Does he actually believe that someone who is not racist at all will see a statue and then become a white nationalist, because of a lawn ornament?"
1920. Wojna i milosc,I heard through the grape vine that there is a movie called Jane the Virgin where a woman who planned on remaining chaste until marriage gets pregnant as the result of a medical error. I have never actually seen this movie though.
1920. Wojna i milosc,"It's sad and unfortunate but there are people who believe that you only have rights if they like you. If you dare to contradict them, you become their enemy. They simply cannot see that it is only by protecting the rights of those you disagree with or hate that you protect *your own* rights -- because there are likely a lot of people who disagree with or hate *you*."
1920. Wojna i milosc,It's a show.   I saw it.   They do a decent job of setting up the medical mistake.
1920. Wojna i milosc,"The cinematogrophy is what I recall most about that show. Imo some of the other elements wavered as it went on, but it never stopped being interesting to look at."
1920. Wojna i milosc,Richard Harrow is one of the most magnetic and tragic characters in TV history.
1920. Wojna i milosc,"It was a great show. Many people say it's not good after season 2 but they're wrong. Season 3 was fantastic, especially the villain. Season 4 had a bit of a drop in quality but was still pretty good TV. And season 5 imo was just as good as season 1. A great finish to a great show."
1920. Wojna i milosc,Van Alden is one of the best parts of that show.
1920. Wojna i milosc,"A couple seasons were masterful, and Richard Harrow makes that show. Chalky is also fantastic. 

They don't totally pull off the story in the end, and they borrowed from a couple shows a little too liberally (Carnivale comes to mind), but it doesn't matter one bit. It felt like watching an undiscovered show somehow, even when there were big ads everywhere. "
1920. Wojna i milosc,"You haven't gotten to that point yet, but I think people aren't remembering it so fondly is because the creator Terrence Winter pretty much rushed the ending and abandoned the series. The series was one of my favorites for the first 4 seasons, especially season 2 and the shocking ending ranks as one of the best on television."
1920. Wojna i milosc,"As a gritty period piece, it was absolutely amazing. As a Daredevil backstory, it made little to no sense. "
1920. Wojna i milosc,Easily one of my favorite shows. Top 3 HBO shows for me. 
1920. Wojna i milosc,"I think one of the main reasons this show is so overlooked is that it had a lot of stiff competition on the small screen at the time. 

Breaking Bad was doing big things, Mad Men was still killing it, people still likes The Walking Dead (I think) and Game of Thrones was on picking up steam. "
1920. Wojna i milosc,"I think it could have gone down as one of the greats if the final season wasn't rushed.  Not to spoil, but there is a time jump, and a major character's death is just totally glossed over, which is a shame, since it was a pretty monumental character and the actor gave a great performance.  I heard this occurred because the creator (Terrance Winter, I think?) was going to go work on Vinyl, which was a flop for the network and was cancelled after one season anyway.  "
1920. Wojna i milosc,"I watched it and loved it. Great characters, great production values, a cool setting, intriguing story lines... and then I kind of forgot about it.

It's weird, can't explain why."
1920. Wojna i milosc,"It is a really strong show, I enjoyed it considerably. The only complaints I ever really had was how short the final season was (8 episodes) so things feel a bit more rushed in that season compared to the others, and the second thing is a major spoiler so I'll tag it.

[Boardwalk Empire season 5 spoilers](#s ""The time skip causes us to miss some things that would have been really interesting."") 

In any case, neither is an issue until season 5. Seasons 1 - 4 are amazing, and even with my complaints its still really strong up until the end."
1920. Wojna i milosc,"""These woods is for livin.....ya understand"""
1920. Wojna i milosc,"An HBO show about New Jersey mobsters sounds like a can‚Äôt-lose proposition, but the show never really took off and became water-cooler material like The Sopranos. It wasn‚Äôt an inexpensive show, either. That giant outdoor boardwalk set was located in Brooklyn.

It also debuted a year before Game of Thrones, and we all know how that turned out.

It‚Äôs ironic because HBO really didn‚Äôt know what it had in its hands; they probably imaged Boardwalk was going to be their flagship show."
1920. Wojna i milosc,"Richard muthafuckin Harrow!

""What does mother fucker mean?""
""I suppose its a Swartz word"""
1920. Wojna i milosc,Best intro also
1920. Wojna i milosc,"You're in for a treat! Just finished this series a week ago, I already miss it"
1920. Wojna i milosc,">I just finished season 3 and stood up to applaud the screen.

Fucking hell. Get a grip."
1920. Wojna i milosc,"I remember seeing commercials  to that years back while watching wwe i always thought it looked amazing, i love the style of that time the slick back and suits i may need to check it out."
1920. Wojna i milosc,Great show.
1920. Wojna i milosc,Margaret Schroeder kinda kills the show a bit.  Not a fan of that character.  
1920. Wojna i milosc,"Its a lot like LOST, first 4 seasons are great but the 5th and final season is shit and rushed tbh. I did not give a flying fuck about Nucky's childhood. "
1920. Wojna i milosc,"i think it‚Äôs one of the most frustrating shows ever, the first 2 seasons are fantastic, season 3 is great but starts to turn. then it just gets sloppy as hell and leaves us with an unsatisfying conclusion. I still believe killing jimmy off was the biggest mistake but overall it‚Äôs not a bad show. there‚Äôs so much to admire and enjoy but it could‚Äôve been an all time classic. "
1920. Wojna i milosc,Great tv show. Richard Farrow was my favorite character in that show. Gyp Rossetti was my favorite antagonist
1920. Wojna i milosc,Agree its well made but plot kinda boring. And too much nucky / margaret. 
1920. Wojna i milosc,I stopped watching the show when Nucky was living away from the boardwalk for security
1920. Wojna i milosc,"That's what I keep hearing, I'm assuming after season 3? I think the first 3 seasons were outstanding but season 4 seems to a slow start. "
1920. Wojna i milosc,"I love Richard Harrow so much, they could honestly make a movie about i him, just call it ""HARROW"" and watch it smash the box office. 

I was even thinking of going as him for Halloween but i suspect there costume would be lost on most people. "
1920. Wojna i milosc,"> Richard Harrow

!spoiler!

I know it seems petty but when they killed him off I stopped watching."
1920. Wojna i milosc,"> Season 3 was fantastic, especially the villain. 

Whenever I see Gyp Rossetti in anything I just cannot see anyone else.  It is hard to reconcile him being a super nice/sweet step-father and be a bro towards Ant-Man. "
1920. Wojna i milosc,"I remember I took a break after season 2 because I didn‚Äôt know if I would still be into it after the end of that specific arc. A few months after it aired I bit the bullet and started season 3 and it blew my mind. Gyp was so terrifying and the box scene shocked me to my core (amazing performance by Kelly Macdonald). 

I still liked season 4 even though it was not as good (how can you top that?). Season 5 was definitely underwhelming but I loved the kid who played Nucky as a child. He was so amazing. "
1920. Wojna i milosc,"For me season 5  ruined the whole series, it‚Äôs the only season I have not bought because I‚Äòm most definitely not gonna rewatch it. The show ending with 4 was perfect in my opinion. Seriously I have no idea how someone can finish watching season 4 and think ""hey we need another one"""
1920. Wojna i milosc,"Agreed ! I really didn't expect his character to go through so many drastic changes, I thought he would be Nuckys primary antagonist throughout the whole series. But i love how complicated they made things for him. "
1920. Wojna i milosc,the last season was two seasons worth of story crammed into one
1920. Wojna i milosc,"My biggest (petty) dislike for the final season are Nucky's fake teeth.  Obnoxious those made the cut, especially since young Nucky's actor was good.  Runner up would be what happened, or did not happen, with Arnold Rothstein.  "
1920. Wojna i milosc,">Terrence Winter pretty much rushed the ending and abandoned the series.

He didn't abandon it. It was canceled by HBO and he had was given one more season to wrap it up.   "

1920. Wojna i milosc,Daredevil backstory?
1920. Wojna i milosc,"How the hell could he have been more interested in vinyl than boardwalk?! That's like deciding the last couple bites of the best Thanksgiving dinner aren't worth it, and choosing to buy a bucket of kfc chicken instead. 

Then again, vinyl was actually pretty decent, i was a little shocked that it was cancelled after one season. "
1920. Wojna i milosc,"I really loved everything about her character and character arch, also what it brought to the plot and story, but once she does become part of Nuckys life and starts living the rich life, she becomes insufferable. "
1920. Wojna i milosc,"I think she was good at grounding the show for the first season or two since she was an outsider to this world like the audience. Also I'll take as much of Kelly Macdonald and her accent as I can get.
  
It's only later, when she go too comfortable with the lifestyle, that she became a bit superfluous as a character."
1920. Wojna i milosc,I'm almost sure that they killed Jimmy because the actor was causing problems on the set (its been a while but I think it might have been a substance abuse problem) and was fired. 
1920. Wojna i milosc,I liked season 4 but agree it's a slow burn

1920. Wojna i milosc,Not true. It was canceled by HBO. Terrence Winter was lucky to get one more season to wrap it up.  David Milch was offered a similar opportunity with Deadwood but turned it down.
1920. Wojna i milosc,A lot of people think he got too busy with Vinyl and his heart wasn't in BE anymore. Seriously season 4 was like a set up for a fantastic 2-3 season finale arc. 
1920. Wojna i milosc,"Yeah I've been moaning about this since it aired. Such a wonderful, fully formed world, and the last season just seemed so rushed. He had apparently been working on getting Vinyl made for years, so when he got it greenlit at HBO, all of his attention just went there. And then it got canceled after 1 season and it's just kind of depressing to think about now. 

But we still have Boardwalk forever :) I'm glad you're finally catching up on it. It's an awesome show, and it definitely doesn't get enough praise. "
1920. Wojna i milosc,"Interesting, i heard that was the case with the actress that played Lucy Danzigar too. "

1920. Wojna i milosc,He's hilarious in Angie Tribeca
1920. Wojna i milosc,">A lot of people think he got too busy with Vinyl and his heart wasn't in BE anymore. 

Boardwalk Empire was canceled by HBO. It was an HBO decision, not a Terrence Winter decision. He was given one more season to wrap it up.  Of course he didn't bad mouth HBO afterward because they had an ongoing relationship at the time."
1920. Wojna i milosc,No problem! Final season will be starting sometime this year (hopefully). 
1920. Wojna i milosc,"He's only in season 3, but he's fucking excellent in it. Also check out Homecoming on Amazon, he's really good in that too."
1920. Wojna i milosc,Yea he was great in homecoming. I also saw him on broadway in ‚ÄúThe lifespan of a fact‚Äù. He was phenomenal along with cherry jones and Daniel Radcliffe.

1920. Wojna i milosc,All this has happened before... [and it will all happen again](https://youtu.be/UmutRqkMx3g?t=278)
1920. Wojna i milosc,Both
1920. Wojna i milosc,"Thanks, there are some great suggestions there. I left the last ones off the list because although I understand where you‚Äôre coming from I feel like if I start including contemporaneous shows (or shows that are of a time rather than about a time) then I could, by that rationale, have to include nearly every show ever made that wasn‚Äôt science fiction. I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôve explained myself very well but I know what I mean!"
1920. Wojna i milosc,"Thanks, I‚Äôve never heard of Centennial. Was it good and is it available anywhere? Covering 170+ years over 26 hrs is quite the feat."
1920. Wojna i milosc,That is one I always thought I should make the effort to watch but to my shame for some reason it just hasn't happened yet.
1920. Wojna i milosc,The Accursed Kings sounds really interesting. My instinct is that the original version rather than the remake would be the one to watch but I don't know how available that would be.

1920. Wojna i milosc,Many thanks for these suggestions and I have done my best with adding dates. I had never heard of the Chinese and Korean ones and it's a part of the world that is under-represented on the list due to my ignorance. I bet there are loads more to discover.
1920. Wojna i milosc,"Thanks, I‚Äôd somehow never even heard of Empire. Would you recommend it because the reviews seem mixed?"
1920. Wojna i milosc,"I get that, that makes sense."
The Surgeons Cut,"Ah, shit, not them too! If they kill off Pike's show because of cost cuts, I ***swear to GOD...***"
The Surgeons Cut,"""Why don't you just give us money and we do nothing?"" - Streaming service providers"
The Surgeons Cut,"I have enjoyed Lower Decks so far, I hope it stays."
The Surgeons Cut,Give me 6+ seasons of Strange New Worlds and Lower Decks and I‚Äôll be happy.
The Surgeons Cut,"LOL, what a ridiculous headline considering what the platform is, and how the studio who owns the platform has prioritized the property. 

Then again, this is essentially just a FanSite (as well read as it might be, there aren't any actual journalists on staff, they're all amateur writers working in the Geek Culture milieu) so for what its worth, the entire thrust of the article is based on this one bit of ""news"" such as it is: 

> none of the other Trek shows have been officially given new seasons, meaning there is no announced production for the continuing series or any new ones.

**This is literally it.** Everything else is speculation/worry that because there's no *announced* production for continuing series, that the future remains unclear in the face of streaming cuts, despite the fact that Star Trek is floating that platform, will always float that platform, and the idea that streaming cuts means the future of the TV series is in question is alarmist and frankly, ridiculous.

If anything, the worst-case scenario is that they crank back the budget on the shows, not that they eradicate them completely. Star Trek is successful TV. Exceedingly so. They're basically giving up on it being a film franchise for the foreseeable future and it's a good bet that's *been* paying off. 

TL:DR - the future of Star Trek TV is fine, Paramount+ is going to continue funding production of Star Trek shows, and this is a Geek Culture fansite stretching its legs pursuing a complete hypothetical based on a single line of real news."
The Surgeons Cut,Please keep lower decks - it‚Äôs legitimately the best Star Trek show since voyager
The Surgeons Cut,Streaming services will not survive if they have no good exclusives shows. Star Trek is one of the biggest IPs owned by Paramount. They would be dumb to cancel Star Trek shows.
The Surgeons Cut,"Keep SNW at the very least.

I see this this as a relatively good thing. Having like 6 series on at once seems a little much. Strengthen your focus."
The Surgeons Cut,I enjoy having a full spread of star trek to watch this year please leave it alone. Lower decks is awesome.
The Surgeons Cut,"I‚Äôm not a huge Star Trek fan but I had a great time watching Strange New Worlds. Reminded me of when I watched Stargate as a kid with the case of the week episodes.

Made me realise how much I miss that format."
The Surgeons Cut,Any of us who lived through the video game crash of 1983 could see this coming.
The Surgeons Cut,Only 2 things will survive a nuclear bomb; cockroaches and Alex Kurtzman's Star Trek.
The Surgeons Cut,"Given that Star Trek is propping up a lot of other stuff at Paramount, I think we're good."
The Surgeons Cut,Right when they started making good shows.
The Surgeons Cut,"Good bye, *Star Trek Discovery*.  And whatever Section 31 show that was in development Hell.    


*Prodigy, Lower Decks, Strange New Worlds* and some form of *Picard* (TNG) spin-off will be Trek's future, imo."
The Surgeons Cut,"With Picard ending this year and Discovery likely ending in the next couple of years, I think the immediate danger to Star Trek on Paramount Plus is gone.

Star Trek has proven to be an important pillar to their streaming service, and you can't just have nothing but Yellowstone spin-offs.

I do think the era of Star Trek shows with a large season long arc is likely ending with Picard and Discovery.

There's a rumor that they are planning a spin-off Star Trek series that focuses on Worf and Raffi doing missions for Starfleet Intelligence.

This could be a great way to keep new a Star Trek show going without the need for a large ensemble cast or huge budget for massive space battles and other special effects.

It also slots in nicely since Strange New Worlds, Lower Decks, and Prodigy likely have several more seasons of life left."
The Surgeons Cut,"Lower Decks is by far, the best ST show in a long time and I am in love with Strange New Worlds. I will pay to keep Paramount+ as long as these shows continue.

Otherwise; cancelled!"
The Surgeons Cut,"Cut Discovery, problem solved"
The Surgeons Cut,"Picard has to go. Stewart is either too old now, or he's decided to play the part as someone who is unable to move, or speak without slurring like he's had 5 bottles of regular earth brandy. And a 25 year old's hairstyle does not make Seven or Crusher 25 again."
The Surgeons Cut,"Simple, keep prodigy and lower decks on tv. Strange new worlds could honestly jump to movies (maybe after a 3rd season kinda like OG trek)"
The Surgeons Cut,Imagine if we don't get a season 3 of SNW because they're only gonna budget for S6 of Star Trek Therapy.
The Surgeons Cut,Keep Lower Decks and Prodigy please
The Surgeons Cut,[Let them die!](https://youtu.be/4yIRfXiLQbE?t=291)
The Surgeons Cut,So all the streaming services are cutting back on offerings to save money because they don‚Äôt make enough on subscriptions alone. And because of that people will start to subscribe less and less lol.
The Surgeons Cut,"The only reason that anyone pays for paramount.

Edit: misspelling"
The Surgeons Cut,"It‚Äôs simple really, just like all the others, they need subscribers to justify spending."
The Surgeons Cut,"This is the last season of Picard anyway. Just keep lower decks and strange new worlds and don't worry about the section 31 show. If they want to tell more stories, they can start doing three episode miniseries."
The Surgeons Cut,All this push for streaming and subs is starting to back fire
The Surgeons Cut,"So no Section 31 spin off, right?"
The Surgeons Cut,"Paramount has the possibility of keeping marginal Star Trek fans forever but only if there is always a live action show coming within a year and not just a cartoon.  I enjoyed Prodigy a lot but Lower Decks just seems like ""new 'member berries"" of old material."
The Surgeons Cut,"A new show with Jeri Ryan as captain would be pretty awesome, especially with some TNG/DS9/VOY cameos thrown in from time to time."
The Surgeons Cut,"In related news, my ongoing subscription to Paramount+ also remains unclear."
The Surgeons Cut,I‚Äôm more worried about the future of Evil with this announcement. Such a glorious show. Star Trek Strange New Worlds should be safe.
The Surgeons Cut,So Paramount+ is a very confusing streaming service in it makes no sense. They've got so much old content people would kill to see.
The Surgeons Cut,Star Trek is literally the only reason I subscribe to Paramount+
The Surgeons Cut,Lower Decks and Strange New Worlds are two of my favorite shows on TV right now.
The Surgeons Cut,I'll be happy if they keep Lower Decks. The rest is meh aside from Discovery which is crap.
The Surgeons Cut,I don‚Äôt understand how they can make crap like Discovery and then a great show like Strange New Worlds.  It‚Äôs a complete disconnect.
The Surgeons Cut,Kill off the bad new-Treks (Picard and Discovery) and just keep the good ones aka Lower Decks and Strange New Worlds. By the way im still waiting on DS9 and Voyager blurays. Id rather have those than anything else
The Surgeons Cut,"Picard is wrapping up, cancel Discovery, that should give them some budget for Strange New Worlds."
The Surgeons Cut,As someone who grew up watching TNG and loving the show to this day I‚Äôm starting to think it‚Äôs fine if some franchises just die.
The Surgeons Cut,It's time to put Discovery down. After second season is basically unwatchable.
The Surgeons Cut,good. Currently rewatching DS9 and the difference is just abyssal
The Surgeons Cut,The only one I'd actually miss is the kids show Prodigy. They finally nailed the spirit of Star Trek with that one. They tried with SNW but it's so bland. LD is hit and miss with its latest season being a huge miss. Discovery and Picard are epic fails. A lot of Star Trek content from this streaming service but not a lot of quality stuff after so many years.
The Surgeons Cut,"Keep Strange New Worlds, Lower Decks and Prodigy. Cut Discovery loose. Develop new series that expand the story after Voyager/Picard Season 3 for whenever they decide to end Strange New Worlds."
The Surgeons Cut,"I don't know if this is an unpopular opinion, but I really couldn't get into Trek post-Abrams. I grew up in the 80s and 90s on the Original Series and the Next Generation. I watched the Abrams reboot and the two subsequent movies but I felt that they ignored most of the things that made Trek what it was in favor of something different. When the series started streaming (Discovery, Brave New Worlds, especially Picard) I just couldn't get through a couple episodes.  

Anyone else here feel the same?"
The Surgeons Cut,Let it die. We were better off with no Trek at all than this bullshit.
The Surgeons Cut,"I haven't seen Strange New Worlds, but Picard and Discovery didn't have the soul of Star Trek. Completely different kinds of shows. 

The original Star Trek (through Voyager, or maybe even Enterprise) was relatively laid back and focused a lot on stuff like ethical/philosophical questions, it had a sense of humor, and didn't take itself too seriously."
The Surgeons Cut,"Honestly, as long as prodigy survives, that's all that matters to me. (Though lower Decks is decent too. Picard was a waste of too much money but it's ending anyway, and Discovery is an absolute pile of crap and the only trek I've been unable to get through.)"
The Surgeons Cut,"I hope they still get to make Section 31, as the article suggests, because for me Michelle Yeoh was the best thing about *Discovery* by a wide margin."
The Surgeons Cut,The Future of Trek was unclear when STD first aired.  I haven't seen anything to bring me back yet.
The Surgeons Cut,"Funny thing is, Star Trek used to be pretty low brow. Special effects were never anything big, it was always about the stories. Unfortunately, they seem to have forgotten that."
The Surgeons Cut,I‚Äôm thinking Halo is much more likely to get whacked than any ST series
The Surgeons Cut,Some of the best Star Treks have come out recently. I hope they don‚Äôt cur any of them.
The Surgeons Cut,But of course they‚Äôre going to cut the stuff that people actually like and keep what drives people away standard corporate bs.
The Surgeons Cut,"The turtle croaks:  He's my son.


Genius, Sir Stewart!  You've transported us all yet again!"
The Surgeons Cut,SNW and lower decks must stay. The rest can go.
The Surgeons Cut,"Strange New Worlds as the main Trek, Lower Decks as the comedy Trek and Prodigy as the kids Trek. No more Discovery, Picard, the section 31 show or any Picard spinoffs unless its a Riker show lol

Edit: Called it."
The Surgeons Cut,I hope something like The Orville is the future of Trek. Not the pathetic and ultimately unwatchable Discovery. (Multiple decade ST fan.)
The Surgeons Cut,"Lol bye Burnham, you whisper crying joke of a Starfleet officer. 
What this ‚Äúmeans‚Äù is Disco is done after this next season, likewise that Section 36 spin-off is toast unless they can talk Michael Dorn into headlining it, SNW might get a 3rd depending on how the just finished filming second does, the Starfleet Academy spinoff is F‚Äôing toast (bye Tilly) lower decks will end after next season and Prodigy may or may not get a second season depending on viewership on Nickelodeon goes. 

My question is do these cuts mean Paramount does the smart thing and abandons the previously greenlit second season of Halo, or do they ride that dark horse straight into the ground because the checks already been cashed so why not."
The Surgeons Cut,Doing better than the Orville. Blame that show for the writing in forspoken
The Surgeons Cut,"Yep, force multiple shows on the viewership, most of which are awful, with plans for even more. What could possibly go wrong?

Please cut Picard and Discovery.  Don't even finish the current seasons.  By that meaning don't broadcast them, they're that  bad.  Picard is vomitous.  I mean dumb, cheap, predictable, and boring as hell.

Lower Decks can stay."
The Surgeons Cut,Hot take: Disco is good but makes less accepting people uncomfortable
The Surgeons Cut,"First off, it never should've made it this far in the first place. 

Second, if Paramount does cancel shows, the Outrage Bait assholes who have been saying everything was going to be canceled after every season are going to be insufferable with their ""WE TOLD YOU!!!""s, as if they actually predicted something instead of being the broken clock that happens to be right once.

/looks like I've pissed the fragile fanbois off again. Oh well. Brand recognition and blind brand loyalty is why we keep getting shitty reboots and pointless prequels  instead of something good or original."
The Surgeons Cut,Well Picard is done so they already are spending less and that was where they would have to pay the actors the most wasn‚Äôt it?
The Surgeons Cut,"Keeps Lower Decks and Strange New Worlds, give Discovery a final season.. or keep it around and just cap it at 10 episodes. It's not better than LD or SNW, so there's no reason to give it 3 or 4 more episodes per season over the others. I am not interest in Prodigy's cgi animation so I will I won't speak on it's quality but if they want to cut costs, then cap it at 10 as well.

They could also, you know, stop expanding the casts each season. Seems like every season of Discovery they think they need to add new people."
The Surgeons Cut,"Picard‚Äôs done after this season and Disco is going into season 5 for some reason, so hopefully they‚Äôd be the first budget difference makers."
The Surgeons Cut,"Leave it, theyre all good. Okay... Picard is lukewarm."
The Surgeons Cut,3D voyager ?!?!
The Surgeons Cut,"‚ÄúParamount has confirmed they will be cutting back spending on content overall as the media industry moves into a new phase of the streaming era.‚Äù


Means:


‚ÄúWe will monitor our competitors, and if they appear to be spending less money, we will do the same. Phew, it appears they are doing that now, so we will do that now. Start contacting the media with fluff articles so we can start telling people now that their particular shows will be impacted.‚Äù"
The Surgeons Cut,Star Trek is pretty much the only reason I have a sub for Paramount + so I hope it stays
The Surgeons Cut,Cut back Star Trek then Paramount+ will hit the cutting room floor‚Ä¶ really the main reason to subscribe
The Surgeons Cut,Yea S3 of Picard is bringing back the magic so far. Not like the S2 dumpster üî•. The Pike show is not bad.
The Surgeons Cut,Starfleet Academy show
The Surgeons Cut,Maybe paramount just didn‚Äôt need a streaming service if they couldn‚Äôt afford it.
The Surgeons Cut,"Star Trek was the only reason I had Paramount plus, they cut back on the content, I could use one less monthly sub."
The Surgeons Cut,"Dump Alex Kurtzman, keep Terry Matalas and give it another shot."
The Surgeons Cut,"Overstuffed, oversaturated, over stimulated, and over IT.  If they‚Äôd just cut the cost of their shitty streaming service they‚Äôd likely have more viewers ‚Ä¶ ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è that‚Äôs what keeps me away.  Every service wants more than ten dollars a month.  Plus the cable bill, plus the internet bill.  It‚Äôs just stupid. Shit adds up.  Not enough hours in the day to live work and look at all these streamers too.  For those old enough to remember,  you can bet Data‚Äôs emotion chip there‚Äôs going to be a very big  ‚Äúdot.com‚Äù bubble type implosion very soon."
The Surgeons Cut,"As someone who has never spent any time investment in Star Trek, I am absolutely blown away at the amount of content being produced for it right now. Growing up, I would occasionally catch episodes of The Next Generation on syndication after school, but that was basically it. I peripherally knew that movies got produced, and that there was things like Voyager and Deep Space 9. Now you guys have like what, 4 active shows running? From what I‚Äôve heard the quality and reception really varies, but it must be nice to be a Star Trek fan these days."
The Surgeons Cut,"This would suck because Strange New Worlds is IMO the best Trek show of all time.

Picard S3 has also been very strong so far with great episodes and great callbacks to past Trek.   Episode 3 has major DS9 implications that could indicate seeing some of those characters in the show."
The Surgeons Cut,Link bait. Star Trek isn‚Äôt going anywhere.
The Surgeons Cut,"It's easy, bump SNW to 30 episodes a year and cancel the rest!"
The Surgeons Cut,As much as I want the franchise to move forward I'm never paying for yet another streaming service. My wallet is more important.
The Surgeons Cut,"Give me SNW, Prodigy and LD and I'm fine."
The Surgeons Cut,"That was the good one. I was so looking forward to more proper episodical stories, enough with all the damn long-arcs."
The Surgeons Cut,"Yeah, I know.  I like *Star Trek: Strange New Worlds*, and thankfully, it doesn't require much knowledge of *Star Trek: Discovery*.  That show sucks, when is that going to die?  *Star Trek: Picard* finally got good, but this is the last season."
The Surgeons Cut,It‚Äôs there most popular show. Now way they cut it.
The Surgeons Cut,"Honestly, SNW isn‚Äôt that great either. It still has the same problems as all of nutrek where no one acts professional, they act like teenagers. It‚Äôs just bad writing"
The Surgeons Cut,"Join us at r/Star_Trek_ to discuss all things trek!  Q‚Äôpla!

Edit: Not sure why I am getting downvoted. There are numerous Trek subs on Reddit. Anyone is free to join one, or all. Yes this one is new, but that‚Äôs no reason to downvote it. Every sub starts somewhere.  I love Trek and would be happy to talk Trek with anyone. Have a great day!"
The Surgeons Cut,At least we would be spared the horrible cast choice they made for Kirk.
The Surgeons Cut,What gets me is how they never have usable apps. How do they think I'm going to watch the content I pay for?
The Surgeons Cut,They‚Äôd still figure out a way to not be profitable.
The Surgeons Cut,"I watch the other ones, but I *enjoy* Lower Decks."
The Surgeons Cut,Lower decks is so good
The Surgeons Cut,Lower Decks and Strange New Worlds are great for my Trek fix: nerding out with LD on old trek references galore and solid enough stories + humour. SNW for a modern approach to one-off sci-fi stories (mostly). If either goes I‚Äôm going to weep.
The Surgeons Cut,Prodigy is fantastic.  Such great arc's and character growth.
The Surgeons Cut,I love lower decks. Really hope it stays too
The Surgeons Cut,"Lower Decks, Strange New Worlds, Prodigy... we are really living in the second golden age of Trek, so it would be stupid to reduce existing shows.

Picard is so so... but even Discovery is more fun than some of the original shows (DS9).

They can cut the upcoming projects. Who needs a Section 31 show? The only reason I want it is because of Georgiou. They can easily find more promising concept for her... or to sneak her into SNW."
The Surgeons Cut,Six seasons and a movie!
The Surgeons Cut,"Yeah, there‚Äôs 5 active Star Trek shows right now.  Seems like Trek and Yellowstone are two of Paramount‚Äôs main pillars for its streaming service."
Once Upon a Time,"At first I thought OUAT was a terrible concept. Then I started watching and realized, oh, this is a great concept (and mostly great acting)! Then kept going and went, oh, they‚Äôre doing this very poorly."
Once Upon a Time,"Fuck that.

It's called FABLES. The show Once tried to be but gave up. 

And the game A Wolf Among Us

That's what I want"
Once Upon a Time,"Fuck that, Galavant season 3...let's fucking go!"
Once Upon a Time,"They tried something similar from the same people who made Once Upon A Time but didn't greenlight it after making the pilot. 

>Epic, the Disney-themed fairy tale anthology, is not moving forward at ABC.

>The Disney-owned broadcast network has opted to not pick up the drama pilot to series. Ordered to pilot in January under new network topper Craig Erwich, Epic would have marked a homecoming to ABC for Once Upon a Time creators Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis. The duo exec produced Epic alongside writer Brigitte Hales, who previously worked with Horowitz and Kitsis on Once Upon a Time and their short-lived Apple anthology Amazing Stories.

>Sources say the pilot didn‚Äôt come in strong despite execs being excited about the script. The pilot was filmed in Ireland, and, because of the pandemic, Kitsis and Horowitz were unable to go on location for the shoot.

In the 'real world' of OUaT, the story of Cinderella existed which means that the movie where Julie Andrews played the character can exist. But the in their world there is no actress named Dania Ramirez, instead that body/face belongs exclusively to their real world Cinderella.

Now take the same logic and apply to a new Disney property like Star Wars. In our world, the story of SW exists. But if a SW version of OUaT was made, it would play out a scenario in which the 'real' SW characters traveled through a worm-hole the show's version of Earth. In that show, a new actor could depict Luke."
Once Upon a Time,"I like the idea of combining the OUAT concept with the Brothers Grimm movie concept that Matt Damon and Heath Ledger starred in. 

Don‚Äôt just like ‚Äúmake it dark,‚Äù but put a spin on it that makes it more interesting than just ‚Äúwhat if fairytale characters existed in a small town.‚Äù"
Once Upon a Time,"They would never do it, but they should adapt the Fables comic. Shit would be amazing. Like Twin Peaks meets X Files meets Shrek. 

It‚Äôs Once Upon a Time. But‚Ä¶ actually good (I‚Äôm sorry it was so hammy)"
Once Upon a Time,"I feel this way about Greek mythology. Can we get like a game of thrones, high quality show about the Greek gods?"
Once Upon a Time,"I love remakes of fairy tales and was prepared to adore Once, but it was awful. The first entire season was the main character literally not believing the basic premise of the show. And then it was just shoe-horning in a ton of properties to try and ""say the thing"" and get people to watch."
Once Upon a Time,or hbo should just make fables instead of this horrible disney abc garbage rip off
Once Upon a Time,Disney is too conservative to do fantasy right.
Once Upon a Time,"The concept of Disney properties having a crossover with each other?

That sounds a lot like Kingdom Hearts lol, but with a dash of anime

Oh yeah, what happened to that Kingdom Hearts Disney+ show that was announced a few years ago?"
Once Upon a Time,What you want is Live Action Kingdom Hearts which is basically Disney‚Äôs Game of Thrones.
Once Upon a Time,ABC-fied or woke garbage?
Once Upon a Time,"In the ‚Äúlost pilots‚Äù thread that was posted here a few days ago, there was a similar concept set in monster lore (Frankenstein/Dracula/werewolf/etc)."
Once Upon a Time,Watch the 10th Kingdom. It's a miniseries so only a few episodes.
Once Upon a Time,[deleted]
Once Upon a Time,"As much as I'd love that, there's no way in hell Disney would adapt Fables literally. I mean, OUaT was a bit dark at times but Fables has GoT-level messed up stuff. And even though all characters have long been in the public domain I don't think any other network or platform would dare to try lest they anger the Mouse. I could see it in AppleTV+, though; CGI-heavy shows with grounded but twisted stories are right up their alley."
Once Upon a Time,"The fucked up thing is that ABC picked up Fables for an adaptation, then dropped it, and then almost immediately launched Once Upon A Time. Given the nature of the property, you can't really say they're violating the IP since it's all based off the public domain, but OUAT is very obviously a Fables rip-off"
Once Upon a Time,"YES YES YES YES YES.

And give it an actual ending, instead of the build up at the end of the comics leading to pretty much a thank you from the creators. Which was nice, but damn.

Hmmm, actually Fables deals with a lot of hardcore stuff. So send it to Hulu I guess."
Once Upon a Time,THIS PERSON FUCKING GETS IT
Once Upon a Time,Amen. Fables was an amazing journey.
Once Upon a Time,[deleted]
Once Upon a Time,Tad Cooper needs his day in the sun.
Once Upon a Time,What do y'all think of the writers absolute refusal to let Mr. Gold be redeemed? It was ultimately why I stopped watching after Mr. Gold fought so hard to be a good person and threw it all away yet again for like the 4th time. Sort of just felt repetitive.
Once Upon a Time,"I know! When I was watching all those years ago I would tweet just bits of info, my mind was being blown and I had to share it with the world lol.  Then I tweeted the spoiler about Red and finally my brother (one of my 3 followers lol) was like ‚ÄúI know this is about that show you watch, nothing you tweet makes sense, I guess I have to watch it now‚Äù He was hooked (üòâ) from day one!"
Once Upon a Time,"Yes.

But is difficult. If Disney wants to create a megahit they need Kingdom Hearts to be live action, and that would imply lots of money.

Also Kingdom Hearts' story is very difficult to understand because it became really complicated, especially since KH2, it would require a massive rework.

Then it's finding children and all the problems associated with it.

First, let's see how Percy Jackson and the Olympians performs..."
Once Upon a Time,"> but is the Kingdom Hearts series still in development?

Yes, KH4 got a trailer drop months ago but it doesn't look like it'll be involved with the Disney stuff, at least from the initial trailer."
Once Upon a Time,THE MOST AMBITIOUS CROSSOVER OF ALL TIME
Once Upon a Time,Man Zeus would make it awkward real quick. But it would/could be incredibly fun. Double fun cause my dogs name is Zeus and gets confused when he hears it on tv.
Once Upon a Time,For it to be a tax write off?
Once Upon a Time,Agreed. They carried that show.
Once Upon a Time,Fables is also owned by DC. So yeah Disney can't adapt it.
Once Upon a Time,"If I told you Disney would make a mini series of Pam and Tommy‚Äôs sex tape, and Chippendales rise and fall, would you say the same thing?"
Once Upon a Time,"I agree with everything you said.

I still won't budge. Too good not to make and if they can simply read a comic then it would be amazing. If someone can adapt fucking Sandman to tv then a true Fables is possible.

Fables or bust not another half ass like Once. I want the whole ass!"
Once Upon a Time,"> And even though all characters have long been in the public domain I don't think any other network or platform would dare to try lest they anger the Mouse.

If Mattel was willing to burn Disney with a rival to Disney Princesses despite being the company making Disney dolls I don't think any company fears Disney in regards to new expressions of public domain characters.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ever_After_High"
Once Upon a Time,"Yup, gave up.  

Instead of making something potentially revolutionary they went literal ABC and made a completely forgettable show.

It's not too late. Fables remains such a high quality that if you just do what Sandman did then you'd have a great show. Learn from the  Y Last Man and Runaways mistakes."
Once Upon a Time,Not sure if you know but Fables came back in 2022 with 12 more issues. Keeps going after 150
Once Upon a Time,Strong jaw and perfect hair!
Once Upon a Time,[deleted]
Once Upon a Time,Thanks. Now that‚Äôs running through my head as I‚Äôm working haha
Once Upon a Time,"Man Rumple went from one of the most interesting characters to one of the most annoying. They should‚Äôve just let him stay dead after his sacrifice in season 3, that was a perfect end to his character."
Once Upon a Time,Im not buying that it needs to be live action to be a hit
Once Upon a Time,"> If Disney wants to create a megahit they need Kingdom Hearts to be live action

They literally designed Sora to look like a cartoon so that he could more easily hang out with all the other cartoons he was going to meet on his adventure through cartoon worlds, why would you want a live action version of that?"
Once Upon a Time,"
>Also Kingdom Hearts' story is very difficult to understand because it became really complicated, 

I will use any opportunity to post this video.

https://youtu.be/4YVTBQCbezQ

I can't even tell you how many times I've watched it over the years."
Once Upon a Time,"KH story would be easy to simplify, just delete 90% of it.  

Nothing of value was lost."
Once Upon a Time,They literally showed Endor in the trailer lol
Once Upon a Time,Hades shows up at the end of the trailer what are you talking about. Well not shows up but its him talking and throwing the fire to donald and goofy
Once Upon a Time,Disney can't adapt it *for free*
Once Upon a Time,ABC did work on a version of Fables in 2008
Once Upon a Time,"But those are not fairy tales, which are one of the main pillars of their brand. I really don't think they are very keen on turning formerly family-friendly characters into assassins, psychopaths, and brutal dictators. Or maybe they are, who knows, Peter Pan was pretty terrifying in OUaT."
Once Upon a Time,"Oh, I actually didn't. I remember a few years ago that they were planning a mini arc, but I didn't know it was released.

I'll look into that, cheers!"
Once Upon a Time,Cojones out to there
Once Upon a Time,A real ear worm.
Once Upon a Time,No it definitely does. It's not like Disney is famous for its animation or anything like that.
Once Upon a Time,doing it like Who Framed Roger Rabbit would be sick
Once Upon a Time,"I didn't say I wanted that.

I only said that if they want it to be a megahit the easiest way (and, at the same time most difficult way because of the problems it may face) is that. ;)"
Once Upon a Time,"DC, I‚Äôve come to bargain"
Once Upon a Time,">	Peter Pan was pretty terrifying in OUaT.

 And in the disney+ rescue rangers movie"
Once Upon a Time,There was no hero quite like *GALAVAAAAANT!*
Once Upon a Time,"I guess if was more of a rhetorical ‚Äúwhy would *anyone* want that?‚Äù  It‚Äôs supposed to be a cartoon, let it be a cartoon.  Kingdom Hearts 3 had multiple cutscenes so long my Xbox tries to turn itself off.  And there were worlds where it was like ‚Äúlong ass cutscene, fight three headless, long ass cutscene, fight two heartless, long ass cutscene, walk into another room, long ass cutscene.‚Äù  They clearly want to make a cartoon, just let them make a cartoon."
Once Upon a Time,"Sup Marvel, we got The Batman and uh..Peacemaker!"
Once Upon a Time,Tough! Plus every other man-ly value!
Once Upon a Time,"Because Sora looks like a human and is a human. This is the dumbest argument, why would you want a Live Action Avengers if they are drawn as comic characters? Makes no sense"
Once Upon a Time,"Mess with him, he'll disembowel you!"
Once Upon a Time,"YEAH! He ruled in every way!

A fairytale *cliche*."
Once Upon a Time,"I'm willing to bet that they would have Abuela making a deal with Rumple for the magic candle, and the magic is dying because of him."
Once Upon a Time,Isabella would own a flower shop like snow queen owned ice cream shop. Antonio would be the town's animal control. Camilo would be actor or town arts director. Julieta a doctor. Feel like all those could be added easily. Dolores a... Detective?... But why wouldn't we meet her before? Maybe there's a new page in Henry's book that prophesies some crazy shit (Bruno) and abuela comes in to calm everyone down while (I like your theory) she's bartering with rumps to get her candle back. Mirabel could be under evil queen's spell and freeing her is the trick to save the town
Once Upon a Time,Abuela turns out to somehow be Regina's long-lost grandmother.
Once Upon a Time,"At the end of one episode, we see the silhouette of a woman standing in a hallway while two characters have a super important conversation. Camera zooms out, it's the girl with the super hearing listening to the whole conversation! What? It ends up the whole family is in Storybrook to help out Rumpelstiltskin. But why? Because Mr.Science, aka Frankenstein is sick of getting beaten on by people with magic, so he recruits some magical people he met on his journeys across the world. Then he starts hooking up with another non-magical person who is surrounded by those with magic, since they can understand each other. An older Mirabella."
Once Upon a Time,It turns out the family in Encanto is related to the main character... and rumple.... and a few other characters.
Once Upon a Time,That show ended how many years ago. And was trash
Once Upon a Time,"Haha I haven't thought about Once Upon a Time in quite a while, but yeah it would be amazing to see them keep adding more and more disney stories.

Imagine if they had started the series now, and could put a proper disney+ budget behind it."
Once Upon a Time,"I have the feeling that it would be better for Netflix long-term if the original content they have has some form of conclusion. Without a conclusion, many people will decide not to even start a show, because they don't want to be left hanging at the end. Shows that got ""finished"" will be stuff that can still draw people to stay on Netflix. Completed shows is something that will stay forever as a viable offering and strengthen them as unique selling points for Netflix.  

I think that is something they need to consider going forward, but I doubt they will do this retroactively for shows that were already cancelled. 

But maybe I am wrong, maybe it will turn out that only very extreme good hit shows actually have any potential (like Friends or Office) to be seen 3+ years after release."
Once Upon a Time,Netflix wanted to have its own catalog of content to stream but its turning into an archive of unfinished series. I come and go as a subscriber but if this trend continues I'm going to be less likely to start new content with them.  I suppose their numbers are driving their decisions but I wonder what their numbers will look like in 5 years when people have more options and have observed a history of their favorite shows ending early.
Once Upon a Time,even though i'm not a biggest fan of this show (i definitely enjoyed season 2 though!) i really hope another outlet picks this show up and continues the story of the OA!
Once Upon a Time,"To be fair, Netflix was truly a beacon for unique programming. The criticism that they have changed their content model is fair, and subscribers can make their decisions on the platforms they chose. 

I dont agree that people have gone ballistic, rather in this circumstance a beloved series is in jeopardy of fading into the nebulous because of unnecessary broadcast/streaming rights. It paints viewers into a corner to fight for the show's renewal on its current platform."
Once Upon a Time,I get tired of finding shows that last 1-2 seasons and then get dropped. Get so old investing that much time.
Once Upon a Time,Season 2 really set the show up to be so much more. Super disappointed to hear it was canceled JUST as it was about to get better
Once Upon a Time,"I know it's been reiterated a hundred times in this sub, but Netflix's failure to issue a legitimate cancellation notice is uniquely odd here. Even after receiving a request from Forbes, Netflix referred to Cindy Holland's statement, which is....lacking finality?

But not joining the tinfoil-hatters. Nope. The OA is gone. For now. Maybe."
Once Upon a Time,"Nobody cared about Santa Clarita Diet, one of the more creative and consistently funny netflix shows."
Once Upon a Time,"I'd cancel Netflix if my wife didn't watch some shows on there.
The platform has been going down hill for a while now.

The OA was one of the most unique shows I've ever seen and I am not surprised at all that Netflix cancelled it. That seems to be their MO these days."
Once Upon a Time,"I like the show but let's be real, the time between season 1 and 2 was unheard of (Part 1 came out in December 2016 and part 2 came out in March 2019) in any format except for shows that have had revivals and it hadn't earned the audience or the money that Stranger Things had to justify another long production before they could push a new season.

While i do think there is a major issue with Netflix cancelling their original programming (which is going to be dangerous for them considering they're going to lose a large portion of their licensed library sooner rather than later) i don't think The OA is the hill to die on when there is justifiable reasons for cancellation."
Once Upon a Time,"Maybe semantics, but didn't Netflix already give the show and its creators ""a chance"" by buying and releasing it?"
Once Upon a Time,Wasn't a huge fan of The OA but it seemed good enough to justify finishing up the story. It was better than a lot of the cringy comedy specials (often by popular actors or whatever who are shitty standup acts).
Once Upon a Time,How is this show?
Once Upon a Time,"I think the main point here is that the creators and writers would have approached the entire series differently if they knew they were only getting 2 seasons. The plan was to tell this story over 5 seasons and there's no way that Netflix was unaware of that when they agreed to make the show.

A fair compromise would have been to tell them during the making of the second season that they would only have three seasons to tell their story. ""Seasons"" of tv shows are shorter than ever and people are gonna stop making ambitious shows if they think they're only gonna get 16-20 episodes."
Once Upon a Time,"Business acts like business, people go ballistic."
Once Upon a Time,The show hasn't really been canceled. We are all now part of the show.
Once Upon a Time,"netflix is trying so hard to the be the next generation bargain bin...

this is what happens when you run your company solely on statistics and forget about the art."
Once Upon a Time,"I'm not a religious person, but I will be praying for the safety of future Altered Carbon seasons..."
Once Upon a Time,Idk if I agree with that sentiment even though I wish OA wasn‚Äôt cancelled. Russian Doll for example is fucking whack and beautiful and fantastic and definitely is not in the wheelhouse of a normal cable company
Once Upon a Time,"Or maybe when it turns out people don't like a show that much, it doesn't make sense to continue making it.

Being willing to axe shows that don't work is a critical part of the shotgun method of giving a wide spectrum of ideas a chance. 

If they don't catch on, you have to stop making them, as continuing to produce hundreds of shows so long as anyone at all wants to see them is a surefire way to go out of business. 

They either make a lot of shows and cancel the ones that don't work, or they make fewer shows to begin with and give them a longer chance. Producing a lot of shows and giving them all a long chance doesn't make sense."
Once Upon a Time,"I've never seen The OA but I've felt this trend, not just for Netflix but among most of the streamers. Streaming used to be an upstart industry taking risks and building up the few original shows they had but now it's big business with many originals in the portfolio and they have to make bottom line decisions the way big businesses do. I still want that happy middle ground where they're big enough to put out cool stuff but not so the big they'll cancel it if it isn't an overnight hit. Like Tom Waits... he's been famous for decades but never a megastar. I want the Tom Waits of streaming services."
Once Upon a Time,You either die a hero or live long enough to become Viacom.
Babel,Alara was my favorite character she's so cute 
Babel,[deleted]
Babel,"The Orville still hasn't figure out what it wants to be. I am OK with campy scifi comedy. I am OK with family drama where limbs get almost cut off by a sadist. 

But mixing both on the same show just means that the it has no defined vibe and is all over the place.  "
Babel,"Holy shit, I thought this was supposed to be a comedy. "
Babel,"I was just happy to see Yaphit.

Norm as the blob always makes me laugh."
Babel,"I want to like this show. I keep failing.

In this latest episode, we're on a new planet watching family dynamics. **Wouldn't it be great if there was some cultural aspect or *anything* that made the family *at least one iota* different from humans on Earth in 2019?**"
Babel,"They really need some over arching nemesis or like a 'goal' in the background like with the others (voyager being my fav).

Aside from that, good episode but as with the other 2, something feels off about this season - lot more loopholes and now with this episode's ending.. hell, they've yet to capitalize on that black dude who was promoted last season - now he just kinda hangs out with everyone whenever he's needed but the banter is gone.. well I just hope these aren't bad signs.

It's still super good, so I hope I'm just being picky.  It still felt really weird that last season they were like replicating pot brownies, banging dudes that blow up blue goo (even Seth getting into it like whatevers), and this season they're being puritan about masturbation (episode 2)?  "
Babel,Fantastic episode.  I enjoyed the second episode but was less than enthused with the premier episode.  This episode made me very excited for the rest of the season.  
Babel,Orville is more Star Trek than Star Trek these days. 
Babel,It has the same problem it always has. The absolute juvenile idea about sex and women(girls). Why would she not be respected as the security chief if she is without super strength? Because she will be just a girl? Last year there were jokes about guys can't handle it because she was stronger than them. 
Babel,The first two were not really on mark. This one really is OK. It's just about viewing order.
Babel,I think it works great as it is.
Babel,"There was complaint last season about Fox's marketing of the show, I wouldn't know how to market it either, it's all over the place. "
Babel,It's a good episode if you've seen it
Babel,I think marketing screwed that pooch
Babel,Patrick Warburton was funny
Babel,"> They really need some over arching nemesis or like a 'goal' in the background like with the others

Oh god Voyager. Anyway, The Orville follows TOS and ST:TNG where the goal, as it is quoted time and again:

>Space: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no one has gone before. 

They do have a goal, it's just nebulous but that's half the campy fun. If you want a goal go watch ST:D where the goal every episode is to see how JJ Abrams they can get."
Babel,It's hit and miss with them but this one was pure ST in it's best form.
Babel,"Easy to be, when Orville blatantly steals everything. Technology, ship/interior designs, character stereotypes, plots, overall setting... There's not a single original idea."
Babel,"What they need is a big strong Klingon as security chief, so he can get his ass kicked every episode."
Babel,ST TNG did the same thing too but the fact that she was in a wheelchair and saves the day despite gravity proves your opinion moot.
Babel,"Glad someone likes it. The show needs more people like you, because as of right now, their ratings have collapsed."
Babel,"I have seen it and was not impressed. Hated the ""dude"" replacement security officer. hated the cliche ridden ""go back home and make daddy proud"" story line. 

&#x200B;

The Orville could be a good show if it did not try to mix Star Trek with GalaxyQuest/Family Guy and instead picked one side and stuck to it. Right now it is all over the place and excels at nothing.   "
Babel,Next Generation with FAS
Babel,"Hopefully they start to refine the show.  I really enjoy The Orville, but it's not a good thing if your audience never knows what to expect.  The Bortus porn episode, while funny at times, was just so jarring, wasn't expecting that.  When you watch Game of Thrones you get Game of Thrones, it doesn't turn into Benny Hill halfway through an episode."
Babel,Dude wanted to do a Trek show but Paramount said no. So he did his own. McFarlane is a huge Trekkie. 
Babel,"I mean, alll star trek series blatently 'stole' everything from each other...."
Babel,Wasn‚Äôt that DS9?
Babel,"I don't know what you are referring to. But even if TNG held sexist standard thirty years ago still doesn't make it any better in 2018. 

She saves the day, as any plot on auto pilot will do. How does that address the casual sexist silliest?"
Babel,Better than DISCO
Babel,"Established lore and canon in the same universe, is not stealing from each other."
Babel,Sexist? I said wheelchair/handicap/gravity/science.
Babel,"If that is your benchmark, sure. "
Babel,Why
Babel,Are you being serious right now? I find it hard to believe you would ask why its not stealing when they are in the same universe. Would you say 2 movies that take place in WW2 were stealing from each other?
Babel,The argument is that the Orville's use of Trek items as 'stealing' affects the quality just as much as DS9 stealing everything from TNG
Babel,"What exactly did they ""steal"" though? It's the same universe. How can it be stealing?"
The War of the Worlds,I just watched the BBC Mammoth version.  I would not recommend it at all.  Really disappointing.
The War of the Worlds,"I‚Äôm on episode 5 of the Fox one right now. I have to imagine it was supposed to be it‚Äôs own thing, but then the studio decided to renamed it to War of the Worlds to make it sell better. Besides the fact that they feature aliens, there is basically nothing similar about the original and this version. No tripods, no red weed, no squid aliens, etc. 

That said, I think it is pretty fantastic if you judge it as it‚Äôs own alien invasion story, and it is also super engrossing. Additionally it has some fantastic effects and production design, especially in the first episode. I strongly recommend it as long as you go in not expecting War of the Worlds."
The War of the Worlds,[deleted]
The War of the Worlds,"I was excited for the Mammoth adaptation since it is actually set around the actual historical period (instead of modernized). Unfortunately, I was disappointed overall."
The War of the Worlds,Just watched episode 3 of the BBC one. I was so confused.  It‚Äôs pretty much the same as episode 2.
The War of the Worlds,The BBC version isnt very good. It's 3 hours of my life I'll never get back.
The War of the Worlds,"I need to see the BBC version, it finished last week but I've been trying to catch up with Britannia II."
The War of the Worlds,The BBC version turned a great novel into a boring slog. A shame because I was looking forward to it
The War of the Worlds,"I watched the first two episodes of the BBC series and gave up, zero interest in finding out what happens to the characters and reading comments here it seems the final episode is shite anyway. There were many faults but the one that pissed me off the most is one which the BBC are guilty of way too often, the characters are bland and could be played by cardboard cutouts with the same effect."
The War of the Worlds,The French one with Gabriel byrne is not bad from the few episodes i watched. I lost interest in the bbc one halfway through the second episode.
The War of the Worlds,Is the Fox one available in English or with English subtitles anywhere? I'd really like to watch it but don't know how.
The War of the Worlds,Epix War of the Worlds is plainly terrible. Don‚Äôt waste a minute on it. Gabriel Byrne must‚Äôve needed the money desperately.
The War of the Worlds,"I am sure it is terrible as all the live adaptations are. 

The 1938 Radio Broadcast is excellent. If you get a chance give it a listen"
The War of the Worlds,"Ah man I was about to start. 

Is it not even worth it as background noise? I've been looking forward to this for a year."
The War of the Worlds,"I‚Äôve only watched the first few episodes of the French one and thought it was pretty good. The acting could have been a bit better. I am not in any rush to finish the season though, one episode every now and then is enough."
The War of the Worlds,Currently watching it now. It's pretty brutal
The War of the Worlds,"Wait, where?

I can't see it in the schedules for the next week on Fox, plus it's not on catch-up."
The War of the Worlds,"I completely disagree! This is a really powerful and compelling series. The characters are authentic, the aliens are suitably terrifying (if mysterious), and I'm completely sucked in to the various storylines. It's definitely worth the watch!"
The War of the Worlds,It‚Äôs only 3 hours.  Give it a shot.
The War of the Worlds,I loved the first two episodes. Third is.. not good. I‚Äôd recommend it overall though.
The War of the Worlds,"That's funny because i remember before it came out people thought the modern one would be bad and the bbc one would be good. Look at how the turntables,lol"
The War of the Worlds,"On paper Gabriel Byrne and Elizabeth McGovern isn't a bad duo to lead your cast. Is the acting issue with them, or the others?"
The War of the Worlds,It really doesn‚Äôt pull any punches. It is genuinely apocalyptic and dark in ways that few shows are able to capture.
The War of the Worlds,[deleted]
The War of the Worlds,"Eh, I agree with OP. The first episode was pretty good but it got boring fast in the ones that followed. None of the characters had any personality whatsoever and the story immediately ran aground on boring storylines. Show me an actual war of the worlds, not hours of miserable characters wandering desolate streets."
The War of the Worlds,"I think if you take out one character, it'll make it better for me."
The War of the Worlds,Does it just kind of fall apart?
The War of the Worlds,"Ah, yeah, just checked Wikipedia and it seems the French broadcast ended in late November, so that makes a lot of sense.

Thanks for the info, though, I'll keep an eye out for when it starts."
The War of the Worlds,"hahaha, it's a matter of taste then. i like my alien invasion / end of the world stories nice and bleak. that's not to say that the original ""independence day"" wasn't a great shoot-em-up, but the more the stories feel like documentaries the more attuned i am. to each their own!"
The War of the Worlds,"that's fair. with 2 major groups, multiple threads, and multiple characters per thread, it is a big group for compact storytelling purposes."
The War of the Worlds,More like it becomes apparent they didn‚Äôt really know where the fuck they were going with it and it really shows lmao
The War of the Worlds,"...They have a 120 year old book to follow and they didn't know where to go?

How fucked up is the finale? Did they just tank the story?"
The War of the Worlds,They messed about with the book significantly.
The War of the Worlds,"The miniseries follows the main events of the novel but from the points of view of several ""new"" characters.  It's quite imaginative but the budget limitations are obvious and distracting and the third episode spins off into a sort of pointless tangent."
The War of the Worlds,"Well they threw the whole god damn book out the window, lmao."
The War of the Worlds,I saw the BBC version and was a bit disappointed.  It's the first screen version of the story to be set in the same period as the original novel (yay!) but the budget limitations were obvious and distracting and the final episode went off on a bizarre tangent.
The War of the Worlds,"We watched three part BBC one as it aired here last month. 

I found the first episode really good, a solid set up with interesting characters and I was excited to see what happened next. Then it sort of all fell down and by the end, it had lost all the goodwill it originally earnt.

I think the original (Edwardian?) setting in ep 1 was more interesting than the what followed and Robert Carlyle was wasted"
The War of the Worlds,"I watched the French co-production (I think it‚Äôs the one with Fox) a while ago, it was pretty good. Not great but good entertainment I‚Äôd say."
The War of the Worlds,"i watched the Fox/Canal+ version and LOVED it!!  it's definitely a very loose adaptation of the Wells story.  it's actually very much a series version of the BLACK MIRROR episode ""Metalhead"" (with those relentless, vicious robot dog things) from season 4...

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5710984/?ref_=ttep_ep5

i loved the music, the international cast, the tone/atmosphere, the alien robot dog things are wonderfully freaky as well. i'm looking forward to season 2! 

i've watched the first episode & part of the 2nd episode of the BBC version and just wasn't all that into it. i will finish it up at some point. one"
The War of the Worlds,[deleted]
The War of the Worlds,Both are not that good sadly.
The War of the Worlds,There was some discussion about this [last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/e7ymsx/2019s_war_of_the_worlds_and_the_war_of_the_worlds/) if you're interested. I plan to check out the Fox/Canal+ one soon. I won't be watching the BBC period version.
The War of the Worlds,That's how I discover this. The tvdb have only.
The War of the Worlds,There's a War of the Worlds show and it's on season 3?
The War of the Worlds,wait what?  I thought it ended with season 2.  story was wrapped up wasn't it?
The War of the Worlds,"I thought the first season was alright. Got an Epix trial to watch Get Shorty, so I haven't seen it since then..."
The War of the Worlds,"Is this actually Sci Fi, or more of a lower budget drama set in a Sci Fi universe? Because it blows my mind I haven't heard about this being 3 seasons until now!?"
The War of the Worlds,Do we ever see the Aliens?
The War of the Worlds,"First I've heard of this show and the trailer leaves me wondering what it's about, besides the obvious title."
The War of the Worlds,Wonder if Daisy shows up or if she was too busy Crawdaddin
The War of the Worlds,I like the multi language that this show sometimes have. Did not expect any more seasons but this is welcome.
The War of the Worlds,"Season 2 was so very disappointing.

Aliens = humans is the most laziest writing. Probably low budget issues."
The War of the Worlds,What do the aliens look like?
The War of the Worlds,Way too many subtitles in this show.
The War of the Worlds,"I watched season 3 first 2 episodes  . It's still slow, with lots and lots of dialogues and little or no action, but some scenes make you jump. The plot is interesting, but it doesn't make much sense. It goes completely in a new direction, even if it remains consistent with the first two seasons. How Catherine Durand manages to travel in time or in another dimension (it is not clear if she is one or the other or if a mixture of the two) is laughable, yes! Almost comic. A  minor character from the first season returns with more screen time, some of the other main and secondary characters haven't shown up yet, and some two-sentence characters also return."
The War of the Worlds,"Yes, it is French-British show. It is a coproduction between Canal+ and Fox.

Epix is just the streaming service who acquired the rights to stream the show in the US."
The War of the Worlds,I thought it got cancelled. I watched the first season and it‚Äôs okay.
The War of the Worlds,"The show is streaming on Epix, a small service, so not many people are aware of the show. 

I've only found out about 'War of the Worlds' because of Gabriel Byrne is playing a major part in the show."
The War of the Worlds,It is a steaming pile of dogshit.
The War of the Worlds,"The problem was that multiple shows with the same name launched around the same time.

There is also a pretty decent tv show from the BBC called The war of the worlds.

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8001226/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_7"
The War of the Worlds,"> story was wrapped up wasn't it?

Yeah, I also thought it was a series finale with the way they end it. 

They did, however, leave some open threads, >!Emily's visions of dead people, the ""aliens"" who followed Bill to the new timeline!<, which I think will be the focus of the 3rd season."
The War of the Worlds,Season 1 is very slow. Season 2 picks up some. I think it's OK. My wife really likes it.
The War of the Worlds,Yes.
The War of the Worlds,"humans.

:(

boring."
The War of the Worlds,I'm just watching the first season. Catherine is not a minor character in the first season lol.
The War of the Worlds,So it's on Fox?
The War of the Worlds,There were two series that came out around the same time. One was set in the Victorian era and was ended.
The War of the Worlds,Yeah I‚Äôve started S3 and you are correct this is the focus.
The War of the Worlds,"Quite enjoyed S1.

S2 picked up but the aliens as humans seemed lazy and destroyed my interest."
The War of the Worlds,What do they look like?
The War of the Worlds,I wasn't referring to her. LOLOLOL
The War of the Worlds,"It's on Disney+ 

(in some regions)"
The War of the Worlds,>!They are humans from the future!<
The War of the Worlds,Yikes. Like right fucking yikes.
The War of the Worlds,My buddy raves about this show. Gonna take a plunge now that I know three seasons are a given.
The War of the Worlds,Not related (but kind of) the War of the Worlds show from the late 80s is on Youtube.  Its a worth a look as well for the sheer level of strangeness.
The War of the Worlds,"Is this a sign for me to watch?  

It's the fifth time I've seen something about this show this week alone..."
The War of the Worlds,"I'd rather the Rafe Spall and Eleanor Tomlinson one, but then again it wasn't that good either. Alan Moore did it best"
The War of the Worlds,I was fairly impressed with the first season
The War of the Worlds,I watched Seasons 1 and 2 but fear they will stretch it out till we are totally bored. Season 1 was better than 2...
The War of the Worlds,If it is the one with Gabriel Byrne and  Elizabeth McGovern it is utter dogshit....
The War of the Worlds,Watched the first episode of Season 3 yesterday and am looking forward to seeing if they can stick the landing this season.
The War of the Worlds,"I've been watching the series the past couple weeks and loving it. I'm halfway through season 2. So far I like season 1 better, but I can't wait to see where its going. I know the third season is airing now, have the producers said how long seasons they are planning?"
The War of the Worlds,"Ooh, cheers. Gonna check it out!"
The War of the Worlds,"Oh shit.  I loved that show back in the day.  I know absolutely no one who remembered that show, which us ironic considering the premise of it"
The War of the Worlds,"I enjoyed how in S02 we got a good look at a modern society months after the world basically ended. I also liked the different story lines and ways of story telling (road trip across Europe, disjointed in time through found footage on a phone in the university)."
The War of the Worlds,"It‚Äôs incredible the amount of actors they had in the series that was either well known or have become well known over the years. 

The same could be said for the pacific, but with Band of brothers it‚Äôs way more."
The War of the Worlds,Lt. Spears when he ran back.
The War of the Worlds,Ron Livingston was fucking golden
The War of the Worlds,My Great Uncle Brad Freeman is the last living enlisted member of the Band of Brothers. [He was just honored by the National WWII Museum](https://usveteransmagazine.com/2022/03/museum-honors-surviving-members-band-brothers/).
The War of the Worlds,I think people sleep on how good Donnie Wahlberg was in this.
The War of the Worlds,"While Michael Fassbender was definitely in it his role was pretty minimal and he basically disappears after the first episode. I don't think you see him again until episode 7. 

If anything James McAvoy has a much more memorable appearance in his only episode.

Still my favorite miniseries ever. I think only Chernobyl comes close."
The War of the Worlds,"Welp, guess I'm rewatching Band of Brothers now."
The War of the Worlds,[deleted]
The War of the Worlds,"This miniseries more than anything else I‚Äôve watched captures so well that sense of marching through hell, witnessing so much horror and then it‚Äôs all over and what now? Sell insurance I guess. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

What a mindfuck that transition must be."
The War of the Worlds,">Following the brigade known as ""The Easy Company""

There is so, so much wrong with that phrase."
The War of the Worlds,"I watch Band of Brothers around every Christmas. One of my favorite series, that and The Sopranos."
The War of the Worlds,Can‚Äôt wait to see if they strike gold again with ‚Äúmaster of the air‚Äù
The War of the Worlds,Awesome series‚Ä¶The Pacific was amazing as well. Generation Kill comes in third for me.
The War of the Worlds,David Schwimmer acted his ass off.
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,I always thought it was funny that backwards ass Pawnee had a thriving gay bar.
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,Greetings from The Snakehole Lounge!
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"In my small town young people hung out at the Waffle House or just in grocery store parking lots because the bars all had a gross, older alcoholics vibe."
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,Maybe you just don't get invited to the good parties.
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"So you're telling me that not every female in Letterkenny, Ontario, is a slim tall attractive woman who wears short shorts in mid winter?"
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"My first night living in a classic American small town after leaving The City was basically exactly that though.

Old timey but fairly nice bar. Lots of wood. Great bands. Attractive people dancing. I was actually staying at the house of the good looking female bartender that knew all the local dramas.

Looking back now, it's kinda funny."
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"It‚Äôs not that they haven‚Äôt been outside of LA, it‚Äôs that the reality of small town life isn‚Äôt anything anyone wants to watch.


Why do people always assume in accuracies are unintentional?"
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,good thing tv is not real and a local watering hole where the who‚Äôs who of the small town hangs out is a convenient story setup
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"You bring back fond memories of the one evening I spent in Arkadelphia, West Virginia.  The fond part is the fact that it was only one night, and then we escaped."
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,The young people usually move away before they're 21 here
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"I always assume those kinds of trendy small towns are on the west coast. They're definitely not here in the south lol

I think Resident Alien is a good example of this. A little mountain town with a small population where everyone is well-educated and dresses nice. I'd love to live in a place like that if they actually exist."
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,I get your point but‚Ä¶would you really want to watch a show that sticks closely to real life in a small town?
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"I live in rural Midwest town and we have two bars.

One is small and occupied/kept afloat by the same 10 guys who are there (almost) every night. They even have holiday parties at the bar with just those guys and their wives/families. I went there once and it was like walking into a slightly less depressing Moe‚Äôs Tavern.

The other bar is the ‚Äúyounger‚Äù bar where generally people in their 20s go. There is a dance floor but no one ever dancing. No live music, but a juke box that people rarely use. And a couple pool tables. And always, always full of smoke. They really only open on Friday‚Äôs and Saturday‚Äôs because it‚Äôs the only time they get any business. It only stays open because it‚Äôs connected to and owned by a family that also owns a successful restaurant in town."
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,I actually stayed a couple of nights in a small town whilst travelling through Texas. They had a bar which was pretty much in a strip mall but it was ace. The decor was a bit dated but they had duelling pianos and line dancing and I went a couple of nights and it was bouncing
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,My favorite thing is those Hallmark movies where a single woman runs a tiny antique shop in a small town and somehow earns enough to drive an Escalade and own a five-bedroom home on 10 acres.
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,Why do people think that if something isn't exactly like they've experienced then it means it's not true or realistic
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"I‚Äôll clue you in on something‚Ä¶

Real life is shitty and doesn‚Äôt look, sound, or feel like most things on TV. They‚Äôre selling the audience an escapist fantasy where they can see pretty people do awesome, stupid, interesting, dramatic, cliched things. 

Most people don‚Äôt want to watch sort-of-6-but-small-town-solid-8 people make awkward conversation at a sticky bar leading to depressed, shitty choices."
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"You often need a way for various characters in shows to interact in a natural way. The small town bar trope exists because it‚Äôs cheaper and easier to have one set of a central location where all your characters could believably interact with one another and have both private and public conversations. 

A bar allows you to have characters share information with one another/the audience that they normally wouldn‚Äôt/shouldn‚Äôt disclose. It allows you to use many various tropes that will further the plot easily. Like [‚ÄúDrowning My Sorrows,‚Äù](https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Drowning_My_Sorrows) [‚ÄúIn Vino Veritas,‚Äù](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InVinoVeritas) and many more. 

Generally in a small town in the USA/Canada you have a market and some stores, a local diner/restaurant (along with some chains), a movie theater, schools, a bar (or bars), some type of amphitheater or assembly hall, churches, city hall, etc‚Ä¶ A bar is the single location that works best where ALL your characters could have an excuse to be at during various times and is a location where you can have ‚Äúsecret‚Äù conversations, private conversations, and public discussions/proclamations/speeches with all your characters. 

A school or church or most anywhere else, wouldn‚Äôt make sense for [a drifter](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDrifter) to make a natural appearance and espouse dialog that furthers the plot. 

There is also usually a TV in the bar which allows you to further the plot and bring news from outside of the town via [‚ÄúCoincidental Broadcast.‚Äù](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoincidentalBroadcast)

You also get to use the [‚ÄúRecovered Addict‚Äù](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecoveredAddict) and  [‚ÄúOff The Wagon‚Äù](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheWagon) tropes to enable [‚ÄúCharacter Derailment‚Äù](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDerailment) and other tropes and divulge to the audience some tragic backstory or important plot details. 

The bar is usually used as a window into the outside world and way to get information from the rest of the world to the townspeople."
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"If it's what you're looking for, 'Horace and Pete' is essentially a direct response to this trope. Enjoy."
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"This really depends on where you are. If you have a college near by? Yes, I see that all the time. Tourist area that has a solid local population? Yep. Oilfields or quick cash towns? You betcha..."
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"It always baffled me when there'd be a nightclub where all the teens went, as if an underage hangout would have top notch bands/djs. Think Buffy or Save the Last Dance. Or Smallville, but I believe that one was mostly a hip coffee shop"
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,Just watched The Peripheral tonight. I think they do a decent job of showing a small town bar replete with pine and shitty tvs.
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"I, too, watch Virgin River"
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"The small town I'm from didn't have jack shit when I lived there. Just the one rough biker bar. About ten years after I left they got a night club. It didn't have live music, but it played rock and country pop music. And it was packed. Like a damn high school reunion, but for them it was just Friday night. It's where everyone went to hook up and get laid. It was the only party place in town, so you never had to wonder where everyone was. And everyone just seemed to end up going home with everyone else eventually. If I had stayed there a month, I could have knocked boots with every girl I went to high school with that wasn't married."
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,I agree but Twin Peaks has all of those things and it's brilliant.
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"I don't know how to tell you this, but TV isn't real life and sometimes creative liberties have to be taken for storytelling/worldbuilding purposes."
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"The local coffee shop has ten times the average daily traffic as both of the local bars... and this ""town"" has two bars, one coffee shop, one gas station, and a pizza joint that's open about two days a week to launder drug money. 

That's it. The bar that does food gets ten times as much dinner traffic as they do bar traffic."
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"It's not a TV show about an average place, it's a TV show about an extraordinary place; That's why there's a show about it. 

That's the way I look at it at least."
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"[And yet, the bar from New Vegas' prologue exists, in the middle of nowhere, is not a tourist spot (well, maybe a little), and is straight up from a Hollywood movie.](https://youtu.be/89sOyZdtVA0?t=2960)

I really don't know what to do with this. BUT it just hit me why being a biker in Nevada is so fucking cool.

And here I am, in Poland, Europe, where every square meter is the same. Everything mixed together for hundreds of years, all in the same, mid climate... boooring. I don't admire your electric grid Texas, but... you attract me."
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,[deleted]
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"I feel like the Vampire Diaries was notorious for this. Small town but they would not only have a packed restaurant/bar, but full on balls with evening gowns at some fancy estate. Whole town would be there."
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"While I enjoyed Schitt's Creek, it annoys me that it's clear no one affiliated with that show has ever been to a small town."
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,My Ex grew up on an island of 800 people off of north Wisconsin‚Ä¶.nah it be‚Äôs like that sometimes.
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,Haha- so true!
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,I've seen this in multiple small towns around the country. Sorry yours doesn't.....
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"When our bar has live music it's a super heavy metal cover band, cause I live in the midwest and apparently that's the music everyone wants to hear. No one dances except for 2 or 3 really drunk women who are in leather and fringes. If you can't take the sound level, you hang out in the parking lot."
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"Blues legend boxcar Charlie plays there every night and never leaves, even though he could be touring the world with a record contract"
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"""New to The Yabba?"""
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,The bar in Banshee was pretty slow.
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,Most bars are mostly males and most of the women in the bars if they are there are older women.  But the media has always created this element of harmony in whatever set is being shown in the tv show.
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"They usually forget the impoverished white families, meth addicts, and lack of jobs and hospitals."
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,a thriving gay bar plus a night club that is seemingly full or at least bustling on work nights
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"The show shows Pawnee as 60,000 to 80,000 people not the most rural-ness place and even smaller somewhat ass backwords towns can have that kind of 
dichotomy. 

* Rural Decorah, Iowa with a population 8,000 of puts gay pride flags up during pride month and yet has ""Club 45"" a bar named for Trump 's presidency. It has a liberal arts college in town

* Suburban/rural Waverly, Iowa with 10,000 people voted for Trump in 2020 yet has city owned power/water and gigabit internet. Also, was the city owned power company was the first utility in the Midwest to have a wind turbine. The the smaller liberal arts college in town has a drag show and this year went off with zero protests. 

* Cedar Falls, Iowa(40,000) and Waterloo, Iowa(60,000) metro which Waverly exists in is has a two day Pridefest every year. 

* one of the years I worked at a Boy Scout camp in Eastern Iowa had a camp staff that was, for those under 30, 27% LGBT: 3 Bi gals, 2 gay guys, 4 bi guys, and 2 who have started their transitioning from guys to gals."
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,Just stay away from the owners crazy daughter Janet.
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"Jesus I remember how often we used to just go to Walmart. We were restless and needed to go somewhere but had nowhere to go because we were 16 and the only other place open was the casino.

I remember one night we swore to God we weren't going to go to Walmart and we ended up going to a Walmart in another town. It's one of my favorite memories."
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"I always felt like they came close to getting the small town bar right..  They over exaggerate the attractiveness of the few women in town but the people there are actually pretty average and the slim pickings are accurate.  

Except for the hockey players, for whom there‚Äôs just far too many hockey groupies for a small town."
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,Did you live in a Netflix show set in the rural West but actually filmed in Canada
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,It's also because they need to have a small number of sets. That's why everyone is always hanging out in the same places. Keeps the budget lower.
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,is that a real place?
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,Didn't they have a fancy French restaurant in that show?
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"People on this subreddit watch TV solely so that
they can see the least interesting aspects of their lives faithfully recreated on screen."
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"Yes, this is the rural midwest town that I am quite familiar with indeed"
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"Most of these places are kept open by the illegal high stakes poker game that starts after midnight and ends as the sun comes up. You have to be invited, otherwise you will never know that it occurs. Often, local officials make up most of the players. This is the real Midwestern small town."
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,And the antique store is not filled with junk.
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,Saddest show I‚Äôve ever seen.
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,This terrifies me. I prefer the city where I may hang out with a stranger and then never see them again.
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"Yes - but Twin Peaks is 100% ""David Lynch has never left LA"" - it's supposed to have a population of 50k people and still be a ""small town"" - 50k people would make it the third largest city in Washington that's not a suburb of Seattle, Spokane or Vancouver."
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"The sketchy dive bar/human trafficking hot spot owned by criminals and sitting on a random highway outside of Twin Peaks that somehow managed to book Moby, Eddie Vedder, and Nine Inch Nails, among others."
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"Are you saying I made a bad decision relying on the local population to purchase organic goat cheese and artisanal body milks from the boutique apothecary I established!?!

I will never financially recover from this."
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,Or they just don't want to make the show worse for the sake of making it small town accurate?
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"Honestly though, I felt Schitt‚Äôs Creek really did show small town life somewhat accurate. The whole concept of having one restaurant where everyone eats, few shopping locations, gossipy small-town politics and having to drive half an hour plus to anywhere is pretty accurate. Now I do think that Schitt‚Äôs Creek wasn‚Äôt accurate in showing a great number of hip, attractive twenty-somethings because that was definitely not my experience in a small town."
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"Laid back, chill place"
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,Doesn't Pawnee have like 70k people? That's not a big city but it's above what I'd consider a small town.
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,And a jazz club.
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,I grew up in a small tourist town we would sit in one specific parking spot in kfc outside the car. Because the tourists basically never went to the kfc
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"No, it was just Silverton, Oregon."
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"Yes.  It‚Äôs in the panhandle.  Draw a straight line from NYC to Dayton, Ohio, and it goes through Arkadelphia, so my friend who was planning the trip thought it would be a good place to stop for the night."
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"And another thing, how come Breaking Bad never had an episode where Jesse just scrolled on Reddit for 45 minutes!!!"
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"I just think it's weird how people in cities who have no understanding about what life in small towns is like, and then they get jobs as writers that shape what what other people in cities will think small towns are like who will then get jobs as writers and perpetuate the cycle indefinitely."
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,And the store is doing well enough that she can employ her sassy best friend Jodi as a full-time cashier.
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"It is a long slow dirge of hopelessness and compromised dreams and an examination of the damage we do to each other to compromise them.

Honestly though, Laurie Metcalf's monologue was completely astounding and made me appreciate her as an actress - just incredible stuff."
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"I couldn't do that even in a city. Always ran into the same people. Though, if you drink enough, it seems like you are meeting them for the first time."
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"That wasn't his fault, he and Mark Frost wanted 5000 people in Twin Peaks. The network demanded more for some reason.

So they added an extra digit to the sign...and then continued to write it like a town of 5000 people anyway. The sheriff's department is *4* people in the original show."
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"You dummy, you're supposed to market those towards the tourists!"
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"[Great drinks, too!](https://i.gifer.com/NTil.gif)"
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,If 70k is small town I‚Äôm a velociraptor
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,I think the jazz club was actually in eagleton
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,What would you do? Just hang in the parking lot?
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"So, kinda both at once."
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"Might be difference in expectations.  Some people think 10,000 is small town, but to others it's more like 500-2000.  A town with 10k (like Silverton) is usually able to have a bit better bar these days than the small ones, which often can barely even operate."
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,What
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,He knowingly planned a stop in a place called Arkadelphia?
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,I don't feel like Jesse is the type to go on reddit. Maybe Badger. Who then forwards the content in the group chat.
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,He was busy eating Cheetos and masturbating all day.
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,You‚Äôre missing they key point: nobody wants to watch a show set in a real small town. They‚Äôre boring.
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,Lots of the people in cities grew up in small towns. It isn't like they forget it all when they move
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,Just how horrible they all were. Every single one. Just like the rest of us. It never received the attention or praise it deserved. Louis was at his peak.
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,I'm sorry about the time you've had to spend with Chris Pratt.
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,Yeah sometimes someone had a guitar or some booze.
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"Insert that ""finger up.... finger down"" guy here."
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"Silverton is also a particularly nice and ""hip"" little town."
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,Yeah I lean more toward 2000ish
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,My mistake:  It was actually Triadelphia.  Not sure how I confused them ‚Äî Arkadelphia is in Arkansas.  Never been there.
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"This feels like the view of someone who has managed to stay far away from local politics.

The beauty of small towns is that everybody who anybody know everyone else. Relationships are closer and more personal. Rumors spread like wildfire and you live and die by your reputation.

Every small town is different with its own story. The small number of people also means that there are less checks on corruption. If you only have a few cops and city council that doesn't give a shit and is often friends with those few officers, there's zero accountability.

I lived in a town where the only library was closed down by the county, and the people fought to reopen it by creating a special taxing district. You would not believe the amount of betrayals, backstabbing, sabotage and personal drama that arose from a fight for a fucking library, with warring interests from the city, the people, the county and an oil company trying to use the conflict to gain support for building their pipeline.

Small towns are boring to live in because there's nothing to do. But they're great to tell stories for that same exact reason since it makes the town is much more closely connected. There are fewer locations people spend time in which means there's more opportunity for them to meetup naturally, even if those meetups aren't happening in the cliche bar every lazy writer falls back on."
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,Some did. Not the majority though. And for not forgetting things from their childhood when they grow up... the number of shows that have terribly written children makes me question if these people have any idea what it's like to be a child.
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"But where are you going to show all those people talking? Are you gonna spend a shit ton of money and develop six different sets to represent the living rooms of all the main characters?  

Because let me tell you, you‚Äôre going to get a note from production, asking if you can please create one common set they can be used over and over for different groups of people talking. Gee, what‚Äôs a place where different groups of people could be credibly congregating in different times on a regular basis?"
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"I mean, another comment mentioned that most of the young people there met up at the Waffle House. I figure any popular caf√© would work just as well. It's actually better as you can introduce a larger variety of characters. Anyone in a bar is, naturally, drinking. That means no one who doesn't drink alcohol would have reason to show up, teenagers can't come on, and parents aren't legally able to bring children.

If you need a set where any character can go, a bar is actually pretty limiting."
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,Nobody's going to use a trademarked brand if they don't have to.  Schitt's creek uses the local cafe for the common area. Good enough for you?
The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"I mean, one example of someone not following the clich√© doesn't make it less of a clich√©."

World on Fire,"I just learned about this shows existence and I'm going to give it a go soon, glad to see another season is coming."
World on Fire,"Absolutely love that show, can't wait for it"
World on Fire,"Alright! I can't wait to enjoy some more of this show, it was really great."
World on Fire,It's been a while since S1(2020).
World on Fire,"Finished watching. Lame characters. And how many times are Lois and Harry gonna meet up and argue? Lois it's your own damn fault harry didn't write you , if you would just said I love you too in episode 1, then boom! he would write to you and we could have avoided this whole moppy, woe is me thing both the characters have. Man, freaking retarded script, but I just kept going cause I had gotten into deep and thought this was a one off series"
World on Fire,"Me too, I thought they'd canceled it"
World on Fire,First season was surprisingly good but it was years ago. Glad to see that it‚Äôs moving forward.
World on Fire,i remember finishing season 1 and not realizing it wasn't a mini series and being pretty disappointed until i heard it was renewed. glad it's coming soon.
World on Fire,"YES YES YES, in 2019 this and watchmen were my Sunday shows and they were both soo good and even though I saw it was renewed there was no news as covid started and I just assumed it was quietly canceled. This is such good news, I need to do a rewatch immediately. Spectacular shown it had a dozen characters and I was invested in all of them. Great news on a shitty week."
World on Fire,"Alright! Glad to hear its finally coming back, the first season was so good.

Still it sounds like this guy is going to face the holocaust."
World on Fire,"Just watched S1 this week lol

Was pretty good actually, I‚Äôm down to see more"
World on Fire,[removed]
World on Fire,"I first saw him, and fell in love with his chiseled pecs/abs, on Runaways. Don‚Äôt kill me."
World on Fire,Covid happened of course; kind of problematic for any show with multi-national production.
World on Fire,"Like, why?"
World on Fire,It's a very well done drama that touches on themes that people relate to.
World on Fire,"Why is it that no matter what I search for on Netflix, the result is ""Squid Game""?"
World on Fire,"It released at the perfect time for a show like this. Huge amount of economic anxiety right now, nobody is exactly sure what the long term effects of the pandemic are gonna be but it's hard not to notice how much prices of almost everything are going up. A lot of people whether out of fear or greed or both are making risky YOLO bets with their money that they know could set them up for life or ruin them financially, look at the rise of crypto and meme stocks. So a show about people making the ultimate gamble that taps into peoples anxiety and hope and fear like this is bound to be compelling. Add to that that it's extremely well produced, drops on the biggest streaming platform globally, and is highly visual with uniquely recognisable costumes and set elements that lend themselves to memes and fanart and you got an obvious cultural phenomenon on your hands."
World on Fire,"Netflix's marketing sure says it does. I think a lot of it is just hype, popular yeah, but marketing in a slow news cycle probably overinflated everything about it"
World on Fire,"Korea is pretty cool these days, the actors are either pretty great or pretty hot, the aesthetics of the show are brilliant leading to it being so iconic so quick, the social commentary of the show is super relevant far beyond Korea's shores."
World on Fire,"It really explores the human condition and our relationship with others, money, and what kind of person people can become given those factors.  I loved the series.  Surface area it is entertaining but it has some deep undertones."
World on Fire,"It's not the next Avengers. I think we all can relate to battling people to the death in a sick game and then going back to the bunks under lockdown, as survivors of the toilet paper wars of 2020."
World on Fire,It's a life or death reality show combined with relatable and hatable characters with a prize that people really would try for just to try and get out of debt.
World on Fire,A lot of people like it. It‚Äôs decent. Fun premise.
World on Fire,[deleted]
World on Fire,"Red light, Green light and Marbles. 

Need I say more? It's right up there with the puppies in Chernobyl episode 4. 

I will never for these."
World on Fire,Because most of us are really poor and can relate?
World on Fire,[deleted]
World on Fire,"Which is weird, because Korea never had any shortages. While people in the US were killing each other for toilet paper, the korean supermarkets had mountains of the stuff in the middle of the aisles."
World on Fire,Thriller more like it. Not really horror. And yeah the main character wasn't supposed to be likeable at first... he grows....
World on Fire,"> the mc was a terrible person

Give him a chance. He's a terrible person but he's scarily relatable."
World on Fire,"The MC being a terrible person was a huge part of the plot, but the show definitely isn't for everyone. No judgment if you weren't able to get into it!"
World on Fire,Agreed. I don't know why people enjoy watching content like this.
World on Fire,"Just because you choose not to think about the television you watch doesn't mean the rest of us do.

Mentioning that the show has relatable themes is hardly going into any deep philosophy of life."
World on Fire,I highly recommend
World on Fire,"Oh it was a brilliant show, brilliant performances and fascinating character development all around and I especially loved its use of multiple perspectives to examine issues from so many places.

Plus I'll give them credit for also showing how the Germans suffered under the Nazi rule, as well as the places they occupied."
World on Fire,"Hey, they had me at Sean Bean. :D"
World on Fire,"Sorry I'm so late to this thread--I realize almost nobody will read my comment in a thread that's already 9 days old, but this is the only thread I could find at Reddit about this series, and I'm not sure my concern is worth starting a new thread over, but--

Has anyone else looked at the [IMDb User Reviews](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8001092/reviews) for this series? I am astonished at how many bad reviews there are: 29 out of 111 reviewers give it 1 star, the lowest possible rating. Most of the bad reviews were posted in Oct-Nov 2019, so they are probably British, definitely not American. (I don't know what other countries may have seen it.)

And the negative comments seem quite repetitive: they repeatedly bash the series for being ""PC,"" ""revisionist,"" ""woke,"" etc. Some openly criticize the inclusion of blacks, gays, and feminists in the story.

Maybe I'm just shocked at my first encounter with British conservatives."
World on Fire,"My mom gets super mad whenever they run adverts for this, it's amusing to watch."
World on Fire,"Just tried to watch this show, but that weird lighting/video quality thing that some British TV shows have just ruined it for me. It looks fake or low budget or something. My husband agrees, yet I can‚Äôt find anything anywhere that mentions this (to me) huge difference. Downtown Abbey didn‚Äôt have this issue, so I‚Äôm not really sure what‚Äôs up. I do know that when the new HD TVs began coming out, sometimes we‚Äôd go to someone‚Äôs house and all of the programs would look like this! We figured out it was because they were on a special setting that makes it easier to watch sports (but to me, ruins every other thing that you‚Äôd watch). It‚Äôs easy to change the setting, so we do, every time. Sometimes people have no idea what we are talking about."
World on Fire,"Just watched Episode 4.

So...British tanks in 1940 Poland, huh?

Also, Helen Hunt's plastic surgery is deeply distracting.  Hollywood certainly isn't fair to actresses of her age, but she looks like she's wearing a rubber mask."
World on Fire,"I feel a bit as if it‚Äôs WWII Light.  That‚Äôs ok for viewing now.  However, Helen Hunt‚Äôs hairdo is atrocious.  I can‚Äôt believe anyone would ever wear their hair this way, even in 1940.  It‚Äôs very distracting.  Actually, I think she is very badly miscast in this part, and is pretty bad in general.  The actress who plays Lois, Julia Brown, is mesmerizing."
World on Fire,"Now I'm wondering how likely it is that a person of color would be an officer, especially an officer in England commanding white people like Harry."
World on Fire,"It was very entertaining and well made. 

But it was written by people who had no real idea what society was like in England at that time. It made irritating viewing because few of the characters they inserted into that time would have existed and the injection of the sexual mores of the 21st century into the repressed 1940s made it risible and annoying in equal parts."
World on Fire,"Can you tell me if birds, other than chickens, can lay unfertilized eggs? Were they betting on when the egg would drop? That scene challenged my suspension of disbelief."
World on Fire,Can someone explain why kaisha and harry are so far apart on the hill???
World on Fire,Why did Frau Rossler commit suicide in episode 6?
World on Fire,Season 2 I hope in 2023. Really need to know if Kasia and Harry survive
World on Fire,Yeah he was certainly a big draw.
World on Fire,"Have to admit that the character of Lois's friend had me wondering what the odds would be of a black woman in 1939 Yorkshire being treated as an equal, sharing the same dressing room as Lois, all that."
World on Fire,"Out of curiosity, what about it spurs such a strong reaction?"
World on Fire,"There‚Äôs a soap opera visual effect caused by motion interpolation, a process that high definition televisions use to display content at a higher refresh rate than the source. The goal of motion interpolation is to give the viewer a more life-like picture, but it's awful."
World on Fire,they're in western Europe; this is just extremely poorly communicated.
World on Fire,"Helen Hunt's plastic surgery is atrocious.  It's a bummer, because she's an actress and there's so much pressure to look young--but she looks like she's wearing a mask.  Watching the season finale right now and it looks like she had silicone or whatever stuffed into her cheeks.  Is that a thing?"
World on Fire,"At times I like her presence as the American who DGAF, but at other times it irks me, especially since she is used throughout the series as a vehicle for exposition of the war."
World on Fire,... Did they invent new people after WWII? Who wouldn't have existed
World on Fire,"quick google search tells me all (or most?) birds lay unfertilized eggs, so that part's fine at least"
World on Fire,don't know much of anything about wartime Britain. I was under the impression that racism against black people was nowhere near as bad as it was in America (particularly the southern states).
World on Fire,"In my opinion, you don't need to believe that a white woman in 1939 would be likely to have a black friend. If race is not relevant to the plot, then the role ought to be open to both black and white actors. This is called ""[color-blind casting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color-blind_casting)"" and I completely approve of it. If we were to insist on complete historical realism, it would be unfair to minority actors who would then be shut out of most roles. Of course, we could compensate for that by making more movies about minorities, like, say, [Fences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fences_\(film\)), but there aren't enough of them, and they have a hard time getting the audiences they deserve. The race of an actor is something the audience can, and ought to, [suspend disbelief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_of_disbelief) about."
World on Fire,"I'll ask her and post back.

Her answer was shit. She said she'll have to see the ad again to remember."
World on Fire,"Yes it is awful! Yes, soap opera-like, but at least soaps compensate with really dim, warm lighting. Is this effect just not obvious to some eyes? I haven‚Äôt seen any comments or reviews of things that mention this."
World on Fire,"I hate it so much. Is it part of the ""film"" of the series itself, or is this something that we can turn off on our end? I have the motion smoothing effect turned off on my TV, but I've been streaming the show on my computer."
World on Fire,How did he get there from Poland?  Because he was certainly there at the start of the series.
World on Fire,"Old comment i found while looking for this review, but theres a video here (on how to behave in Britain for american soldiers), that even has a part at 25:20 teaching that in the UK its not uncommon for polite conversation between white and black people

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltVtnCzg9xw&ab_channel=TheBestFilmArchives"
World on Fire,"Color-blind casting is not appropriate for works that have a historical setting, where that setting is important.  Apparently audiences aren't suspending disbelief, because it seems like there are a lot of people like me who are in fact wondering how a black woman in 1939 Yorkshire is getting treated like a social peer.  It may be ""unfair"" to minority actors but this is supposed to be a series about Europe during the Second World War and casting a black woman in that part is jarringly unrealistic.

You can make a case for color-blind casting in works where setting or ethnicity isn't germane.  So, say, Shakespeare: in pretty much every work except ""Othello"" it doesn't really matter that much what color the performer is.  No black people were dukes in renaissance Italy but when Denzel Washington played an Italian duke in ""Much Ado about Nothing"", nobody cared.

Another example where color-blind casting is fine is that woman whose name I forget who played Hermione Granger in ""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child"".  Some people kicked up a fuss over that, but there was nothing wrong with it.  It *was* non-canonical because there are many references in the Potter books to Hermione blushing, or going pale or white, or getting a tan.  But in the end what difference does it make?

Or as you say folks can make more stories with minority characters and minority representation.  You could do it with a World War II story.  How about all the Indians in Bill Slim's army fighting the Japanese?  How about Ethiopians fighting Mussolini?  How about African soldiers in the French army?  There are stories there and they can and should be made into movies and shows.

But showing a black woman living and working in 1939 Yorkshire and suggesting that her skin color was no big deal and everyone treated her as a friend and peer...that is just wrong, and jarring, and it takes people out of the narrative.

PS--I'm still surprised no one is complaining about British tanks in Poland!"
World on Fire,"When I first got my Samsung TV, I spent a lot of time learning about this and resolved the problem by turning off motion smoothing. Although, I still it in World on Fire and is why I won't watch."
World on Fire,"It's a TV option and it is annoying af, you can turn it off, what TV do you have?"
World on Fire,"you're *really* going to have to suspend your disbelief for this, but the only possible explanation is that he and his comrade were able to make their way across 1500 kilometres of enemy territory in 5 months. not impossible, i suppose, so i can accept it."
World on Fire,"thanks for sharing, this is definitely a valuable video for the light it shines on the era!"
World on Fire,"> PS--I'm still surprised no one is complaining about British tanks in Poland!

I literally searched for discussion about this show because I wanted to know what was going on in that scene and if I had missed something. . . It seemed they went straight from the Russian zone in eastern Poland to . . . Belgium? Or something?"
World on Fire,"was watching it on my computer. I enjoyed the show enough that I plan to get the Blu-ray, we'll see if it looks any different"
World on Fire,"That's...**way** past the snapping point for me, honestly."
World on Fire,Yeah I think it‚Äôs really interesting to hear the way they acknowledge segregation
World on Fire,"I've been watching the show, and I was scratching my head at how the two Polish runaways ended up encountering British troops, but it becomes clear by Episode 5 that those British troops aren't in Poland - the Polish soldiers are in Western Europe. I haven't found any official explanation, as the show does an awfully poor job of pointing this out (really, a few lines of exposition when they meet the British soldiers could have cleared up everything), but there's a big time jump between Episode 3 (Battle of the River Plate, December 1939) and Episode 4 (invasion of Western Europe, May 1940). 

In those five months, we are to believe that the two Polish soldiers went from the Soviet zone of occupation in eastern Poland across 1500 kilometres of enemy territory to Dunkirk. Certainly it requires some suspension of disbelief, but it follows the tradition of any story with a wide cast of characters whose narratives diverse and intersect at various points. I imagine they must have stowed away on trains a lot!"
World on Fire,"That's how I found this thread!  Seriously, where the hell were they supposed to be?"
World on Fire,cool
World on Fire,"I can't blame you, but five months is a long amount of time. As someone else pointed out, they could have made their way to Romania, or any number of countries in southern Europe that weren't yet caught up in the war, and taken different methods of transportation over to western Europe. certainly an epic journey that should deserve its own series or movie."
World on Fire,"There's actually a perfectly logical and historical path they could have taken.  After Poland fell, many polish soldiers took refuge across the border in Romania (a nominal ally at the time), made their way to ships and sailed to Western Europe to continue the fight.

  It's an interesting, undertold story and would fit right in with the show.  But they would have been presenting themselves to the Polish government in exile in London and joining a Free Polish brigade not popping up in a Belgian forest yelling ""don't shoot we're poles"".

I would also like to see the story where two polish soldiers sneaked from Danzig to the Russian Occupation zone and then back through the whole thing and across Germany to get to Western Europe."
World on Fire,"I really do appreciate that this show, which I'd guess was intended for an Anglo-American audience, devotes a lot of time to Polish characters, but I completely agree with you - it's a shame that the backstory of Grzegorz and Konrad's epic journey is brushed over.

SPOILER
With this backstory, it makes Konrad's sudden death all the more painful, when you realize these two men have survived on the run for months, with no other companions but each other, travelling so far, only for him to die like that."
World on Fire,"This show is so good.  The writing, the cinematography, and the actors are all interesting to watch.

Except Helen Hunt.  She's just not right for the role.  She is even hard to watch.

Still a great series though!"
World on Fire,"It could have been very good, but it is peppered with so many inaccuracies and is clearly written by someone who has little knowledge of the period that I find it very irritating to watch."
World on Fire,">Except Helen Hunt.  She's just not right for the role.  She is even hard to watch.

What don't you like about her? She seems credible to me as a composite of the reporters who informed the world about the Nazis before being kicked out of Germany. It is a little distracting to me that I keep staring at her because she's aged, but we all age."
World on Fire,Looks awesome....except for that awful music. Hopefully it won't be in the actual film.
World on Fire,Terrible song choice.  Should have just gone with All-Star
World on Fire,Who comes up with this shit music for period pieces.  I mean come on that just killed it for me. As a WW II buff and a Sean Bean fan that's it's only saving grace.
World on Fire,"That was paint by the numbers except the shitty music. 

I will check it out when it gets to the states."
World on Fire,https://youtu.be/1ws33f6qys4
World on Fire,.. how about yours? that's the way I like it and I never get bored üé∂
World on Fire,"""In an interview with Deadline, Hunt said that Nancy is the first person to see 1,000 German tanks moving into France. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs smart, she‚Äôs funny, which is good in a story that‚Äôs not funny much of the time"""
World on Fire,Does she cry in this role? Because she does the whole weepy thing in like every movie. 
World on Fire,"The subject matter is not happy topic, but she does say it has funny parts."
World on Fire,"There's been quite a few pieces about the behind the scenes troubles of this series. Business Insider claims the show may have spent nearly 300 million dollars for three hours of content. The Hollywood Reporter reported that several writers and producers quit because the Russos had two competing versions of the series and couldn't decide which one they preferred. It's a mess, and the final product likely is going to be...well, worthy of the kind of movies the Russo brothers make for Netflix.

World on Fire,Amazon should be funding Richard Madden in Oasis.
World on Fire,"Isn't this exactly what they bought the Clancy franchise for? Jack Ryan, No Remorse, leading into Rainbow Six, and maybe Splinter Cell?"
World on Fire,"Ah yes the one of the most trusted spy tools. A shotgun... Can we please get a spy series that's more like Tinker Tailor, or the Americans, or something in the middle."
World on Fire,"Spy shows really took off lately, but it doesn't feel like that quality followed."
World on Fire,Madden was tremendous in Bodyguard. He needs a proper drama role.
World on Fire,Why is she holding her arms out like she's got those Black Widow wrist taser things on?
World on Fire,"> When head of Amazon Studios Jen Salke came to Joe and Anthony Russo with an unusual idea for a TV show, they were intrigued by the potential to do something brand-new. 


> **Salke imagined an action spy show that was the first-ever global TV series, with a main show and then local offshoots around the world, starring local talent.** It had never been done before, but that‚Äôs what the Russo brothers liked about it from the start. ‚ÄúAnthony and I have reached a point in our careers where the ambition is the compelling part of the approach for us,‚Äù Joe Russo tells Vanity Fair. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre looking for new ways to tell stories.‚Äù

> Through their production company, AGBO, the Russos embarked on a years-long journey to bring Citadel to life. **The Amazon series stars Richard Madden and Priyanka Chopra Jonas as elite spies who work for Citadel, a spy organization that has no allegiance to any country.** As seen in Vanity Fair‚Äôs exclusive first-look images, **the high-concept, action-packed spy thriller is set after the fall of the spy organization, when the two agents must attempt to piece together what happened. One of the main problems: Their memories have been wiped.** ‚ÄúThis is secrets on steroids,‚Äù showrunner David Weil says. 

> **With standout supporting performances by Stanley Tucci and Lesley Manville, this ambitious new series will premiere its first two episodes on Prime Video on April 28.** It‚Äôs a big, bold swing‚Äîand it‚Äôs actually just the beginning, **with spin-off series already deep into production around the world.** ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not just creating a story, we‚Äôre creating this world that‚Äôs spanning countries and continents,‚Äù Madden says. ‚ÄúThat can be daunting, but also super exciting.‚Äù"
World on Fire,"Good concept, lots of potential, but I'll go out on a limb and say that the two leads are actually the bad guys who contributed to the fall of the titular organization."
100 Days My Prince,"Wait until the Queen passes. Not that I want that, just putting that out there it'll be 10x the coverage."
100 Days My Prince,I read the article so can someone tell me why is the BBC News reporting this as if they are not part of BBC and quoting The Sun about complaints it received about its very own Television channel?
100 Days My Prince,"For anyone who isn't in the UK, the BBC has a number of terrestrial channels:

BBC1,
BBC2,
BBC4,
BBC News...

(best not to ask what happened to BBC3)

When the death of Prince Phillip was announced BBC1, BBC2 and BBC News all simultaneously switched their programming and started to show the exact same feed which was a mixture of live news coverage and archive footage.

Big shows on BBC1 and BB2 were cancelled, the main one being the MasterChef final, a popular show that has been running for years in the UK. The popular satirical news show 'Have I Got News For You' was also moved. 

BBC4 was basically 'turned off' for some reason. This is normally an educational and documentary channel, I have no idea why this was done.

Ideally BBC News should have had the majority of the coverage, all homes in the UK have a 'digital' signal now and can receive this channel so the BBC did not have any real reason to do what they did.

I was annoyed by it but watched Netflix and Disney+ so not the end of the world. I think the reason SO many complaints have been put forward is because the BBC is publicly funded so people tend to think they 'own' it so it should be put to better use than the death of an old sick man."
100 Days My Prince,"‚ÄúA figure of 100,000 would make the coverage of Prince Philip's death the most complained-about piece of programming in BBC history.
Other programmes that attracted a high volume of correspondence included the broadcast of Jerry Springer: The Opera, which received 63,000 complaints in 2005; and Russell Brand's prank call to actor Andrew Sachs, which drew 42,000 complaints in 2008.‚Äù

That‚Äôs not bad company."
100 Days My Prince,"Although if this is for Prince Phillip, its going to be 110% for when London Bridge Happens... and that's going to last weeks..."
100 Days My Prince,"Even some of the most servile royalists think that just randomly showing the exact same stuff on both the main channels was ridiculous. Literally just cancelling stuff for no benefit whatsoever.  Nicholas Witchell thinks it was a bit much.  


Meanwhile, the 10 people who actually think it was a good idea, are all upset because the BBC makes it possible to complain about it. Seriously."
100 Days My Prince,If you think that coverage was too much...old queenie will top the charts!
100 Days My Prince,American here. How did the BBC cover it?
100 Days My Prince,"Probably will go a bit further up after they let Prince Andrew have an interview to launder try his reputation after he fucked that trafficked teen and, with royal support, avoided the FBI calls for an interview.

Deeply normal country with a totally not dysfunctional media filled with people who owe their job to their class position and so will be biased towards the status quo that kills a fuck tonne of working class people."
100 Days My Prince,Makes sense. Normal people tend to not give a shit about a wealthy landowner who inherited everything he had and was duke of a city he's not from and hasn't ever lived in.
100 Days My Prince,"I think that's because the vast majority of us don't really give a shit. I was watching the Spurs United game on the weekend and the moment's silence for Prince Philip felt 3 minutes long. It was so fucking unnecessary, when someone with an actual football background dies the moment's silence lasts for 30 seconds."
100 Days My Prince,"I remember when Diana died and we were forced to watch flowers opening in slow motion while miserable music played in the background, for hours and hours. I'd like to know who comes up with this shit."
100 Days My Prince,Absolute pisstake it was on so many channels
100 Days My Prince,"41 gun salute, the military stood to attention in respectful silence throughout...

But every feckn news channel felt the need to give a running commentary throughout the salute on what we could see unfolding on the screen.

literally counting the horses like a children's tv show, they could not shut up and stop narrating the live segment that was supposed to be done in respectful silence."
100 Days My Prince,"I'm English and not bothered in the slightest about his death so haven't seen any coverage, other than one news report that interviewed prince Andrew, his dad or not, nobody should be giving that fucking nonce air time."
100 Days My Prince,"One for every freckle on his body, a devout nation."
100 Days My Prince,"Fair enough, we pay for the BBC at ¬£12 a month. We should decide what we want. Given that we have a lockdown, and not a lot of people can afford Netflix etc and only have BBC and other Freeview, it was unfair of them"
100 Days My Prince,"This is one of those things you don‚Äôt realize about your country until someone else points it out, but as others have said, yes it is a bit weird, and yes the BBC does this all the time.

I think it‚Äôs partly to add a bit of colour to the news cycle. The BBC tends to be quite discreet when it comes to the royals in common with most if our establishment media but is also (depending who you ask) quite left of Centre. Reporting on complaints about royal coverage is a sneakier way to report on anti-royalist feeling itself without openly doing so. 

Like others said it‚Äôs also a nice hedging mechanism to show that they are responsive to their audience. Keeping a running tally of who has been offended by what has become a feature of our national discourse and the Beeb will report with BBC Concerned Voice that over 200 complaints were received about this or that episode/article/remark even if it‚Äôs not to do with the royals. 

Then again, complaining is also the national sport, so on some level the fact that 100k people had a good old whinge is itself newsworthy, whatever it was about. It‚Äôs a respect thing."
100 Days My Prince,"Hahaha this is so odd

""BBC receives 100000 complaints""

BBC website: However, it declined to confirm the number of complaints it received"
100 Days My Prince,Is Prince Philip still dead?
100 Days My Prince,I‚Äôve never understood how people can be arsed complaining to TV channels. The effort involved alone is enough to put me off.
100 Days My Prince,"I wouldn‚Äôt have complained if the content on all the channels were different, but it was just the same 30 minute reel of ‚ÄòPhilip Dead, this was his life, Philip Dead, this was his life, World Leaders comment, Philip Dead...‚Äô on loop.

Was absurd and I‚Äôm dreading when the Queen goes because it‚Äôll be even worse. Hopefully with her we‚Äôll at least have some more varied coverage."
100 Days My Prince,"Who, honestly gives a fuck, that this guy has died? I‚Äôm English and I couldn‚Äôt careless. There are actual people in the prime of their lives dying  from preventable diseases and for some reason we‚Äôre still talking about this old coot."
100 Days My Prince,"It wouldn‚Äôt have been so bad if it was just the one channel but no, it was them all except the children‚Äôs channel, plus the radio stations 

They even put it on the non English speaking BBC channels (in English)

Plus it was just pure propaganda

Don‚Äôt even claim the BBC isn‚Äôt a state broadcaster"
100 Days My Prince,"Without further context it sounds like BBC put up the form and encouraged viewers to use it.

> On Saturday, the BBC put a dedicated form on its website to allow viewers to complain about the TV coverage, in recognition of the volume of complaints.

> The form was removed on Sunday, after the number of complaints began to fall, the corporation said.

Passive aggressive protest from within the BBC from staff resentful of any positive coverage of royals?

From the American perspective of BBC my impression is *many* unhappy people call the BBC their base."
100 Days My Prince,"As they should.

The royal family does not deserve this ludicrous amount of news coverage."
100 Days My Prince,Did everyone just kinda forget the BBC is a government run organization?
100 Days My Prince,"I think Russel Brand is right that when Elizabeth dies, the monarchy will fade out. People are attached to this couple, but not Charles. And Harry was like: fuck this, I am out."
100 Days My Prince,">100,000 complaints

...with a million more well on the way."
100 Days My Prince,"The BBC would much rather 100,000 people have a moan online than upset their Tory overlords."
100 Days My Prince,"I just put my complain in about his and also the feature of the pedo price Andrew on bbc youtube channel. 

Please do the same this is offensive."
100 Days My Prince,"> The most-watched programme on a single channel on Friday night was Channel 4's Gogglebox, with 4.2 million viewers

That‚Äôs what happens when BBC and ITV clear out their entire schedules and Channel 4 only clear out like 90 minutes. BBC and ITV wiped their daytime programming til 6pm, there was no need to also remove primetime shows.

Plus, Gogglebox is just a great show and easy watching. Best TV to unwind with after a work week."
100 Days My Prince,Do people in the UK still pay an annual TV tax for each TV owned in a household which goes directly to supporting the BBC?
100 Days My Prince,"Complaints only matter when it jeopardises the BBC‚Äôs charter. But the tories run the BBC now, and they fucking love the royalty, makes them cum in their nannies‚Äô Union Jack nighties."
100 Days My Prince,*from around the world. We care little for what American think of this coverage.
100 Days My Prince,"Sad, self important losers"
100 Days My Prince,"Royalty jumped the shark by the 1990s. After the queen kicks the bucket, I don‚Äôt think the world as a whole would care at all."
100 Days My Prince,"The BBC is just the government mouthpiece of whoever is in power at the time.  When there‚Äôs a change from labour to conservative or vice versa you can actually see the BBC bias gradually changing direction as they rewrite policy and change staff/shows; it takes about 12-18 months to complete.  Addressing this thread‚Äôs original topic: the BBC interrupted ALL of its channels to break the news of Phil‚Äôs death and then broadcast identical content across them for hours on end.  Numerous looked-forward-to shows were postponed for the sake of ‚Äúnews‚Äù about his unsurprising death.  The BBC, and certain pro-royal newspapers (all owned by right wing) are still wailing and gnashing their teeth over this news a week later.  All boils down to our rotten class system - if the media elite (who are powerful in their own right) want any chance of a knighthood or an OBE then they‚Äôve got to pretend they‚Äôre pro-royal and are sad about the death of royalty.  The BBC simply does what it likes anyway; once they realised that Philip‚Äôs death had broken the previous record for BBC complaints, they simply took down their on-line complaint form about it.  Problem solved.  We do not live in a democracy, never think it.  Dissenting voices will be silenced and the official message will prevail.  It‚Äôs fucking Orwellian and the sooner the BBC is either abolished or made truly independent, I don‚Äôt care which, the better."
100 Days My Prince,"I feel like we got an absurd amount of coverage in the states . I don‚Äôt remember living in a Monarchy . 
/s"
100 Days My Prince,"Bro, I‚Äôm sorry, but I don‚Äôt give a single fuck about the royal family. We got our own problems here."
100 Days My Prince,"Because it‚Äôs cult like coverage, how many times can you repeat the same message"
100 Days My Prince,"Can't wait to see the complaints roll in once the queen goes. It was before the code word got well know ""London Bridge has fallen down"" that informed the media from the Royal household that the Queen has died start the Royal death contingency plan. And that will be every channel. All comedy must stop when this announcement has been made for a set time too."
100 Days My Prince,YouTube has received 10k complaints from me alone. Couldn't seem to get the drivel off my feed.
100 Days My Prince,"Well it's not as bad as it sounds when you think about it. The coverage was so far reaching that almost every adult in the UK has been exposed to it in some degree, and 100,000 complaints out of every adult isn't that bad. It's when you get 50,000 complaints on a show which was only watched by 2 million viewers that you know someone really fucked up. That being said, the coverage was a bit much, I'm not going to waste time making a complaint personally though."
100 Days My Prince,The BBC strangely reporting on the BBC as if it‚Äôs not the BBC so as to not seem strange bringing up criticism of BBC decisions. Classy
100 Days My Prince,"Why does no one mention what the complains were? Not in the article, not here. 
I can't believe I am the only one that has not enough knoledge about the British royals to know right away the reason."
100 Days My Prince,"It‚Äôs ridiculous, even 6Music has gone onto an emergency broadcast week where they seem to be only allowed to play the most dreary and boring music. Is the Queen likely to tune in and get upset?"
100 Days My Prince,"If anything this just shows how out of touch the BBC had become from the populace.  How this organisation is still around baffles me, especially after the Jimmy Saville revelations.  It's a relic from the past and is no longer needed."
100 Days My Prince,"someone needs to start a pirate channel that only broadcasts satire about the royals in these moments, its gonna be unbearable when the Lizzy drops dead,"
100 Days My Prince,"People in the UK clearly didn‚Äôt see American coverage of Ronald Reagan‚Äôs death in 2004. Wall to wall coverage for DAYS. 

A full day of breaking news coverage on a TV network for a head of state passing is nothing. Programs get preempted in the US all the time."
100 Days My Prince,"I was a bit miffed when they cancelled the Masterchef finale, I can‚Äôt lie."
100 Days My Prince,So?
100 Days My Prince,"Why do people hate him so much? After looking through it, he‚Äôs said some regrettable shit, but also been a major force in conservation and getting people active, such as the DoE Awards."
100 Days My Prince,Til people in england still watch cable tv.
100 Days My Prince,There is nothing more British than complaining to the BBC about their coverage of the royal family.
100 Days My Prince,"And they would have had 100,000 complaints if their coverage had been too little.  Can't please everyone."
100 Days My Prince,"BBC still has coverage of President Trump. Really. BBC needs to focus on their own, like Brexit, and that Johnson clown...  Trump needs to go away."
100 Days My Prince,I mean I am sorry he died but there are more important things going on like you know COVID?!?!?!!!
100 Days My Prince,"99,001 came from Scotland."
100 Days My Prince,"Well, that is how I feel whenever there is a major football event going on. I consider this more worthy of coverage."
100 Days My Prince,I can‚Äôt believe that Seth of some old person is more promoted then war of Russia again Europe and their attack on Ukrainian territories. This is upsetting.
100 Days My Prince,People living in a literal kingdom complaining about coverage of a royals death. Your educators failed you miserably.
100 Days My Prince,I mean we're not USA or North Korea. We don't need to see this bullshit!
100 Days My Prince,"The Queen is a ‚Äúroyal‚Äù and, of course, the ‚Äúroyals‚Äù are SO ‚Äúspecial‚Äù. The family is worth over 80 BILLION EUROS. What the fuck is so special about this woman? She‚Äôs a HOARDER who makes her staff wrap-up leftovers ‚Äújust in case‚Äù <wink!>. Just in case of what, exactly? Who needs a monarchy, anyway? It costs 80 MILLION EUROS each year - almost a BILLION PER DECADE - just for this fucking charade of a facade. It could feed every hungry person and clothe every homeless person a thousand times over. It‚Äôs all a bunch of bullshit on a grand stage. üò≥"
100 Days My Prince,"Honestly, this should have been 1 day of reporting, but it's fucking everyday for hours.

It was a 99 year old racist that died. Nothing more, nothing less."
100 Days My Prince,How long until the Queen sets up a Tinder account?
100 Days My Prince,Anything to get the focus off of the Harry and Megan racist sitch
100 Days My Prince,"Considering he was a living symbol of entitlement, classism, racism and an absurd monarchical system, it's not surprising that many got tired of the excessive coverage.  I can imagine how irritating it would be to miss a regularly scheduled show to see a bunch of blahblahblah about a guy who got to where he was because who he was born to and which second cousin he married."
100 Days My Prince,God forbid anyone is delayed from watching EastEnders
100 Days My Prince,"I honestly don't get why anybody would complain about this. We are no longer limited to watching broadcast TV content. If you don't like what's on the TV, switch channels, hit YouTube, or god forbid do something else. Stare out of the window for a bit. Contemplate life's big questions. Accept that you will be dead in a handful of years and absolutely nothing really matters anyway. Take the dog for a walk. Make a sandwich. Read a book. Fuck it, write a book. Aimlessly scroll through Instagram looking at all the cool things you are not doing. Go for a run. Whatever, but complaining to the BBC about the coverage of a recently dead royal should really be a bit further down your list of priorities. Such sad."
100 Days My Prince,"50,000 complaints said there wasn't enough coverage. The other 50,000 said there was too much"
100 Days My Prince,So why did people complain the article didn‚Äôt say why.
100 Days My Prince,"If BBC did not do the over the top coverage there would be a different group complaining about the BBC. Not respecting the crown, not being British/patriotic enough.  This group would include British politicians and to appease them the government/regulator would overreact.  If he had died on Saturday and football coverage was cancelled then the complaints would‚Äôve increased ten fold. The coverage was overly excessive but the channels/BBC can not win here."
100 Days My Prince,Is there anything else happening in boring Britain?
100 Days My Prince,"Oh, woopity-fucking-do, people couldn't watch MasterChef the day they wanted to? I'm not even a royalist but come on. A person who has played a highly important role in modern British history died, it's only natural that the BBC should cancel its programming."
100 Days My Prince,"100,000 people with nothing better to do. If you don't like something, don't watch it!"
100 Days My Prince,Monarchy is cancer. The ‚Äúroyal‚Äù family is bullshit. It‚Äôs 21 century already. Just abolish monarchy!
100 Days My Prince,Oops wrong bbc
100 Days My Prince,"In Australia, the rolling coverage was OTT too, entire schedules were changed with a bucketload of commemorative Philip programming."
100 Days My Prince,Imagine caring enough that you go out of your way to write a complaint
100 Days My Prince,"Just to point out ‚Äòcomplaining‚Äô was as easy as typing your email address onto their webpage.

If effort had to go in, it would be a fraction of that number. Not saying it isn‚Äôt justified, but that‚Äôs not 100,000 complaints as such."
100 Days My Prince,"I mean while as an American I couldn‚Äôt care less about the monarchy, they‚Äôre still pretty bug figure heads in England. It makes sense they‚Äôve covered it a lot and a stuff. I remember when Bush died they covered that a lot and he was just a one term president. A prince of 50+ years is a big one."
100 Days My Prince,"I don't get why this pissed people off so much, it's not the 90s, our options aren't 4 live TV channels or nothing anymore. I saw the coverage on TV and just turned on Netflix instead."
100 Days My Prince,"Save you a click...Complaints were because other shows weren‚Äôt aired due to coverage about his death. 

Call me an asshole but I think covering the death of the royal consort to the longest reigning monarch in British history should probably take precedent over this weeks episode of Britain‚Äôs Got Talent, or whatever the fuck people wanted to watch. (I‚Äôm not British so I‚Äôve no clue what ya‚Äôll watch on what network) If the spouse of our President died I would expect similar broadcast interruptions, and that‚Äôs just some elected asshole that serves for 4-8 years."
100 Days My Prince,What are they complaining about?
100 Days My Prince,Down with the royals.  You owe them nothing.  Certainly you are not obliged to mourn with them.
100 Days My Prince,Fuck him
100 Days My Prince,Well blimey. Of course
100 Days My Prince,Must be said were it not for royal protocol Philip himself would likely have been complaining. There has been a weirdly huge amount of fuss at the expense of more actionable issues.
100 Days My Prince,"Not sure why we care much about the monarchy, let them live their lives"
100 Days My Prince,"It‚Äôs complete tripe. All these shows are looking for brownie points. It‚Äôs like in North Korea where the louder you cry the better off you are! I‚Äôm aghast by the amount of bollocks these hosts and guests are coming up with ‚Äòhe was the kindest man I‚Äôve ever met‚Äô, ‚Äòdid so much for us and the rainforests‚Äô, ‚Äòhe shook my hand and told me I was doing a grand job‚Äô. Such a farce!"
100 Days My Prince,"fuck the useless bbc news.  the bbc should stick to drama which it still does extremely well.

however, i'm more aghast at the fact that parliament is devoting a whole session to a virtue signalling wank fest of tributes to philip."
100 Days My Prince,God forbid people can‚Äôt watch antiques roadshow for a day because the Queens husband has just died.
100 Days My Prince,"I‚Äôm amazed people still watch TV. Other than a couple shows I watch on the few streaming services I own, I no longer watch broadcast Television. It all feels like filler.

Edit: I annoyed the 4 people who still really like watching television."
100 Days My Prince,I heard you get a letter from the queen when you hit 100 in England. I always wondered if Philip would get the same letter. Guess we'll never know
100 Days My Prince,Funny all the xenophobic Royalists losing their shit over a Greek lol
100 Days My Prince,"I was more upset about DMX, that guy influenced my childhood. I didn't even know this Philip guy until he was brought up by some comedians a couple years ago for being unpredictable and racist."
100 Days My Prince,[removed]
100 Days My Prince,"> The BBC has received 100,000 complaints from members of the public over its coverage of the Duke of Edinburgh's death, according to the Sun newspaper.

The BBC is reporting it has received 100k complaints... via the Sun?"
100 Days My Prince,The news are always full of bits about the royals it‚Äôs about time people get fed up.
Spirit,"Agree completely. Her performance was wonderful. 

Mossbacher got a second shot with Andor."
Spirit,Literally every actor in that show should be getting some award. Show was incredibly well done all around.
Spirit,"Heard, chef."
Spirit,"Naija in the building!!! So happy for her, I haven't finished the Bear yet, but she's been great in everything I've seen."
Spirit,"I am really happy for her. I love her character in the Bear since its one of the few ones that actually feel like how human beings actually behave. 

She got recently cast in Marvel's Thunderbolts and knowing Marvel, I hope they don't ruin her character. I am really rooting for Ayo and Jeremy Allen White to grow successful as actors."
Spirit,Yes!!! She is the best.
Spirit,"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tVq8L7Skxpg

She just also starred in a stage reading of triangle of sadness."
Spirit,She is very good in this series. Well deserved
Spirit,Ok now I've gotta watch this. She's been really funny in all of the podcasts I've heard her in.
Spirit,She was great in season one.
Spirit,"Good, she deserved it!"
Spirit,She was great. I only think Carmy pulled a better performance and nearly everyone did a fantastic job.
Spirit,"She deserves it, she‚Äôs amazing. Can‚Äôt wait for season 2!!"
Spirit,She did a great job in the show. Can't wait for season two man.
Spirit,i would like to start a cult and ayo is the leader. my queen
Spirit,She have a license for those guns? Dam
Spirit,I love her character. That‚Äôs great!
Spirit,Loved that show but I had to stop watching it because it triggered tf out of me
Spirit,The thumbnail looks like she is naked holding a bunch of kittens
Spirit,Daaaaa bear
Spirit,Awesome! I wonder if she gets to go celebrate by doing cocaine with cocaine bear
Spirit,Most relatable character. And shes pretty
Spirit,"The Spirit Awards are pointless now. How on Earth  is streaming show  considered ""independent?"" 

Of course this pales in comparison to a movie produced by the fucking Russo Brothers being also considered ""independent."""
Spirit,Why is she kinda ripped
Spirit,[removed]
Spirit,Icon
Spirit,She can take that award to Brunch with now!
Spirit,Great show.
Spirit,"She was great, happy for her"
Spirit,Favorite second behind Carmy. She was amazing! Can‚Äôt wait to see where her career goes after this
Spirit,Absolutely agree. Part of the reason the show was so awesome was that every single person NAILED their character. Very impressive when you look at it from all angles.
Spirit,"Yes, Jeff."
Spirit,this should be the top comment lol
Spirit,"We love the show, patiently awaiting new season."
Spirit,We no Dey carry last!
Spirit,She also got casted to voice April in Seth Rogen‚Äôs TMNT: Mutant Mayhem movie next year :)
Spirit,"Ooh, do you know which Thunderbolt she‚Äôs playing? I read those as a teen bc my bf was obsessed with them lol"
Spirit,"I‚Äôm jealous that you get to watch ‚ÄúThe Bear‚Äù for the first time. It‚Äôs awesome, enjoy!"
Spirit,she looks jacked af
Spirit,"If it is made by an independent studio, it is considered independent."
Spirit,Does it matter?
Spirit,Why do people hate this remark as much
Spirit,"Sorry, I‚Äôm unclear: who do you think is being discriminated against?"
Spirit,wOkE
Spirit,I believe that anyone that uses woke in a negative fashion doesn't have anything useful to contribute to society.
Spirit,"But acting is not something that benefits from a gendered awards system. Men and women act together and neither has a biological advantage. It honestly makes no sense to separate the categories except "" this is how we always have done it"""
Spirit,Are you some sort of a multinational broadcasting conglomerate? What‚Äôs your big plan with boycotting oscars for life? Standing in crowd with a poster? What if your life expectancy is around year and a half?
Spirit,"Awards delivery order: 

Best Supporting Actress

Best Supporting Actor

Best Actress

Best Actor

Best Film

It was always clear that ‚Äòbest actor and film‚Äô were the pinnacle of the show, the most important awards. The word ‚ÄòActor‚Äô covers both men and women who perform, but awards shows separated women from that word and gave them their own, lesser category, ensuring they can never compete against men for the top spot. 

As a young girl who was taught to ‚Äòsave the best for last‚Äô, the Oscar‚Äôs seemed to be intentionally telling me, and everyone else, that a girl could never be *The Best*, she could only be the best *girl*, the runner up. I asked every year why men and women couldn‚Äôt compete to be the best against each other. AT LEAST in acting. We were prohibited from being a part of so much else, for so long, this always just seemed like a reasonable request for fairness and equal opportunity to me. 

So yes, you are crazy for thinking those ugly, unfair things, and I think you may also lack empathy and thoughtfulness."
Spirit,Fuck brunch! :)
Spirit,"Shes probably gonna see her role in abbott elementary grow, janines relationship w her sister is hilarious"
Spirit,*Cousin!*
Spirit,It is
Spirit,She's also playing Janine's sister in Abbott Elementary. Having a great year.
Spirit,And she plays Janine's sister on Abbott Elementary
Spirit,That movie comes out in August this year actually
Spirit,*cast
Spirit,It hasn't been revealed yet
Spirit,I‚Äôve watched it three times and I have no regrets
Spirit,Yes
Spirit,It‚Äôs funny cause largely the same group who used to scream ‚Äúwake up America!‚Äù is now screaming ‚Äúgo back to sleep! Go woke be broke‚Äù
Spirit,"So you are okay with one person winning instead of two?  Got it! üôÑüôÑ Separating the sexes ensures that BOTH genders get rewarded for their efforts, talent, and hard work.  Or does equality only matter when we are talking about women and racial minorities?! üò≥üò≥ 

Yes, I‚Äôm crazy this way because to me- who is a gay woman by the way- equality means FOR ALL PEOPLE, MEN AND WOMEN! üò¨üò¨ If we just change these categories to actor, either a woman or a man will win, so one gender will always be left out.  See my logic, or are you so obsessed with manufacturing a gender neutral world to the point that you can‚Äôt see how this would hurt and punish BOTH genders equally?!But, yeah, saying I want equality for both genders is being a misogynist and somehow backwards and bigoted in today‚Äôs cultural climate‚Ä¶ üòîüòî 

As for sports, men will always be physically stronger and faster than us, so yes, as women we would always be on the losing end of that battle if professional sports were to become gender neutral or men and women competed against each other for sports titles.  There might be exceptions, of course, but due to the biological and physiological differences between us, women would most often end up on the losing end of this equation.  This is all just my opinion, I think most reasonable and rational people would agree with it, but you have the right to disagree and keep fighting for a genderless society as is becoming the trendy thing nowadays‚Ä¶ üôÑüôÑ"
Spirit,"The writing in that show is great. Especially since the creator and head writer stars in it. That combo can spell disaster with the writer/actor dominating the show and having no flaws and getting no criticism.

All characters feels like they have good sides and bad sides, which makes them feel relatable.

Also I need Tyler James Williams to star in an Eddie Murphy biopic. It‚Äôs like his character is Eddie dialed down to 1. I think it could work."
Spirit,And let‚Äôs not forget she‚Äôs also playing Janine‚Äôs sister on Abbott Elementsry
Spirit,"Oooh even better!  I love TMNT stuff and thought it was 2024 for some reason ><

edit:  Thanks for that!"
Spirit,Why?
Spirit,"Sure bud lol, not reading all that, the first line was dumb enough."
Spirit,Yea its rare to see a piece of art work so perfectly in this medium but abbott nails it on every level
Spirit,"I‚Äôve heard tell in the television program, ‚ÄúAbbott Elementary‚Äù, she plays the sister of lead character ‚ÄúJanine‚Äù"
Spirit,Because I like ripped girls?? Am I gonna get hate for this too?
Spirit,"Your initial comment provided no context. Honestly, I thought you were mocking her for being ripped."
Spirit,"I was not, it was a compliment"
Spirit,Your comment could have been written a bit better then.
Spirit,No it couldn't
Spirit,I really hope he gave himself the full rehearsal experience and we get to see it as a special or part of the 2nd season
Spirit,This is almost as crazy as the time I crashed my Scion TC at a 100 mph!
Spirit,"""But the more I practiced the line about the bean salad, the more I began to wonder: what I was trying to accomplish here? If I won, which version of me would they be giving an award to? Which version did they want to see? Nathan Fielder, the comedian? Or the persona I'd created for this production?"""
Spirit,"If the practise for this speech appears in season 2, I swear to God, I'm going to go completely insane."
Spirit,Door city over here
Spirit,"Can‚Äôt believe he didn‚Äôt comment on how heavy the award is. 
Would love to see the flow chart of this acceptance speech‚Ä¶. Dependent on: Get a laugh / no laugh"
Spirit,"Is it an actual prize? , or did Nathan stage a phoney awards ceremony and present himself with another trophy?"
Spirit,We better get an episode in Season 2 that documents his rehearsal process for getting the award
Spirit,remember a video of Nathan and apparently there are no videos of him out of character and its great to see him still either being completely himself or being someone entirely different.
Spirit,Is it just me or does he look a lot older in this video
Spirit,"Find a job where you can do exactly what you'd be doing if you weren't working and you'll never work a day in your life, even if you were working."
Spirit,Fuck he‚Äôs a funny guy
Spirit,üòÇ that show is cray
Spirit,How can it be unscripted? Didn‚Äôt he have writers help him with his rehearsals?
Spirit,The show is scripted though.  He scripts all of his actions and meticulously picks out the best scenario for him.
Spirit,"Isn't the Rehersal by definition scripted? Literally, the point of the show is that they rehearse and script/ predict out every single interaction and story beat."
Spirit,Non-scripted? The show seemed totally scripted to me. Loved it but i find it hard to believe it wasn‚Äôt scripted.
Spirit,Damn how big is The Rehearsal‚Äôs budget this season that they got Audra McDonald
Spirit,That sounds exactly like the sort of thing he‚Äôd do
Spirit,"He never breaks character on camera. That's part of his whole thing. He's definitely playing the role of rehearsal Nathan here, I think this is a bit for the show. Being confident and having jokes land due to the amount of in depth practising and over analysing, while also at the same time still being in the awkward ""Nathan for you""character mode, is quite the acting achievement."
Spirit,"Mark this post or something because I have a serious prediction: whatever is happening in season 2, we‚Äôve already seen part of it, first that strange cameo at the baseball game awhile back, and now this."
Spirit,I called this many moons ago: that he‚Äôd win an Emmy or something and it would all be part of season 2. Can any redditors with skills find my comment? I‚Äôm thirsty for recognition
Spirit,"When I was binging Nathan for You for the first time, I stumbled across an appearance he did on Jimmy Kimmel. The interview was hilarious, but I was slightly offput by some of the weird comments. I was absolutely shocked to see literally the next episode I watched was about orchestrating that specific interview."
Spirit,It‚Äôs days like these I curse the Germans for inventing automobiles
Spirit,"Your comment is 32 minutes old. Makes me think of Psalm 32. Blessed is he whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man whose sin the LORD does not count against him and in whose spirit is no deceit."
Spirit,I'm happy to see our man saying things once more and going places.
Spirit,"""It wasn't until after the show had concluded that I was told there was no bean salad. So to make my speech a hundred percent authentic, I reorganized the event, inviting all the same guests. Only this time, I hired this professional chef to prepare ninety pounds of bean salad and place the bowls on tables in highly foot trafficked places around the auditorium. This way, nobody in attendance would be able to recall which version had bean salad and which didn't."""
The Ultimate Braai Master,"Kevin Smith's worked with her before and seems to be a big fan, so that makes sense."
The Ultimate Braai Master,Why isn't SMG continuing in the role?
The Ultimate Braai Master,I totally thought that the show was over lol
The Ultimate Braai Master,"Honestly, I know it got a lot of complaints due to He-Man not being in most of it through the first half...but it was a pretty well-done series.

It held true to the spirit of the 80s show but wasn't, y'know, Filmation crap just made to sell toys. 

I'm happy there's going to be a second season."
The Ultimate Braai Master,"Just keep it inside

Learn how to hide

Your feelings"
The Ultimate Braai Master,"I know I'm in the minority, but I'm really looking forward to the new Skeletor story arc after his final scene in the previous season. Seems creepy/badass."
The Ultimate Braai Master,Jewel of Wilson‚Äôs foul domain
The Ultimate Braai Master,"Give me some quality live-action He-Man already, damn!"
The Ultimate Braai Master,"Skimmimg through the article, I thought for a second that William Shatner was doing the voice for Skeletor, imagine that."
The Ultimate Braai Master,"Seeing as she‚Äôs literally married to He-Man, I‚Äôm not surprised."
The Ultimate Braai Master,Didn‚Äôt fans hate the last one of these shows that they made?
The Ultimate Braai Master,This show is still on?
The Ultimate Braai Master,"Amped they're continuing this! I thought the S2 finale could have been much better paced, but overall I really enjoyed this."
The Ultimate Braai Master,I really enjoyed the first season so I'm happy they are making more. Don't really have an opinion on the voice acting change.
The Ultimate Braai Master,"I'm going to get downvoted to hell but dear god I loathed both seasons of this show.  And Teelah was the most god awful protagonist.  She had to be coerced and pulled from one scene to the next, was joyless and just uninteresting to watch.  And that's not SMG's fault, the writing was just bad.  

To the show's credit I was interested in Evil Lynn and Orco's episode.  The animation was top notch.  

But He-Man got sidelined even Skeletor got sidelined.  And for the most part the show was a joyless slog that damaged one of my childhood heroes.  But this show wasn't for me as an 80's kid.  It sold itself as being for me, but it was a complete bait and switch."
The Ultimate Braai Master,Super
The Ultimate Braai Master,"Definitely an upgrade. Though I don‚Äôt think her husband had a great He-Man voice. A good Adam but he lacked that booming bass from the 80s show.

Edit: Melissa Benoist as Wolverine‚Äôs daughter:

The Ultimate Braai Master,She was super girl right?
The Ultimate Braai Master,Didn‚Äôt they already ruin this franchise?
The Ultimate Braai Master,"Is this a new, new series or a continuation?"
The Ultimate Braai Master,I'm honestly surprised this show is getting another season. The first was a monster turd.
The Ultimate Braai Master,Awe that sucks! I thought she did a great job! I hope it's just a scheduling conflict
The Ultimate Braai Master,How has this not been cancelled yet?
The Ultimate Braai Master,"My take is it just needs to be a ‚ÄúHe-Man‚Äù show‚Ä¶ like the original was‚Ä¶ 

And then, at least, all us OG He-Man fans would love it. Because we loved that show. 

You can always make a different show, centered around a different character, and still call it ‚ÄúHe-Man.‚Äù You can do that, it‚Äôs a free country, but then you risk alienating the people that liked and enjoyed the original show. 

Maybe you can have greater success without the original fans‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs possible‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs not the direction I would have gone with the IP."
The Ultimate Braai Master,"The actual star of He-Man, Teela is getting an new actor? 

Somehow, some way, we shall be okay."
The Ultimate Braai Master,"This is such a lowkey powerhouse piece of IP. New toy line, two animated series and a live action show all in the last ~5 years."
The Ultimate Braai Master,‚Ä¶..and it‚Äôs cancelled
The Ultimate Braai Master,Idek what another season would be about. Teela is the most powerful being in history and STILL has He-Man for backup
The Ultimate Braai Master,this dumpster fire gets a season 2? and yet netflix cancels good shows? what kind of power does kevin smith hold over netflix?
The Ultimate Braai Master,Okay but like... give that the first part was awful why even bother.
The Ultimate Braai Master,Why won‚Äôt Sarah Michelle Gellar reprise the role? I really love anything that she‚Äôs involved in.
The Ultimate Braai Master,I like Melissa and I like the symmetry ofThe Vampire Slayer being replaced by Supergirl
The Ultimate Braai Master,"Netflix cancels shows people give a shit about, but greenlights one of the most derided misfires of the last decade? Oof. If even SMG didn't want anything to do with it you know this shit is even more DOA than the first series."
The Ultimate Braai Master,Good. She was miscast.
The Ultimate Braai Master,"Bruh, Masters Of The Universe series does Netflix have?"
The Ultimate Braai Master,"I don‚Äôt think SMG was good in the role, but I also don‚Äôt think the show was very good period."
The Ultimate Braai Master,Would anyone even care?
The Ultimate Braai Master,"Please don‚Äôt destroy my childhood, I can‚Äôt go through another Footloose situation"
The Ultimate Braai Master,I wouldn‚Äôt touch that project with a 50 ft pole either.
The Ultimate Braai Master,This show was utter garbage
The Ultimate Braai Master,Netflix canceled so much. Why are they making this trash?
The Ultimate Braai Master,"That is going to continue?
Bold move from Netflix."
The Ultimate Braai Master,Boooo
The Ultimate Braai Master,Are we doing another He-Man-less He-Man cartoon again?
The Ultimate Braai Master,Why not the show as a multiverse then you can have both women as the character?
The Ultimate Braai Master,I always wonder if those actors whom rejects roles still filthy rich or what got on their minds to pass important roles.
The Ultimate Braai Master,"That show, it's fans & haters. Lol"
The Ultimate Braai Master,"I thought that the season was told out of order. They second half of the season should have been shown first, with minor tweaks to have it flow better, and the second half be second. It'll give us fans some time with the characters before killing them off. Then kill them off in the fifth episode for some shocks value and then continue with how the episodes in the first half but now the second half. It works out wonderfully and the series might have actually been better."
The Ultimate Braai Master,"I hated this show and say that with full confidence after watching too many episodes of it. I'm utterly shocked it's getting another season or that Netflix will waste money on it versus other shows like Mindhunters, etc."
The Ultimate Braai Master,‚Ä¶ and hosting me too like some brain-dead AOL-er
The Ultimate Braai Master,Whatever her projects and films I'm always support her.  She's the greatest super girl.
The Ultimate Braai Master,Had no idea this was in the works
The Ultimate Braai Master,"Plus the voice actor for He-Man is her husband, they met while working together on Supergirl."
The Ultimate Braai Master,"They are friends, and he likes giving his friends work."
The Ultimate Braai Master,"She doesn‚Äôt like to work. 

I don‚Äôt mean that in a disparaging way. 

She comes and goes as she pleases within show business, choosing carefully when she works and when she doesn‚Äôt so that she can take care of her family. With her already producing and starring in a show, she likely just doesn‚Äôt want to work on a second one at the same time."
The Ultimate Braai Master,They did not say.
The Ultimate Braai Master,I‚Äôm assuming she will be busy filming season 2 of her new Paramount+ show.
The Ultimate Braai Master,Maybe she watched the first series
The Ultimate Braai Master,"if it isn't scheduling conflict or her being too buzy , maybe it's because of the reaction to her character in season 1 as she was mostly the lead instead of He-man and grown men took that personally."
The Ultimate Braai Master,You didn't catch the final episode's teaser?
The Ultimate Braai Master,"I'm kinda surprised it was renewed.  I have no strong feelings about it (watched the first episode and a half, decided it wasn't for me), but it was an odd choice to try to harness the nostalgia of He-Man fans, and then write He-Man and Skeletor out of the show in the first episode, lol.

People tried to pretend online that the backlash was just about sexism, but like Ghostbusters 2016, the backlash is probably just because you made something that sucks."
The Ultimate Braai Master,"Genuinely, compared to Transformers War For Cybertron it was a fucking masterpiece."
The Ultimate Braai Master,AND HE PRAYS!
The Ultimate Braai Master,I just wanna link [this legendary cover](https://youtube.com/watch?v=C7Q10bfWEMQ&si=EnSIkaIECMiOmarE)
The Ultimate Braai Master,A lullaby the breezes whisper..
The Ultimate Braai Master,"I didn't hate having Teela be the fous but I DID hate turning Skeletor into Joker and giving him the same exact abusive relationship with Evil Lynn.

We get it Kevin, you love batman and Mark Hamill but come up with something original."
The Ultimate Braai Master,I think it was over hated and I loved some aspects of it.  I do kinda question the direction it took though.  Who takes a show called HE-MAN and decides to make it mostly about the female side character?  Its odd.  Like a Barbie reboot that focused entirely on Ken.  But it was still overall enjoyable.
The Ultimate Braai Master,I didn't watxh the original  but the show was 80% good but the 20% that was bad really slowed down the show. Like you would have this great story then we would stop and focus on 1 issue or character and pause everything else. Made the show clunky. I am sure there is a version with a little editing it would be really good.
The Ultimate Braai Master,I loved it.
The Ultimate Braai Master,"No, just noisy Internet people."
The Ultimate Braai Master,Yes we did
The Ultimate Braai Master,"They wanted to flesh out the side characters so they took away He-man and Skeletor for the first half of the season and ""killed"" them off. Anyone with a half a brain knew they were coming back but half brains complained about wokeness because Teela was the main character. He-man and Skeletor come back in the second half of the season. The whole thing was done really well. Outside of the Fisto jokes that were cringey and get old quick I enjoyed it."
The Ultimate Braai Master,They watched it and talked about it. It doesn't matter if they liked it or not.
The Ultimate Braai Master,Hard to say. A certain portion of the internet definitely complained the loudest (many after not watching it or only watching the first episode or two) but if it got picked up apparently Netflix was happy with the numbers. So not sure it wasn't more noise than anything.
The Ultimate Braai Master,"It's nice to see people can finally dislike the show on this sub without being downvoted to oblivion and called sexist. I'm glad people have chilled out a bit.

I had a more mixed reaction to the show. Teela was a real drag and although Evil Lyn started off great, her character and arc fell apart after she supplanted Skeletor as the main villain. The side characters (including Adam which is weird to say about a He-Man show) were handled well though, so I think the show has some untapped potential if Smith forgets about the culture war and just writes a good show. I am cautiously optimistic about a second (or third? Who even knows with Netflix's release strategy) season."
The Ultimate Braai Master,"> nd for the most part the show was a joyless slog that damaged one of my childhood heroes. 

Watching old He-Man cartoons as an adult damaged the show/character for me."
The Ultimate Braai Master,The show is utter trash. Just awful.
The Ultimate Braai Master,"No one without a paper thin agenda is going to drag you over shitting on a Kevin Smith production

Although, i‚Äôll give credit where it‚Äôs due, the Clerks cartoon was pretty good and probably the last decent thing he worked on."
The Ultimate Braai Master,Not sure if I totally agree with it being an upgrade.
The Ultimate Braai Master,Yup
The Ultimate Braai Master,sounds like a continuation
The Ultimate Braai Master,Was also hoping it would start fresh. But no.
The Ultimate Braai Master,Maybe her role in Wolf Pack?
The Ultimate Braai Master,The new He-Man show was mostly derided by a few weirdos on YouTube and their fans who didn't watch it; it's great.
The Ultimate Braai Master,"Huge fan other both MotU and SMG and I have to agree. Not the only one in that series either. I loved how much it celebrated the original toys and show but somehow it all came together as a meh show. Still glad we‚Äôre getting more, though."
The Ultimate Braai Master,The Tron one hasn‚Äôt been renewed yet.
The Ultimate Braai Master,How so? It was extremely successful for them.
The Ultimate Braai Master,See if it works out for 'em
The Ultimate Braai Master,They love losing money
The Ultimate Braai Master,Read the show title again...
The Ultimate Braai Master,"You do know that they quickly brought him back to life, right?  Like who didn't see that coming.  And it was actually cool seeing the other characters try to get by without relying on He-Man for awhile."
The Ultimate Braai Master,"He-Man was literally in the majority of the episodes lmfao

He was only absent from like two or three of them"
The Ultimate Braai Master,Forgot that Adam was voiced by Mon-El. Clearly Smith loved Supergirl.
The Ultimate Braai Master,"One could even say they‚Äôve collaborated on multiple things.

Edit: I see you edited your comment to reflect their marriage."
The Ultimate Braai Master,I wanted them together in the show badly. Then I found out they‚Äôre married IRL and somehow my universe felt complete haha
The Ultimate Braai Master,Who doesn‚Äôt?
The Ultimate Braai Master,"Good for her. If I was successful enough to pick and choose what I worked on, I'd absolutely do stuff like this or being in awful movies for a free vacation. I'm never going to get mad at an actor for prioritizing a good time over their career.   
EXCEPT FOR YOU, TAYLOR LAUTNER! You thought you were too good to be Shark Boy again, but we all know where you came from, you coward!"
The Ultimate Braai Master,"No one likes to work.

I also don't mean that in a disparaging way."
The Ultimate Braai Master,"I have so much respect for that, and the way that somehow she and Freddy Prinze Jr have been able to keep their private lives mostly private.  Seems like one reason they are a successful couple. 

Married 20 years and they both look amazing and seem to have the right idea about work in general."
The Ultimate Braai Master,"Oh thank God.

I thought she had done/said something horrible. 

This was a much more benign explanation."
Hard Copy,The sheer build up and execution to the Watchers of the Wall is enough to qualify it alone. But I also love everything else about S4 as well.
Hard Copy,"Season 4 is definitely my favourite. Oberyn Martell, The Trial of Tyrion, death of the cunt king, just an amazing season."
Hard Copy,the craziest thing about this part of the story is that Seasons 3 and 4 are combined into one book. Imagine all the climactic moments from both these seasons but happening back to back to back.
Hard Copy,They should have given us Lady Stoneheart.
Hard Copy,"S4 is hands down my favorite season and one of the best seasons of television ever made. The watchers on the wall puts most movie battles to shame. So many quotables, so many awesome moments, I dare you to not get pumped when the giant is charging the inner gate.

Then there's Oberyn, there's the purple wedding, the Mountain vs the Viper(for better or worse), Sansa finally playing the game(short-lived as that was), Tyrions trial, Brianne vs the Hound... I could go on.

Such a shame it was all downhill from there."
Hard Copy,Season 4 is the peak of the show and books
Hard Copy,"Seasons 1-4 of GoT for me are easily the best pieces of television i've watched, ever. Only thing that comes close would be Breaking Bad, i personally prefer the fantasy epic's over anything, which is why i loved GoT way more. That's just me though.

I used to rewatch every single season of GoT before a new one would drop, was doing this since season 3 or 4 i think. That's how much i loved it.

After seasons 7 and 8 and what they did to the show, a large part of my life was just gone. No interest in further rewatches, no interest in book re-reads, in my head GoT was a great piece of television which aired for 5 seasons and then just abruptly ended, no idea why HBO cancelled it!

( the reason why i included season 5 which wasn't as good as season 4 is beacuse of episode 8 ""Hardhome"", which is a straight 10/10 )

Also season 1 of HotD was fine to me, but nowhere close to season 1 of GoT. I'm interested to see what they can do with season 2, but season 1 was just, eh. I have 0 interest in rewatching it.

The characters and dialogue in HotD for now are just orders of magnitude worse than early GoT 's Tyrion, Tywin, Jamie, Ned, Bobby B, Littlefinger, Varys.... the list goes on and on.

Viserys and Daemon had a few solid moments, but that's about it. I rewatched GoT season 1 alongside the books so many times it's hard to keep track of, couldn't be bothered to even think about a  HotD rewatch. I know i'm judging them by the insanely high bar of GoT, but it is a prequel"
Hard Copy,Shae was a much more interesting character in the show and giving her the same book fate made no sense to me. Season doesn‚Äôt work for me for that reason. Wish they went off book for her.
Hard Copy,"It has some of the best moments in the series but its where the cracks first started to show, in the fact everything that happened in the north before the attack on the wall was inconsequential filler."
Hard Copy,I preferred Season 6.
Hard Copy,Not even the best GoT season
Hard Copy,It's not even the best season of the series.
Hard Copy,"That was my favorite season of tv ever.

Until Arcane. Legit the most perfect season of anything I've ever seen."
Hard Copy,[deleted]
Hard Copy,it's not a game though. Remember goat stands for game of all time.
Hard Copy,"GoT season 4 is incredible. The stretch of 1-4 is unmatched 
Side note the best two episodes of tv ever to me tho are at the end of S6"
Hard Copy,GOT S1-S4 is the goat 4 season stretch of television in my opinion
Hard Copy,The 2nd half of book three is just heart-pounding thrill after thrill and season 4 adapted it damn near perfectly.
Hard Copy,Before season 5 aired. They did a big one day event where they were showing the final two episodes of season 4 on IMAX. It is one of my all time favorite movie going experiences.
Hard Copy,"Season 4 has great moments and the intro to Oberyn was flawless.

But its also where I see the cracks in the writing really forming. To me seasons 1 and 3 were all better overall, though 4 benefits from some great pivotal moments done well and more production budget, and was better than season 2 IMO."
Hard Copy,The first 4 seasons of GOT are among some of the best tv I've ever seen. It was very consistent. I'd argue that seasons 1-4 should've won or at least tied with Breaking Bad and other shows that beat it during that era.
Hard Copy,"It is the best GoT season for sure, but The Wire S4, The Americans S6, Breaking Bad S5 are a tier above that imo."
Hard Copy,"Straight banger of a cold open to start the season. Just a final ""fuck you"" to the Starks. This is what happens when you lose. There's no honor, no closure... They melt down your sword and burn your wolf pelt and erase you and your house and your legacy. CHILLS."
Hard Copy,So much happens here. Sansa escaping KL and coming into her own was a big jump in her arc. Jon steadily grows into a significant figure. Arya and Hound continue an unlikely bond with each other. Amazing stuff all around.
Hard Copy,"Oberyn and Tyrion's ""I will be your champion"" scene is the best in the show. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4eH46P-SoU

""'That's not a monster,' I told Cersei. 'That's just a baby.' And she said, 'He killed my mother.... Everyone says he will die soon. I hope they are right. He should not have lived this long.'"""
Hard Copy,Pedro Pascal really felt like the only actor/character that actually challenged Tywin and put him in his place
Hard Copy,That is one of the cuts I can live with. The question is: Where is the character going? We don't know since we don't have the ending for her.
Hard Copy,"That sucked, but what ***really*** got me was the way they resolved Tyrion's arc. 

In the books, he's constantly revisiting the trauma of his relationship with Tysha. She was the first woman Tyrion was ever with, and he wound up falling for her and marrying her. Tywin found out, and ordered her to be raped by his entire guard, then ordered Tyrion to rape her last before he sent her away. Tywin reveals he did this because she was just a whore who was conning Tyrion, and Jaime admits that he knew about it. This obviously fucks Tyrion up, both because of the obvious horror of what happened to her and the implication that nobody will ever love him genuinely. The whole Shae situation reopens this wound. 

When Jaime and Varys come to smuggle Tyrion out of the city, the subject of Tysha comes up. Jaime admits that he lied, and that Tysha was actually just a commoner who fell for Tyrion. Tywin forced Jaime to pretend otherwise to teach Tyrion a lesson. In a rage, Tyrion admits (falsely) to assassinating Joffrey, and tells Jaime (truthfully) that Cersei is fucking just about everybody she can behind Jaime's back. He then sneaks into the Tower of the Hand, murder's Shae in cold blood, then has an argument with Tywin about Tysha. This culminates with him shooting Tywin the second he calls Tysha a whore. 

In the show, all the Tysha stuff is dropped. Tyrion sneaks into the Tower of the Hand unprompted, and tearfully kills Shae in self-defense. He then kills Tywin for calling Shae a whore. He also has a tearful, sentimental farewell with Jaime. All in all, it was a much more sanitized happy ending for Tyrion, and wound up robbing both him and Jaime of their purposes in future seasons. Jaime was supposed to grow distant from Cersei, instead he keeps doing her bidding and we get whatever the fuck that Dorne arc was. Tyrion was supposed to stay on his trajectory of becoming a vengeful monster who wants nothing more than to hurt everybody who's wronged him. Instead he becomes a cheerful drunk who likes to make quips and ask invading queens to pretty-please not kill any of the people who wronged him."
Hard Copy,D&D didn't like all that fantasy stuff in their... Fantasy show.
Hard Copy,They made the right choice to cut it if they weren't going to dive deeper into what's happening in the riverlands.
Hard Copy,dont really agree. that storyline never went anywhere and the character literally had no character. im glad it got cut out of the show.
Hard Copy,"The ending of season 4 was a dud, all they had to do was put the Book 3 epilogue at the end and it would have been the best season of all time"
Hard Copy,">Seasons 1-4 of GoT for me are easily the best pieces of television i've watched, ever. Only thing that comes close would be Breaking Bad

That was the time man, when GoT fans and BB fans used to argue about being the GOAT. As a fan of both, I could barely pick one myself and was just glad to be watching such peak television.

But once again, it was just another proof of why BB having such a perfect ending is a such a milestone in television. It's just extremely rare to have shows that consistently good throughout and also nail the ending."
Hard Copy,I‚Äôd say the wire beats both breaking bad and GoT
Hard Copy,"man its just a tv show. and this type of commentary is so exaggerated and nostalgic.

yes the last few seasons were a drop in quality, no it wasnt the worst tragedy in human history and were still fairly entertaining."
Hard Copy,"Good writeup. Yeah those 4 seasons were supreme. Even when met with competition like Breaking Bad or Sopranos, what wins the case for GOT is how many levels above it was compared to others in ambition and scope. Basically it was much easier to mess up Thrones than something like Mad Men or BB. There are just so many parts in motion and a great skill was required to make it all coherent and thrilling.

> After seasons 7 and 8 and what they did to the show, a large part of my life was just gone.

Same. I dunno how many hours I have sunk in watching, reading, discussing, arguing over Thrones. 

>  the reason why i included season 5 which wasn't as good as season 4 is beacuse of episode 8 ""Hardhome"", which is a straight 10/10 )

Hardhome is magnificent. I always get chills during the last 20 minutes or so. Such fine piece of filmmaking.

HOTD was above average. The story isn't exciting and neither are the characters too compelling. But visually it is dazzling."
Hard Copy,"I agree, the Sopranos is so overrated Game of Thrones was better"
Hard Copy,"I don‚Äôt see why the show should affect your enjoyment of the books. They are such vastly different stories, in terms of themes explored, that I just separate the two.

Plus, the ending of the show had massive plot points straight up invented by D&D."
Hard Copy,I think you're selling HotD a little short there.
Hard Copy,"Everything about Season 4 was superb to me when first watching it, EXCEPT that exact point! In fact, I thought it was the very first time in all four seasons that GoT had a visible (that I noticed while watching it) plot hole. Everything about the show, every single episode, up to that point, felt like a naturally occurring story. One thing was leading to another with surprising but logical twists and turns.

Then this ""betrayal"" happened.

It was the first time ever it felt like something happening in the show wasn't a ""real-world"" (within the show) event - it was immediately immersion breaking. I was watching a character doing what she was doing not because her character development and the plot had led her to do that in her world, but because the writers of the fake TV show I was watching were making her do that on my TV screen, to force a new soap-drama plot point that they had not developed.

I remember looking on Reddit to see what others were saying at the time, and people were proclaiming ""yeah, that was supposed to happen, she was like that in the books too!"" But after looking into it, it sounded like in the books she never had any scenes where she was doing the right thing or actively trying to help when no one knew what she was doing. She was only pretending to do the right things and help when she thought it would be public to someone(s).

But in the show, there were multiple scenes across multiple seasons where she clearly tried to help and/or do the right thing when it did NOT potentially benefit her and when it would have been more beneficial if she did the opposite. Yet suddenly all at once ""yeah she has been pretending from the beginning"" - when it was very clear in the show (because we the audience were shown things that only we knew, despite other characters not knowing) she was not pretending in any episode previous to her betrayal.

They literally retconned her character. Was the first time I noticed a bad plot problem in GoT. As I said in another post, I have no confidence in GRRM's ability to give a good  conclusion to a long/complex series, but I don't think it is a coincidence he left after the end of season 4 due to ""disagreements"" with the showrunners. I bet how that plot/character was handled in particular was one of multiple final straws for him."
Hard Copy,Ouch. üò≠
Hard Copy,"Honestly in my recent rewatch I thought that was one of the best seasons of a TV show I had ever seen. They did a great job of building up to an amazing pay off that happens in the last two episodes with the Battle of the Bastards and Cersi's revenge. 

I can see why there was so much hype going into Seasons 7 & 8, and they definitely fumbled the ball at the goal line."
Hard Copy,The Winds of Winter is the best episode of the show for me.
Hard Copy,"That‚Äôs just not true. Plenty happens, some of it wasn‚Äôt well written but it doesn‚Äôt distract IMO from how amazing S4 is. I agree with OP"
Hard Copy,"Not true. There were solid climaxes on all of the first 5 seasons or so. Yes they fucked the conclusion and we are all lesser people because of it, but you cannot take those first 5 seasons away from us. They were magical"
Hard Copy,"Yep. And with GRRM not even finishing the books, I don't trust that the entire problem was only on those two idiot showrunners. Don't trust HotD at all on landing the ending, and considering they are keeping GoT with its trash ending as ""canon"" for the future of the same world that HotD takes place in, I don't even care about it in the first place. How can anything on HotD even matter or make sense in the context of the non sense that happens in the future?

But in response to the OP - yes season 4 was great. And it was the last great season too :("
Hard Copy,"Low key, Sansa had the best and most consistent arc of the entire series."
Hard Copy,Tiny pink cock
Hard Copy,My best guess is that she will be responsible for the death of House Frey in lieu of Arya.
Hard Copy,Ironically they made GoT S6-S8 typical fantasy with rushed ending
Hard Copy,"They wanted to take out magic to appeal to ""mothers and NFL players"". That's a real quote."
Hard Copy,"To be fair (I haven‚Äôt read the books too for what it‚Äôs worth), do we *know* it doesn‚Äôt go anywhere? I was under the impression it was kind of still developing as of the end of the most recent book."
Hard Copy,"> that storyline never went anywhere

I mean, that has more to do with GRRM not writing anything for the past decade. 

I think there will probably be a couple big roles for LSH in the books. First, she'll be a model for how fucked up the process of resurrection can leave a person. When Jon is resurrected, I think there will be a lot more uncertainty about his temperament, and whether it's even still Jon in there. 

Second, I think at some point she'll meet Arya. They both have similar goals in exacting revenge against those who wronged House Stark, in particular those involved with the Red Wedding. I think this will bring them together, and seeing her mother as a fucked up revenant murdering her way through the Riverlands will be what finally steers Arya away from revenge. It would be a more compelling resolution to that character arc than the Hound looking at her and telling her ""actually, don't kill Cersei"" at the eleventh hour."
Hard Copy,"Should D&D have cut Oberyn Martell because his only function was to get his head crushed by the Mountain?

Lady Stoneheart did serve a function: She was the main person exacting poetic revenge on the Freys. They gave this role to Arya, which is problematic because Arya was already a vehicle for a million other happenings.

It also gave us reasons why Jon Snow's resurrection may not have been a good thing, where in the show it was unambiguously the right decision.

That careful crafting of tension and ambiguity is something D&D forgot to do in the final seasons, something Lady Stoneheart would've given more of."
Hard Copy,Yea i think its safe to say BB wins in the consistency and ending department üíÄüíÄüíÄ
Hard Copy,Sopranos is overrated
Hard Copy,The Sopranos beats the Wire
Hard Copy,"it's a fun debate.  I think the wire is a better show, but i enjoyed breaking bad more."
Hard Copy,"> no it wasnt the worst tragedy in human history

Literally no one said this mate

>  and were still fairly entertaining.

Dude, now you're just making me laugh. If that was entertaining to you then holy shit lol. GoT went from a 9-10/10 rated show to 2-3/10 at best.

GoT was a global and cultural phenomenom in it's prime, and you're surprised people are still sad it got butchered towards the end? Man please, complete nonsense of a comment"
Hard Copy,"The Sopranos is in its own orbit. Nothing like that was made before, and in some ways, since."
Hard Copy,"You can't compare the Sopranos and GoT. They're probably my two favorite TV shows, but it's like they're not even playing the same game."
Hard Copy,The tea I heard was that he wasn‚Äôt getting his work done so D&D had to kick him off the show so he could work on the books. People say the Purple Wedding episode was good because GRRM wrote it when he only wrote the first draft. He was trying to introduce all the other book plots (like Ramsey‚Äôs wife who gets raped by dogs instead of Sansa) and the writers had to change it so it‚Äôd fit the show.
Hard Copy,"Yeah. I don't really understand why so many people seem to extend their justified anger about the last two season to S5+6 as well.

Yes, both seasons start to show some cracks, but they are not a big step down from the first 4 in my opinion. They also deliver a lot on the build up from previous seasons which to me almost makes up for some of the areas that were not as great."
Hard Copy,Then you have brain damage
Hard Copy,"Yeah the notion that an unfinished story has *no* value is a very pessimistic one. We spend plenty of time piecing together the stories of real history even though we know we'll never have a complete picture of it.

It's a fucking shame how it all turned out and I don't blame any individual for not wanting to engage with ASOIAF any further. I just hope that the prevailing narrative that the early seasons/the books are fundamentally tainted will start to shift soon and that they can be appreciated in spite of their conclusion or lack thereof."
Hard Copy,"5 was closer to 6-8 in terms of quality than to 1-4

It had some cool moments but the quality of plot, writing and dialogue took a tumble there"
Hard Copy,It took him 7 years to write book 5. And that was great. And before tv show even started. So I don't think that you can draw any conclusion. He is just a slow writer .
Hard Copy,"> Don't trust HotD at all on landing the ending

The story being told in HotD is already finished in Fire & Blood, they'll have to flesh it out a lot but it has a clear and defined trajectory."
Hard Copy,"There's also the theory the she will be used to resurrect Jon in the books, but that's kinda out there lol"
Hard Copy,"S6 still had some really good moments/episodes and the overall pacing was also fine, compared to S7/8.  
It was much better than S5, which doesn't get nearly enough hate IMO. I read the books afterwards and the way that the Dorne plot was butchered in the TV adaption is absolutely disgusting."
Hard Copy,"It's not a real quote. Someone misquoted them as they were live-tweeting an event, and publications ran with it. When the audio turned up with what they actually said, those publications didn't rush to correct themselves. [What they actually said:](https://watchersonthewall.com/benioff-weiss-reflect-decade-game-thrones-austin-film-festival/)

>‚ÄúWith the fantasy genre on television, tonally it‚Äôs very easy [go too] campy. Every scene, you change these two lines and it‚Äôs Monty Python and the Holy Grail,‚Äù Weiss jokes. ‚ÄúAlso, in terms of fantasy exposition, with proper nouns, it‚Äôs almost like a game of Jenga, where you‚Äôre trying to plow as many of them as possible without the whole thing falling over. In the first pilot, we had one too many and the whole thing fell over. Going forward, we tried to keep that stuff to a minimum, because we didn‚Äôt¬†just¬†want to appeal to a fantasy fanbase. We wanted them to love it, and we wanted our parents to love it, and people who play professional football to love it. We wanted to reach a wider audience, and to do that keeping the tone [under control] was very important.‚Äù"
Hard Copy,"Ashamed to admit I'm one of the people that this was for. Everytime the show turned into dragon fest i was bored. The dragons are easily my least favorite part of HOTD too. I like the political drama, not so much the fantasy elements."
Hard Copy,"Character was introduced in the final page of a book released 23 years ago. Since then, they've appeared in a single chapter from a book released 18 years ago.

I don't think GRRM has any idea what's going on with the character. I don't blame D&D for dropping her."
Hard Copy,"We don't know if it goes anywhere but the show has been long over and the books don't seem likely to be finished so really, it doesn't matter whether or not Stoneheart is vital to the book storyline.

But currently, she just seems to be a revenge zombie which wasn't something the show needed."
Hard Copy,"developing is a big stretch. there were a few chapters about it and they were quite vague. it was basically just a way to give some well-liked characters a reason to group up.

they arent even really mentioned in the 5th book afair, only up to the 4th book. and that shit was in 2005. almost 20 years, thats no longer ""developing"""
Hard Copy,"I recently did a full rewatch and I don't think the story lost much without her. I think D&D made the right decision. 

For starters, it would've been another storyline/character that D&D would have had to wrap up before the end and they clearly were struggling with what they already had. 

They had Arya do what, 1 or 2 scenes taking revenge on the Freys? They would have needed to add more to justify Stoneheart or it wouldn't have been at all worth it to keep/revise a character that had little to do with the main story. Did we need more scenes of the Freys being hunted down? Nah. Arya standing in place was fine and took care of the Freys. 

With John and Beric and the Mountain being revived from deaths, yet another character coming back would have lessened the stakes. (That said, D&D lessened the stakes anyhow with plot armor for the main ""good guy"" characters). 

They wouldn't have had time to shoe-in more of John struggling about coming back than what was already in the show.

There were so many other problems with the later seasons that Stoneheart would've just been a waste of time."
Hard Copy,"from that perspective it just wouldve been a total red herring (it is, as far as we know since the books wont be finished). jon snow is revived without any issue or drawback and nothing ever happens to him.

also thats a pretty weird comparison to those characters btw who are all well-developed and you know, actual characters with conversations and personality. vs zombie lady who doesnt talk and we know nothing of her intentions/motivations other than general revenge, and we follow her because?"
Hard Copy,I completely understand that. I think the wire is a heavier show to swallow. Some scenes are fucking brutal. I think breaking bad is a much more fun show and easier to watch. Idk if that makes sense
Hard Copy,"> GoT went from a 9-10/10 rated show to 2-3/10 at best.

this is exactly what i'm talking about, this is a completely ridiculous opinion.

you still watched every episode. you were so engaged that you cant let it go until today, years after it's over. *thats* a fucking 2 out of 10? lmao. what rating is the other 95% of garbage pumped out by every studio constantly?

it was entertaining to you as well, you just cant admit it because of the narrative that arose.

if it wasnt, you would have stopped watching it."
Hard Copy,Agreed. GOT is playing in a whole different league. Much harder imho.
Hard Copy,"Season 5 definitely wasn't as good as the first 4, true.

I always give it a pass though beacuse the last 3 episodes in season 5 were really fucking good, especially episode 8."
Hard Copy,"I think that 5 might might not have been as good as season 1-4 but it was a lot better than most other shows, and far from 6-8."
Hard Copy,"> It had some cool moments but the quality of plot, writing and dialogue took a tumble there

That's how I'd describe 6. 5 was a mixed bag and the lows were really low but it still felt like they were trying."
Hard Copy,Seems kind of wonky but who knows. I think George RR Martin has grown to hate his original ending so maybe he should just canonize his favorite fan theories.
Hard Copy,"Even if it were a real quote, a show aiming to appeal a broad audience is not a bad thing."
Hard Copy,"There is a middle ground between Season 1 of the Witcher in which they absolutely do have too many ""proper nouns"" introduced for most viewers, and then whatever it was that they gave us. The key is being a good writer, so, ya know..."
Hard Copy,They wish their writing was half as good as Monty Pyrhon.
Hard Copy,It may not be *verbatim* but that is still exactly what they said...literally the same message
Hard Copy,I agree with you and I'm not ashamed to admit. The political scheming was by far the best part of the show. The dragons and White Walkers were always much less interesting.
Hard Copy,"There are plenty of 100% drama shows out there, no need to ruin a well-written fantasy that incorporates politics into it very well.

I don't want full CGI dragon episodes either but if you completely remove them the story doesn't even make sense.  IMO they would be better used like a monster who you rarely see on screen at all, but that doesn't mean they don't exist and they are erased from the story.

If you are not a fan of fantasy you probably do not even realize what we are talking about with Lady Stoneheart.  Catelyn Stark comes back from the dead.  That's a pretty major plot point for a major character to come back from the dead, and they just left it out because they are clueless schmucks who didn't know what to do with it."
Hard Copy,[deleted]
Hard Copy,"Very few characters are mentioned in both the 4th and 5th books, they take place at the same time in different parts of the world. As of where the books left off, Lady Stoneheart is moments away from executing two of the most important characters in the story, I would say that definitely seems to be going somewhere."
Hard Copy,">For starters, it would've been another storyline/character that D&D would have had to wrap up before the end and they clearly were struggling with what they already had. 

Absolutely not, as the beginning of Lady Stoneheart was the end of Beric Dondarrion."
Hard Copy,People up here still justifying D&D's rampant cuts to the story and over-simplification of characters and themes despite this obviously ruining the show in spectacular fashion.
Hard Copy,"Lady Stoneheart represents revenge the way GRRM intended: limitless, destructive, unclean.

By giving this moment to Arya in a crowd cheering moment, Arya is no longer a real character on a real journey, she instead became an omniscient, fast travelling, can-do-no-wrong dora the assassin.

They removed the best twist of the books post-season 4, then ruined one of the best characters by offloading all that baggage on Arya, and then completely subverted the way revenge is meant to be portrayed as intended by GRRM.

All this... just because Stoneheart might've been a bit meaningless? Lol. At that point, they should've just removed Oberyn Martell too."
Hard Copy,"? Are you actually serious?

Yeah i was totally gonna not watch the last season of a show i've been watching/following/reading books about for years... ?

I have no idea if you're actually serious or just a troll, genuinely no idea.

Season 7 was bad and riddled with mistakes, ofcourse everyone also watched season 8 just to watch the train derail and burn completely.

Bro what are your comments genuinely?"
Hard Copy,"Yeah, ASOIAF was my favorite series and I was so excited (and scared) when the show was announced.    At the time I only knew one or two other people in real life that had actually read the books, and this show made my DAD read them.  And he doesn't read fantasy.    Anyways, I was scared they'd butcher the characters and turn them into caricatures.   The show improved some characters (Oberyn and Davos were show favorites of mine and I did not care for them in the books) and made others worse (book Jon >>> show Jon,  Mance Rayder) and some I feel were perfectly cast (Jaime, Cersei, Tywin, Tyrion,  Jorah).   Plus the show gave us that badass Mormont child leader.   She's the best part of the last seasons.  

Anyways, while the show had book source material it stayed great.  And when it started ""spoiling"" the books for me my resentment and anger (at GRRM, whether that's fair or not)  totally did contribute to my less charitable opinions on the storylines.   I had wanted to read these, not see the dumbed down version with missing character arcs try to wrap it all up.   And it was so underwhelming because the expectations were high AND I was bitter and predisposed to not be happy about it no matter how good it was.   And it did end up being... not great.   Maybe in book format we'd have had enough story added to make the ending work, but we didn't have that here.   But there's no way objectively that it's 2/10.   I'd say 6.5/7.    But if our expectations were for 10/10, then 6 or 7 feels like a huge letdown.   As big of a letdown as if a  6-7/10 average show had a 2-3/10 finale."
Hard Copy,"I feel like The Witcher was confusing on purpose though with the timelines, it's like they wanted you to always be wondering ""wtf was that about"""
Hard Copy,"Aside from the massive difference in tone... they're talking about fantasy *vocabulary*, not magic itself."
Hard Copy,"I know about Lady Stoneheart. I understand the fantasy elements are important to the story, I just said they're my least favorite parts. I didn't ask for them to be removed or anything."
Nothing But Thirty,"This show really missed the mark for me. Willow was a movie that Millennials grew up with but this was clearly geared to gen z who, I think, mostly don't care about the IP. Willow got sidelined as a character and the story felt like an incredibly generic YA fantasy plotline with Willow stamped on it. I had the same complaint about Wednesday but that at least kept the Tim Burton AF vibe through a lot of it, and who doesn't love Danny Elfman covering Metallica? Willow seemed to try too hard and then give up entirely. Watching Davis step back into the role was a treat but they... Fuck I'm not gonna say it.... Okay fuck it. They shortchanged him bad. And I say that with all respect to a living legend. His scenes, especially about his and Sorcha's history, were great. Everything else felt like Disney said ""How old could Millennials be? 10 years?"""
Nothing But Thirty,"I tried to do some research into viewership, and it was obviously not particularly conclusive, but certainly pointing towards lower viewership then required for a sequel series if the show didn't pick up a lot more viewers in later works. The bad word of mouth/user ratings probably didn't help.

https://medium.com/@plumresearch/willow-on-disney-b702a8874c74#"
Nothing But Thirty,"""Did he get EP?‚Äú

""He did.""

""Good for him!"""
Nothing But Thirty,"I think they really missed the mark with casting, script, and music selection. So many ridiculous lines, delivery, and terrible covers broke the immersion constantly."
Nothing But Thirty,"I liked the series enough. The one thing I didn't particularly care for, and I must be in the minority since I haven't seen it voiced elsewhere, was that it felt more of an ensemble, and that Willow was just a supporting character. I was really hoping for Warwick Davis to shine, and I think he can definitely carry a show."
Nothing But Thirty,They never made a legitimate season 1.
Nothing But Thirty,"If you didn't want to end up hemming and hawing about sequel possibilities, you should have made sure the people in charge had the property's legacy in mind when developing it, as opposed to their own personal checklist."
Nothing But Thirty,"Man is a legend, and genuinely a nice guy. I noticed him while traveling through Italy and he actually greeted me!!!!"
Nothing But Thirty,"I really enjoyed Willow. Here are the main things that bugged me: costumes were too modern, as was the language (including, but not limited to, swears). Most of all, though, was the modern music that ended most episodes and sometimes was played during the episodes proper. Why did the season end with ‚ÄúMoney for Nothing‚Äù? Best I could figure was because, if there is a second season, the characters will find themselves in Dire Straits."
Nothing But Thirty,If season 2 is more like episodes 6-8 than 1-5 I‚Äôm in.
Nothing But Thirty,"Show sucks.  So.  Bad.

Could've been handled smartly, wasn't.  Shame."
Nothing But Thirty,"Yeah I doubt it, even though they definitely aimed for at least another season or two.

* The show was weirdly paced, with some parts aiming to be slow paced while others are cut too quickly to compensate for list time. 

* The atmosphere jumps back and forth between being a YA CW show to a gritty fantasy. It's pretty odd jumping back and forth between characters making immature jokes and a plot significant character dying suddenly. I think we lost a third of the cast by EP 3 for... Dramatic impact? I barely even got attached to them.

* i'm not gonna pretend the original Willow was Shakespeare, but the dialogue was irritating in how modern it was. At least pretend you're in a fantasy setting.

* Every character quips like they're in a Joss Whedon production. At certain moments I'd beg the characters to STOP. TALKING.

* Story is for the most part predictable and dull.

* Character dynamics are forced. There's 0 chemistry between the cast, and Kit is the most insufferable, with Boorman taking second place for the most cliche quip-slinging scoundrel.

* Was it just me or Warwick Davis' didn't even try acting?"
Nothing But Thirty,This show was‚Ä¶ not good.
Nothing But Thirty,I don't think it makes it to season 2.
Nothing But Thirty,"If it actually gets renewed, please hire new writers."
Nothing But Thirty,They had a sequel book series called shadow moon that honestly would have been a better path for them to take.
Nothing But Thirty,"Being Gen X - I watched the Willow movie probably more than Star Wars New Hope. 

This show was not Willow - it was not the world of Willow. What was the scene with the 1800s frontier people all about? And don‚Äôt get me started on the trolls.

The show reeks of nepotism - Jonathan Kasdan does not have the talent of his father, nor the voice of his generation. Yet, time and again, he is given these huge projects because of his relation to his father.

I have little hope for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.

Maybe I would‚Äôve enjoyed it more if it didn‚Äôt have the ‚ÄúWillow‚Äù label.

I laughed a bit and thought there were good moments. But it didn‚Äôt feed off the world the original movie built.

I‚Äôm all for growing audience awareness and presenting new opportunities for people to become a part of a treasured franchise - some traditions need breaking down, but this series tore down the original foundation the movie built that endeared us to it years ago.

I just can‚Äôt believe people signed off after reading the scripts - especially the first one - just bad."
Nothing But Thirty,"It was ‚Ä¶ ok. Pretty trope-y YA stuff. Felt like they robbed pretty heavily from everything.  Multiple times it felt like Harry Potter meets LotR meets Fantasy Star Wars, but it was decent for what it was.  Would I ever re-watch or recommend though?  Nope."
Nothing But Thirty,But it‚Äôs so awful
Nothing But Thirty,"So did they finish the story arc, or is this something else I shouldn't start watching only to be disappointed in a cliffhanger"
Nothing But Thirty,(Insert Arrested Development reference here)
Nothing But Thirty,Won‚Äôt cry when they cancel it. It‚Äôs like the Disney Channel tried to re-imagine Game of Thrones.
Nothing But Thirty,"I wanted so bad to love this series.  I will do anything to support Warwick Davis, as he's legitimately one of my favorite people on this damn planet.  I LOVE the Willow movie.  I love love love the movie.  I do not subscribe to any streaming services, so when the show was announced, I figured I would be buying Disney+ for a month to watch it, but I was able to watch the first episode at my mom's house.

The first ep is all Ive watched still.  I just couldn't really get  into it.  It didnt grab me like the movie.  It felt *too new* and too unfamiliar.  I still loved seeing Warwick, I still love him as an actor and I know it mustve been so special for him to play Willow again, but Im struggling to get into it and it makes me feel bad."
Nothing But Thirty,I read that in the Arrested Development narrator's voice.
Nothing But Thirty,I didn‚Äôt even make it past the first episode.
Nothing But Thirty,"My kids and I loved it, started out a bit rough, but definitely got better. I hope it gets one more roll."
Nothing But Thirty,I wouldn't bet on it.
Nothing But Thirty,The story was ok but the dialogue was just awful. It was like watching a bad CW show
Nothing But Thirty,"I say this as someone who grew up with the movie and still quotes it to this day with friends: this is a truly terrible series. Atrocious writing, editing, casting and acting. From the top down, this production is full of baffling decisions. I would not let Kasdan near another franchise."
Nothing But Thirty,Let‚Äôs do a Legend series instead
Nothing But Thirty,"Was a fun and funny show, felt like a good d&d campaign or something. I hope they get renewed."
Nothing But Thirty,"Watched 2 episodes and gave up. The show sucked on so many levels, annoying characters with zero charisma. And how the hell is Davis not the main character. Movie is not that good to begin with, and the show just shat all over the nostalgia it had build up through the years"
Nothing But Thirty,"I looked forward to this show so much. And I haven‚Äôt felt so betrayed since..the last time they revived a franchise Millenials and Xers and Boomers loved and just made it for what old people think Gen Z will like. Horrific writing, editing, production, everything. Why would you do this. We waited forty years and this is what you do? Why, why, why?"
Nothing But Thirty,"I liked it, it was fun and didn't take itself seriously with some refreshing trope subversions. Would definitely watch a second and third season, as a show it's a nice palate cleanser fom all the other grimdark series."
Nothing But Thirty,"I just finished it.

I thought it was a limited series.

I thought it was far better than Reddit indicated to me lol.

I was not a fan of the film and so enjoyed this more."
Nothing But Thirty,"I was sooo disappointed by this series..

The terrible dialogue


The ""princess is a lesbian"" trope


The one good written character arc dying (to free princess from marriage obligations)


Willow just being mopey half the time

Me and wife loved the film and were giddy to see this show.. wife thinks they tried to force too much modern society into a fantasy story, and I just watched it to see if maybe it got better.. it didnt"
Nothing But Thirty,"The show wasn't great, but it was decent in spots. I actually enjoyed the anachronistic needle drops everyone else seemed bothered by."
Nothing But Thirty,I'm sure the hundreds of people watching will be eagerly awaiting a second season.
Nothing But Thirty,Season 2? Most people have never seen episode two
Nothing But Thirty,Please focus on editing and writing. I really liked some of the themes and visuals especially towards the end but new shows now have this amateurish feel to them.
Nothing But Thirty,I dropped this series after episode five because it jumped the shark.  Episode five was beyond awful.
Nothing But Thirty,This needs to be cancelled.
Nothing But Thirty,I loved it. To be honest I only watched it after having a few on my day off and strictly as a comedy. But I liked it a lot.
Nothing But Thirty,"""more story to tell"", there was barely any story in this season.
This show was just not good at all. Doesn't  feel anything like the original film."
Nothing But Thirty,"Willow was extremely derivative and by-the-numbers 90s nostalgia pandering, and I loved every minute of it."
Nothing But Thirty,"I was a bit irritated by the way they introduced the ‚ÄúWomen aren‚Äôt accepted as fighters/knights,‚Äù thing. In OG Willow, Sorsha was a badass; they could easily have made the setting accepting of women warriors. This made a lot of the conflict in the first episode feel really contrived to me."
Nothing But Thirty,"I named my kid after something in this amazing movie from my youth and now I am embarrassed because of the show.  I‚Äôm sorry kid, I guess I should have named you ‚ÄúMaze Runner Divergent.‚Äù"
Nothing But Thirty,"I had such high hopes for this man, so much hope and then Disney pissed all over it.

Terrible costumes, terrible script, mind numbing dialogue, incoherent and utterly baffling story.

Fucking hell"
Nothing But Thirty,"I liked it a lot, hope it gets a second season"
Nothing But Thirty,"I was 5 when the movie came out and my dad watched it on VHS all the time, he loved that movie. I thought it was good, but was never a super fan. I went in having zero expectations and I enjoyed it - mostly for its comedy and it felt like a D&D campaign. I didn‚Äôt rewatch the movie beforehand so it‚Äôs probably been 15 years since I‚Äôve seen the movie, but I did appreciate the cameos from the movie. There was definitely some random ‚Äúwtf‚Äù moments - but overall I enjoyed it considering how low my expectations were. I feel like they were trying to capture the same kind of audience Netflix gets from Stranger Things."
Nothing But Thirty,After watching episodes 1-2 I felt the need to watch it all the way through just to see if it could get worse and it did. Was really excited when I heard about the project but that show was bad.
Nothing But Thirty,"I was looking forward to this the teaser interview with warrick and cast was funny but the show was a train wreck, tone was all over the place. The orginal was average back in the day but had its moments but this was cringy as hell. Still better that the rings of power snooze fest"
Nothing But Thirty,"this show is very much like the witcher, were the main character has become a support character.  that said, i only watched 2 episodes then i bailed out, because the whole show looked like a bad cosplay. 

and the fun part is we all made fun of sony how they screwed up constantly, yet with the last of us they did everything right. stay close to the source material and let joel and ellie be the main cast.

it is really easy actually, give the fans what they want, instead coming up with your own imagination of how things should be."
Nothing But Thirty,"Willow is trash, forget about it."
Nothing But Thirty,Unfortunately the show is flaming hog wart dung
Nothing But Thirty,"For me, Willow was quite atrocious. 

The acting, delivery, music choice. I literally only like 2 of the characters, I hated Willow himself with a passion and to me, his acting was incredibly subpar. There were a couple of scenes that I enjoyed, but I won‚Äôt shed a tear if the show doesn‚Äôt get renewed. It was overall quite bad."
Nothing But Thirty,"It is a fun fantasy. An enjoyable mixture of action, romance and drama, with plenty of jokes. It seems like a three season arc is planned, if the Disney plus drops it, I would like to see it completed in comics or novels."
Nothing But Thirty,Can't wait to see the new adventures of Strong Female Character and Ginger Plank of Wood..Riveting stuff!
Nothing But Thirty,If there was ever a show that SHOULD be cancelled it‚Äôs Willow.
Nothing But Thirty,"Willow is horrible. I hope fantasy/scifi shows like this keep failing, while more shows like Andor and HoTD succeed. Course correction is needed."
Nothing But Thirty,"Willow was always a classic

couldn't stomach more then 3 episodes of that dog shit

wow"
Nothing But Thirty,This was another huge misfire. Identity politics is all these people care about. They latch onto an existing IP like leeches and then bastardize it.
Nothing But Thirty,this show needs to not be renewed.
Nothing But Thirty,"To people who actually finish it, was it good?  I only made it to episode two and had to turn it off."
Nothing But Thirty,The last two episodes of the first season were so bad that I don't feel like Season 2 anymore
Nothing But Thirty,This was awful. Such a disappointment. I stopped watching. Shame
Nothing But Thirty,Ron howard produced this fucking trash?
Nothing But Thirty,"I loved the hell out of this show.
Willow was one of my childhood favorites, because it was so weird and wonky but fun and adventurous.
I still remember picking up sticks in high school and saying ‚Äúuuuussse theee waaaaaand Willow!‚Äù to make people laugh. 
Hope it gets a second season."
Nothing But Thirty,"I forgave everything about the series until Money for Nothing kicked in. Great song , terrible choice."
Nothing But Thirty,I really disliked the first episodes and then someone told me to change the perspective. Since then I think of it as the attempt from a GM to run a Grimdark adventure and the players having other ideas. After that change I enjoyed it really
Nothing But Thirty,"Hey Ron:  Maybe make season two of ""Willow"" be about *Willow*."
Nothing But Thirty,Haha. Shoulda made a good show if you wanted to keep this job Ronnie.
Nothing But Thirty,"I am sure that a majority of the people saying that they didn‚Äôt like the series genuinely didn‚Äôt like it based on their perception of its merits or lack there of

However I think it should be kept in mind that a large minority of the people saying that they didn‚Äôt like the series are saying that because a large part of the story was dedicated to a lesbian romance

Due to that one fact alone most conservative people are not going to like this series but few of them will come right out and admit that that is a reason for them not liking it"
Nothing But Thirty,"There‚Äôs either a ton of shills or bots in this thread, I can‚Äôt quite figure out which."
Nothing But Thirty,I really enjoyed the series. I rooted for the characters. It garnered my full attention.
Nothing But Thirty,I saw the trailer & knew I would actively avoid it. Then I hear it‚Äôs obsessed with modern politics over story once it‚Äôs out & count my blessings I never wasted the time.  A damn shame as fond memories of the original.
Nothing But Thirty,"The Wheel of Time, Lotr and now Willow. All terrible adaptations. We are truly living in the dark ages of fantasy genre on TV."
Nothing But Thirty,"The show was trash.

Bunch of annoying brats."
Nothing But Thirty,Narrator: There was no hope or plan but no one bothered to tell Gob .
Nothing But Thirty,"A Willow TV show is a cool concept, but this tv show doesn‚Äôt meet expectations. The problem with the first season is that it shoe horns the distopian fantasy genre into Willow and it feels kinda hallow and lacks the worldbuilding the movie had. The film was also more of an epic fantasy."
Nothing But Thirty,"I really get baffled when I see the critiques of this show on reddit. I had never seen the movie so I watched it before jumping into the show. If you saw the movie, you knew Willow was a bit of a misfit and the show itself is a band of misfits that both equally get themselves into and out of trouble through both their strengths and weaknesses. Do I think the pacing was off in some episodes? Absolutely. But the people basically expecting Disney Lord of The Rings or Game of Thrones clearly never saw the movie and are just offering extreme critiques for the sake of offering extreme critiques."
Nothing But Thirty,A no for me. Not after you convince the Former CEO to cancel the Owl House for this.
Nothing But Thirty,"Shit, I better go watch it so they know I like it!"
Nothing But Thirty,"The show was just ok, but it felt like it just wasn‚Äôt that great.  It felt like it was maybe catering to the wrong audience, instead of focusing on making a great show."
Nothing But Thirty,"Is it bad if, at this point, if I see Erin Kellyman I just assume it's going to be bad? Not sure why, but she's basically an albatross for Disney shows and movies."
Nothing But Thirty,Good luck with that Ron.
Nothing But Thirty,I didn‚Äôt enjoy it at all. The writing was terrible and the acting subpar.
Nothing But Thirty,"My favorite movie growing up and I watched every episode of the show. I can see why people don't like it because it has weird edits and abrupt plot stuff, but I don't think the show took itself too seriously so I didn't either."
Nothing But Thirty,It‚Äôs an incredibly bad show. Shockingly poor.
Nothing But Thirty,"Wow what a disgrace to your legacy to put your name attached to this project, Ron"
Nothing But Thirty,Why are the heroes in today's series always women? Really boring. And unrealistic
Nothing But Thirty,"I managed to watch the entirety of She Hulk so I thought hey, I can watch this, plus top bloke Warwick is always a bonus. nope, an absolute dumpster fire, left midway episode 4, shows where literally everything in it is shit are a sight to behold but even such a sight has its limits"
Nothing But Thirty,"Fugghedaboutit. 

I bet the ratings are terrible right now and I hardly hear anyone praise it. Even those who ""kind of like it"" warn you it's boring and slow."
Nothing But Thirty,"I hope not, a real disappointment"
Nothing But Thirty,I definitely needed more LGBTQ drama in my Willow reboot
Nothing But Thirty,"Hmmm... So i've been reading some of the responses here - I can totally see why people were a bit ""disappointed""  and maybe I have low expectations (For instance, I liked Rings of Power and hope to get more seasons of that)  

Willow, which I have not finished yet!  On episode... 7 - but Willow... Has been a bit of a rollercoaster.  Semi slow start, gets really dark and entertaining, but have some slow episodes in between.  The episode I'm watching now has taken me a few days to complete haha, but I enjoy it so far.  I want to see more.  I think there definitely can be improvements.  

I'm recommending it to everyone even though I know they'll never watch it, just like I did with Patriot (And now that show is canceled because of my stupid friends and coworkers not taking my advice to watch grrrrr)"
Nothing But Thirty,"I hope not. This is the series literally no one wanted. It's so fucking bad.  Like dragon ball evolution and Velma bad.

Edit: You people's taste in entertainment scares me."
Nothing But Thirty,Does he have COVID?
Nothing But Thirty,I can't be the only one who doesn't give a shit about old 80's/90's re-hashes of barely popular movies. Let's get over this whole nostalgia phase and get some original content for once.
Nothing But Thirty,Renew Willow and drop that garbage show they call national treasure.
More than Friends,"Yeah, because it's fucking long."
More than Friends,"Kinda have to. I could be misremembering, but Part I is around 16 hours long, Part II was more like 35/40 hours, even if a lot of those events are concurrent

Edit: apparently I remember it being longer than it actually is! Still, I think it benefits from being approached as multi season arc, as someone who likes the vast majority of it"
More than Friends,"I‚Äôm curious where the split will be in-between seasons. Unless season 2 is going to be all >!Ellie hunting Abby and end with Abby confronting her at the theater, but I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre going to do the POV switch in the show because it could seriously dissuade show-only members if a season 3 starts and they only see Abby every week for over a month. Paralleling their days in the same episodes seems like a better fit for the medium.!<

Also I‚Äôm guessing they‚Äôre going to add a lot to the show because even thought Part 2 is twice the length of Part 1, it has a lot of extended combat scenes (moreso than Part 1) that will likely be taken out. I can see them fleshing out >!some of the side characters like Yara, Jesse, and Isaac were who fairly one-note in the game, and give more backstory to the Seraphites since they felt like set dressing for the most part.!<"
More than Friends,"I feel like part 2 could be adapted as two shorter seasons of 7-8 episodes, with hopefully a quicker turnaround. It'd suck to have to wait two years between seasons 2 and 3 after the likely 2 year wait (optimistically 18 months) between seasons 1 and 2."
More than Friends,If I don‚Äôt see the >!Rat King!< I will stop watching üêÄ
More than Friends,"That was obvious but what I'm curious about will be the timeline. Will they keep it like the game or make it more linear? Either way after season one, I trust them."
More than Friends,"Third season will be the NG+ playthrough where the story is the same, but all the gun stats are maxed out from the beginning."
More than Friends,I really hope they keep the crane
More than Friends,"Hope they keep the rope puzzles, I loved those."
More than Friends,Part I really needed that extra runtime as well.
More than Friends,"This sounds like they‚Äôll be able to give it room to breath and maybe it‚Äôll give them a chance to structure the story  in a way that feels a bit tightly focused. I love the story they told with the game, just feel like the way they told it could have been re structured a bit to work a bit better."
More than Friends,"Makes total sense. If the pacing is about the same as Season One, Season Two could comfortably take us to the natural ""inflection point"" that anyone who's played the game can appreciate.

Part II is a more complex story with a larger cast of major characters. Would definitely feel rushed if compressed into a single season."
More than Friends,"I don‚Äôt like a lot of the choices from part II, I think a few changes here and there and it can be received much better. 

It will probably still be an absolute shitshow online like when the game released."
More than Friends,Really wish the first season was longer
More than Friends,"I hope they take their time with it. This season has felt a little too rushed, in my opinion."
More than Friends,"This season was good but as it went on it felt like they were rushing through the plot and the finale felt just a little hollow as a result, almost like I was watching a catch-up summary for the next season. Doesn't help that every show now has to be 10 episode seasons or less. Looking forward to starting the game and getting the full effect."
More than Friends,[removed]
More than Friends,It was a significantly longer game so that makes sense.
More than Friends,I still think they could have made Part I into two seasons. Maybe not 10 episodes each season but something like 7-8.
More than Friends,"So I haven‚Äôt seen the show yet, but for those who have, is season 1 part 1 only?"
More than Friends,"All of yall thinking where to cut in the video game, but im guessing they could go the hobbit route and randomly introduce a love triangle between side characters. 

Oh lord"
More than Friends,"Absolutely hated Part 2 for personal reasons, but if they decide to adapt so that >!Season 2 is Abby‚Äôs background and story, maybe leave out the part that intersects with Joel and Ellie first so that new fans don‚Äôt know who she is and they get to bond with her character and then either end Season 2 with their initial confrontation or start S3 that way and have the entire season focus on their conflict!< I would give it a shot.

Main reason why I didn‚Äôt like Part 2 was >!The way they wrote Joel‚Äôs ending!< and >!the game‚Äôs ending!< being absolutely disappointing for me. But I hope they make it work somehow."
More than Friends,The drop off of viewers is going to be interesting after a certain event.
More than Friends,"everyone working ""spoilers not spoilers"" into their comments, suck, for those of us who didn't play the game, and are just trying to enjoy the story presented by the show"
More than Friends,"Huge spoiler take

>!show dies when joel dies!<"
More than Friends,This last episode felt rushed with 9 episode season for sure
More than Friends,Why don't they just make a couple seasons that explore what happened between the games?
More than Friends,This show started off amazing. I got bored as the season went on. I‚Äôll watch season 2 but I‚Äôm not excited about it.
More than Friends,"I personally didn‚Äôt really think Part 2 was that good, but I can definitely see it being handled a lot better in a television series format, especially considering Part 2 will be stretched longer to make everything feel more developed and complex."
More than Friends,"a 3 season show feels about right, I'd like it to have a definitive end there and not just say ""hey, success, lets keep it going!"""
More than Friends,"I hope the actress that plays Ellie will be able to pull off the older character. I'm assuming so, but still makes me nervous"
More than Friends,"I thought they flew through David‚Äôs storyline. I‚Äôm loving this so much that I don‚Äôt mind if they stretch it out, I know they won‚Äôt ruin it and I trust that they will stick to source material and not exhaust the series"
More than Friends,"Should have done the same for part 1. One of the most poorly paced shows I've ever watched. I'm glad they stayed pretty true to the game but damn, they could have done so much more."
More than Friends,"I think they are between a rock and a hard place with the next season. If they follow the games' story there will be a ton of people that hate it, if they dont it will be admitting that the direction they went with the game's story was essentially a mistake. Will be interesting to see how they navigate it."
More than Friends,[removed]
More than Friends,I imagine you‚Äôd have to just for pacing purposes when translating it to live action formats. The fairly early game twist would be jarring if they just hit that off the beginning episode of season 2. Not to mention there is plenty of in between game happenings that could be made into great character development moments to make the events of the 2nd game more impactful in tv format
More than Friends,they could have adapted season one into multiple seasons. they rushed through the plot points I thought.
More than Friends,Money
More than Friends,"Probably should do their own spinoff, too, explore the whole world, get as wild as they wanna."
More than Friends,"Could have done that with s1 too, felt rushed ino"
More than Friends,"I think they will probably pseudo-alternate between TLOU and HOTD every year, like they did with GOT and Westworld years prior. 

They now have seasons 2 & 3 mapped out. HOTD S2 is coming out in 2024, so they might do TLOU S2 (first half of Part II) in 2025, and do HOTD S3 in the same year (2025) or 2026 and do TLOU S3 (second half of Part II) in 2026 (since it would be a two-parter story, I don‚Äôt see this coming out in 2027). 

Maybe a break after 2026, and they might have revealed or even released TLOU Part III by then. So possibly TLOU S4 in 2028."
More than Friends,"First game needed at least 3 or 4 more episodes. Or 2 seasons. With Joel almost dying as the finale/cliffhanger.

Glad they will be making game 2 at least 2 seasons."
More than Friends,"Pitch Meeting:  
 *So, you got a tv show for me?  Yes sir I do. You know how you like money sir.  Ohhh yeah, is that what the script is about?  Well it can be sir. I was thinking we take a single story and make it last 3  or 4 seasons.  Oh very cool, sounds like the fans will love waiting 4 years to watch it.  I think so sir*"
More than Friends,"I haven‚Äôt played 2 because it seems like a despair burger (I get notoriously dark with stuff like that)

Is it worth it though? Im seeing people saying it‚Äôs an experience not worth missing. May have to change my mind‚Ä¶"
More than Friends,"Without spoiling the games, is season 1 the entirety of part 1? Like part 1 and season 1 ended at the same spot?"
More than Friends,"This is great news. People already felt this first game felt rushed, and the second is twice as long."
More than Friends,"So I gotta say... the show was a pale comparison to the game. Performances were flat (Check out side by side comparisons if you don't believe me) It felt really small in scope and severely rushed.  Felt like a local theater troupe rendition of a Hollywood play. 

If I had never seen the original, I would have probably loved it, because I didn't know all the stuff they cut out and how stellar the performances were. Yes, I know episode 3 was a nice story, but it wasn't worth cutting out an entire section of the game where you really come to understand Ellie and Joel as characters. BUT, I think most issues I had with the season was a budget problem. They couldn't afford to tell a grand adventure. So, with the big success, maybe they can do the story justice.   IMO, the first game should ideally be covered in two seasons instead of one.  Splitting up the second game will improve pacing a lot."
More than Friends,Shit‚Ä¶ that scares me! If you played the games you know why
More than Friends,Of course Neil wants his proper baby to span into 2 seasons while the S01 finale was 46 minutes
More than Friends,Tbh wonder how pedro/joel being done durty is gonna go with tv audiences. Ppl definitely hated it and i personally hate the entire plot of the second part.
More than Friends,"For once I wish they'd deviate from the source material. Unfortunately, I found the plot of part II to be lackluster and not that interesting."
More than Friends,loved the second game but i hope the show improves some narrative issues that part 2 have.
More than Friends,I know I'm alone on this but I wish they'd come up with new stories that take place in between the games. I want more world building and what not
More than Friends,Milk that cow dry baby. After that we will have 3 spin offs and prequal
More than Friends,"I think that makes sense.

I think Craig Mazin is perfect with character dramas, and was STILL surprised at how well-developed the characters of TLoU are.

But we all know the biggest challenge is TLoU2 by a *mile*. They all have their work cut out for them trying to get me onboard with that story. Even just trying to connect the two stories meaningfully... because Drunkman failed so spectacularly...

I like The Closer Look's YouTube video arguing how the story works wonders as an adapted TV series that can give the perspectives they need to give the story scope. Much better than a video game that has to frame the game through a couple perspectives at most.

I say this because TLoU tried to pull a grand perspective shift and failed because it disrespected the player and played then for sympathy, constantly trying to twist them into hating the protagonists...

I don't know if it's possible to salvage TLoU2. But I think if anybody can do it, it's Mazin. And I can believe it's going to take 2 seasons to get there. I'm praying they can find two complete stories that fill in the gaps of story in the game. With what I've seen of S1, I'm at least hopeful they got a shot."
More than Friends,"Naughty Dog needs to get on finishing its story.

I'm getting Game of Thrones flashbacks."
More than Friends,"God I'm actually low-key dreading them adapting LoU2, if only cos we're gonna get a repeat of all the awful discourse surrounding it, which among other things led to actresses/creators getting death threats, the Last of Us sub devolving into another redpill/gamergate hive and has even infected this very thread when I scrolled towards the bottom comments, only this time it won't just be contained to gaming sites."
More than Friends,"Last episode sucked though, they cut way too much and it felt rushed."
More than Friends,"They are going to have to. I think they start losing viewers once they >!kill Joel off, so hopefully he stays alive for most of if not all of season 2!<"
More than Friends,"Lol they speed run/drag their feet through the beloved first game in one season, but now want to drag out the maligned and controversial second in multiple seasons? 
Yeah ok makes perfect sense üòÇ"
More than Friends,Hopefully with better pacing. My expectations are pretty low because season 1 was kind of weird.
More than Friends,"Yeah, I loved the game but felt it was a couple hours too long: condensing all of that into 9 episodes would be a nightmare."
More than Friends,"Game 2 seems to be a passion project of Druckmann based on the way he presents the game. I‚Äôm not surprised that he‚Äôs basically brushing aside the first game to start work on the second. 

I‚Äôm curious to see how it will be adapted considering the gameplay in game 2 is what held it up, not the story. Maybe he‚Äôll listen to criticism and change up the way the story was presented, but he‚Äôs been pretty bullheaded and doesn‚Äôt seem like the kinda guy who think he can do wrong."
More than Friends,First game should also have been two seasons honestly.
More than Friends,"I mean hell, I thought the game was over and then it switched perspectives

Then I thought it was over *again*, and it switched perspectives *again*

They‚Äôll definitely go the GOT route and have rotating perspectives or else people will tune out when season 3 doesn‚Äôt feature anyone you really know. It would be like if they made season 4 of GOT with *only* the parts about Dorne in the books."
More than Friends, Shoulda done that for part 1 too
More than Friends,I LOVED the narrative of TLoU. I couldn't finish TLoU2.
More than Friends,This'll be a beautiful trainwreck. The discourse will happen again cause they'll double down.
More than Friends,"Because they know ""you know what"" is going to turn people away and they want to delay it as much as possible"
More than Friends,They‚Äôre adding to the show to keep certain characters on screen for longer.
More than Friends,"I don't get all the excitement and hub-bub about this show. I'm up to episode 6. I mean, it's good, and I definitely didn't expect Nick Offerman to make me cry, but..... It's just a rehash of The Walking Dead, no?"
More than Friends,"if the seasons are only 10 episodes, that's unsurprising"
More than Friends,"honestly this first part should of been two seasons it felt so rushed yet it had entire pointless filter episodes about characters that had 5 minute in the game. 

Would of really liked to see more of the infected as a threat.  They really felt like a non threat. And while the game is almost Post - Post apocalypses where humaning it coming back around and the biggest threat to humans is humans.  They (infecteD)  really felt like almost a complete non threat ."
More than Friends,"Why not just do a longer season? Remember when shows used to have like 24 episodes a season? I get wanting to cut costs, cut filler, etc., but it really feels like with a lot of the shorter season shows nowadays that you lose so much character development by only having 10 episodes to work with. We just don‚Äôt know anything about characters anymore. There is no room for the relationship between character and audience to just take a breath together."
More than Friends,"It's going to need some reworking. The plot in TLOU2 was pushed along by the characters trying to out stupid each other, it was infuriating. I finished the game hoping that they all die."
More than Friends,Milk it baby.
More than Friends,"Just don‚Äôt nerf the violence from the second game. Don‚Äôt want them softening it up, the second game was amazing"
More than Friends,"Part 2 is a story that's undermined by and undermines its medium, If done well it will shine and be appreciated much more in the TV show."
More than Friends,"If they >!kill Joel like they did in the game,!< I will stop watching the show right then and there."
More than Friends,Redo season 1 as 3 seasons. I feel like the sped through it.
More than Friends,Last episode was ass
More than Friends,Gotta milkü•õthat intellectual property.
More than Friends,"I wish they had done this for season 1 instead. It felt so rushed, and I was in no hurry to get to the story of the second game.

The stakes are so low compared to saving humanity from Game 1, and I hated what they made the character of Ellie become, and disagreed with her motivations for most of the story. It had all the sensibilities of a Rambo movie wrapped in a pretentious bubble, and had none of the heart of the original."
More than Friends,No thanks
More than Friends,"I hope they change the order of some events. Whilst I think it had the basis for a fantastic game, the pacing and structure left so much to be desired. I just didn't care what happened because of the way it was. They kept trying to force this one thing on you and I didn't care."
More than Friends,They did this exactly backwards.  They should've made TLOU at least 2 seasons.  The adventures of Joel & Ellie is what people wanted.
More than Friends,Could have easily done that with season one too
More than Friends,"This was clearly the plan, all along. Rush to Part II quickly."
More than Friends,"Hopefully, ""adapt"" means change that story completely"
More than Friends,"People are thinking that the next seasons are going to be as negatively divisive as the second game was.  I think this may be incorrect.

1. Hopefully they will have learned their lesson from the games and keep everyone in character this time.  This was a preventable problem with the game that could have been solved with better writing.  So with a little luck, they can solve the problem here.
2. We can have a bit more time to build up the new characters.  It's hard to do that in a game where everyone really wants to get back to playing the characters they know.  
3. This format may be much more forgiving to the story they wanted to tell.  One of the problems that turned many people off was being forced to play as someone you felt was the enemy.  That is tricky to pull off.  But we are used to seeing different points of view in shows.  Cersei was a fan favorite despite being, well, Cersei.  

We'll see how they handle it."
More than Friends,"So wait‚Ä¶. If I watch the last episode of season one tonight, I don‚Äôt need the game?"
More than Friends,"Excellent. The game itself has cliffhangers within cliffhangers, it‚Äôs only right the show leaves us wanting more as well. All the stories and character arcs might not feel rushed"
More than Friends,So they could drag out that crappy storyline? Ugh!
More than Friends,They should have did that with the first video game
More than Friends,"The second season is just going to be the rattlers subplot confirmed.

/s"
More than Friends,"I hope they can make it a little more compelling than the game, just because it is hard to follow game/season 1. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I think it‚Äôs a good story but it felt dragged out"
More than Friends,Could honesty be 3 season if they are are short as season 1. 9 episodes with 2 being self contained flashbacks made it fly by.
More than Friends,"I‚Äôm really curious/excited to see how they adapt this game. I‚Äôm a huge fan of part 2 but I think by far the worst aspect of it is the pacing and a lot of that was down to how the story was structured, so I wonder if they‚Äôre gonna change that for this show."
More than Friends,Gotta stretch that oooouuuuuttttt mang.
More than Friends,I‚Äôd love to see them have a season that explores Ellie and Joel living in the community. With the season finale being the beginning of TLoU2. Have the end of S2 be the golf club scene.
Love Again,"He was excellent in Dune which is a big blockbuster, still waiting on him to play a badass hitman ala John Wick later down the line"
Love Again,Isn‚Äôt his deal with Marvel different then the ones other MCU actors have? Like he‚Äôs only contracted for Moon Knight and that‚Äôs it?
Love Again,Pedro Pascal and Oscar Isaac buddy cop movie please
Love Again,He‚Äôs an exceptional actor.
Love Again,I love Moon Knight! I‚Äôm surprised so many people hate it. It‚Äôs the one thing I look forward to on Wednesdays now. Granted I‚Äôve never read a single one of the comics.
Love Again,"If I had already been in one of the best Coen movies, I‚Äôd be fine with taking some giant paychecks, too."
Love Again,Watching him as Steven has left me hoping that the long ‚Äúin production‚Äù Disney rendition of *Hitchhiker‚Äôs Guide to the Galaxy* gets off the ground and casts him as Arthur. I watched a couple of the episodes just thinking ‚Äúthis is the best on-screen version of Arthur Dent I could ever hope for.
Love Again,Funny thing if you give an actor a chance to apply their skills they can find it rewarding.
Love Again,He was in X-men?
Love Again,[removed]
Love Again,"Was this written by his publicist? Jeez, at what point do we stop calling it ""journalism"" and instead refer to it as PR?"
Love Again,"BREAKING NEWS: STAR HAS NOTHING BAD TO SAY ABOUT HIS TV SHOW

like fr it‚Äôs just tiring."
Love Again,‚ÄúVersatile screen heartthrob‚Äù
Love Again,"I love the guy but you can only be in so many of the worlds most massive franchises before the whole indie-shtick comes across a little silly. It's fine, no need to explain."
Love Again,"NYTimes with the usual Disney sponsorship. Dude just killed it in Dune which outclasses Moon Knight in terms of size and production quality.

Edit: they could have phrased it differently to emphasize that his role in Moon Knight is considerably more important within the scope of the project."
Love Again,Money is a fantastic motivator
Love Again,Hopefully they do a season 2
Love Again,"unlike star wars and xmen, moon knight has good writing and dialogue so i can see why he likes this but disliked the former

it's like people prefer quality over mediocrity, crazy, right?"
Love Again,Buddy was just in Dune. I don‚Äôt get it.
Love Again,That last epi was a tour de force of his acting chops. I expect great things from this man.
Love Again,"Despite his best (?) efforts, Moon Knight is aggressively average television"
Love Again,"He‚Äôs a wonderful actor, but I can‚Äôt get into Moon Knight for some reason. I find it boring!"
Love Again,"He is amazing in moon knight, the fact he can play two characters that are so different from eachother is crazy. There wasn‚Äôt many times where I thought to myself this is the same person playing the roles. He does such a good job, they really feel like separate people. Adam Sandler wishes he could do as good of a job playing two characters in something. Haha"
Love Again,"The general consensus about the show is pretty good and I'm personally really satisfied with what they've done with it. The production shows an excellent care for character details, from the sound to the visual design of the show and Oscar really acts his brains out here. EP 5 blew it out of the park though and it and me shedding a tear for sure. 

Good show!"
Love Again,I love the Karl Pilkington mention. That guy is an uncommon genius.
Love Again,"He‚Äôs great and Ethan Hawke is great but the show, like most of the Disney+ shows, just isn‚Äôt clicking with me. They offer some unique things but overall just feel extremely generic and never have a payoff that feels worth your time that you invested."
Love Again,Am I the only one who wishes it was a show about being Moon Knight instead of a show about NOT being Moon Knight?
Love Again,I heard he doesnt hate the money either but im not sure could be wrong.
Love Again,Dune?
Love Again,"Dude has so much range, he‚Äôs one of my favorite working actors."
Love Again,"I think he did a great job in Moon Knight! Wasn‚Äôt a fan of him in Star Wars, but probably because those movies sucked so bad (my opinion)."
Love Again,Best actor possible for this role. His performance is outstanding
Love Again,Loves that Disney money
Love Again,"I watched Ex Machina at a local indie theater last night and let me tell you, this man is so brilliant. I mean we all know it. His only bad role is Star Wars and it wasn't his fault. Star Wars wasted many incredibly talented young actors. Man, I'm just such a fan of Isaac."
Love Again,"Yeah, probably because the new Star Wars movies sucked, and he‚Äôs the guy who said ‚Äúsomehow palpatine returned.‚Äù 

I wouldn‚Äôt want to do another blockbuster either."
Love Again,"He knows he was in Dune, right?"
Love Again,this series will be forgotten like the others‚Ä¶ remember Loki!? Lol
Love Again,Haven‚Äôt been too impressed with Moon Knight this far
Love Again,Versatile? What's he been in to show this?
Love Again, his acting is on point as always  the series however is just meh
Love Again,Can you stop with these articles? We don‚Äôt care. Pay for ads if you want to advertise whatever movie
Love Again,"What he was looking for was a paycheck and right now, these are where  the paychecks are. 99.9% of what actors say is acting."
Love Again,I wish the writing was better for Moonknight. It's kinda boring in my opinion. Thought he was good in Dune and wished we got more scenes with him.
Love Again,"""versatile screen heartthrob""...."
Love Again,His Star Wars character was supposed to be killed off and he begged JJ to keep him alive. After the trilogy ended he was like yeah I should have let them kill Poe. The sequel has some of the worst Star Wars characters Poe was absolutely pointless.
Love Again,I never realised how good his accent was until I heard someone who sounded like him on British TV.
Love Again,"Lol the Sequel trilogy probably left some emotional scars.

And his character was wasted beyond belief by both JJ and RJ."
Love Again,I'd be a little bummed considering we've barely seen Moon Knight fight at all.
Love Again,I wish I could find satisfaction in moon knight.
Love Again,üòÄk what the fuck is this title.
Love Again,I‚Äôve got to say I‚Äôve watched all of moon knight so far and I don‚Äôt really get it. I am a huge marvel fan but haven‚Äôt read any of the moon knight comics. Isaac Is brilliantly convincing as two characters (don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a spoiler) but apart from his entirely compelling performance I feel the show isn‚Äôt offering much. It certainly isn‚Äôt in the same realm as wandavision.
Love Again,"I love how honest he is and doesn‚Äôt immediately trash everything

You got an earlier shot at comic-book adaptations with ‚ÄúX-Men: Apocalypse.‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt well received, though I think it gets a bad rap. Is that a role you‚Äôve disowned?

No, I don‚Äôt disown it. I know exactly what I went in there wanting to do and the reasons why. There were these amazing actors involved that I really wanted to work with, [James] McAvoy and [Michael] Fassbender and Jennifer Lawrence. I collected X-Men growing up, and I loved Apocalypse, I just found him such a freaky, weird character. And then you get there and you‚Äôre like, Oh my God, I‚Äôve got all these prosthetics on. I‚Äôve got a suit on. I can‚Äôt move. I can‚Äôt see anybody. All these actors I wanted to work with ‚Äî I can‚Äôt even see who they are. I still think back to that time with fondness. I wish it would have been a better film and that they would have taken care of the character a little better, but those are the risks."
Love Again,It sucks that his only former experiences with these big blockbusters were poorly written trash. Star Wars sequels and then X-men Apocalypse had to have left a bad taste in his mouth
Love Again,Maybe because the character actually had an arc planned out ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Love Again,Is it me or could he pass for Ash Williams when he‚Äôs clean shaven?
Love Again,"He is in too many things now though. Seems like every show I watch has him in it which is kind of bad. Instead of being able to get into the show, your brain keeps thinking if other movies he‚Äôs been in."
Love Again,Love that my boy MK got some solid respect on his name now.
Love Again,He came on my radar when I saw in SW. But moonknight has made me appreciate him a lot as an actor
Love Again,Dune isn‚Äôt a blockbuster?!? What????
Love Again,And this has easily been his best franchise pick yet.
Love Again,They guy‚Äôs range in particular is phenomenal. Future hall of famer for sure
Love Again,He did say last week on an YouTube interview that he‚Äôll do another Star Wars if he ever need to buy another house.
Love Again,"Am I the only one who thought Kelsey Grammer played Apocalypse in the movie right up until now?

üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
Love Again,"""learned to love blockbusters again""
==
""learned to love getting money"""
Love Again,"The sequel trilogy fucked a lot of us up, but we had the prequels to prepare us for it."
Love Again,So we forget about Dune?
Love Again,"I felt so bad for him after X-men Apocalypse. He would have made a fantastic, empathetic villain and instead they stuck him behind 40 pounds of prosthetics and gave him nothing to do. 

Moon Knight has been an absolute blast for many reasons, but the first is watching him get to have fun and stretch his **considerable** >!Acting Chops!<"
Love Again,I thought this was a tv show
Love Again,It's just depressing to hear good actors talk about taking junk roles for cash. Ugh
Love Again,Why he look cracked out. Johnny depp looks better dressed in Jack Sparrow make up
Love Again,I prefer Marvel plots that aren't about the usual ensemble and take on other genres like Shang Chi and now Moon Knight. Haven't seen a good old Egyptian mummy caper in awhile and the mental element makes a richer story.
Love Again,Boooo
Love Again,I‚Äôd learn to love them again if Marvel paid me too.
Love Again,"He has a unique look, like a young Al Pacino or Dezi Arnez. The camera is good to him."
Love Again,"He is in many good, great and decent films. Sadly Moon knight will never be one of them."
Love Again,He‚Äôs also really really hot‚Ä¶ that is all
Love Again,Jesus h these headlines get more ridiculous by the day
Love Again,Now I‚Äôd love to see Jon Boyega and Daisy Ridley get some decent Marvel roles as well. Those three really got handed over an odd trilogy.
Love Again,I‚Äôm adoring his performance in moon night. The last episode dealing with childhood trauma was unbelievably heavy and showed an incredible amount of Oscars range as an actor.
Love Again,I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a good show and he‚Äôs a great actor but I‚Äôm beyond done with Marvel and DC media
Love Again,Too bad the show is garbage.
Love Again,I thought you meant Blockbuster the video place when I first read this. I was thinking - what a weird time to rediscover a love of 90's VHS rentals.
Love Again,"Moonknight is reminding me of the Legion show a little bit.  Really enjoying it.... and if you haven't watched Legion, you should."
Love Again,"Didn‚Äôt read the article, just came here to note that that is a weird picture of oscar isaac"
Love Again,"He is a good actor. I really just don‚Äôt enjoy Moon Knight. The whole series thus far has been nothing but exposition with a total of like 10mins of stuff happening. 10mins of stuff within 5 episodes isn‚Äôt gonna cut it for me. I find it pretty boring, but I love Marvel stuff so I watch in hopes that one episode will finally be a WOW episode. Hasn‚Äôt happened yet."
Love Again,"I'll admit, we've been pleasantly surprised by this series!"

Love Again,"Serious spoilers in that NYT article.

As others have pointed out, I agree the show can be slow and as a viewer, I was not invested in the characters until the second to last episode. However, I applaud the writers and show runners for what I consider to be an ambitious approach to the show and how they introduced the characters.

--Spoilers--

>!The first two episodes focus almost entirely on developing Steven Grant. You learn about his job, love of ancient history, and his unsuccessful dating life. Marc Spector is later introduced and you have what appears to be two fully independent people sharing a body.!< 

>!Finally, you learn that Marc Spector has essentially multiple personality disorder due to an abusive childhood and Steven Grant was created to cope with that trauma. AND THEN, they kill Steven off, a character they spent more time developing. Five episodes into the season and you finally give a shit about Marc Spector and better understand his character.!<

I hope there is a second season with Oscar Isaac."

Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Graceful Family,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
Graceful Family,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.
Graceful Family,No Atlanta? Both seasons last year were incredible
Graceful Family,Pachinko is the most slept on series of 2022
Graceful Family,"1. She hulk
2. Ted lasso
3. Ms Marvel
4. Harley Quinn show
5. Lord of the rings
6. Spy x family 
7. Chainsaw man
8. Loki
9. Mob psycho
10. Hot D"
Graceful Family,Which ones did you see? ü§î amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?
Graceful Family,"> is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
Graceful Family,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
Graceful Family,üôÇüíï
Graceful Family,It‚Äôs great but it‚Äôs depressing.
Graceful Family,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
Graceful Family,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
Graceful Family,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
Graceful Family,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7‚Ä¶ cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
Graceful Family,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
Graceful Family,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
Graceful Family,Oh my bad. I‚Äôm late to the party.
Graceful Family,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
Graceful Family,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

damn. guess i gotta hurry and check this one out now. lol."
Graceful Family,"You should check out Kotaro Lives Alone, such a good show!"
Graceful Family,"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven‚Äôt managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
Graceful Family,I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!
Graceful Family,"I personally disagree on Season 3 being the best for Scrubs, Buffy, and Arrested Development (though I generally understand the argument for Scrubs and Buffy).

I seem to usually prefer Season 2s to more shows than Season 3s.

That said, I might add the following shows to the list of ""Season 3 was their best"":

A Series of Unfortunate Events

Castlevania (though I suspect I'm in the minority on this one)

Runaways

Star Wars Rebels

The Legend of Korra

Weird that most of these are animated since I don't watch that many animated shows."
Graceful Family,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation.""  That's the season with my absolute favorite episode (""Yesterday's Enterprise"") and ended on the ""Best of Both Worlds, Part 1"" cliffhanger."
Graceful Family,Succession - hopefully season 4 is even better
Graceful Family,"Narcos, game of thrones ( close with 2 and 4. But I thought 3 was the best the first time)."
Graceful Family,Farscape maybe? Haven't watched the show since it aired though.
Graceful Family,"I wouldn‚Äôt say most of that list is definitive. 
My picks for best season of each:

Buffy - 5

Angel - 5

Parks and rec - 3

The x-files - 3

The sopranos - 5

Friends - 5

Cheers - 2

The Simpsons - 4

Arrested development - 1

Fresh Prince - haven‚Äôt seen

Will & grace - haven‚Äôt seen

Scrubs - haven‚Äôt seen

Malcolm in the middle - haven‚Äôt seen

Futurama - 3

House - 4

MASH - Final season"
Graceful Family,1899
Graceful Family,"Season 1 is establishing the concept of a show that gets people hooked. Season 2 is the ""difficult second album"" where shows panic to get more out and sometimes miss the mark, Season 3 is where they've figured out what works and what doesn't and are jn the flow, then after that a lot of the best ideas have been used up.

Doesn't always work like this of course.
Season 2 and 3 of community were pretty great, Season 2 was better rated but I preferred 3."
Graceful Family,I agree with this. Often are season 3 the best and season 5 where the downfall starts. To add to your list; Entourage.
Graceful Family,Perfect Strangers - Balki was really coming into his own and maturing to become a multi-dimensional character that you couldn't help but feel a deep sympathy for despite his many negative traits.  Season 3 was truly the beginning of the end of him and Larry - culminating in probably the most gut-wrenching and horrifying series finale ever filmed.
Graceful Family,"no way is season 3 the best season of sopranos. 2, 4 and 6 all clear it"
Graceful Family,"I'll go with one I'm currently watching, His Dark Materials."
Graceful Family,"If the show is unpopular or bad it would probably not get a 3rd season. If a show is really good, it may happen that writers and show runners run out of good ideas and start to repeat themselves in later seasons. So it makes sense."
Graceful Family,"Black sails S3 is epic 

Expanse S3 

Lost S3 isn‚Äôt the best (S1, 4) but after a rough first few eps it really kicks off around Juliet‚Äôs flashback"
Graceful Family,Lost Season 3 is definitely not its best season but it has the best consecutive run of episodes of the whole show.
Graceful Family,"3rd season usually is a pretty good point for long running shows, because it's kind of like a make or break point.

Season 1 tends to be introduction of the world and characters, season 2 tends to have a lot of loose ends from Season 2 to tie up. Season 3 is when things kind of settle down, and the writers need to get more creative to get the show to continue, they either do really well and the show goes on forever, or they completely bomb and the show stops there.

So I find that most shows that have 5-6+ seasons, season 3 tends to be pretty good even if not the best season."
Graceful Family,"I also think Castlevania season 3 was the best season, it had the most balanced pacing, everything was basically perfect about it except for the Alucard story, which kinda ended up going nowhere, 

Its still a little better than season 4 which had incredible payoff but boring build up imo"
Graceful Family,A series of unfortunate events season 3 was probably my least favourite.
Graceful Family,I love the fact that you mentioned Runaways. That show was so much fun. Glad it got an ending.
Graceful Family,"Fair point.

5 was an amazing season for Buffy so I could believe why someone would put it as the best, but I think 3 was that perfect and I personally preferred Buffy+Angel Story/character dynamic over Buffy/Riley, Buffy/Spike, Buffy/Dawn, that I think 3 just takes top spot for me. Plus, I think the character lineup with Angel, Faith, Oz, Cordi, etc. was slightly stronger in 3 but I guess that‚Äôs more of a preference thing. The stakes were similarly se high in season 5 and there were some interesting character dynamics, but I think 3 takes it overall for me. 

Same sort of thing with Friends but I guess I just think the run of episodes in season 3 (including my personal favorite episode The One With the Football) and Ross/Rachel dynamic was so strong and my personal favorite episode that I would at least think it‚Äôs worthy of discussion along with season 5."
Graceful Family,Community had so many great episodes in seasons 2 and 3 it‚Äôs actually wild.
Graceful Family,2 is my least favourite and 4 has a lot of fluff in the middle. They‚Äôre still both amazing seasons of tv obviously but that‚Äôs just my opinion. Season 6 is definitely better than season 3.
Graceful Family,"Strongly agreed. It's my second favorite season of the series, but you just can't beat 3x19 - 3x22 (and could potentially stretch that all the way back to 3x17)."
Graceful Family,I could see that. It was close between 2 and 3 for me.
Graceful Family,I enjoy hearing your opinions.
Graceful Family,It‚Äôs just SO good. The finale is a masterpiece. What‚Äôs your favourite season?
Graceful Family,For me it was close between 1 and 2 but I like your opinion.
Graceful Family,"Season 1. Getting to know all the characters, mysteries around every corner, and very few weak episodes‚Ä¶ I just love the vibe of that season."
Graceful Family,I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a single episode I‚Äôd call weak in season 1. I could argue in favour of even something like Hearts and Minds. The characters are brilliant‚Ä¶ and the mysteries! Nothing beats watching Lost for the first time.
Graceful Family,"Post more threads like this for sure. Always fun to read about some of the lesser known and hyped shows that are due in 2023. I was aware of some of these shows but I had no idea stuff like Mrs Davis and The Consultant were in the works. 

You do a decent job of selling all the shows on that list and that is often more than can be said for the distributors themselves!"
Graceful Family,"This is really cool, I've seen some of these where the ""why you should be excited"" section didn't do much but you made me genuinely excited to watch a lot of these, thank you!"

Detention,"Being awful, always and on purpose, is a fun quirk. - Gina Linetti, Brooklyn 99"
Detention,"These are all comedies that have a history of outlandish moments and stories. I don't think anyone should be looking at these shows for ""good messages"" and if they are, they're the ones who are at fault. Majority of conedies throughout history have fucked up shit, but they're not supposed to be taken seriously.

&nbsp;

Finding these ""bad messages"" in more grounded dramas would be a better talking point for you imo. Shows like Gilmore Girls have come under scrutiny in recent years for some of the character's actions that were previously deemed okay."
Detention,">It is better for 100 people to regret not having kids than even one person regret having kids.

Detention,I liked how the author cited the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights in a complaint about iCarly
Detention,"> Shows like Gilmore Girls have come under scrutiny in recent years for some of the character's actions that were previously deemed okay.

I think this is more a judgment on certain members of the audience than it is the show. In Gilmore Girls, all of the various characters make errors but they still remain protagonists. Nor does the show flinch from showing the negative consequences of their actions.

So when you hear people who are re-evaluating the characters, they're not really making statements about the show so much as their own failure to understand it on first viewing. Even worse, they're re-evaluating on the naive and simplistic premise that good people can't also be flawed people."
Detention,"Having messed up messages is more problematic when the subject matter at hand is  family/kids shows since kids will actually take the messages to heart many times. While messed up messages in adult programming is still bad because it's meant to be taken more seriously and should have more complex stories and messages, I don't think it's as much of an issue there because adults typically don't carry as many messages from shows as kids do, and they can usually use their own logic to identify when a message is bad and why it is bad. 

Many of these examples are from kids/family shows so I think they're reasonable arguments to be made."
Detention,People constantly talked about how Lily is literally the worst and Marshall deserves better when it was airing.
Detention,"I do not think that any of these shows are inherently bad, they are good shows that have bad moments."
Detention,What are you talking about?
Detention,"Your list of 10 things are all numbered ""1"", instead of 10, 9, 8..., I assumed it was intentional and had a meaning I was missing, or it was an inside joke on the sub or something."
Detention,"From my end it looks like they are numbered 1, 2 ,3 ,4 in that order. 

I do not know why it isn't that way on your end."
Detention,"Huh, that's weird af. Maybe it's because I'm on mobile. Idk."
Detention,"I feel like you're watching some really dark stuff.  Watch something happy. You need to break up the heavy dramas with some comedy or something less depressing.

 Watch Ghosts (the British version and American version are both great).  Watch The Great - dark comedy for sure but still a little brighter than The Handmaid's Tale.  1883 can be brutal but it's hopeful overall."
Detention,"I haven't seen any of the other shows, but Titans is only mentally exhausting because it's so fucking awful.  I can't imagine who it would be suited for to be honest."
Detention,"I don‚Äôt see Schitts Creek mentioned, which is a beautifully uplifting show.  One of the couples (no spoilers, but you‚Äôll probably know which) just has one of the most lovely journeys from meeting to marriage.  But everyone is pretty loving and supportive all the way through."
Detention,"Let this help guide what you watch instead of trying to watch everything popular.  Some shows, I actually really enjoy but I cant binge a bunch of episodes in the same day.  In that case, I'll space them out so it's maybe one episode a day at most.  If any of these are shows you enjoy, modulating your viewing frequency will help.  Something else too, at times my mood may make certain shows just not at all enjoyable right now.  Maybe it's a touch of depression or just real life already exhausting me... and in those cases watching something fun is the way to go."
Detention,"The Handmaid‚Äôs Tale devolved into full-on misery porn in season 2-3. It was always going to be a problem because even though season 1 was amazing, it also made for brutal viewing - but at least its brutality had *a point*. Then the writers made the decision to drag out the story and make it go in circles and i started feeling like the show became complicit in whatever it was trying to critique. Some reviewers have said that season 4 gets better, but i made it through 4 episodes before deciding that this show isn‚Äôt for me anymore.

Want a recent show that‚Äôs uplifting and optimistic? Watch Station Eleven and thank me later ;)"
Detention,Watch the Gilded Age it's amazing.
Detention,Would highly recommend The Great of you want something that's a bit more lite on the mind.
Detention,Outlander is like this for me. I just started watching last week and was obsessed. Then I got to the last two episodes in season 1. I just couldn‚Äôt handle it. I read a few threads with spoilers and decided that I could not remain a healthy person and continue the series. I‚Äôm so upset about it though because I was so interested and can‚Äôt stop thinking about it.
Detention,Watch Taskmaster (UK).
Detention,"For something completely different, try Cobra Kai. It's surprisingly realistic considering the hype of Karate Kid, binge-worthy (10 episodes a season but the series is broken up as like one 5 hr long movie in half hour chunks) and just quite enjoyable. It doesn't pretend to be anything it's not and everyone in the show (adults and kids alike) all seem to be really enjoying themselves.

Otherwise, yeah. There's a lot of doom and gloom shows out there. You just have to find the good shows.

Why Women Kill (at least season 1) is incredibly well made and enjoyable."
Detention,I have watched a few of the shows you have listed and didn't find them emotionally exhausting but there are shows I just can't watch.  I was a huge Walking Dead fan but at some point just got tired of the characters not getting a break.  So I stopped watching it.   I don't have a problem with most streaming shows because their seasons are so short.
Detention,"Bluey could brighten anything else. After a dark ep, watch a couple Bluey ones (they're short, like 12 minutes per ep with credits and stuff)."
Detention,"I have a solution for you. Ted Lasso. Just a nice watch. People are nice. Conflicts are manageable. The protagonist is just an all around decent person. 

But all of those you chose .. conflict is pretty much inherent in all of them. For All Mankind may be an outlier? I thought it had good drama, nothing too over the top despite it being science fiction. (I don't know what Stay Close is - the only one I haven't watched of those). 

The Handmaid's Tale I found a grind. Like it was misery porn. I could admire the production and the acting but no way I could make it through more than one season of it."
Detention,"This is why shows like Leverage and Burn Notice are some of my favorites. Lighthearted, campy, and something a bit different each episode while still following a formula."
Detention,"there seems to be a lack of levity in recent years, agreed. Cobra Kai and on a much lesser extent Ted Lasso are the cure, I find"
Detention,"I always feel like a Mormon when I do this but...
 
Do you have a moment to talk about our Lord and Saviour, The Expanse?"
Detention,"Looking at the shows you mentioned, and trying to think of something non-heavy based on that, *iZombie* is the first thing that came to mind."
Detention,"I find it's good to diversify what you watch. My personal preferred genres are sci-fi/fantasy, animated shows, or comedies. I do have outliers though (for example, Justified isn't the type of show I'd usually watch, but in my mind it just does everything right). I find the best shows have a bit of a mix. Shows where you connect to the chaaracters and feel a connection to them, but aren't afraid to make you laugh either. My top 3 shows of all time are Scrubs, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Futurama. Each of them has their heavier moments, but still many more where they make you laugh. That's just my take on it, though."
Detention,"See if you can find this, the most relaxing show on television

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10590066/"
Detention,"Watch better shows, problem solved"
Detention,"Look for more blue sky shows:

Monk

Royal pains

Warehouse 13

Eureka"
Detention,"There seems to be a big trend of extremely bleak and emotionally heavy storytelling in TV shows right now, and I'm tired of it too.  That kind of fare pulls in lots of viewers though, so networks and studios stick with it because it makes money."
Detention,"Aren‚Äôt those all shows that are meant to provoke thought and discussion?  They‚Äôre not sitcoms.  

‚ÄúClever things make people feel stupid, and unexpected things make them feel scared!‚Äù

-Fry"
Detention,"i watch Euphoria in small doses. 

had to quit Handmaid‚Äôs Tale after 2016 election"
Detention,Watch The Expanse.  It‚Äôs all you really need.
Detention,[deleted]
Detention,"Patriot. It can be dark, and beautiful... but always hilarious."
Detention,Thats i how felt with Breaking Bad. It‚Äôs a good show but i didn‚Äôt enjoy watching it at all
Detention,"I think the shorter seasons aren't helping either. If you cram everything into 8 episodes instead of 10, 13, 20 or more there's no time to let anything breathe. You've got to ramp up everything every episode. ST:Discovery seems this way to me along with others."
Detention,"Try Station 11. Balances dark post apocalypse themes with light, and is pretty uplifitng"
Detention,All of the Harlan Coben series on Netflix. They all have too many situations and characters to follow in one series.
Detention,When i get burnt out on tv shows i watch some good movies i havent seen in a while. I watched the recent planet of the apes trilogy over the weekend and now im feeling back to my bingey self lmao
Detention,I had to quit Handmaid's Tale after June got recaptured. I just didn't have it in me to see what kind of punishment was in store for her.
Detention,I really want to finish the handmaids tale but it depresses me. I am invested enough in the story but it feels like a job to watch it üò≠
Detention,"I had to stop watching Bojack Horseman for a bit because of this. I realized that not only was it stressing me out, but it was also making me a worse person in some ways. I was justifying negative behavior I shouldn't have been and it was just making me depressed."
Detention,Have you considered sitcoms?
Detention,"I watch a lot of mediocre sitcoms because I need some light easy to watch stuff in my TV diet.

A lot of the more well written are too heavy  and too much heavy entertainment will get a person down."
Detention,This is why Always Sunny is the greatest TV show in history.
Detention,This is why Quinten and Joss are such big names in H town. They write realistic dialogue.
Detention,Those shows are all pretty bad so you‚Äôre probably just bored and tired of paying attention to something you don‚Äôt care about. Just move on to something better.
Detention,Not the only one.  Fiction by its nature tends to be triggering.  A lot of stuff on Netflix can be exhausting to watch for this reason.
Detention,"I agree with all of these except Black Summer, but I hear you. I‚Äôd put GoT on the list too. There‚Äôs just too much going on at all times, too many dots to connect, and every decision weighs heavy. Sometimes a show is good enough to watch but ends up feeling like a chore"
Detention,"I mean, it doesn't necessarily mean they aren't for you. It could just be that right now you need something else. Sometimes I need stuff that isn't too heavy. Other times I welcome heavy, or complicated.  It all depends on how I am doing. When I am having a hard time, I tend to stay away from the super heavy stuff."
Detention,You need a will ferrel cleanse
Detention,"I love a show that you kinda dread to watch cause it‚Äôs unpleasant, but I have no patience for bad shows. If I‚Äôm not enjoying it, I stop. 

Most of the shows you said aren‚Äôt bad because they‚Äôre too grim, they‚Äôre just bad. Just like a lighthearted show can be bad too. 

Too much praise gets thrown around for too many shows that are average at best and below average in reality. There‚Äôs good grim shows and good lighthearted shows."
Detention,I agree but stay close was fun.. not very mental for me
Detention,Just go back to watching the Office on repeat
Detention,I get Handmaid's Tale and others (I didn't watched last season exactly because of that)... but how is For all mankind or titans mentally exausting?
Detention,"Yes, it's messing with my ability to just watch TV. Everything has to have twists and turns and reveals and then cliffhangers. Its made to be addictive"
Detention,"Mentally exhausting to me is when it hits too close to home. Why I almost cannot watch much of anything except murder mysteries right now(like Midsomer Murders, or Vienna Blood). So many have cancer and/or death. I have had about enough of that these past 10 years...."
Detention,As in depressing? Yeah which is why I don't choose to watch them - I think the only depressing thing I watched recently was Squid Game. I dropped just about anything that's a heavy drama within the past few years.
Detention,Watch Only Murders in the building.
Detention,"The irony here is that is how I felt about weeds about mid way through s3&4, mind you I came into it from series like the wire and was told it's a great satire of the drug game but just the whole having the cartel bosses baby and the stuff around it just broke my ability suspend disbelief for a TV show."
Detention,Ghosts is fabulous. Robin is one of the best characters ever created.
Detention,I actually just started watching ghosts tonight. I‚Äôm on episode 2 and I like it so far. It‚Äôs not super funny but it‚Äôs different
Detention,Lol I recently dropped the great (on episode 3) exactly because it‚Äôs just so dark and depressing that I can‚Äôt even appreciate the humor.  Funny how ppl see things differently.
Detention,"For real, who let these schmucks into the writers room? So bad.   
  
Characters regularly contradict themselves and any potential character development they‚Äôve had, often within the same scene. I swear, it‚Äôs like for each scene they wrote all the dialogue and then drew names from a hat to decide who says what. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever yelled out loud at a show more than I have with Titans."
Detention,"I watch it but it is trashy, angsty. I watch it mainly because it is a counterpoint to the Disney+ Marvel series."
Detention,Titans is that show you hate but can't stop watching.
Detention,The Good Place as well. Seems like OP is watching dark heavy dramas and them complaining that that's what they are. You're not supposed to watch *just* dark heavy dramas.
Detention,I‚Äôve been watching a bunch of Star Trek and The Orville again recently. They‚Äôre a good panacea.
Detention,"I just couldn't watch it even in S1. I realized that it was making me anxious around men. Or it was making that already existing anxiety worse. It made me angry and afraid. 

I definitely think some people need to watch it, but I also think you should be mindful of your mental health."
Detention,"Reaaaaally love Station 11. It's kind of optimistic, but it also made me super anxious the entire time.

Edit: So worth it, though."
Detention,Ehhh...
Detention,I think someone on r/Outlander made a list of all the scenes involving >!sexual assault!< so people can skip them.
Detention,"I agree lol Outlander season 1 is great overall. And the premise is fun too. I learned alot about the economic, social, and political affairs in this region period setting.

And then came the last episode... just why.

I don't wanna sound rude or insensitive, but since the main target audience is women, is that *scene* supposed to be some kind of fanservice thing? Would it count as one? I personally think it might be, but I'm afraid to interact with the fandom with these notions lol"
Detention,"It's free on youtube. Y'know what? Here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4YhsooE5xY&list=PLRWvNQVqAeWKT-Ouq4ICzdyyOaJELZUlc

Oh, and it's from the official account, so guilt-free."
Detention,"Agreed, cobra Kai is really fun to watch"
Detention,Cobra Kai was fun but in no way was *any* part of that show remotely realistic haha.
Detention,Ooo these are both good recommends
Detention,I found Ted Lasso to be emotionally exhausting in season 2. There‚Äôs a lot of misery for a show that people say lacks conflict.
Detention,"Second the Ted Lasso recommendation. 

It‚Äôs a well-written, well-acted breath of fresh air."
Detention,"I read The Handmaid's Tale when the show as about to come out. After finishing, I had no desire to watch the show.

The first season of Ted Lasso is tv chicken soup for the soul. It's warm, optimistic, and comforting.

I really liked the first season of For All Mankind, but only got partially through the second. Huh."
Detention,"Ted Lasso was great just for that, S1 was so great, the kill them with kindness attitude was so refreshing after all these dramas.

I think people who liked Ted Lasso would really like Weeds, it's not the same kindness but overall lightness they kinda reminded me of each other."
Detention,"Ted Lasso is just a warm hug. Season 2 can get heavy,  I think they maintain the overall vibe and tone of the show though so it's not draining to watch. 

I want to add Ghosts(American version) is a new one that finds a sweet spot between being fun, positive, light, funny, and wholesome but not corny. 

I can't speak for the UK one, but generally the response from people is both are good but different and beyond the first 2 episodes have their own storylines."
Detention,If this person found For All Mankind season 2 exhausting I don't Expanse will be any better for them. Nothing against the show it's excellent sci fi but it's got its fair share of drama and tension
Detention,Dude I was all in until the end of season 1. Something about >!the story arc was caused by a space virus.!< really turned me off. I was into the world building of the show and it seemed unnecessary? Idk.
Detention,"Yes, but some of it just begins to feel like misery porn. And given that these are shows with hours upon hours of episodes, it's not entirely healthy to indulge in them and only them."
Detention,"Euphoria was just too shocking for me.

It was really well made from the half episode I did watch, but I stopped after the motel scene, horrified.

I totally get why people enjoy it, but that's not for me =/"
Detention,"I finally picked up this show last week after hearing about it for so long and binged the entire show in 5 days. Turned out to be my favourite sci-fi show in at least a decade and became my standard for what a sci-fi show can and should be.

I am also one of those people who feel dragged out when watching serious or dark contemporary dramas but there was something to the Expanse that kept pushing me to watch more and more.

And then it ended :("
Detention,Amen. Fantastic show and emotional wringer.
Selena: The Series,"This series is going to be big in Latin America. Shows based on 80s/90s singers have been extremely popular. Amazon just released a series about Menudo while the Netflix original about Luis Miguel (mexican singer) was very successful, media outlets in latin america talked about it for weeks."
Selena: The Series,Feel like I don't need this but it's such a good story that I'm sure I will enjoy it. Still blows my mind how much they made J.Lo look like her in the original.
Selena: The Series,Is that Suzie Crabgrass?
Selena: The Series,They apparently didn‚Äôt consult with her husband for this one. Hard to capture the feel of the movie but I‚Äôll likely be checking this out.
Selena: The Series,"Isn't her dad a real pos on the level of Joe Jackson? Anyway, would be amusing to watch Debra Wilson and Nicole Sullivan react to this in their [MadTV characters](https://youtu.be/QzqifJsMLcI)."
Selena: The Series,"hoping that because this is a show, we get alot more AB in this one"
Selena: The Series,I am going to cry.
Selena: The Series,"knowing how it ends, watching this would be incredibly sad"
Selena: The Series,"Ugh, another show Netflix will probably end after one season..."
Selena: The Series,"This does not look good at all, the acting and dialogue seem pretty shakey from the bits given in the trailer."
Selena: The Series,[deleted]
Selena: The Series,[My review of the show if anyone is interested :)](https://youtu.be/T7S9ihKFqVI)
Selena: The Series,Luis Miguel was awesome. The second season is coming and I can't wait.
Selena: The Series,I disagree bro.  The 1997  Selena movie was good . I feel like Mexican America  culture tend over obsession  with dead singer.  She die 25 year ago.   I feel like this over milking it. How many movie or TV series do you  need to play tribute to singer ?
Selena: The Series,Micky is Puerto Rican...
Selena: The Series,Yeah She was perfect in that movie.
Selena: The Series,"Yes, Christian Serratos"
Selena: The Series,I think it‚Äôs because the father hates him apparently and doesn‚Äôt want to hear his side of the story.
Selena: The Series,Suzanne got more screen time in the trailer than she did the whole movie lmfao.
Selena: The Series,They don't feature Yolanda
Selena: The Series,Well that can‚Äôt really drag it out that long considering how it ends
Selena: The Series,Its a mini series...
Selena: The Series,"This will by orders of magnitude more popular than Society.
Edit: what is TBH?"
Selena: The Series,"""Why doesn't Netflix cater exclusively to my tastes!?"""
Selena: The Series,For Selinas? All of em
Selena: The Series,Damn still does?? Is it still because of the hair??
Selena: The Series,Yes. Apparently the Quintanilla family is super conservative and horde all her assets and rights to themselves and shut out her husband
Selena: The Series,TIL. Sucks because he obviously knew her very well.
Selena: The Series,Damn I had no idea.
Selena: The Series,The society was already renewed but they unrenewed it due to covid
Selena: The Series,Teenage Bounty Hunters.
Selena: The Series,Anything for Selinas.
Selena: The Series,"Oh yeah.  Like those shows, but Selena will be way more popular."
Selena: The Series,finally Christian Serratos having the recognition he deserves
Selena: The Series,"Well, we do know *how* it will end."
Selena: The Series,"Not gonna lie im very excited for this. Growing up my mother went through some tough times and my sister and I would watch the movie with her to make her feel better. I legit know every single song lol. Also love Christian Serratos from TWD, shes going to do great!"
Selena: The Series,Will watch for sure but everyone should be aware that Abe Quintanilla is basically the Latin Joe Jackson with less spanking.
Selena: The Series,Airs 4th of December.
Selena: The Series,Just watch the movie? I thought it did her justice.
Selena: The Series,It ends with a bang
Selena: The Series,Is this a remake of an old movie about a fictional pop star?
Selena: The Series,Dying was the best thing that could have happened to Selena's career.
Selena: The Series,Had a crush on her since Ned's Declassified. I'm so glad she's getting this big role. Lopez played Selena so fucking well can't wait to see this version.
Selena: The Series,Being a main character on Walking Dead for like 6 years isn't recognition enough? A Netflix show is more recognizable than one of the biggest shows of all time? lol.
Selena: The Series,Why does she deserve any special recognition? She‚Äôs a shit actress with a pretty face. Hollywood is chalk full of them.
Selena: The Series,"We all knew how The Titanic would end, but it still made for a fascinating and entertaining adventure in the process. Hell, the opening to The Titanic was showing us the ship-wreck"
Selena: The Series,There are stage parents far worse than Joe
Selena: The Series,What do you mean?
Selena: The Series,"That movie is over 20 years I think it‚Äôs ok she gets introduced to a new generation. 

It‚Äôs a timeless movie in my eyes, but it is a tad outdated and acting isn‚Äôt top notch."
Selena: The Series,"To be fair, the movie really limited her story."
Selena: The Series,Agreed
Selena: The Series,"aaaawwww /u/bootywranglers, why doesn‚Äôt anyone like this lovely joke? We shouldn't  take life to seriously."
Selena: The Series,"Really dude, you have the internet at your finger tips and you *willingly* chose to type out this nonsense?"
Selena: The Series,"Dying as a has been or young really doesn't matter when she'll be known as the first latin grammy award winner and you're a nobody ( like me). 

In the words of Michael Scott:

""My mom always used to say that average people are the most special people in the world. And that's why God made so many."""
Selena: The Series,"You got downvoted and I probably will too because people, especially Mexican-Americans, worship her but it‚Äôs true. It‚Äôs either die young or live long enough for people to call you a hasbeen, overrated, whore, junkie, crazy, or a diva. Name a female pop star who hasn‚Äôt gotten one of those monikers. Dying young and beautiful without any major scandals is the best thing a female singer can do for her legacy."
Selena: The Series,"when it's an adaptation of the life of possibly the most famous mexican-american musician/entertainer? yeah, probably"
Selena: The Series,Yep
Selena: The Series,K
Selena: The Series,That‚Äôs Edward James Olmos.  How absolutely dare you.
Selena: The Series,Que te folle un pez.
Selena: The Series,That's because of the misogyny not the fact they are still alive lol
Selena: The Series,"Oh, I guess we can only dehumanize certain celebrities"
Selena: The Series,The age factor is a part of the misogyny.
Selena: The Series,A person life is capable of being copyrighted?
Selena: The Series,Trying to make sense of Copyright rules was your first mistake
Selena: The Series,Yup
Selena: The Series,This type of thing happens all the time with dead musician biopics. Their family wants to cash in when finding out someone is making a movie/show so sue. Family owns the rights to the deceased artist and won't give them away for free.
Selena: The Series,"No. The *script* can be copyrighted, but with the understanding that since it's based on real life there will have to be some similarities."
Selena: The Series,"Except it‚Äôs the producer of the film suing, not the family or the estate."
Selena: The Series,The family is suing too
Selena: The Series,Was really hoping Chris Perez would win the right to have his book made into a series. Pretty shady that Selena‚Äôs father stopped this from happening and is now making his own series. I feel Selena‚Äôs dad has a warped vision of who his daughter was. I don‚Äôt see him adding anything new to the series that we didn‚Äôt get in the movie. Again would‚Äôve much rather seen Selena‚Äôs story told through the eyes of someone else who was close to her other than her father.
Selena: The Series,"selena the movie is one of my all time favorite movies, selena the artist is one of my favorite singers, i am 100000000% in on selena the series"
Selena: The Series,In an alternate timeline selena starred in a movie about the life of Jennifer lopez
Selena: The Series,All those prayers to [Saint Selena](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzqifJsMLcI) paid off :P
Selena: The Series,>Bidi Bidi Bom Bom @SelenaLaLeyenda‚Äôs incredible life story is coming to Netflix as a scripted series! @selena_netflix was developed alongside and will be executive produced by The Quintanilla family
Selena: The Series,[removed]
Selena: The Series,"Ooohh Salinaaaaaassss

But what didn't we get from the movie that we'll get in this series? I mean I'm looking forward to hearing her music again through this, but I was pretty content with the movie when I was younger..."
Selena: The Series,Are you serious
Selena: The Series,i wonder who they will cast
Selena: The Series,I will be watching!!!! This is exciting news :).
Selena: The Series,I wonder how it ends. Are they going to go out with a bang?
Selena: The Series,good lord this bitch had 1 hit single people swon over her ass like she was the second coming of christ. i so sick of this shit and im fucking mexican.
Selena: The Series,The movie is great. 
Selena: The Series,For the longest time I thought Jennifer Lopez was actually Selena
Selena: The Series,"How do I get in THAT timeline. Not that I hate JLO (love her actually), but I really just want to know what she would be doing if she was still alive :( "
Selena: The Series,"In such s timeline, would Jennifer Lopez have gotten as famous as she is in this timeline?"
Selena: The Series,Not enough to make up for losing a daughter.  
Selena: The Series,The question is if what makes a good bio pic is sufficient for a Multi season series. 
Selena: The Series,Thanks to your post I just found out JLo is older than Selena. How often are real people played by someone who‚Äôs older than them?
Selena: The Series,Why do you love her?  She is so disconnected from everyone else that I can't even pretend to entertain her BS.
Selena: The Series,She'd have been murdered after Anaconda. 
Selena: The Series,Probably not.
Selena: The Series,When you stop aging at 25 the possibilities are endless 
Selena: The Series,Really enjoyed this show!
Selena: The Series,"I wish for this show, that she'd stick the name Martin (Or Martina, or Martinique) into her name for the credits. Not for real life, just to match her costars. ""Selena Martina Gomez.

I really like this show and I'm glad it's getting a second season."
Selena: The Series,Highly recommend this show. It's the *Galaxy Quest* of murder mysteries. It cleverly satirizes its genre while also being a top tier example of the actual material. And it has a lot of laughs packed into a relatively short running time.
Selena: The Series,"> I‚Äôm catching up by phone with Gomez, who is on the set of Season 2 of ‚ÄúOnly Murders in the Building,‚Äù her hit Hulu series with Steve Martin and Martin Short. (Check out the exclusive selfie that Gomez sent me above!) The three play neighbors who try to solve a murder in their Upper West Side apartment building. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cool because personally in my life, since I started Season 1 to doing Season 2, I changed so much,‚Äù Gomez says. ‚ÄúI know that it‚Äôs a small amount of time, but I think it kind of carried on into [her character] Mabel. If anything, there‚Äôs just more of a sophistication to her. Her style gets better. She‚Äôs like super cool. I cut my hair. So it‚Äôs a whole fresh start for Mabel.‚Äù


> Gomez says series co-creator John Hoffman started mapping ideas out for Season 2 toward the end of filming the first season, which wrapped with Mabel leaning over another dead body before being arrested along with Charles (Martin) and Oliver (Short). ‚ÄúAnother season was casually thrown around but then John started spewing these ideas out and sure enough they have come into fruition,‚Äù Gomez says. ‚ÄúWhen I was reading it, I was really really shocked because this is so different but it‚Äôs what makes the show so great. They did such a great job creating another story.‚Äù"
Selena: The Series,I really enjoyed season one and am looking forward to more.
Selena: The Series,This is a really fun show.
Selena: The Series,This is a great show and I feel she holds her own with these 2 comedy legends. Looking forward to season 2.
Alien Worlds,"I've wanted a kind of ""Animal Planet"" style show but set in an alien landscape for so long. I'm excited."
Alien Worlds,"Not sure if anyone remembers it, but there was a great series that came out on The History Channel about 10 years ago called 'Life After People' that explored what the world would be like if the human population all died out suddenly. They made computer-generated recreations of what different cities would look like and how vegetation would overtake certain areas and different animal populations would repopulate and move into new habitats. It was a really fascinating series, and this trailer is giving me the same vibes."
Alien Worlds,"Reminds me a lot of *Alien Planet* which was a docufiction that aired on Discovery Channel back in 2005. That was based on the book *Expedition* by  Wayne Barlowe.

A different speculative fiction about how alien life may have evolved on Darwin IV.

I enjoyed that a lot, so I'll probably be giving *Aliens Worlds* a good look."
Alien Worlds,"Part of me is like ‚Äúthis seems kind of dumb,‚Äù but the other part of me is like ‚Äúthe effects look amazing, and it involves aliens, and I want to see it‚Äù"
Alien Worlds,Kinda like [The Future is Wild](https://youtu.be/w0kzMmcTS8I) or [Alien Planets Revealed](https://youtu.be/8hL1qkEQYgI). [Life After People](https://youtu.be/r8bkbhyyQjE) was also good.
Alien Worlds,This will be cool to eat edibles and watch
Alien Worlds,"Some more interesting videos about potential of extraterrestrial life:

- [Alien Planet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJIgcihiw2Y) - a fictional expedition to Darwin IV with autonomous probes which explore an alien world

- Life Beyond ([chapter 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUelbSa-OkA), [chapter 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThDYazipjSI)) - exploration of the possibilities of alien life evolving in different environments"
Alien Worlds,"holy fuck 10 year old is shitting the bed and current year old me is shitting the bed, this looks amazing"
Alien Worlds,No Mans Sky the TV show???
Alien Worlds,"I want several seasons of this. The entire concept has been utterly fascinating to me since I was a kid, thanks to Alien Planet on discovery as well as the source book Expedition by Wayne Barlowe.

Aurelia, The Blue Moon (NatGeo's Extraterrestial) and Darwin IV were my shit."
Alien Worlds,"At 0:55, proof that Covid is an alien life-form and Netflix was hijacked to broadcast their alien propaganda."
Alien Worlds,"I am trying to watch this,  but so far it's just a guy training birds"
Alien Worlds,Do you guys think this show would be okay for a 5 year old? She‚Äôs super into space and science and science fiction.
Alien Worlds,Oh OK. How long till it's canceled?
Alien Worlds,Now this looks like a show I'd want to watch stoned put of my mind
Alien Worlds,Season 1 of 1 because Netflix will cancel it.
Alien Worlds,"Dumb enough to be on the History channel, but the CGI is too expensive. Better go to Netflix then!"
Alien Worlds,"Ah yes just as alien as everything else major film does, awkwardly similar to everything on earth because people cant concept actually alien concepts."
Alien Worlds,[deleted]
Alien Worlds,Could be a great rehearsal the children of time
Alien Worlds,More of these types of shows please.
Alien Worlds,Awesome!
Alien Worlds,No Man's Sky?
Alien Worlds,Alien Planet!
Alien Worlds,"I think anyone who denies the existence of alien life is a fool. The universe is vast. JUst in our milky there are billions of stars. Each star have planets / moons revolving around it. The possibility of a planet that is similar to ours is highly possible. 

The phrase seeing is believing is incorrect in this instance. Believing is believing."
Alien Worlds,Liking the calm and slow narration.
Alien Worlds,I wish Netflix would hire melodysheep to create a series that integrates astroscience and the possibilities of alien life. One of my favorite videos he recently completed: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThDYazipjSI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThDYazipjSI)
Alien Worlds,I swear I saw Slave 1 in this trailer
Alien Worlds,"There was a special years ago on Discovery Channel that wss that. Narrated by Dr Cox from Scrubs. It was very neat. I have the DVD of it, but I don't know where to track it down online."
Alien Worlds,"Check out the Future is Wild or Alien Planet, the second of which is very similar to this"
Alien Worlds,You might like [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThDYazipjSI). It looks like it might be pretty similar to what this Netflix show turns out to be.
Alien Worlds,"Disney, if you're listening: This, but Star Wars."
Alien Worlds,This show isn't it... terrible.
Alien Worlds,"I remember that show because it mentioned how basically every type of dog that we‚Äôve designed through selective breeding would die, and they would go back to being wolfs in a short period of time. Your typical house dog can‚Äôt survive in the wild anymore."
Alien Worlds,I remember that. I was fairly young so it kinda spooked me
Alien Worlds,It had different times also. I remember Mt. Rushmore lasting quite a long time.
Alien Worlds,Was that the one where it showed Parrots would still be talking human language hundreds of years after?
Alien Worlds,"That book is one of the most incredible books I've read.  WDB's artwork transported me to Darwin IV, it's such a great piece of escapist media. 

The show was ok, it's so hard to capture the detail and majesty of the planet with mid 2000s CG plastered on real world geography."
Alien Worlds,I'd be more excited if it hadn't had the clip of the alien autopsy video. The alien life recreations look really cool; I'm just a bit concerned it's going to veer off in some super-flaky direction.
Alien Worlds,I feel like they did Alien Worlds rather than the Future is Wild simply because there's not much entertainment value in watching a bunch of barren arid land for several episodes.
Alien Worlds,Tremendous.
Alien Worlds,Watch Fantastic Planet for the scariest trip of your life.
Alien Worlds,Reminded me a lot of Life Beyond!
Alien Worlds,They try to stay close to the science so it's not as fun as what crazy speculation would be.  It got me to thinking though.  Why hasn't nature produced a booster rocket type setup where the plant shoots a projectile up as high as it can and which then releases a lighter seedpod that would float on winds higher than plant level?  The booster would fall back to the ground where animals would eat it.  Being a mild laxative it will cause animals to defecate providing nutrient for the mother plant.
Alien Worlds,"I said to myself, ‚ÄúOh the Netflix people finally played Spore.‚Äù"
Alien Worlds,"As soon as I saw the title, I was hoping for Barlowe aliens."
Alien Worlds,At least this sort of series is unlikely to have some kind of overarching narrative. Even if it does get cancelled we'll probably just be able to enjoy what it did give us.
Alien Worlds,2 seasons.
Alien Worlds,"Like with convergent evolution here on earth, they most likely would look like earth animals if the environment is similar."
Alien Worlds,"What even is an ‚Äúactually alien‚Äù concept anyways? You might as well be asking an artist to invent a brand new color, we can‚Äôt create something we can‚Äôt possibly imagine. All we can do as human beings who‚Äôre stuck on earth is take inspiration from the history of life on our planet and try our best to remix it in clever, novel, and fantastical ways."
Alien Worlds,"Hm, I'm not really sure that its inappropriate given the context? If you saw a documentary about a tribe in Africa from 2000 b.c, and you saw black people climbing a tree, that would be totally acceptable. How is this any different?"
Alien Worlds,"My wife and I saw and noticed it too. We both gave each other a very puzzled look like ""Did they really?"""
Alien Worlds,"[.](https://youtu.be/oVjYtZydMuo?t=3384)

life is or is not an intrinsic property of some type of universes, but we are in one where it is not, therefore life is rare but possible we are not only ones..."
Alien Worlds,Sounds dope. What's it called?
Alien Worlds,Dude that special was so fucking cool.  I absolutely loved it.  The giant strider things that walked on the brine oceans and ate with their feet.  So dope.
Alien Worlds,Oh I remember watching that!
Alien Worlds,I remember seeing this. This looks like a kind of rehashed version of it. Not complaining though this looks great
Alien Worlds,I fucking loved The Future is Wild. I‚Äôd love to go back and rewatch it.
Alien Worlds,"They actually did a book a while back that covered the different ecosystems of planets in Star wars, pretty cool."
Alien Worlds,Lol I'm not impressed with it either
Alien Worlds,"My guess would be they'd have an episode on potential inteligent life, and as an intro show images of our general perception on what that would be, you know, that autopsy, area 51 (also there) maybe throw in a clip from E.T. and Alf, and then show their version of what it could look like. That's what makes the most sense to me. Having said that I am fully on board with this.

Edit:typos"
Alien Worlds,"You say that, but from what I know about the far future of the Earth as the Sun increases in luminosity in about 600 million years it will be very hard for most types of plants and trees to survive and plant life will have to rely on a much less common and efficient type of photosynthesis called C4 Carbon Fixation. Even these types of plants will probably peter out after around 800 million years from now, depending on their ability to evolve resourceful adaptations.

Animals have a more robust ability to survive these conditions than plants, but it will be very difficult, the loss in oxygen and the huge losses in food availability, along with the ever increasing temperatures and hostility of the planet, will make life very, very hard. I'd be really interested to see what life could be like near the end of the time when complex life is still possible on the planet, and what kind of desperate last ditch characteristics start to appear.

Even aside from that, on a grand timescale the worst effect humans could conceivably have on the Earth, up to and including the largest nuclear war we are capable of along with the worst global warming we could manage, is ultimately something that life on Earth will handily recover from after a few million or tens of millions of years if past mass extinctions are anything to go off of. It would be cool I think to speculate on how a healthy Earth could look in, say, 100 million years, when human damage is long in the past and the horrible future I outlined above is also far off."
Alien Worlds,Joey?
Alien Worlds,you and your wife are both fucking retarded
Alien Worlds,Alien Planet
Alien Worlds,Alien Animals with Cox
Alien Worlds,Yeah!! The algae ocean was a neat concept!
Alien Worlds,"I did think of some possible eras in a future is wild remake. The billion year one I only thought of one concrete animal so far. Termites, which bury underground kilometers below near lava tubes to grow crops"
Alien Worlds,"Yeah, well, that's just, like, your opinion, man."
Alien Worlds,"One cool thing about it was that it was framed as the story of two probes hu.ans sent there, so they discuss some of the difficulties in communicating with a probe that far out. The lifeforms were really interesting concepts."
Alien Worlds,"This ""documentary"" was so damn cool. I like how they showed didn't just make ""animals but in space and with weird colors"". They did weird stuff like imagining eyes and mouths never evolved and extrapolating that out to figure out how creatures would adapt differently."
Alien Worlds,nice. thank you!
Alien Worlds,John C McGinley narrated that?! Holy shit!
Alien Worlds,i think i've read that fan fiction
Alien Worlds,your dumbfuck level has decreased from Level 544 to to Level 69
Alien Worlds,"Also reminds me of the one they did for Earth in the far future called The Future is Wild, including the dominant form of life eventually becoming squids."
Alien Worlds,I always wanted the book [it was based on](https://www.google.com/search?q=wayne+barlowe+expedition&safe=active&client=firefox-b-d&sxsrf=ALeKk01UI8T526lWe7KMb1NV7uwsmcm3pQ:1605819197088&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjBksPWvo_tAhWG9XMBHXzzCvUQ_AUoAXoECAUQAw&biw=1920&bih=966). Reminded me a lot of Metroid Prime.
Alien Worlds,"Theres also Extraterrestial by NatGeo. 

Sky whales on the Blue Moon.

Animal Tree Analogues that have beating hearts and shit on Aurelia."
Alien Worlds,Nice.
Alien Worlds,And sharks evolved into the [sharkopath](https://speculativeevolution.fandom.com/wiki/Sharkopath).
Alien Worlds,"Still have that on DVD, one of my favorite series"
Alien Worlds,This sounds so cool.  I'm going to try and find it.
Alien Worlds,"Oh yeah, *that* is the one I was thinking of. 


Lots of hypothetical paths for life to take in various environments.  

Love these types of ‚Äúwhat *could* life do given different challenges‚Äù type of series."
Alien Worlds,https://www.dailymotion.com/video/xkdb8x
Alien Worlds,Linda deserves this!
Alien Worlds,"Happy that Linda is being rediscovered, though too bad it wasn't a song she has the rights to. ""Running up that Hill"" was written and composed by Kate Bush, so she made an awful lot of money from that, Linda won't see much in terms of financial benefit from this song."
Alien Worlds,I'm standing in line at CVS currently and it's playing on the store radio
Alien Worlds,Prior to this my only reference for Linda Ronstadt was the Mr. Plow episode of the Simpsons.
Alien Worlds,"I don't think it did really, it's not in the billboard hot 100 or anything. For context Running Up That Hill peaked at number 3 on billboard due to Stranger Things and was on the charts for months after."
Alien Worlds,Long Long Time has been my favorite song since I first heard it in the early 70s. I've been a Linda Ronstadt fan since I heard her sing Different Drum with the Stone Poneys.
Alien Worlds,Did Depeche Mode get a bump too? I lost my shit when Never Let Me Down Again played at the end of the pilot. It made me anticipate the next episode even more knowing that song came out in the 80s.
Alien Worlds,I was hoping it was a megadeth tape that they found in the truck.
Alien Worlds,"Linda Ronstadt was a huge part of my childhood with Kevin Kline in Pirates of Penzance, we used to watch it all the time. Such an amazing voice."
Alien Worlds,"‚ÄúMr. Plow is a loser and I think he is a boozer, so you better make that call to the Plow King!‚Äù"
Alien Worlds,"I like this song, but am much more into the Depeche Mode song they play at the end of Episode 1!"
Alien Worlds,Good for her. I'll take Alone and Forsaken by Hank personally but some solid music thus far in the show.
Alien Worlds,"Glad it introduced me to it, it's a gorgeous song"
Alien Worlds,"Anyone looking to find out more about Linda's unbelievable career should check out her documentary, The Sound of My Voice.  If you're a solo female rock artist, you owe Linda a debt for all the trails she blazed for you."
Alien Worlds,I love how much old music is coming back into the spotlight. Streaming and social media have their flaws but it's really cool that when a good song is from is becoming a non issue
Alien Worlds,"Surprised, scrolled through comments in this thread and didn't see any links to the song"
Lone Wolf,"God, Genndy Tartakovsky is just so damn good! Such a simple style (there's not even a ton of animated movements within this clip), yet he tells so much through the art. I can't wait for the next season of Primal!"
Lone Wolf,Fantastic detail when Ogami opens his eyes and emphasizes that he's not just defending his son or anything here- Ogami is **angry as hell**
Lone Wolf,Fun fact the pnly cartoon to be drawn without an outline at the time
Lone Wolf,Great show.
Lone Wolf,"Incredible show, even if I had a lot of problems with the final season"
Lone Wolf,"Did a recent rewatch while I was housesitting for my parents, the first time I had since I think season 5 came out, and man does it stir up all the feelings I had when I was a kid. I wanted to be an animator when I grew up and only stopped when I found out how little respect/money/recognition they are given in their field.  
This show was a major reason why I wanted to get into art in the first place, it hit me in just the right ways at just the right time and has become the platonic ideal for cartoons for me, as all other cartoons pale in comparison. Avatar came close though..."
Lone Wolf,quite possibly one of the greatest manga epics out there.
Lone Wolf,"I need to rewatch this, amazing show"
Lone Wolf,I thought they ended the series on that crispy love scene
Lone Wolf,Um ......
Lone Wolf,"> when Ogami opens his eyes

[Momotaro](https://youtu.be/L_BE85hCSDU)!"
Lone Wolf,"""Grandson of my heart.""

I'll admit that I had some doubts midway through that they could pull off the same quality throughout over such an incredibly long span of time but I felt foolish for ever doubting Koike and Kojima's abilities by the time I got to the end. 

Epic gets thrown around a little too easily sometimes but LW&C is absolutely epic in both scale and execution.  Sadly, most people won't ever read it due to its length."
Lone Wolf,Nope. I guess it's going to be more of an anthology.
Lone Wolf,Yes?
Lone Wolf,The creator has said that offhand a couple times but I haven‚Äôt seen anything concrete
Lone Wolf,[deleted]
Lone Wolf,Richard Harrow!!!
Lone Wolf,"I love that they‚Äôre keeping the confusion going with the names being similar, story being similar, and bringing on Britton. They should do a crossover!"
Lone Wolf,I was wondering about whether they would FINALLY turn this into an anthology.
Lone Wolf,This will be amazing. Such a sad story for Jewell.
Lone Wolf,Who will play supreme asshole Tom Brokaw?
Lone Wolf,Guess they are beating the Clint Eastwood film to the punch in telling this story
Lone Wolf,Produced by Kevin Spacey?
Lone Wolf,Elaborate.
Lone Wolf,He's also amazing in The Umbrella Academy
Lone Wolf,I read this comment twice before I realized you weren‚Äôt talking about Connie Britton as if she were a man.
Lone Wolf,Made me cry when he died
Lone Wolf,"He means Mindhunters where Britton steals the show as well. 

Sorry people downvoted you rather than answer."
Lone Wolf,Hazel is absolutely the best part of Umbrella Academy
Lone Wolf,A man that size shouldn't be able to move like that.  I really enjoyed that show.
Lone Wolf,it made me cry when he missed his shot
Lone Wolf,He was making an Umbrella Acedemy reference actually
Lone Wolf,"i am not much of a star wars fan as well. Really enjoy the ""spaghetti western in space"" vibe. it's the only star wars entry other than KOTOR and KOTOR II that i thoroughly enjoy."
Lone Wolf,It is good although there are certain parts I'm not happy with like the idea of fobs that can just track everyone which I'm pretty sure would have been very useful in a lot of other movies. In one of the more recent episodes the rebel drop trooper gets her gun jammed and starts trying to fix it even though you can see she has a side arm for pretty much that exact purpose but maybe she's just not worried about being shot because storm troopers can't aim for shit.
Lone Wolf,[deleted]
Lone Wolf,"To me as a Star Wars fan it's amazing. But it also shows the other side a bit. The movies are usually about universe changing things. But this felt local and while the plot does get bigger it never becomes galaxy threatening.

It's a great show, a joy for star wars fans with a lot of refferences for the lore geeks like me and still a great show for those that don't know Star Wars."
Lone Wolf,"'Amazing', you sure about that? It's decent, great visually and easy enough to watch, but the writing is way too poor for the show to ever be called amazing."
Lone Wolf,Its a fun show each time with laughs that doesnt need to dig too deep into other storylines by itself.
Lone Wolf,"They made the right choice in making The Mandalorian very lose on plot because it means it's very accessible for newcomers. The Saturday morning cartoon vibe also fits surprisingly well. 

That said, the story we have got so far has been so good and I really want them to make the seasons more and more plot heavy as they go along, with a proper season long arc rather than standalone adventures loosely tied together."
Lone Wolf,"This is Star Wars at its best. 

Star Wars is normally different genres just with a space theme over it. 

Mandalorian is a western in space. 
Original Star Wars was mid evil knights and magic in space. 

The prequels had the issue of being too political which was boring. 

The sequels had the issue of being a dumpster fire of a plot which was also boring."
Lone Wolf,"As a Star Wars fan, I can tell you that something that makes it great is it takes all of the good parts of Star Wars and celebrates them, while leaving behind all the shitty parts."
Lone Wolf,I find it numbingly bland.
Lone Wolf,"You guys, have you seen this show on Disney+ - the Mandalorian?"
Lone Wolf,It makes you a Star Wars fan.
Lone Wolf,"It is watchable, but nothing special. The acting is wooden, the plot is very vanilla and the settings are incredibly fake."
Lone Wolf,"It‚Äôs written like a video game. Find side quest, complete side quest, upgrade armor and weapons. I find it enjoyable but it‚Äôs far from art."
Lone Wolf,"You are definitely on the right track.  Since the first trilogy, very little has been good.  The prequal trilogy were hot garbage.  The sequel trilogy films weren't much better.  While TFA was a weak retread of the original film, it at least had Han and Chewie.  Harrison Ford simply has the on-screen charisma to carry a film.

While some of the interactions between Rey and Kylo in TLJ were pretty good, episodes 8 & 9 were mostly just meh, especially ROS.

A lot of people like Rouge One, and I kind of get it, but it didn't click for me.

I think I can honestly say, the only great Star Wars moment I've experience since 1980 was Season 2 of The Mandalorian.  When I saw that green lightsaber ripping up dark troopers, it was a true WTF moment.

The best, closest, recent comparison, would be when Gus Fring got blow up in Breaking Bad"
Lone Wolf,"As a non Star Wars fan, I did not end up liking season 2. For me, season 1 would be a 9/10 with season 2 as a 5/10.

For me, season 1 was a self contained story set in the Star Wars universe. While season 2 felt like you really needed to know the entire Star Wars lore. With the introduction of all these interconnected characters from different shows, I found myself getting confused/not caring about the character at all. For example, I hated the episode with Ahsoka Tano. I have no idea who she is or what her motivations are (who is General Thrawn and why is she looking for him, what's her relationship with Bo Katan etc.). And the show does not explain any of this, so I ended up having no idea what was going on in that episode. And I have similar issues with Bo Katan and Boba Fett. Who is Boba Fett's father and why does he have mandolorian armor? I think in the show they mentioned that he fought in the war? But, what was that line about him being a donor? If I was a Star Wars fan, I'm sure these would have been great characters, but as a non fan, the show gave me no reason to be interested in these characters.

I hope season 3 goes back to being a self contained story."
Lone Wolf,"If you watch the whole show so far and you don‚Äôt cry in the season 2 finale there might be something wrong with you.

E: I forgot I was in r/television aka r/tvsnobs. Crazy how I‚Äôm getting downvotes for *liking the show*."
Lone Wolf,It sucks. I bailed after s02e01.
Lone Wolf,"Nah, it's boring and slow and 'not much happening'. I'm guessing if you are a Star fan you like it., But if you are alike me and don't know Star Wars at all, then it is boring. I stopped after about three or so into S1. I even saw the 'fan fix' from the spoiler of S2 and I can only see a guy in black taking the gremlin... don't know what any fuss is about.

Speaking of sci fi shows (since this is the general TV subreddit); Raised by Wolves. Now there's a show that I am head over heals over. Compared to it, this Mandalorian thing looks like a kids show next to it. A slow, empty, boring kids show.

I also have high hopes for Foundation. I hope it doesn't suck."
Lone Wolf,">It's pretty awesome how Pedro Pascal manages to imbue Mando with so much personality even though you barely ever see his face.

People that praise his performance are in another world to me. He's got a helmet on. You can't see him."
Lone Wolf,">For the most part, I've found them to be ok at best with 2 films - Empire and Rogue One - being truly great.

A lot fans might say something along those lines, for whatever it's worth. One thing that has emerged over the last decade or so is that Star Wars tends to come across better on TV than in movies (just on average). The Clone Wars doesn't have and won't ever have as wide an audience as The Mandalorian, being animation and so forth, but it was a turning point and a lot of its groundwork is now good material for the Mando to use.

Beyond everything else, music included, what's great about this series is that it draws on the wider Star Wars universe. Books, animated TV shows and games are relatively niche, but a lot of good characters and story ideas have been developed in those media over the years. We're finally seeing some of that in a form that general audiences can enjoy, which is very cool."
Lone Wolf,"You do realize that Pedro just did the voice for a majority of the episodes, right?

He was barely there according to his coworkers. It was just a body double."
Lone Wolf,"I've been wondering this as I'm not a SW fan but everyone says this show is amazing.

It's not so much that I'm not a fan, as in like I've watched the movies and they just didn't click with me, it's more so that I just have no interest in SW. Of course I've watched those original movies, or well it might have been just the one movie with that iconic lava scene, but that's as far as I ever went with SW."
Lone Wolf,Yes! Completely agree! The show is making me want to replay KOTOR. Maybe Jedi Academy for some lightsaber fights üòâ
Lone Wolf,"She does have Fennick, the best sniper in the galaxy, and two Mandalorians with her. She knows getting her main weapon back in the fight is more optimal than giving it up at the first sign of a jam."
Lone Wolf,Getting shot doesn't seem to be more than a minor annoyance for anyone in the Star Wars universe anyway.
Lone Wolf,"I'm with you on this. I enjoy so many aspects of this show, but why does it get a pass on things that were criticized in the previous movies. The dialogue is stilted. Certain scenes seem either forced on contrived. Some of the acting is kind of borderline, some of which I blame on the dialogue. But people keep gushing over how amazing this show is. I've watched every episode and the world building is fun and admirable, but it just feels like it could be so much better."
Lone Wolf,"I'd second this. It has fun atmospheres and is a great engine to create plots for other shows to follow through on, but Mando especially feels like he was written by George Lucas. Him crying over a battle Droid was akin to Anakin saying how much he dislikes sand...

Though the tension they managed to create in the episode with Mayfield and his former commanding officer was a thing of beauty."
Lone Wolf,"That's generous. Writing is weak, and the actions scenes are a fucking bore."
Lone Wolf,"The original Star Wars trilogy draws a lot of inspiration from Westerns and Japanese samurai films, which themselves are very intertwined genres in film. 

The Mandalorian takes those original inspirations and makes them even more explicit. The dueling duels between the space gunslingers and the space samurai in ‚ÄúThe Jedi‚Äù is one of my favorite things that they‚Äôve done on the show."
Lone Wolf,"Star Wars the originals were the best. Lucas had a ton of no-men around him, who could shut his bad ideas down. There is a youtube documentary called something like: How Star Wars was saved in the edit, which shows how Lucas' Star Wars story was given second, third and most likely more thoughts which eventually led to a story that worked. 

I'm kinda torn about Mandalorian. On one hand it's ok entertainment, and I'm happy that so many people like it. On the other hand, if so many people like this, then we will most likely get more of this, which means we will never get truly great Star Wars again."
Lone Wolf,The green lightsaber made me cry and I am not even a Star Wars fan.
Lone Wolf,"I‚Äôm just struggling to get invested in anything in this show. That last Bill Burr episode was easily the standout of the season for me, but generally speaking, I find the world and characters incredibly bland. Then again, that might just be Star Wars for me."
Lone Wolf,Good to know
Lone Wolf,Yeah weirdly if you just watch the first couple of episodes and skip about 12 the emotional impact isn‚Äôt quite there is it
Lone Wolf,"I can't tell if this is ironic or a troll being baity. Raised by Wolves is one of the slowest, inconsistent shows released this year. It rides purely on Ridley Scott's aesthetic and nonsensical plot twists with very little else. Sounds like you wrote off The Mandolorian before you started it just because it's Star Wars. I'd suggest trying it again, it would be a shame to miss a great show that actually had a logical plot just because you're too snooty for what's popular."
Lone Wolf,Have you read the Foundation trilogy? I can't wait for that show.
Lone Wolf,Wow lol your comment was the dumbest shit i read all day today.
Lone Wolf,"They might be talking about his voice acting, no pun intended."
Lone Wolf,"The Mandalorian has been rather fascinating when it comes to weaponry.  I don't recall anyone running out of ammunition *ever* until that one time Mando did.  I don't recall a single blaster ever getting jammed, either.  In fact, most of the time one is left to wonder just what in the world all that armor is for when every rando with a handgun can take you down in a single shot anyhow.

Then this show comes along and has armor that actually protects the wearer, weaponry that malfunctions, and even manages to argue why you'd want any of the large, bulky weapons when the sidearms have traditionally seemed good enough for the task at hand."
Lone Wolf,"Yeah people say you don't have to be a star wars fan to enjoy the show, but imo, the best thing about the show is that it is Star Wars. I don't think anyone would have cared about the show if it was in a generic Sci - fi universe."
Lone Wolf,"I pretty much just assume that ""English"" has changed over the however many years it's been."
Lone Wolf,"> The dialogue is stilted. Certain scenes seem either forced on contrived.

That's Star Wars though. Even the OT had these problems. People love this show because it FEELS like it's actually Star Wars. Even Disney's best movie, Rogue One, didn't feel like Star Wars. I know I'm being vague but that's the only way I can describe it."
Lone Wolf,"People only love it because it's Star Wars, is not bad like the sequels, and has fan service out the ass (just like Rogue One). It's writing is one step above kids show writing. Most episodes are one big action set piece with just enough plot surrounding that to make it work. The show relies a ton off the IP for it to work"
Lone Wolf,"That battle droid was the legacy of his friend that just died.  That battle droid saved his life, saved the kid's life, convinced him to let go of his hatred and begin to heal from his childhood trauma.  

I was crying too."
Lone Wolf,I love when they send two transport ships of stormtroopers to just run out and get shot at. It was like a power rangers episode.
Lone Wolf,"The Mandalorian is the best live action Star Wars we‚Äôve had since the original trilogy. If you‚Äôre asking for more than this, I‚Äôm not sure where your standards are set."
Lone Wolf,"I watched the beginning scene in The Godfather about the daughter's wedding and then flipped to the end, some dude kills some other dude and another dude ordered it or something, I don't know, shit sucks man."
Lone Wolf,Expectedly- which is why that isn't the point.
Lone Wolf,"You got to be blinded by fandom if you praise the writing of this show. I haven't written it off, because it's star wars and it's pretty, but the writting is sloppy and cliche. Raised by Wolves isn't perfect but at least it tries to do something more than just a cliche. And that show rides purely on aesthetics? You do realise that the only reason mandalorians were popular, is the aesthetics of the suit?"
Lone Wolf,"Your being judgmental and assuming. I said I watched three or so episodes and I didn't like it.
Now notice I didn't judge you or made assumption on your behalf for not liking something I liked.
The hubris of 'there must be something wrong with someone that doesn't like what I like'. lol"
Lone Wolf,"I can't follow novels, sadly, (they are like 13 books or something!) but I am a fan of Asimov and I only hear good things about Foundation. This is why I am hyped for the show. Being a big budget production just seals the deal."
Lone Wolf,"I mean those blasters are powered by some sort of energy source so maybe that source depleted leading to the failure of his blaster. This is just my personal theory (read head canon), I'm not sure if there's an in-universe explanation for how guns work in the galaxy far far away."
Lone Wolf,"I think more that stilted dialogue, the characters dont really have any chemistry. My favorite episode was probably the one with Bill Burr because he felt like the only one bouncing off of everyone with his personality."
Lone Wolf,RLM put it best: Rogue One is the greatest fan film of all time.
Lone Wolf,"It's funny you say that, I like it because it doesn't feel like Star Wars."
Lone Wolf,"> best live action Star Wars

That's not a remarkable achievement honestly. The best of Star Wars hasn't been in live action for a long time. I enjoy Mando, but it doesn't realize the potential of the universe as well as The Clone Wars series or Knights of the Old Republic games did."
Lone Wolf,"I think The Force Awakens is better in itself, though there is too much copy from A New Hope. Other than that, live action Star Wars has been crap. Shouldn't you also question your standards, if just better than crap satisfies you?"
Lone Wolf,"I really wish I could understand why people feel this way, but for me personally, TFA, TLJ, and Rogue One were a lot better."
Lone Wolf,Kinda is though
Lone Wolf,"Ah yup because 'Religion bad' and 'space monster go brrr' are really fresh views in the world of Sci Fi, Raised by Wolves hardly develops its characters it's so busy rushing between tropes. And you are so right! People watch close to 18 hours of a show because they like a suit from thirty years ago! There's no way the show backed that up by actually having characters or a story."
Lone Wolf,[removed]
Lone Wolf,Its the way you wrote your original comment. It just came across as dumb.
Lone Wolf,"I fully expect that they *can* run out of ammunition.  Most of the video games have reload mechanics to boot.  It's just that I can't recall it ever being required in anything live action other than that *one time* in Season 2.  I don't mean that as a knock against the series or anything.  It's actually a pretty neat moment.  It raises the stakes and suggests that the mass-issued hardware is inferior to what the heroes generally carry.

The gun jamming, on the other hand, is a bit odd as that suggests moving parts and timing problems that seem a little strange for a gun that doesn't appear to have all that many moving parts.  I don't think that moment works all that well for a number of reasons.  The first is that it doesn't immediately make sense, but that's a lesser problem.  The bigger one is that it undermines the nearly unflappable elite soldier the character generally has going for her without any obvious narrative benefit.  She is, after all, backed by three other absolute badasses any one of whom could plausibly clear the ship themselves, so her gun going down doesn't raise the stakes the way it did when Mando ran out of ammunition.  (Bill Burr's character might be a lot of things, but unstoppable killing machine isn't one of them.)"
Lone Wolf,Your opinion bro
Lone Wolf,"If something is 'so obvious' then chances is you misunderstood. You really think I said I only watched 3 episodes of a show then complain about not being emotional with the finale of the following season? I even said it wasn't my point and your reply is ' no, it is' then go on to telling me what my own point is... Wow. 

I guess instead of asking or discussion or even keeping on topic, you just want to reaffirm an opinion you already made about someone. In that case, good for you and I'm moving on."
Lone Wolf,">>Ah yup because 'Religion bad

Did you not watch the show?

>>Raised by Wolves hardly develops its characters

You do know the context is the comparison to the mandalorian? There is a ton more charater development. Even the androids have developed more than the Mandalorian.

>>And you are so right! People watch close to 18 hours of a show because they like a suit from thirty years ago! 

That is the main attraction. What else do you think had people wanting more of Boba Fett/mandalorians? He had almost no screen time.

>>There's no way the show backed that up by actually having characters or a story.

You are right. They really didnt. They wrote him as a strong silent loner. (omg, who has ever heard about that before?), who has a good heart (wow, even more original)

Listen I'm not saying it's worse than Hercules, Xena, Walker Texas Ranger, that it's trying to emulate. If that's what it want to be, then good job. But to me Star Wars the originals was so much more than those B series."
Lone Wolf,What was your point then?
Once Again,"shout out to Genevieve O'Reilly; first of all she's absolutely *stunning* in these off shoulder party dresses, secondly she's so good at conveying raw emotions under formal circumstances"
Once Again,"Andy Serkis and his character have been absolutely great. I became so attached to him in such a short time, and *that* moment killed me. And Skarsgard's monologue at the end was simply incredibly."
Once Again,on program!
Once Again,"Andor has been fantastic, I didn't expect to like it but it's been hitting it out of the park every week.

""One way out"""
Once Again,You have seriously made the same post the last 3 weeks.
Once Again,Agreed. Super happy Season 2 has been greenlit.
Once Again,>!I can't swim.!<
Once Again,Are its ratings/viewership that low? Is that why there are so many daily posts about how unbelievably awesome this show is?
Once Again,"Oh jeez, another Andor thread. Marketing bots are really busy."
Once Again,"When is the Old Republic show finally coming out?

I‚Äôm sick of all this shows circling around the OT."
Once Again,"Really? Its boring and uninteresting imo, it is no DHoT, better than RoP tho"
Once Again,"While I like the series, I fail to see why everyone is raving about it. The whole prison series wasn't really that good. They rushed how Andor got there, then stayed in the prison for too long, only to rush the escape again. I expected more from that. More planning in advance, and higher stakes in the execution. I hope we return to the prison to find out what they were actually making and to find out what became of Kino Loy."
Once Again,"Yea man.  I was done with Star Wars after RoS.  I just accepted that Disney killed my interest and moved on.  I didn't like Mando, didn't bother with Fett or anything else.  But the positive buzz for Andor, and my affinity for Rogue One, got the better of me.  I started around episode 5 or 6 I think.  Do you know the last time a show had me waking up early so I could watch the episode before starting my day?  Basically never.  I just like it so much.  It's not good for a star wars show, or good for a disney show.  It's just a really good story, with strong characters, great writing, and a banger of a plot.  No sith or jedi or even lightsabers.  None of it.  There hasnt been a moment of filler.  Tony Gilroy pulled off the near impossible."
Once Again,"Should‚Äôve told Andy Serkis that there was a juicy sweeeet fish in that water, and he would‚Äôve jumped right in."
Once Again,haven't been into a show like this since Breaking Bad.
Once Again,Isn't this a sub about discussing TV shows? The show releases weekly episodes so fans come back each week. Just ignore it if you don't like the post.
Once Again,Heartbreaking üíî
Once Again,I died with him.
Once Again,"No, it‚Äôs just a good ass show. Lighten up."
Once Again,"See this show gets real organic threads from people genuinely interested in the show as opposed to the artificial corporate bought interest a show like Rings of Power gets.

The difference is that this show has people raving about it where a show like Rings of Power we're being told it's great by some mega media outlet. Or far worse, being called racist bigots because we don't like their trash. That shit is infuriating and needs to stop. 

But yeah, Andor is awesome. Total surprise."
Once Again,I‚Äôm not a fuckin bot dude
Once Again,The only people who I‚Äôve heard say it‚Äôs boring are those who didn‚Äôt get past the first episode.
Once Again,"Discussing television, yeah. But these specific weekly episode discussions are best for the specific subreddits. 

Especially OPs threads. Nothing new is being brought to the discussion, just ""this show continues to amaze"" every week. It starts coming off as shilling."
Once Again,"I stopped after the 3rd Ep, the pacing was abysmal and I'm a sucker for deeper lore stories (world building) not just about the jedis etc, i couldn't even tell you where the plot was going after 3eps"
Once Again,"i mean it is a star wars show that is somehow not getting episode discussion threads on the television subreddit, idk why they kinda stopped after like episode 4 so im fine with it"
Once Again,Tell that to the endless SNL YouTube posts every week.
Once Again,"I still see nothing wrong with this. It's too easy to ignore it. Also, it's not like it's against the rules of this sub. 

When 'The Bear' was new I used to see tons of posts like this and almost everyone saying the same thing but no one had any issues there. 

This sub likes targeting all content they don't consider prestige and whatnot. And this is one of those examples. 

As I said, it's very easy to ignore these posts so just do that please."
Once Again,"You missed something then, and I think you should circle back. By the end of Episode 3 I had to see where this story went, and it has gotten really, really good. You're missing some lovely and surprisingly deep worldbuilding."
Once Again,">I'm a sucker for deeper lore stories (world building)

real ""all according to keikaku (keikaku means plan)"" energy going on here"
Once Again,It has several arcs all broken up into 3 episodes. We just finished the prison break arc and into something else.
Once Again,no more than twelve
Once Again,"The issue is that this is a comment, not a post. There is absolutely nothing in OP's post to encourage discussion. No questions. Just ""I love this show"". If everyone in this sub decided to do the same thing every time they watched an hour of television they liked, wouldn't that be a problem?"
Once Again,"I'll give it a re-watch, thanks :)"
Once Again,If you‚Äôre reading this: episode 1 is worth every damn minute of your time (44ish if I‚Äôm correct).
Once Again,Well of course he is a comic visionary. The guy graduated from one of Canada‚Äôs top business schools with really good grades.
Once Again,"There were at least 4 times in this episode that my wife and I yelled some variation of ‚Äúhe did what?!‚Äù During this episode. 

Totally bizarre, captivating, and amazing."
Once Again,It actually had me in suspense
Once Again,Isn't the whole point that the show takes literally zero chances
Once Again,"Loved it, it was captivating. The ending had me screaming at my TV.

Some of his best work yet.

(it's on Binge here in Australia)"
Once Again,All shall Bow down to Nathan
Once Again,I just watched ‚ÄúThe Rehearsal‚Äù last night and loved it! It‚Äôs fascinating and has a weird/funny tone.
Once Again,This was literally the best thing I've seen since Bo Burnham's Inside. Nathan is truly a master at his craft
Once Again,Nathan Is Truly Something Special.
Once Again,That‚Äôs the guy from Cool Teens
Once Again,The hype for this is wholly deserved.  One of the most incredible things I‚Äôve seen in many years
Once Again,Is there any way to watch this in the UK legitimately?
Once Again,He‚Äôs one of my role models truly
Once Again,Anyone who enjoys this *needs* to watch How To with John Wilson. A very different show that somehow scratches the same itch. I think Nathan produced it too.
Once Again,"1st ep was genius, borderline sociopathic, but genius nonetheless"
Once Again,dissecting human nature
Once Again,"It may not just be for me, but isn‚Äôt is comedy at the expense of others?  Or am I misunderstanding?"
Once Again,Is this a reality show? I just cannot tell from the description.
Once Again,Couldn‚Äôt even make it thru the first episode.
Once Again,It‚Äôs like ‚Äúdoor city‚Äù over here.
Once Again,What streaming service is it on? I keep seeing posts about the show but not where I can watch it
Once Again,It‚Äôs days like these that I curse the chinese for inventing gunpowder
Once Again,Just finished it. Laughed out loud many times but the camera cut in the alley at the end to the actor had me keeled over
Once Again,"Just watched it based on your comment! It was a good first episode, great concept! Just a bit more wholesome than comedic than I expected from reading the title."
Once Again,?
Once Again,"Lemme guess: 

-Starting fake blog 

-Hiring dude's friend to write for blog 

-Using fake blog to interview trivia host and steal questions for trivia contest

-Building complete replica set of bar 

-Everything else"
Once Again,"Well played. Although, I‚Äôd say the show itself takes chances, but the people in the experiment in the show do not."
Once Again,"Show some respect, its the guy who made the Teenyverse."
Once Again,"Sadly, there isn‚Äôt. You can check this website: https://www.justwatch.com/uk/tv-series/the-rehearsal"
Once Again,Not yet but it is a regular HBO show so it will turn up on Sky at some point. They usually air the smaller shows like this once they wrap their runs.
Once Again,"His last show, Nathan For You, definitely had moments that were trying to be funny at the expense of others--although it was more common for Nathan to use himself as the butt of a joke. 

In this show (or at least in the first episode that aired last night) the comedy is mostly about the extreme lengths he goes to in order to help someone, and I really can't remember a single moment that felt mean-spirited to me."
Once Again,He never makes anyone do or say anything. They know they're doing a TV show.  The beauty of the show is that he's getting genuine reactions from people.
Once Again,"From the description, it sounds awkward as hell. 

> the goal of the show is to help real people prepare for difficult conversations or big life changes by putting them through a practice session with actors posing as loved ones, friends, and bystanders. But as the first season wears on, Fielder, playing a needy and insecure version of himself, becomes as much a part of the rehearsals as the folks he is supposedly assisting, and uses these interactions to reflect on his existential woes

So it's real people, and they're having to deal with someone playing a huge narcissist and making their problems about himself. Yikes."
Once Again,Its a comedian interacting with real people. So kinda like Borat but a completely different vibe
Once Again,Yes. Nathan has a script for some parts but the rest is real.
Once Again,"It‚Äôs close to a comedic version of Straight Guy. Real people and real situations, but kind of over the top in a comedic, but not mean spirited way."
Once Again,You have to watch it. I technically couldn't tell you it's unscripted but it's as blurry a line as it could possibly ever be
Once Again,It‚Äôs like Nathan For You with HBO‚Äôs budget and fewer side quests.
Once Again,"And that's totally ok. I love it, but I also get that it's just not some people's sense of humor."
Once Again,HBO max
Once Again,"I lost it when he came out in disguise with baggy pants a too large jacket , a bucket hat and a shell necklace."
Once Again,"Reference 
https://youtu.be/_w5D4QJbLW8"
Once Again,"Most of those, plus the answers given on a walk, and how Nate‚Äôs confession at the end about the trivia answers was to the actor he was working with, not the actual person. And it took me a full 10-15 seconds to realize it wasn‚Äôt the same guy."
Once Again,Ty
Once Again,"I wouldn't hold your breath, How To With John Wilson still hasn't ever been released in the UK nearly two years after its US release"
Once Again,Agreed. I actually felt like he showed how sympathetic the real people were. I was rooting for them the whole time
Once Again,That is great to hear.
Once Again,I appreciate that.  And l know they sign up for it.  I guess it‚Äôs just not for me.  I want to see people shine.
Once Again,Thank you for this.  I don‚Äôt know why our comments got downvoted.
Once Again,Nathan for You also had HBO's budget.
Once Again,thanks idk why i got downvoted lol
Once Again,Holy crap! I didn‚Äôt notice that.
Once Again,That show is brilliant.
Once Again,I wonder if all episodes will be like this. The big lesson will be that we worry about the worst reaction from people for no reason
Once Again,"Wow my comment hasn't aged well, The Rehearsal comes out in the UK tomorrow"
Once Again,Rosa Salazar is Aubrey Plaza except.. Well no they‚Äôre just. Both great. They need to be sisters in a movie. Or mortal enemies
Once Again,"Well I‚Äôm going to have to check this out. Her track record for me in Alita Battle Angel, Undone, and Brand New Cherry Flavor means I‚Äôll basically give anything she‚Äôs in a shot"
Once Again,Was this ever in doubt? Hoping to god for a Alita sequel
Once Again,"Battle Angel Alita and Undone already proved this. Your fault for sleeping on both, Variety."
Once Again,r/WeddingSeasonHulu for episode discussions
Once Again,"Finished it, woah what a ride. I recommend it. Plenty of interesting moments. Rosa is great."
Once Again,That's a Disney+ show though. It was made by Disney+ UK.
Once Again,I don‚Äôt get the insane vibes from Rosa that Aubrey has always given me. So there‚Äôs that.
Once Again,"Brand New Cherry Flavour is top notch weird horror shinanigans.

Up there with Archive 81 and Midnight Mass for me."
Once Again,"> Hoping to god for a Alita sequel. 


Me too, so long I'm just gonna read all the spin-off manga"
Once Again,"Weird is an understatement. That show was bonkers. I loved it, though. So did Blake Bortles."
The Bachelorette,"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Shot_at_Love_with_Tila_Tequila

>A Shot at Love with Tila Tequila is an American reality television dating game show similar to the TV show The Bachelor.[1] It premiered on October 9, 2007 on MTV starring Tila Tequila.[2] The series consists of a bisexual-themed reality dating show where 16 heterosexual male men and 16 lesbian female women contestants live in Tequila's house and compete for her attention and affection.

It was a terrible, trashy MTV show. I don't know why I remember it."
The Bachelorette,Are You The One already did a bisexual season. And it was a great.
The Bachelorette,I don't watch the Bachelorette but I'd imagine that would make the show more interesting just because it changes the dynamics.
The Bachelorette,"What stops contestants from getting together with each other in this case, instead of the Bachelorette?  I'm curious, not enough watch, but curious."
The Bachelorette,A Shot at Love with Tila Tequila wants the idea for their show a decade ago back
The Bachelorette,"Are we likely to see a bisexual Bachelor, where men and women are trying to win the heart of a guy? Of course not, because our supposedly woke and progressive society would rather not see two dudes kissing"
The Bachelorette,She‚Äôs also the first indigenous one
The Bachelorette,Say her name 5 times fast
The Bachelorette,"the only thing i've learned about bisexuals is that men are okay with dating bisexual women, but women hate dating bisexual men"
The Bachelorette,"And in 30yrs we might let it be a bi bachelor. Great to see progress, but we're still a long way off proper equality"
The Bachelorette,"I hope the contestants start pairing up after going through this strange shared experiment, and she‚Äôs left with no one. These ‚Äúlove contests‚Äù are the absolute strangest thing. Why would anyone compete for someone‚Äôs heart without first knowing if they actually wanted a relationship with them?"
The Bachelorette,Tila Tequila did it
The Bachelorette,"I think reality shows are pathetic bottom of the barrel trash, but having a bisexual girl in this show sounds kind of interesting ngl"
The Bachelorette,Sooooo how do I watch this from Canada...
The Bachelorette,r/bisexual
The Bachelorette,"Wow that's woke as fuck, I'll definitely be sure to watch it now....."
The Bachelorette,So she gets a wife and husband?
The Bachelorette,Wonder if any contestant will be trans...just to round things out - and for ratings.
The Bachelorette,*Tila Tequila has entered the chat*
The Bachelorette,"Well, its not like the show could get any worse"
The Bachelorette,"I love that her Wikipedia entry has her listed as:

> Tila Tequila

> American neo-Nazi television and social media personality"
The Bachelorette,"It wasn't just trashy TV, it was the PINNACLE of trashy TV. A masterpiece of the early 2000s trash reality show era."
The Bachelorette,Tila also went loony right wing like a fox.
The Bachelorette,"I WANT REPRESENTATION!

Gets: Tila Tequila, or Caitlyn Jenner, or Milo Yiannopoulos, or Ellen DeGeneres, or Lisa Nowak or Colin Ireland or...

FUUUUUCK!"
The Bachelorette,Holy shit I remember that show - prime trashy TV. MTV  and Fuse are like the two things I miss about cable TV.
The Bachelorette,"if you‚Äôve seen it, the real question is: how could you ever forget?"
The Bachelorette,"Trashy, sure. But it was hilariously bad and definitely worth watching."
The Bachelorette,Why was it terrible / trashy?  I was never able to watch it
The Bachelorette,Only opened this thread to see if someone mentioned this. I watched the shit out of this garbage.
The Bachelorette,"Funny how Tila herself is bisexual yet none of the contestants were, only straight men and lesbians"
The Bachelorette,I think it'd be hilarious if the contestants all paired off and left the bachelorette holding the bag.
The Bachelorette,I don't think it'll happen for a while. The US Bacholor/ette seems to have deep roots in its Evangelical audience. Rarely does an episode go by where some contestant doesn't mention god. Just a season or two ago a final 4 got dumped for not being Christian.
The Bachelorette,Nothing really stops the contestants from doing whatever they like even in the past seasons though the ones who want to stay on the show and get famous will try to play along with the storylines  even if they plan to hook up with another contestant after the show.
The Bachelorette,All the women are gay? Except for her
The Bachelorette,Apparently [nothing](https://www.glamour.com/story/two-bachelor-contestants-prove-you-can-find-love-on-reality-tv).
The Bachelorette,"imagine if that happened, it would ruin the whole show"
The Bachelorette,"Whatever drives the ratings, baybeee"
The Bachelorette,Yep. All this is doing is highlighting how ‚Äúok‚Äù bi women are compared to men.
The Bachelorette,I am glad someone is willing to point out the double standard. Men are treated very differently when it comes to sexual experimentation and identity.
The Bachelorette,Speak from your own experience. I‚Äôve dated a bi guy and I‚Äôd do it again.
The Bachelorette,Not all women. I would be down with dating a bi guy
The Bachelorette,"While there are anecdotal examples as the two female posters below, the stats or studies agree with your comment. On average women strongly prefer heterosexual men.

Is because women are more close minded or is it because they feel that this may lead to problems down the road?

And are men more ok with dating bisexual women?   While many men fantasize about threesomes, the reality will be different.  Men sometimes have a tendency to be jealous and perhaps this is would not be something that some men would want to contend with."
The Bachelorette,"It took 25 season for The Bachelor to have a black lead, so probably"
The Bachelorette,"Good point, I was thinking the same thing myself."
The Bachelorette,Torrent.
The Bachelorette,Say you're a piece of shit without saying youre a piece of shit
The Bachelorette,No it's a ratings gold mine. She was massively popular on the Bachelor and Bachelor in Paradise. If she's openly pan-sexual then why not give her the choices she wants rather than strict males because the incel crowd will get all fragile about it?
The Bachelorette,"Is there any possible format which involves a bisexual or gay person that wouldn't be ""woke as fuck"" to some blowhard like yourself?"
The Bachelorette,[deleted]
The Bachelorette,I imagine one or the other... Didn't say she's seeking a thrupple.
The Bachelorette,Whoa TIL that Tila went crazy
The Bachelorette,"Man, I knew she was a flat earther, so it really shouldn‚Äôt have been this surprising to me."
The Bachelorette,A non white neo-Nazi? Tf?
The Bachelorette,"Why did they leave out ""lesbian and anal themed porn star""?"
The Bachelorette,"If all you ask for is representation, the best you‚Äôll ever get is such as picked by the same self interested parties that own power structures.  You need to ask for equal access independent status."
The Bachelorette,So i guess im not the only one who roots against the bachelor/bachelorette on these shows
The Bachelorette,I hate to say this but all the contestants will have to be monosexual for this to work lol
The Bachelorette,I don't think that's as likely as you think
The Bachelorette,[The Gay Bachelor](https://youtu.be/YdKYwI4C4t4)
The Bachelorette,So the ladies can get together with each other.
The Bachelorette,No bi contestants?
The Bachelorette,"She‚Äôs gay too, just a bisexual gay"
The Bachelorette,"Yeah I'm kinda torn about this. I'm all for representation but the show has always been openly trashy, full of manufactured drama and exaggerated titillation. I worry this will lean heavily into ""look at these hot girls kissing each other"" under the guise of equality.

Basically something like this could be great and interesting if it were put in the right hands. The Bachelorette producers are not the right hands."
The Bachelorette,"It‚Äôs not ‚Äúok‚Äù for women to be Bi. It‚Äôs ok for them to make out and look sexy and hot with women for the pleasure of men. At the end of the day they still are expected to end up with men. The stigma for bi men and women looks different, but it‚Äôs still definitely there."
The Bachelorette,"There is definitely a double standard.  Is it in part because anytime a woman is with another woman, that means they aren't with a man?  Promoting bisexuality in men gives men more options which isn't a priority."
The Bachelorette,Why do you think that is?
The Bachelorette,"I wish I was as woke as you are, fortunately for me it isnt actually possible for me to give less fucks what you think of me."
The Bachelorette,"Not to mention the extra potential for drama, especially if any of the contestants are bi too. I‚Äôd bet money there will be at least one ‚Äúscandal‚Äù where the contestants hook up with each other and/or use flirting to screw other contestants over."
The Bachelorette,"Probably not, certainly not reality TV where the name of the game is exploitation. As a far as I was aware what I choose to watch on TV isnt yet dictated by easily offended little snowflakes. Or people like yourself."
The Bachelorette,"She's not trans, she bi."
The Bachelorette,"Oh  fuck right off, this sad excuse for a TV show has nothing to do with finding love, it just a platform for another no name reality TV star to get ""famous"" while having no discernible talent in the first place. The fact that she bi or whatever is just pandering to the lowest common denominator and to show how woke as fuck the company making the show is."
The Bachelorette,"It's TV, anything can still happen. Next week on..."
The Bachelorette,She was always fucking crazy.
The Bachelorette,Her Wiki is nuts
The Bachelorette,"""went"""
The Bachelorette,"My best friend recently came out to me as a flat earther. Tried to sell me on it and the fact that all history and science we‚Äôve been taught is all a grand conspiracy. 

I asked him what anyone would gain from telling us the world is round if it is really flat. He hasn‚Äôt spoken to me in three days."
The Bachelorette,"If you look deep enough, flat earth has some weird anti Semitic Nazi shit"
The Bachelorette,"> The former reality star describes herself as a an ""alt-reich queen"" and an adamant Trump supporter. She once tweeted: ""Women who complain about Trump saying 'Grab her by the p‚Äîsy!' are r‚Äî-rds because I love getting grabbed by the p**sy! LMAO!""

> Tequila also once posted a photo of herself and two white men performing the SS salute and tweeting ""Seig heil!""

[link](https://www.ranker.com/list/what-happened-to-tila-tequila/anncasano)"
The Bachelorette,Neo-Nazis aren't known for their logic.
The Bachelorette,The best part is she starts down the Nazi path after getting brain damage. Best part being that of course you would need to be brain damaged to be alt-right
The Bachelorette,it's really not that far fetched or surprising
The Bachelorette,"They don't know what to call people who don't fit into their pre-made categories.  Like you'll see Black British referred to as African-Americans in American media, even though they're not American at all.  They just see a person of African descent, with African features, and automatically call them African-American without even thinking."
The Bachelorette,Does anyone root *for* them?
The Bachelorette,"You clearly don't know the controversy of the Bachelor who one month after they finished filming and realized oh this woman I picked sucks in the sack called up producers to change his choice. 

Man what an extra humiliation, it's one thing when you complain about a starfish girl to your mates, it's another when you get an entire production studio to produce an extra juicy episode about it."
The Bachelorette,"Why can‚Äôt they be bi as well? If anything, there‚Äôs more potential for scandal (contestants hooking up) that way."
The Bachelorette,[deleted]
The Bachelorette,"But then, the men have no one to be with except if they're all bi too (unlikely) so there are still some contestants at least."
The Bachelorette,"Of course not, [nobody wants to see bisexual men.](https://www.cdc.gov/msmhealth/stigma-and-discrimination.htm)"
The Bachelorette,"No, that's not how that works. She's bi.

Bi is bi, gay is gay."
The Bachelorette,"I hate that she has to be almost model perfect to be no representation but Brooke is the real deal in terms of self awareness, poise and intelligence. She‚Äôs a Sports Presenter (football) and carries herself well. If there‚Äôs anyone who can pull off the show with dignity and articulate sexuality without pandering to fetishisation it‚Äôs Brooke. She already showed on a different season (when she was on the bachelor) couple photos of her ex GF and they were so cute and not for male gaze."
The Bachelorette,Would it be any less fetishized if it were a bi male host instead?
The Bachelorette,"Exactly, bi women are fetishized, bi men are ostracized."
The Bachelorette,"Yes, that is what men think.  But that is foolish.    I don't know if women think that way.  The number of bi-women with other bi-women with is increasing rapidly.  

I agree we shouldn't stigmatize and mistreat LGBTQ people. The problem would be if the rate of bi males doesn't keep up with the rapid rise in bisexual women.   What happens if 25% of women are in relationships with other women?  I think you will find that men will have to be even more competitive (possibly bringing out the worst characteristics of competition ) to attract women and societies where men have no chance of finding a mate historically have been much more violent."
The Bachelorette,"Because society expects all men to always be the alpha, the dominant macho male. If they aren't, they are seen as inferior. Then that is coupled with the perception that being on the receiving end of gay intercourse means that you are submissive and weak. 

When it comes to lesbian sex, there is no such prejudice.

A woman can kiss another woman and it can be passed off as it being a phase or her experimenting. If a man kisses another man, he will be labeled gay for life."
The Bachelorette,"Yet here you are, engaging people with your shit opinions."
The Bachelorette,As you post here begging for attention..
The Bachelorette,"Yeah, but I didn‚Äôt know she was a Nazi."
The Bachelorette,"I went to high school with a kid who was always a bit off. He would randomly start talking about wanting to live in the woods like Thoreau, shit like that. One time when we were watching a documentary in psych class, he passed out and fell out of his desk and knocked his head on the hard floor at full force. He was back at school the next day so we all assumed he was fine, no concussion or anything. He got way weirder after the fall though. Started insisting he was related to our psych teacher and going on very weird tangents about communism in the middle of unrelated class discussions. 

A few years later and now he‚Äôs posting about Qanon and 5G microchips, denying the Holocaust, ‚ÄúBush did 9-11‚Äù type stuff, all of it. I‚Äôm pretty sure he got some sort of brain damage from that fall that the hospital somehow managed to miss."
The Bachelorette,"You should be looking out for your friend. 

Flat earth spirals really fast into antisemitism. 

It's hard but you gotta try to pull them back from the edge"
The Bachelorette,"Considering a day is one full spin of the Earth, which implies the world being round, maybe your friend just thinks it's still the same day?"
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"Probably around when tv shows (mostly streaming and HBO) started to have budgets big enough to afford those actors.

You‚Äôll notice the old system like what you‚Äôre talking about (distinction of tv and film actors) is still pretty distinct in network tv, where the only exception I can think of is Viola Davis doing How to Get Away With Murder."
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,Glenn Close in The Shield was one of the first I noticed
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,The West Wing helped - Sheen and Lowe.
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"George Clooney stayed on er for a few years, even after he was Batman."
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,24?
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"1st season of True Detective. Don't know exactly why, but it felt like there was a shift after this where tv shows became more prestigious for movie actors."
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,The advent of streaming services has blurred if not outright obliterated that line.
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"I wouldn‚Äôt say there‚Äôs one clear answer but tv as a whole got taken a lot more serious in the mid-late 00s. With stuff like mad men and breaking bad, it became more appealing to do tv for high quality performances. But going back earlier id say west wing and sopranos are two that paved the way for how tv evolved. But shows like mad men and breaking bad didn‚Äôt have movie stars leading the way. Bryan Cranston was a tv guy at the time and has now become a versatile character actor across film, tv and theatre.

Alec Baldwin doing 30 rock gave it a lot of gravitas and he was one of the first to do tv and still be considered a big star in the modern era. 

People like Kate winslet often did miniseries around 2010/11 era and would usually get high acclaim and Emmy‚Äôs which would‚Äôve made it more appealing to others.

Maggie smith in Downton abbey would‚Äôve been a big one. Jeff Daniels in the newsroom. Matthew McConaughey in true detectives.

Veep as well, even though Julia Louis Dreyfus is more successful on tv, the quality of performance she was giving on tv would make big film stars realise that tv could be creatively fulfilling too.

I think ultimately streaming really played a big part. It offered immense creative control, shorter seasons and lots of money. House of cards was an early streamer and it had the movie star prestige from stars and fincher behind the scenes"
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"1979's *Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy*, arguably. Sir Alec Guiness (and we don't hand out knighthoods to that many actors, usually one or two an honours list), who was financially secure off his percentage of the huge gross of *Star Wars*, does a miniseries adapting a spy novel and wins a BAFTA. Then he does *Smiley's People* in 1982 and wins another one."
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,I think 24 was one of the firsts that I remember.  Kiefer Sutherland was a pretty big movie star in the 90s
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"Movie actors have been transitioning to tv for decades.

Barbara Stanwyck moved to tv in 1965 with the western show The Big Valley

Burt Reynolds who went from TV (Gunsmoke) to movies and back to TV with the show Evening Shade in the 90s.

Martin Sheen went to tv in 1999 with The West Wing.

Alec Baldwin went to tv with 30 Rock.

Michael J Fox also went from TV to movies and back to TV with Spin City

One of the earliest being Lucille Ball. She started off in movies and then did a string of tv shows starting with I Love Lucy.

Michael Keaton currently has the show Dopesick.

Angela Lansbury with Murder, She Wrote in the 80s and 90s"
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,You could argue that the Sopranos paved the way with it's hour long almost cinematic style episodes heralding serious TV closely followed by trailblazing programs like the Shield and West Wing in the US. They paved the way for House of Cards and then Game of thrones amongst many.
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"It was a combination of many factors, like the quality and prestige of television shows going up and fewer opportunities to do mature storytelling that doesn‚Äôt involve wearing a superhero costume in film. Breaking Bad didn‚Äôt have any movie stars, but the success of Breaking Bad made a lot of people aware of what kind of stories could be done on television and they could look first rate.

The money dynamics also changed. TV checks began to go up for stars as movie checks were beginning to go down for people who weren‚Äôt gigantic names."
The Holiday Movies That Made Us, Now it‚Äôs commonplace used to usually signal a dying career for an actor
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"Kiefer Sutherland on 24 is the actual answer. It started for him out of necessity, but boy did it inspire others to do the same"
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"The correct answer is House of Cards. Kevin Spacey was one of the greatest actors of his generation (no matter what his personal morals are) and a multi acting Oscar winner.

If *he* could work on TV then everyone could. At least that‚Äôs how it felt at the time."
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,HBO True Detective for sure helped in this narrative
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"The business changed behind the scenes. You didn‚Äôt have ‚ÄúTV actors‚Äù and ‚Äúmovie actors.‚Äù You had studio talent stables. Actors in movies had multi picture deals and first look opportunities that were constantly spinning plates. Actors in the television circuit worked an annualized industry that had very specific periods where everyone did the same thing (ie: pilot season). You were in the production flow of one or the other and there wasn‚Äôt much crossover from a professional situation. Different people in charge of TV and movies, different groups to get ‚Äúin‚Äù with. And movie actors approached their craft aiming to make 2 perfect hours over months with take after take, not 24 ‚Äúbest you can do in a week‚Äù stories getting good at moving quickly. Different skills and working preferences. Also, movies mean temporary work and a tv show is a steady gig.

Then streaming happened, and the annualized TV model broke apart. Netflix spent big to contract movie stars to TV shows to bring the box office draw to their service, and it worked. Kevin Spacey (pervert) was the biggest named star and success with House of Cards, but it was relays happening behind the scenes. Suddenly Netflix could offer both worlds: the chance to craft your perfect hours, without the annualized scheduling. And the same people at the top whether it‚Äôs a movie or a tv show. Granted, lots of other headaches, but they removed the business barriers that kept people in tv/movie silos.

It wasnt any one actor that changed things. The business shifted and this was an inevitability."
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"Robert Mitchum, a huge Hollywood star, did Winds of War in 1983. From what I've read, he admitted it was just for the paycheck."
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"To me the explosion of it started with House of Cards.

Of course there have always been downgraded stars from Movie to tv or a tv star becoming a movie star from the beginning, but streaming, production deals with the stars, higher quality, and fewer episode make it appealing for stars.

I think Friends started the notion that movie stars and tv can go hand in hand with their frequent guest stars. I temper Julia Roberts was in an arc with her then boyfriend Benjamin Bratt on Law and Order."
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,True Detective. Was probably the biggest catalyst to Matthew McConaughey‚Äôs Oscar win.
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"Jimmy Stewart had a sitcom for a year, c. 1970. Shirley MacLaine likewise. Henry Fonda likewise, except it was more of a dramedy. Anthony Quinn, too, except it was an hour drama. Donna Reed was a movie star, went on to a sitcom for almost a decade. Likewise Miss Barbara Stanwyck, except it was a Western. Doris Day and Rock Hudson were the biggest box office stars in America, she did about five years on a sitcom, and he on a detective show. James Garner became a TV detective, too. Bing Crosby had a sitcom. Robert Wagner was a minor movie star before becoming a TV spy - Fred Astaire recurred as his father."
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"I think there has (almost) always been crossover; I recall Jimmy Stewart, Henry Fonda, Bette Davis, and Katherine Hepburn doing TV in the 60s/70s."
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"While it doesn't necessarily involve big actors dropping down from film careers to TV (though there's plenty of names appearing in the show), I'd say Sopranos was one of the first to show ""Hollywood"" actors that TV was becoming the place to go for a good role."
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"Michael J Fox was in Family Ties, but he might've been the exception back then.


I would say that one of the big ones might've been Clooney staying on ER after going into movies."
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"The recent trend was definitely started by Big Little Lies. Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman being co-leads in a show was huge, while also being surrounded by other actors mostly known for film. Afrer it being both incredibly successful critically and commercially is when we really started seeing more and more movie stars try to get their own TV project. Even Meryl Streep joined this particular show for its second season. In the years after we suddenly got people like Amy Adams and Cate Blanchett also leading their own limited series."
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"I feel like it was more that the movie going industry is slowly dying combined with the explosion of the streaming age and the hunt for content is what led to more ""movie stars"" in TV shows. There was just more demand and money in TV. Will be interesting to see what happens since it's looking like the TV streaming bubble is bursting a bit."
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"Everything the others have said, plus the quality of the picture and sound in TV sets has made a difference. That and soaring theater prices. Throw in Covid and movies were almost DOA. More TV channels to compete for an audience leads to improvement in product."
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"It was less about any specific show and more about the rise of cable television shows, which were shorter and thus less of a time commitment for actors who worked mostly in film.

In the 00s it was mostly actors who weren't big stars, in the 10s the move to bigger stars happened, I think the most crucial one was probably True Detective since it was so successful.

It should be said that HBO, who made True Detective, already made ""prestige"" miniseries with big actors, so the jump from that to ""limited series"" (which is what True Detective was initially pitched as) wasn't so big."
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"Cate Blanchett did Mrs. America and her performance went a bit unnoticed because the show didn't get a lot of traction. She had done TV before but all in Australia. 

She'll be doing another series streaming on Apple TV later this year.

And Nicole Kidman doing BLL... she continued to do several more limited series."
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,The Shield had Glenn Close and Forest Whitaker
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,10 episode seasons.  Then they could still do films.
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,Michael B Jordan minor character in The Wire
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,I think the popularity of shorter seasons or miniseries have definitely gotten movie stars to join tv. Alot of well-written shows that don't require you signing years long contracts.
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,[deleted]
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,Good call. Forest Whitaker surprised me as well. What a tremendous show.
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,And in Damages
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"This is it, it was a really big deal at the time and actually changed the industry."
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"100%

Between The Shield and the Sopranos, movie actors began doing TV. Glenn Close, Forest Whitaker, Steve Buscemi, Joe Pantoliano, etc."
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,her character was so good
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,Rob Lowe was doing west wing for a bit of a comeback wasn‚Äôt he? He wasn‚Äôt as big in the 90s after his scandal
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,this is probably the most correct answer.
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"He was contractually bound to the show, but he certainly isn‚Äôt a good answer to the prompt since he was mostly a nobody when ER began."
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"This can‚Äôt possibly be true


Edit: you‚Äôre right. That‚Äôs insane."
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"Yeah, it kind of went '89 Quantum Leap,  '90 Dream On, '93 NYPD Blue, '94 ER, '99 Sopranos & West Wing, '01 24, '02 The Wire, everything everywhere.

The commercial tv vs cable premium was kind of a thing, but serialized tv that showed big budget television could be profitable kept pushing the budget higher with breakthrough shows. 

24 was one of the first serialized commercial tv shows with a movie actor lead that seemed like every episode could have been in a movie theater, and the buzz around it was massive."
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"That same year you had Billy Bob Thornton doing *Fargo*, and we were fresh off of Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright doing the first season of *House of Cards* and Netflix pulling Kyle Chandler back to TV for *Bloodline*."
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"Yeah, I definitely think True Detective sort of paved the way for this shift. This obviously wasn't the first time it happened, but I do feel like it was when TV shows became more appealing for movie actors."
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"It certainly wasn't the first, but I do agree that it felt like a turning point that led to the floodgates opening."
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,the change OP is referring to happened before streaming reshaped the landscape
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,That did not impact Hollywood though
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"I think the difference was the career arcs for actors transitioning basically boiled down to:

 - Up and coming actors made a name on TV, then moved to the movies.

 - Actors with fading or stalling film careers transition to TV 

We didn't usually see things like Matthew McConaughey doing *Dallas Buyers Club*, moving to TV for *True Detective*, and coming out with *Intersteller* the same year. Or Dwayne Johnson doing Fast and Furious movies, then multiple seasons of *Ballers* while still headlining action-comedy movies."
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"I call stuff like *Game of Thrones* ""cinematic television"" - shows with the budget and scope of movies."
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,And it turned out to be one his most celebrated roles.
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"I agree too. Before everything broke about him being a pedophile, Spacey was like A+ list level. He was at the top of the game really. Then he starred in a TV series that was exclusively online & that really caused big names to reconsider TV shows."
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"Your answer is the closest to being correct on here.

It was actually in the 1950s.  

There was originally a lot of hesitation and scorn of the TV medium by the Hollywood stars.  But they gradually warmed up to it and then a flood of big movie stars crossed over to TV in the 50s and 60s."
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"Yeah, it was right around 24 and The Sopranos that the budget, scope, and prestige started to really shift in a noticeable way"
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"He didn‚Äôt stay on ER, he left as soon as he could. If he could have gotten out of his contract after the second season, he would have."
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,Three years before that *True Detective* had mid-McConaunaissance Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson a decade removed from his last TV appearance in the middle of the Hunger Games series and *Fargo* had Billy Bob Thornton in lead. That was the year I felt like TV started shifting from the 30 Rock joke that Alec Baldwin makes about actors doing TV and never going back to A-list again.
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"He wasn't a movie star, he was like 14 and it was one of his first roles. 

Great performance and character though, it's easy to see why he was able to find success."
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"Eh, I‚Äôd consider Samberg a tv actor that does the occasional movie between seasons, which is kind of the classic tv actor career."
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"He was, and considering he's pretty much only done TV and TV Movies since he falls under the regular historic transition of ""stalled and fading movie actors move to TV"""
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,Excuse me he was a handy man on facts of life.
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,True Detective and House of Cards were definitely the first two shows I thought of.
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"Considering that a lot of Hollywood is made of Brits and actors talk to each other, it arguably had some impact."
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"FYI, films and TV are made outside of Hollywood."
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"Yeah, this is the sea change. TV is seen as an equally viable medium to the movies, not just the space for rookies and has-beens."
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"> shows with the budget and scope of movies.

That's somewhat insulting to those shows IMO, the scope is much bigger.  
It's the reason why I prefer shows over movies, a movie could never tell a story of that scope."
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"I'm not saying there weren't instances of it happening before, but both those shows in 2014 didn't start a trend that then followed with years of many high-profile film actors doing TV. Ryan Murphy was one of the only few consistently getting them in his projects, and HBO had the occasional series starring one or two. It didn't happen much that they crossed over other places. Even when Fargo and True Detective were onto their second seasons, looking back their only competition in terms of movie stars was still... Ryan Murphy (ACS/AHS) and HBO themselves (Show Me A Hero). Outside of that you had limited series like American Crime, Roots, Flesh & Bone, War and Peace, The Missing, Texas Rising, Wolf Hall, a 24 mini-series.... hardly a crop full of movie stars. Even against Big Little Lies and the year after the most shows were still things like The Looming Tower, Godless, Howards End, Patrick Melrose, American Vandal, Gilmore Girls. Not that many movie stars leading anything in sight. True Detective and Fargo were among shows that helped to destimigatize, but it is not when every movie star decided to get their own TV project.

Fast forward two/three years and we're getting George Clooney making the jump back to TV and also Cate Blanchett on Hulu, Emma Stone, Ren√©e Zellweger and Octavia Spencer on Netflix, Michelle Williams on FX, Benicio del Toro and Russell Crowe on Showtime, Chris Evans on Apple... Al Pacino on Amazon? This was the moment where not just HBO and Ryan Murphy were getting movie stars. Now suddenly they started popping up everywhere. Constantly. And this is all besides HBO and Ryan Murphy continuing to do their thing. And it has only intensified ever since. Big Little Lies was hardly the first show to ever do it, but that show and *especially* Meryl fucking Streep jumping on the bandwagon with a second season was easily a turning point for the industry. It's about the show that started the trend. The one that made it look even more feasible for movie stars to make the jump. It wasn't the only show to contribute to it, but it's **the** one to point at if you really want to narrow it down to where a switch happened."
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,[deleted]
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,Boss on Roseanne too
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"Same here. All 4 are pretty big hitters, Spacey and McConaughey being most notable. Hell, McConaughey won an Oscar the same year True Detective came out. 

House or Cards was the big one though IMO. Kevin Spacey was basically A+ list if you ask me; before the scandal & all that, he was probably my favorite actor. His inclusion to House of Cards immediately legitimized Netflix as a heavy hitter for prestige TV, but also really got the ball rolling for movie stars to join TV series."
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,I absolutely think it would have had an impact. If you have an actor of Guiness' stature on TV it would have definitely been noticed in Hollywood.
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"The shift really starts in the mid to late 1990s with Glenn Close doing The Shield.

Before that point when a TV star had a movie that did well they stopped doing TV eg Bruce Willis"
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,What impact did it have? How did Alec Guinness influence in the US with his decision?
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,Yes but the division between TV and movies was a US thing and it persisted for decades after Guinness.
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"I feel like **the** show to point to would be *House of Cards* with Fincher behind the scenes and Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright carrying things - True Detective and Fargo were signs it wouldn't just be a streaming service throwing money at those sorts of things. After 2014 HBO tapped Dwayne Johnson (in the midst of high level movie success) for multiple seasons of *Ballers* starting in 2015, then in 2016 Winona Rider started in *Stranger Things* and Ed Harris joined *Westworld*. Big Little Lies was continuing an ongoing trend."
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"There‚Äôs a difference between being in movies and being a film actor in this concept. It‚Äôs more so about where the body of their work and what they‚Äôre known for. 

Nicole Kidman is a film actor that does tv

Reese Witherspoon is a film actor that does tv

Tom Cruise is a film actor (doesn‚Äôt do tv)

Nathan Fillion is a tv actor that does movies

Ellen Pompeo is a tv actor (doesn‚Äôt do movies)

Jennifer Aniston is a tv actor that does movies

In regards to Samberg, he‚Äôs mostly known for tv (B99 and SNL). He‚Äôs not a movie star to the point where he‚Äôs plastered across all the advertisements and is a major box office draw.

I mean, it‚Äôs kind of a pedantic concept, but I hope you get what I mean."
The Holiday Movies That Made Us,"> The shift really starts in the mid to late 1990s with Glenn Close doing The Shield.

The Shield didn't start until 2002."

Why do we automatically believe every allegation ever made? Of any type?

Why didn't she go to the police right away? Is she going now? Is she pressing charges? I am not familiar with this show, but it's reality tv - everything is filmed, right? This will be the easiest criminal and then civil judgement imaginable?

Are You The One,"Not surprised. That mentality is definitely ingrained in the industry.. I'm glad she is okay but that's traumatizing to say the least.. Doesn't matter if you're smart or stupid, no one deserves to be taken advantage of. Even if the cams are or aren't on."
Are You The One,Paywall for me:(
Are You The One,I remember the two leads going on Seth Meyers and talking about the eerie similarities of their show to The Bachelor. Like the episode where a contestant shits herself and then it literally happened in the episode of The Bachelor that aired the next night. Wild.
Are You The One,"They almost certainly gave her something else or a shit ton of it. The way she is described as being so out of it and her eyes dilated, a ""low dose"" of an SSRI is not going to do that. The amount of booze the producers give these kids is extremely problematic."
Are You The One,"Zoloft (sertraline) does not necessarily takes weeks to build up, it can show some effects immediately, but it's true that it wouldn't work like that. Neither would it make her calm down, nor would it exacerbate effects of alcohol that much^(1). If they did give her something to calm her down and it made her intoxicated more than the alcohol, then it could have been some benzo, ambien or something. 

1 - SSRIs don't directly interact with alcohol, but due to overall mechanism of work and expected therapeutical effects, they shouldn't be mixed."
Are You The One,"It also doesn‚Äôt matter in terms of contraindications with alcohol whether you take it at night or in the early morning. 

Reality show producers sound like a notch below used car salesmen. You don‚Äôt ‚Äúdouble dosage‚Äù of Zoloft like that."

Are You The One,"And victims of abuse often stay with their abusive partners because ""I know they really love me and they don't mean to get so mad!""

What's your point?"
Are You The One,"Sexual assault can be hard to deal with. She probably had to process everything that happened to her on her own and also deal with the pressure the producers probably put on her to not tell anyone about what happened. Reality tv is also heavily edited and of course the producers wouldn‚Äôt show a woman saying no to someone several times and then cut to them having sex (or any other sexual interaction). And before you say the police can always demand the clips, the showrunners will probably give the excuse that the footage has already been deleted.

Sexual assault is no joke and people can have years of trauma because of it. Even when you have witnesses, some cases still get tossed aside or be in favor of the offender. This woman also ruined her chance of getting onto any other reality tv show by releasing this statement and maybe even other jobs that have nothing to do with tv, just because her boss might be afraid she‚Äôll say she got sexually assaulted by a co-worker. Please don‚Äôt underestimate what SA survivors have to go through to even say what happened to them, let alone press charges. The MeToo movement showed that a lot of people can get away with SA, even if there is evidence against them."
Are You The One,"Did you read the article? Other cast members confirmed the allegations, so for this to be a false accusation it‚Äôs going to require a whole lot of people lying. 

>	I am not familiar with this show, but it's reality tv - everything is filmed, right? This will be the easiest criminal and then civil judgement imaginable?

You‚Äôre way off in thinking that everything on the set of a reality show is filmed, but even if you weren‚Äôt, the lack of a criminal or civil proceeding still wouldn‚Äôt mean she‚Äôs lying."
Are You The One,You'll be downvoted. But to be honest unless there are charges/ proper allegations I just ignore the story. There is a reason we have a justice system. It's not about believing them or not. It's about due process but people like to make snap judgements.
Are You The One,"> Why do we automatically believe every allegation ever made? Of any type?

Human nature is that the more salacious the better.  And that's a sentiment that has only accelerated in recent years.

I'm a strong proponent of listen and welcome allegations, but belief has to come from proof or probability.  

I've seen incredibly distributing scenarios where people have convinced others (or even themselves) of things that didn't happen, or didn't transpire as they say.  

It seems cold, but since both sides of conflicts like this have their own reasons to dissemble or be in denial, I scramble to look for the more objective and factual pieces to guide me on which side of the probability scale to consider.

In this event, one such piece is the talk of multiple special NDA's supposedly being forced on her to sign.  If true, that's damning.  Where are they?  For me, if they exist, it strongly pushes the dial in favor of her story.  But if they don't exist, the dial goes strongly the other way. 

Friends that you've talked to for years about this may not remember what happened but be influenced in the years of discussion.  That happens a lot.  

Employees working for a culpable organization may see their career or income affected, depending on how unsympathetic or forgetful they can be.

But something that's not subject to those doubts would be the words in those two extra NDA's.  If they say ""you promise to hold us blameless and in return we don't show the sex scenes"" that's two very strong bombshells.  But their absence (so far) suggests the opposite.

Even before that key evidentiary piece is sorted, we can speculate about it.  The NDA story doesn't even make a lot of sense.  I've worked on similar projects and never heard anything like this.  It doesn't sound like anything legal and insurance would do, as it would just create multiple conflicting contracts.  And how would it even be enforced?  

The crew and producers on these shows are (though some would dispute) humans, and they aren't going to be blithely dosing someone with mystery drugs as part of the scale hourly job.  They aren't going to be sitting around watching rapes happen.  

The real situations are far more nuanced and harder to delineate in the moment.  I remain open minded to either way this story plays out."
Are You The One,"Probably a contract that keeps her from getting paid if certain details come to life.  And let‚Äôs be honest with ourselves, sexual assault is wrong but these shows certainly attract a specific type of person."

But I will never understand appealing to the court of public opinion instead of putting them behind bars.

PS - You're saying I'm discounting what they're going through. When did I do that?

And you say that it's too difficult reliving the experience to press charges. But she just made a huge media event out of this by appealing to the public instead of putting these monsters behind bars? In 2021, a famous woman with witnesses getting her sexual assault ignored seems pretty unlikely.

She also probably spread the information on twitter to shed light on the situation.

Maybe she should have waited until more information about a case or something was available, but she still has the right to share this information and to boycot the show she was on. People like you who that is stupid and irrational and that this woman should have gone to the police first are a big reason many people hide that they have been sexually assaulted."

Are You The One,"What? Why is everyone putting words in my mouth?

What are we supposed to do with this. She has my sympathy, but I'd like to see this proven and the person put behind bars. I don't like hearing about people getting away with violent crime. 

But by the same token...

Lemme ask you, do you believe in capital punishment? No, right? Because there's a tiny chance that an innocent person is being put down? Which is totally understandable. Innocent people have indeed been put down, which makes CP a tough sell.

So essentially, what I'm saying is that society has a justice system. As flawed as it may be, it has to be better than a twitter mob, or than nothing happening at all.

You can't let a sentence on twitter be judge, jury, and executioner for people's lives, but you want to believe the victim. And so the answer is - and this may shock you - legal action.

You can't say she's afraid to come forward - she's forward. This situation is going to define her relationship with the media and the public for the next, I don't know."
Are You The One,Stay quiet by announcing it to the world? That's what I don't get.
Are You The One,"Me deciding to believe people when they say they were raped has absolutely no bearing on what actually happens with the case. I‚Äôd much rather believe someone and turn out to be wrong, since that‚Äôs so much rarer than people actually just telling the truth."
Are You The One,What does that mean
Are You The One,"I recall Ricky Lake and other Ali shows at the time came under fire after one of the guests went and killed another over things that happened on the show. They were notorious for getting guests intoxicated. So it makes sense the tradition is still alive and well. 

I think in general they have little to lose. The fact that it was in the DR also might shield them a bit more from criminal charges."
Are You The One,"Too long, didn‚Äôt read"
Are You The One,"Dude you GOTTA stick to the topic here. Talking about capital punishment and Rose McGowan has nothing to do with this situation. 

In response to your original question: I will believe a sexual assault victim just like I will believe someone who says they were mugged or their car was vandalized. 

I was a victim of sexual assault and it took years for me to even admit to myself that what happened was wrong and it wasn‚Äôt my fault. And then another couple of years until I was able to talk about it with anyone other than my therapist. Part of the reason was people like you. I don‚Äôt see this kind of reaction when people talk about other crimes they were victims of. 

I also want to see victims of sexual assault be able to comfortably go to the police and report it, but our whole society needs to change around sexual assault for that to happen. And it can start with us. There may be a person who was raped and hasn‚Äôt come forward reading your comments and decide they don‚Äôt want to answer those kind of questions.

Edit: this doesn‚Äôt even touch on the fact that the production company allegedly took advantage of and manipulated a young woman. I remember myself at 21 and let me tell you, if someone in immediate power of my living situation and paycheck made me sign an NDA, I might have done it because I wasn‚Äôt as confident in myself and standing up for what‚Äôs right at that age."
Are You The One,"What are you talking about?

She was quiet for years and finally felt ready to publicize it"
Are You The One,"I understand that for people in your life, but don‚Äôt really get it for high profile cases about celebrities or pseudo-celebs, like what is gained by believing one side after only hearing their end of the story?"
Are You The One,If I see an old women fall in the street. I'm not under any obligation to help her. Doesn't mean it's not the right thing to do.
Are You The One,"Well, thanks to people like you, these atrocities will continue to happen."
Are You The One,"> I will believe a sexual assault victim just like I will believe someone who says they were mugged or their car was vandalized.

This is such a good point. When someone says they were robbed, people don't immediately go, ""Were you really? Prove it"" or talk about how we need to be skeptical or ask what they were wearing or if they'd been drinking. Saying ""believe victims"" is a reaction to the fact that so many people do NOT believe (particularly) women when they say that they were sexually assaulted. That doesn't happen with other crimes."
Are You The One,"So what now? I'm serious, that's not meant to imply anything. I'm curious what happens now.

I'd be so mad if the people who did something like that to me were waltzing around enjoying life."
Twelve Nights,"Great explanation of the time lines! Gonna show this to my folks who are watching, but are mildly confused. 

However, you missed one of my favorite (small) details: 

Ciri and Geralt‚Äôs destinies are so intertwined that the farmer Geralt saved from ghouls actually offers him the Law of Surprise as payment. Geralt immediately refuses, but had he accepted,  Ciri would have once again been his reward.  She was what the farmer had waiting for him at home, but did not know."
Twelve Nights,"I'm Confused. I've play the games and read about the books, always believed Gerald white hair was due to a more advanced set of trials rarely given to any witcher."
Twelve Nights,"Thanks for the write up of especially the pre story lore of the world as I didn‚Äôt get all of that from the snippets of dialogue in the show.  

I do have a question, what is the valley of plenty?"
Twelve Nights,">  Geralt saves Yen by wishing for their fates to be bound together.

Do we know what he wished for?"
Twelve Nights,[deleted]
Twelve Nights,"I think you misrepresented nilfgaard a bit, in a lot of ways they are better than the north for being more advanced and not racist, however Nilfgaard does employ slave labour, slaves that are usually supplied via the wars of agression they fight, and their ""manifest destiny"" of conquering the entire continent doesn't come with just a desire for unification, but with genocide and atrocities that are pretty fucking terrible, if they don't kill people they displace them and bring in colonists from nilfgaard instead, and in Nilfgaard you get hanged by the tiniest of offenses, like speaking ill of the imperator, whereas in the northen kingdoms criticism of the kings and queens is pretty common."
Twelve Nights,"As someone who had no prior knowledge of the Witcher (other than that it existed), I felt the show did quite well in explaining itself.  It usually takes me awhile to catch on so no surprise that I didn't realize 3 seperate timelines until ep5.

That said I didn't know everything you wrote, so it's a nice little background but not entirely necessary to keep up with the show and understand what was happening.

Still, thank you for this."
Twelve Nights,"I do wish they had added a little more fun between Geralt and Jaskier. The sho presents Jaskier as an eternal pain in the ass, and it feels like Geralt just basically dislikes him. Hard to fit all that into a single season, but the way they presented it feels forced."
Twelve Nights,"Thank you so much for this. As someone new to the world, I did not find the series confusing, but I am very grateful for your short description of the background of the world. The whole Conjunction was mentioned in the show, but was not really explained. Really interesting to read about. 

I do have a few questions

> There‚Äôs frankly a pretty good case to be made that the citizens of the north would be better off if conquered by Nilfgaard, although since the protagonists are part of the small minority that wouldn‚Äôt be better off (rulers, sorceresses, witchers), they don‚Äôt see it that way. 

I am happy to read this. I actually found myself cheering for Nilfgaard in the final battle. I could not figure out if the show intentionally wanted us to see good and bad on both sides, or if the show just failed in giving me any sympathy for the North. 

Sure, Nilfgaard was portrayed as pretty bad in some areas, but the whole ""Defend our way of life in the North"" that the Brotherhood kept talking about did not convince me. Their way of life is to turn innocent girls into eels and to kill baby girls who were born at the wrong time... 

Are we supposed to see the North as the good guys and cheer for them? Or is it on purpose that the show is hinting towards Nilfgaard not being the worst side? 

Also, I was confused why Yennefer joined the battle for the Brotherhood. During the whole series she has seemed mostly focused on herself and on achieving beauty, power etc. It seemed that it came down to Tissaia saying something like ""Do it for me"". But I really do not feel the show succeeded in showing any kind of friendship or loyalty between Yenn and Tiss."
Twelve Nights,"To give you some more history about the politics of the Witcher, you need to understand the history of Poland.

Poland, itself, is a country of iterations. Going back from when people bothered recording history we see that the slavic regions have been a stopping off point for many nomadic peoples, from the goths to the Burgundy to the  Tatars, to Mongolians and Germans, and vikings and jews. No one peoples have a claim to the idea of an ethnic pure poland, as poland itself is extremely diverse set of peoples. This is analogous to the Conjunction of the Spheres, as the Elves weren't the first people in the land of the Witcher, and neither were the Dwarves, gnomes are the oldest known ""civilized"" creature in the Witcher World, but that doesn't even take into account the other ""monsters"". In this sense, the amount of monsters and different elder races and humanity living together represent the messy living situation that is the polish ethnic makeup, and how at times it can be peaceful with lots of harmony, and incredibly violent. 

Now; the Nilfgaard vs Northern Realms is something analogous so what happened in more recent history; In World War 2, Poland was being carved up by the two world superpower. The Ethnic cleansing warmongering Fascist-feudalist state that was Nazi Germany (Northern Kingdoms), and the technologically advancing mega-empire with more money and manpower than sense in the Soviet Union (Nilfgaard). Nilfgaard (Soviets) were kinder to the Elder Races (Gypsies) than the Northern Kingdoms (Nazis), so they felt that it was fight or die, while the Northern Kingdoms wanted an ethnically pure realm by ghettoizing and displacing as any of the Elderblood as possible for ""The safety of and prosperity of the Kingdom"".

This dichotomy is what leads us to the Anti-politics Geralt, who represents the post-soviet attitude of Poland that is Neo-Liberalism, the idea of free movement and a more tolerant society for the purpose of ensuring a more free, less oppressed, and more resilient Polish republic."

Twelve Nights,"One thing I would add is that the farmer Gerlalt saved offered him the law of surprise as payment for saving his life.  The reward would then be Ciri who his daughter was taking in as a new daughter and, thus, his new granddaughter.   This further reinforces the destiny between Geralt and Ciri."
Twelve Nights,"Good write-up! Although I disagree with the decision to jump around the timelines so much, they do try and drop a few hints here and there that let you figure it out. I think the first one is when they talk about an old battle that Calanthe won, and a few scenes later we hear that she's just won it. There's also stuff like Foltest as an adult king vs. seeing him as a child. You can definitely reconstruct the timelines based on the hints, but it's really hard to do on the fly as you're trying to watch the show."
Twelve Nights,"Omg, you linked my version of the Witcher map!"
Twelve Nights,"Thank you so much for this.  I am enjoying the snow but have been relatively lost.  I don't consider myself a total idiot, either (though that's certainly a matter of opinion).  I was just thinking to myself that this show is likely much better understood by those who are already familiar with it."
Twelve Nights,"This is very well written, but I feel like the show generally explains things pretty plainly in exposition if you just pay attention."
Twelve Nights,"I never read the books or played the games, but I did still pick up on most of that stuff. However, the one thing I didn't pick up on at all is that Nilfgaard isn't actually the bad guys. 

The army clad in black armor surely had to be the horrible people. It is pretty much the trope of all movies/shows that the people in black attire are the bad guys. 

As I watched though, they never really seemed that bad. I just figured they hadn't expressed their true intentions yet. So, the whole time I was just thinking; ""what are they up to?"""
Twelve Nights,"If Nilfgaard is this advanced civilization, why does it have a leave nobody alive policy during war?  It instantly makes them look like the bad guys and somewhere else in this post it says Nilfgaard uses slaves so it‚Äôs be counterintuitive to kill everyone.  Does this have something to do specifically with Cintra or do Cintrans just think Nilfgaard is like that because they tend to dehumanize the south?"
Twelve Nights,"This is going to get me downvoted, but I don‚Äôt care. Evidently there‚Äôs something fundamentally flawed about your storytelling when fans have to write a 20+ paragraph explanation as to what‚Äôs going on. 

It‚Äôs one of my major gripes about the show - your average Netflix dude/lady isn‚Äôt going to understand the world‚Äîisn‚Äôt given enough information to‚Äîand likely isn‚Äôt going to deep dive the internet for information if they see a show that jumps around timelines and assumes you already know characters. My friends couldn‚Äôt get into it for this reason.

I like the show and hope it improves but this shouldn‚Äôt be the norm."
Twelve Nights,"It‚Äôs a shame the show needs the fans to fill in everything the show runners failed to accomplish themselves. Cavill is great, but they need to replace the writing/production team. The costumes, dialog, and soundstage feel aren‚Äôt up to snuff in 2020.

I‚Äôm worried it‚Äôs not going to get a third season with drop off of non-Witcher fans."
Twelve Nights,"If I need to read paragraphs of explanation to understand the show, did the writers do a good enough job of world building? I understand they‚Äôre not holding our hand, so to speak, but neither did GoT and it was understandable."
Twelve Nights,"Great effort, mate. Appreciated"
Twelve Nights,"The endless circlejerking for this show is so tiring now.

Saying shit like ""this show doesnt hold hands"" is some serious rick and morty level defending to excuse some pretty sub par writing/direction.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand the witcher."
Twelve Nights,"I rewatched it again and realized that time doesn't go back and forth. It's consistent, but it jumps for one character to catch up to the other.

Geralt starts when his legend began. Blaviken.

Yennifer starts when her legend began. The Lodge of Sorcerers.

Ciri's starts when her legend began. The Cintra massacre.

The stories don't interwove into each other yet. They show their exploits and experiences first. Time is going forward but at different points. They merge together at the end."
Twelve Nights,This is a great primer but you shouldn‚Äôt have to know all this to enjoy a TV show. It was a jumbled mess and I doubt I‚Äôll watch season 2.
Twelve Nights,"I'm late to the game, so this will probably go unnoticed, but I'd still like to show my appreciation for this post.

My biggest complaint about the show - for someone unfamiliar with the Witcher - was how we did have no notion at all how the world worked. There is no timeframe, no location, things just happen. It felt like a small world, because I had no idea what the larger scope was.

The plot felt so convoluted and I really feel they could have used your writing on the show. 
Words like ""meanwhile"", ""northern"", etc.. can give us more information about a larger world while keeping the story focused in a monster-of-the-week routine while we follow Geralt.
Including a map would work too, exactly how you did, because it can make for much better understanding.
Great fantasy shows like ""GoT"" or ""Avatar: the Last Airbender"" even feature their map in their openings, because they know they are important for worldbuilding.

All in all, I did think it was an average to subpar fantasy show when you consider the above. This post made a lot things more clear, which I believe shouldn't have. Since a good story is clear on itself."
Twelve Nights,"Okay, this summary made way more sense than the show itself did."
Twelve Nights,"> In Nilfgaard, elves and dwarves are treated as full citizens 

Nope, that's fanfiction. Nilfgaard's internal racial relations are never addressed. Over the course of the books, we meet only 2 elves (and not a single dwarf) in the South, so it's possible they simply do not have any significant population of elves and dwarves. 

> There‚Äôs frankly a pretty good case to be made that the citizens of the north would be better off if conquered by Nilfgaard 

Again, fanfiction (aka Witcher 3). They would be dead or enslaved, since Nilfgaard's goal is to replace Nordlings with their own settlers to achieve Lebensraum (a living space). As a state, they have very little redeeming qualities. Individual Nilfgaardian characters can be nice though."
Twelve Nights,"As a person who first played the games in their release-order and who read most of the books I didn't find the timeline too hard to follow or separate after the third or so episode, and my girlfriend who watched it with me and who never played the games before also caught on to it quickly without needing my help with explaining anything.

And as much as it can be a bit confusing for the first episode or two I actually really appreciate how the story was structured since it really puts the differnce in life-span between Sorcerors/Sorceresses, Witchers and humans as a whole into sharp contrast.

While Gerald and Yennefer is effectively just dicking their way through the decades a teenage-queen becomes a mom, a granny and eventually see her kingdom razed to the ground."
Twelve Nights,My wife and I are watching the series now and were quite confused. Your timeline doesn't seem to match what we are watching.
Twelve Nights,"I know that I will get downvoted for this but if the first season of a fantasy show needs a post like this to explain it... then it is not a good show.     

I am currently watching the Dark crystal age of resistance and it has a lot of fantasy elements which are very original yet nothing that needs a lot of outside explanation if you have not seen the movie since it explains most of them as the story goes on"
Twelve Nights,"I watched it and was also mildly confused until the last two episodes. If a show needs a ""guild"" then it wasn't explained good enough in the series. Did anyone notice when a time or scene changed there was never a caption explaining the time or location? Pretty frustrating and not insightful"
Twelve Nights,"Guide or no guide, it's still an average show"
Twelve Nights,Appreciate the help!
Twelve Nights,"The thing is, this being necessary means the show failed in its job."
Twelve Nights,"Very nice explaination. Although the plotis not hard to understand by just watching, your write-up makes it better.

> Geralt broke out of Cintran captivity in the chaos, but had no idea that Ciri successfully made it out, too. Geralt, like Ciri and the Nilfgaardians, also travels north from Cintra, in his case heading for the witcher‚Äôs keep of Kaer Morhen to lick his wounds and feel sorry for himself over the whole Ciri business. He saves a travelling farmer from ghouls attracted by the bodies of Cintran refugees, but catches a nasty bite in the process. The farmer tosses Geralt in his cart to recuperate. As a wound-fevered Geralt is transported back to the farmer's house, the Battle of Sodden Hill happens close enough to be within earshot, and Yennefer (who Geralt doesn‚Äôt know is fighting in that battle) goes MIA after summoning a firestorm that stops the invasion cold.

You didn't mention the part where Geralt saw his mother. Was that a ""dream"" or was his mother actually there?"
Twelve Nights,It‚Äôs a really big indictment on the writing in the show that you‚Äôd feel like this type of thing was necessary.
Twelve Nights,This is an absurdly long post for a show that isn‚Äôt at all hard to follow
Twelve Nights,"Holy heck thank you for this write up. I watched the show and loved it though was very confused initially. I own Witcher 3 but haven‚Äôt played and have never read the books. It helped so much, especially the backstory."
Twelve Nights,Extremely helpful and well-written. Thanks!
Twelve Nights,"Thanks so much for this. I went in totally blind and this helped world-build a ton for me. I think the show is entertaining and pretty well done, but I wish this backstory would have been explained more (or better)."
Twelve Nights,Very helpful. I think if you pay attention most of this is clear in the show but this definitely helped me connect some dots. The law of surprise connection being such a strong father - daughter bond for them was not 100% clear to me before this so things make a lot more sense now.
Twelve Nights,"The wish to tie their fates together, didn't that stop the djinn because if the djinn killed Yennifer then it would have killed Geralt and a djinn cannot kill it's master?"
Twelve Nights,Fantastic writeup
Twelve Nights,"Good writeup overall, missing most of the details of Yennefer's plotline, but I can see why you left them out for clarity's sake."

Twelve Nights,"Super helpful. Once I realized there were more than once timeline, even for just a relatively short period of the show, I got co fused and somehow thought Renfri and Yen would end up being the same person.

Twelve Nights,Very good post
Twelve Nights,"The only thing that bothered me was the characterization of the Wizards/Sorcererers in the series. In the books and games, they are said to be the most beautiful/handsome a person can get due to magic manipulation. So they should be all Kens and Barbies, but i can udnerstand the issues of adapting that."
Twelve Nights,Thanks man this helped so much! Hopefully they have a less confusing timeline in season 2
Twelve Nights,"Thanks very much for the write up! It's nice to have some of those gaps filled in. I didn't see this asked anywhere, so apologies if this was clarified, but why was the law of surprise in one case (Duny) a marriage, but in another (Geralt/Ciri) it's protection? 

Will Geralt eventually marry Ciri when she gets older or something? The rules just seem so ambiguous for such a powerful request."
Twelve Nights,"RemindMe! One week ""Read this when you have finished the series"""

Twelve Nights,"One detail I think is really good to show the tone of the series is that Gerald does not get the butcher of blaviken moniker because he killed some cutthroats, but rather because he opposed the elite/rulers, that being the mage."
Twelve Nights,"A bunch of people have probably already said it, but thank you.  This is a great, concise piece that filled in several gaps for me about the show."
Twelve Nights,That was very helpful in filling some plot points I missed
Twelve Nights,"Fun fact: if Geralt had invoked the law of surprise for helping the farmer at the end, he would have gotten Ciri twice by the law."
Twelve Nights,"Thank you for this great recap. I watched the show without any background knowledge and it was a bit confusing to follow at times. I had to go look up a few things between episodes.

This summary lets me know that I did get the gist of things from the show. When I watch it again I think I'll be able to enjoy it more now that I know what's going on."
Twelve Nights,There's a place called flotsam but not jetsam
Twelve Nights,Saved this for later.
Twelve Nights,Thank you for posting this. I had never played the games nor read any of the lore. Loved this series and can‚Äôt wait for more.  This guide has helped me put some pieces together of the history that I was unsure of.
Twelve Nights,Bookmark
Twelve Nights,"even with my playing the game, this is more thorough and a wonderful guide!"
Twelve Nights,did you just write another book...
Twelve Nights,Will be showing this to my partner. Great write up.
Twelve Nights,Thank you!!
Twelve Nights,I'd like to know more about Filavandrel's uprising
Twelve Nights,"Top job! I didn't miss anything in your recap of the series it seems, but I really liked your summary of the world at the start, I didn't know much of the world building stuff."
Twelve Nights,God‚Äôs work
Twelve Nights,"It'd be dope if they explained this better in the show. I love a non-linear narrative but the way they attempted it did not make sense.

I think one problem is throwing too many unknown nouns at us too quickly"
Twelve Nights,"You sir, are a god among men"
Twelve Nights,"You say Nilfgaard attacking Cintra is an irrational desire that wont be revealed until season two, but I got the impression Nilfgaard wanted Cintra as they needed Ciri because some mysterious white flame told them to? I mean you don't know the exact reasons and I am sure they will be expanded on in S2, but that is the premise yes?"
Twelve Nights,"Just finished the series today. 
Great write up! Didn‚Äôt realise that was why Geralt couldn‚Äôt sleep. 

Really helpful"
Twelve Nights,Someone toss this man a coin!
Twelve Nights,Thanks for putting this together. I was completely new to the Witcher with while watching the tv show. I didn‚Äôt even realize they were playing with the timelines until a few episodes in. This background gave some great context.
Twelve Nights,What was the comment about not being able to make any more Witchers?
Twelve Nights,"Really appreciate this. This was better explanation than the show! I watched the show due to all the hubbub and enjoyed it. But def could feel there is sooooo much more going on that isn't being explained. It would be great for fans already of the books and games. However being Netflix and so mainstream with tons of the audience not being familiar with the TW universe previously, I'm confused why they didn't explain much of this better."
Twelve Nights,Great guide!
Twelve Nights,"Keep up the chatter, we need so many seasons!"
Twelve Nights,Omg. My wife an I just discussed how this detail was missing for nubes. Thank you!
Twelve Nights,"I've been hesitant to watch this, until now. Thank you!"
Twelve Nights,Thanks OP
Twelve Nights,What an amazing and well written summary.  Thanks for that from one who knows the story only from having watched the show.
Twelve Nights,Hm
Twelve Nights,Thank you!
Twelve Nights,This helps a lot
Twelve Nights,nice
Twelve Nights,"Fan of the show who never read the books nor played the games:

My biggest complaints during the show were having no idea what the hell the power-gifted characters were actually capable of, and not understanding the Law of Surprise.

One of the early episodes opens with Yennifer bamfing around across the whole world every minute or so fleeing an assassin.  Then later when all the mages need to get from point A to B and time is a factor, they need to take a boat??  So I thought maybe I missed something, and these portals aren't just free teleport-anywhere-whenever-you-want spells.  But then in ep8 that one mage teleports onto the Nilfgard general to try to kill him?

I just generally never know what any of the magical characters can actually do.  I have no idea if they are taxed to exhaustion by summoning a sword, or if they can freeze time, magically decapitate someone, or burninate a whole mountain.  

And how the hell does the Law of Surprise work.  You save someone's life, and claim it.  Then they owe you the first thing they gain without knowledge?  Seems to often be a person?  Does Geralt own Ciri?  Does he marry her?  Does he raise her as his own kid?  None of that was explained well.

Loved the show overall.  Just never knew if the magical characters were genuinely in danger because I had no idea what they could do at any moment."
Twelve Nights,They just needed to give town name and date as text wherever they changed timeline.
Love Island Australia,The prick turned up to court each day in a rented Rolls Royce. Not really sure what the message he was trying to make was.
Love Island Australia,Gonna chime in on this one and say I have no idea how the people of Britain let this guy fucking win during his season. Like there were absolute pieces of garbage that season and he stood out the most. The show even allowed his now ex-gf to break up with him IN THE HOUSE on an episode after he had sex with another contestant LMAO.
Love Island Australia,People are so stupid.
Love Island Australia,I read that he made 40k from his OF around the time he posted the video. I hope he has to pay her every cent of it.
Love Island Australia,Good. What a POS.
Love Island Australia,[Every time I see this fuckwit I remember him shitting his pants in big brother when that giant opened the door.](https://youtu.be/-dJ-fRGSTEQ)
Love Island Australia,What a gross thing to do.
Love Island Australia,Holy fucking loser Batman
Love Island Australia,"Saw him on 2 seasons of The Challenge and it was obvious he was a major asshole. He had some fun moments but he didn't know when to stop and took things too far.

It was rough watching some of the girls fall for his ""bad boy"" charm over and over (specifically Georgia and Kailah). 

In retrospect that scene where Wes and Bananas stuck a photo of Kailah's boyfriend up above her bed was probably a low-key effort to remind her she was about to cheat on her boyfriend for an absolute prick."
Love Island Australia,Celebrity is quite a stretch
Love Island Australia,Eww. He *drips* douchebag.
Love Island Australia,Maybe Channel 4 can stick a camera up his arse so we don‚Äôt miss any of the action.
Love Island Australia,"Not Georgia! She is so lovely ü•∫ 

...And even if she wasn't, no one should ever suffer this humiliation or invasion of privacy. The court ruled appropriately."
Love Island Australia,I hate everything about this headline.
Love Island Australia,"I have never seen this person, so I guess even winning Celebrity Big Brother doesn't make someone much of a celebrity."
Love Island Australia,These guys trying too hard to prove their masculinity. What a joke.
Love Island Australia,Good. Fucking loser
Love Island Australia,I had to read that headline nine times before I stopped seeing George Harrison.
Love Island Australia,Who and who?
Love Island Australia,"Not long enough considering this dickhead's given her a life sentence, knowing that video will be online forever now because of him. Hope he's put on the sex offender register for life."
Love Island Australia,Oh what a miserable fucking cunt this dude is. I hate him so much. He‚Äôs a true monster.
Love Island Australia,"It‚Äôs crazy this shit stain got 21 months for posting a fucking video, versus that mega shit stain QB who only got 6 months for beating the shit out of his gf. It‚Äôs a very backwards, fucked up system we got"
Love Island Australia,"For context, he will only serve half of this sentence and be on some bullshit probation for the remainder."
Love Island Australia,"Not long enough IMHO, arrogant prick."
Love Island Australia,Never heard of him.
Love Island Australia,"If he‚Äôs put on the sex offenders register, will he banned from travel and social media? I really hope so would be nice for him to disappear from consciousness. 

Oh, and I hope prison is thoroughly unpleasant for him. But he‚Äôll probably be protected on the nonce wing."
Love Island Australia,As he should. If not more‚Ä¶
Love Island Australia,Oh my god that‚Äôs terrible.  Which website was it?
Love Island Australia,[removed]
Love Island Australia,"Isnt this how the kardashians got their start? They just did it in a sneaky ‚Äúoops, it got leaked‚Äù way."
Love Island Australia,Nasty bastard
Love Island Australia,What's really sad is if you watch the video of him showing up for sentencing there was still loads of girls wanting pictures with him
Love Island Australia,"Disappointed that he turned out to be an actual prick. For what I saw when he appeared in those reality shows my GF watches, he was pretty hilarious. Managed to rub everyone the wrong way. Especially those idiots of the MTV Challenge shows who take themselves way too serious. But fuck him for putting this video online and he got what he deserves"
Love Island Australia,"She looks like a Smut anyway, should have never made a video knowing it could get out."
Love Island Australia,Link?
Love Island Australia,Maybe don‚Äôt allow yourself to be videotaped for sex?
Love Island Australia,Lame.
Love Island Australia,Remindme! 2 hours
Love Island Australia,20000 channels here
Love Island Australia,"This is so stupid. Yes if somebody is murderer, robber, rapist, etc.. send them to prison. But this? Wtf this world is so soft lmao"
Love Island Australia,"If two adults consent to recording themselves having sex, you pretty much give up any right to privacy given the risks involved of that video being made public."
Love Island Australia,*Sigh*
Love Island Australia,Money often brings out the trash that was hidden within. Hope he enjoys his three hots and a cot.
Love Island Australia,See ya
Love Island Australia,Loozah!
Love Island Australia,Showing off the dick again. Some guys can‚Äôt help themselves.
Love Island Australia,Good
Love Island Australia,"Surely that should be ‚Äòcelebrity‚Äô Big Brother. Seriously though, why do we keep enabling biological waste like this numpty?"
Love Island Australia,"How about we change the narrative on this:
""Convicted sex offender Stephen Bear sentenced to 21 Months......"""
Love Island Australia,Dick head. Off to jail. Fker
Love Island Australia,What a douche.
Love Island Australia,"I remember him watching the, ‚ÄúThe Challenge‚Äù. I never liked him and always rooted against him"
Love Island Australia,"Wait, I'm confused. His only noticeable claim to fame is being on Celebrity Big Brother? Wouldn't that mean he wasn't a celebrity? How the fuck did that happen?"
Love Island Australia,"every brother is big in prison‚Ä¶

have fun."
Love Island Australia,Whoa that‚Äôs awesome. I remember when people would literally post videos of themselves having sex with a minor unbeknownst to the other party the other party would be the one that got dragged and everyone else celebrated the poster. Happened to Paris Hilton.
Love Island Australia,Picture checks out
Love Island Australia,Disgusteng
Love Island Australia,Neck tattoos‚Ä¶
Love Island Australia,"What kind of asshols does that?  Just because they have a typical hot attributes of man, doesn't mean this! What a prick."
Love Island Australia,Who is this guy and why is he well known enough to be considered a ‚Äúcelebrity?‚Äù
Love Island Australia,Is *everybody* on Big Brother a steaming pile of shit?
Love Island Australia,Both of them are a waste of space
Love Island Australia,A smart rich person would go to rehab and blame it all in the demon liquor
Love Island Australia,"‚ÄúI‚Äôm terribly insecure, please feel jealous of me‚Äù"
Love Island Australia,Maybe he was trying to make sure that every single person who saw him loathed him. The crime itself probably was enough but he could have wanted the extra assurance.
Love Island Australia,Trying to be an Andrew Tate alpha dude bro? Because apparently doing sex crimes is fine as long as you own luxury cars
Love Island Australia,He‚Äôs probably a big Andrew Tate fan
Love Island Australia,"Must have been trying to let everyone know what a massive cunt he is, as if his previous actions hadn‚Äôt already proven it to anyone watching. Not that I condone anything bad happening to him but maybe going to prison as a sex offender will show him the error of his ways, although being a high profile prisoner will probably afford him more luxuries than the average person would receive"
Love Island Australia,How do you know it was rented
Love Island Australia,Imagine the type of people who watch celebrity big brother and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll find your answer
Love Island Australia,"People vote for the people they want to see more of next week. It's visual clickbait that ends up winning, not because we like these people, but because we like to judge them. 

So this weird symbiotic relationship exists where assholes try and be mega-assholes just to keep the eyeballs glued to their antics. And the viewers get what they want just the same. 

My word for 2023 is ""disengage"". Really I shouldn't even be reading a reddit thread about the guy, it is absolutely what he wants and will perpetuate this sort of personality proliferating."
Love Island Australia,"Many idiots think of people like him as ""alpha males"" unironically... they think they are ""powerful"" and ""real men"" and other shit like that, since they believe themselves to be like that or worse, wish they would be like that, and thats why they vote for that.

Then you have some women that like ""bad boys"" i.e. assholes they think they can ""tame"", when we all know assholes will stay assholes....

Thats sadly how most of reality TV works, the biggest dicks and assholes always win, women and men.

I mean look at Francesca WhatsHerName from Too Hot to Handle on Netflix, she won, when she was not only clearly there for Clout only, but basically fucked over everyone, was a total bitch and basically sold herself for some internet fame... and she still has a huge following because there are too many idiots and lowlifes that love people like that as described above... people are insane."
Love Island Australia,"In Australia when it first started the person who usually wins is just a genuine compassionate down to earth person with empathy.

Most have had good positive careers after it and in talk shows and are just good people.

How the fuck do these cunts keep winning now? Is that what people inspire to be like now?"
Love Island Australia,"Well, this is the same show that produced Andrew Tate, so‚Ä¶"
Love Island Australia,"Didn't watch celebrity big brother but did see him on The Challenge.

He came across as a ""douche with a heart""  

* He would cheat, but be honest that he cheated and show some remorse

* he would lie, but show some remorse for the lie

* he would act tough, but talk about it being a front

* (not a big brother thing but in the challenge he had a string never quite attitude even against much bigger people that made him popular)

On the challenge he played up a character  pretty well.  The bad boy with a heart of gold.  People eat that shit up.

The girl in the video met him on the challenge and ate that shit up.  People love an asshole who looks to have a soft center"
Love Island Australia,None of these shows are chosen by the public. It is all decided by marketing and money.
Love Island Australia,"This entire genre of media is fucking appalling trash, that's how. Its fans are just as awful."
Love Island Australia,Area you trying to rationalize reality TV? Go touch some grass
Love Island Australia,People are so ~~stupid.~~ horrible
Love Island Australia,Which beckons the question why we‚Äôre giving them more publicity
Love Island Australia,He‚Äôll probably be paying that in legal fees.
Love Island Australia,Holy shit that guy is huge
Love Island Australia,I don't understand anything that happened in this video
Love Island Australia,The narcissistic wound in public format
Love Island Australia,Lol! Just watched that. What a fucking pussy.
Love Island Australia,"Ironically, after all his attempts at appearing Alpha, he looks just like David in Schitt‚Äôs Creek.

‚ÄúEeew, David.‚Äù"
Love Island Australia,The Challenge is the show I know him from. Wes and Bananas teaming up for that was hilarious.
Love Island Australia,"Ahhhh

Bear from the challenge....

He was fun on the challenge but being a douche on that show won't make you stand out. Pretty much all of them are douches

Him being a little guy who fought with a ton of heart is what got him fans."
Love Island Australia,"I haven't got to this season yet, but I've seen Kailah and I hate hearing this. She's someone I hate due to a lot of her actions, but she's so pretty in exactly the way I like with dark hair and tats."
Love Island Australia,"In the UK he sadly is. This trial was constantly reported on by our tabloids and even the BBC. 

This guy is a scumbag and should absolutely have no celebrity following, but some people live for following this stuff. See also Chris Brown still selling out tours."
Love Island Australia,"The great natural culmination of Big Brother (the UK version anyway) was the blurring of the lines between celebrity and non celebrity Big Brother.   
     
When it started back in the late 90s, it was just some people in a house and you watched them on TV. It was the only reality TV there was. Pre-Facebook world, any ‚Äòsocial media‚Äô that existed was just bored teenagers listing their favorite bands.       
Then the celebrity one was a charity version of ‚Äòall in a house‚Äô only it was people who were known to the public due to being high profile in some form of entertainment (music, acting, sport, comedy, etc.).       
       
Slowly people started to realise that success on reality TV could be the gateway to ‚Äòa career in being famous‚Äô and being on other TV, so more and more people were less ‚Äòjust in a house‚Äô and more trying to achieve notoriety as a springboard to fame.     
And in the celebrity one it became seen as about tacky famewhores and associated with being ‚Äòwashed up‚Äô, so they were increasingly scraping the barrel of who was ‚Äòfamous‚Äô.    
The original meta-culmination of this was when they had a non-celebrity-pretending-to-be-a-c-list-celebrity on celebrity Big Brother, which then naturally made her a celebrity.    
       
But then the third act topped it, as social media became more universal and challenged broadcast TV in importance.      
Now you still have attractive young people who want to be famous (aka the people that go on Big Brother), but if they are serious enough about that to be a good Big Brother contestant, they already have a set of high profile social media accounts with many followers unrelated to their real life. They also likely also interact with similar social media personalities (and date similar) so they can all put it on their social media, etc. They‚Äôre already ‚Äòscene‚Äô if they‚Äôre hungry and importantly attractive enough to become scene, and therefore celebrities.    
       
So by the end both celebrity and non-celebrity versions was an indistinguishable collection of hot 20 something‚Äôs who had already got off with each other for likes and ad revenue on various media platforms. Only the celeb version would also have a washed up American star with poor mental health who needed the money for legal issues thrown in to interact with them.      
     
That‚Äôs the point that it became clear ‚Äòthe kids‚Äô make their own reality-fame these days and it was pointless to broadcast people who constantly broadcast themselves.       
       
Big Brother became a perfect window onto the changing nature of fame."
Love Island Australia,"Ohhhh he posted Georgia...from the challenge

They were both fun to watch on the challenge.

(Yes total douche but everyone is a douche or recovering douche on the challenge. It's part of what makes the eliminations so fun)"
Love Island Australia,"Hilariously, I‚Äôm pretty sure that the contestants are supposed to be celebrities before joining the show (that is, they aren‚Äôt becoming celebrities because of the show, they are supposed to already be famous). 

Of course, there‚Äôs no way to get a genuine celebrity with a real career to agree to do something like this, so the casting people have to go with a bunch of nobodies anyway. Checking Wikipedia, the people who were on that season are mostly from other reality shows for example."
Love Island Australia,"The genre is circular. You are famous by being on reality TV and that feeds back in to the celeb side of reality TV. It just eats itself because no one else wants anything to do with it, because its beyond useless trash."
Love Island Australia,"Just hoping this wasn't America's version of Celebrity Big Brother, which only ran opposite the Winter Olympics."
Love Island Australia,"I saw him on the challenge.  Charismatic douche

Fit in well on the challenge as they are pretty much all douches or recovering douches."
Love Island Australia,"I mean, his onlyfans and twitter is full of videos of him sitting on a huge dildo and fucking himself with objects. Can‚Äôt be more masculine than that!"
Love Island Australia,I can't find it
Love Island Australia,"If he posted it on his only fans, then it's not public so no it won't be online forever"
Love Island Australia,"But he is also a registered sex offender, and all that entails"
The Guest,"Yeah, I‚Äôm down. 

Hope it drops all at once."
The Guest,Apparently this is gonna be a case of the week type format which explains the huge cast list.
The Guest,"What, no Lady Gaga? :P"
The Guest,I cannot wait for Rian's take on Murder She Wrote format haha
The Guest,"It's not. Weekly episode release (after the first four together).

And of course Peacock's free year subscription ends just before it drops. The only fucking reason I had it."
The Guest,"> Hope it drops all at once.

I do not think so, but you can wait until the season is finished on March/April."
The Guest,Very excited for that aspect. Feels like the success of serialized storytelling in the streaming age has pushed the pendulum a bit too far in that direction. Episodic storytelling has it's place too.
The Guest,"Yeah, I was hoping for case of the week or like 2-3 episodes/case"
The Guest,I think were due for a redefining of what episodic storytelling is in television. Hopefully this works for people.
The Guest,"Daphne and Cameron are conning and are actually poor, trying to get money from Harper and what‚Äôs his face"
The Guest,"The gay couple are 100% scamming. Why else would there be ‚Äú60 year old hags‚Äù constantly around the villa??? 


Cameron knows something is up with Ethan and Harper and I have a feeling he left the condom wrapper intentionally. 


I have a feeling at least Cameron and Dominic are going to end up dead."
The Guest,Remember that time Zeus came down to the mortal realm disguised as a flagrantly gay hotel manager that delighted in defecating in his guest's rooms? Greek mythology is pretty messed up.
The Guest,"I felt weird clicking ""spoilers"" but you can't be too careful I guess"
The Guest,Myths‚Ä¶ haha üòÇ
The Guest,I'm half expecting that to not be the case just because it seems so obvious.
The Guest,"That seems like a tough con to actually pull off.  Cam already approached him about investing with him at his job, and I'm sure he'd love to make that sale, but that's a far cry from ""we're poor and we're going to con this dude out of millions.""  What would their con even be?"
The Guest,I don't think Daphne would have warned Harper that Cam works with sleazebags  (I remember she calls his coworkers Madoff-like or something?) if she were part of the con. I think it's all Cameron
The Guest,"I was thinking that Cameron may have lost most of their money, and Daphne simply doesn‚Äôt know. And given the series‚Äô rule about how nothing truly bad will happen to any rich characters, the two of them would be back on the ‚Äòchopping block‚Äô so-to-speak, in terms of which characters will die.

There is also a theory that there was a hidden time jump in the opening scene, between Daphne finding that body, and Valentina (the manager) learning that multiple guests are dead, meaning that she (Daphne) could also be one of them."
The Guest,"I think Ethan won't have sex with Harper because he's afraid she'll get pregnant and he doesn't want a family. (Sorry if the show has established this, I'm an episode behind)"
The Guest,They could be trying to break Tanya's prenup.
The Guest,"My gf asked me if I think that Mike white starts each season with guests arriving on boats because  it parallels how each season of survivor starts. Which, Mike white has stated are some of the finest memories in his life"
The Guest,Pyramid scheme
The Guest,Dark-triad somethings
The Guest,You should probably blame every agent and PR person in Hollywood too. They are gonna get this out there one way or another.
The Guest,Disney used all their brake fluid putting the stops on the baby Yoda leaks from S1
The Guest,And they want to make money by hyping up the show. You ain't gonna win this fight.
The Guest,Dear Disney when are you going to option my Mando erotic fan fiction screenplay? Those jawas aren't going to bootyblast themselves.
The Guest,Why are you singling out just that show when most shows do the same thing
The Guest,"I don't really care. You can't seriously expect wanting to be surprised at an actor's casting to be a popular definition of ""spoiler"". Do you really think - from a studio perspective - that surprising a handful of fans on reddit with a minor detail like casting is worth foregoing the publicity they'll receive from the visibility?"
The Guest,"comes to a sub dedicated to television news, complains about television news. IF only there was some way to prevent this!!!"
The Guest,Better yet why don't they not even tell us the shows they are making so I don't get any spoilers about what's being made. I just wanna open Disney+ and click on a random grey icon so I don't get any spoilers for what I am even going to watch.
The Guest,"They haven't made announcements, casting news simply nearly always gets out. If you don't want to hear it don't follow social or media sites focused on the industry"
The Guest,Has Disney announced a single guest star?
The Guest,"Disney aren't announcing anything, websites keep checking in with sources who confirm the info and then they report it."
The Guest,It‚Äôs impossible now a days the only show that successfully pulled of a surprise return was Westworld season 2 with Anthony Hopkins
The Guest,"Yes, now I‚Äôm hoping with recent the news the guest appearances of a character or two are not going to appear in the final 20 seconds of S2 to tease S3."
The Guest,I just want a good story.
The Guest,Doubt read star wars news if you want to be caught completely unawares next time?
The Guest,Its called advertising. Its been around for quite a while.
The Guest,"They gotta hype it so of course they are going to say who the stars are.  Do you consider a movie poster to be a spoiler? Those show the actors and the characters many times.

Alternatively there was all this hype revolving around Pedro Pascal playing Mando and then it turns out most of the time its another actor in the suit and Pascal is just the voice which seemed kinda disingenuous.

Edit - sp."
The Guest,They don't care. They do what's going to make more people watch. I agree with you 1000% for my personal viewing experience. But seeing a certain person I won't spoil's name coming back makes me more likely to watch. They accomplished what they wanted to.
The Guest,they haven't there leaks
The Guest,"I've felt this way for years about movies

Hollywood (Disney included) doesn't care about surprising you. They just want your money (or, at least the marketing department does)"
The Guest,Who cares about actors? It's not spoiling. Spoiling would be saying what fan favourite character they are playing.
The Guest,"If Disney doesn't do it, Reddit will.  Season 1 was the most spoiled season of TV I have ever seen.  Pictures on every sub without spoiler warnings.  Mods did nothing. It seriously pissed me off."
The Guest,Like Bill Burr was going to keep his mouth shut.
The Guest, could you have imagined if end of season 2 ep 1 2 light sabers suddenly appeared in the dark and we see who is holding them without knowing she was coming?
The Guest,"Meanwhile I haven't seen a single thing about guest stars on The Mandalorian. Most shows advertise lol, that's not gonna stop anytime soon."
The Guest,Stop reading the news
The Guest,"Disney's totally behind the reports. They're trying to keep people from quitting before Mandalorian season 2 and it's still a long way off.... I'm assuming Disney was already seeing cancellations after season 1 ended, and I'm sure the current economic situation isn't helping. Disney is trying to remind people of a reason they should keep the service."
The Guest,"I'm excited for Ahsoka, but seeing her on screen as a surprise with no announcement it would be like baby yoda x100"
The Guest,"This is normal, announcing cast."
The Guest,This is one of the reasons season 1 worked so well. I didn't know what to expect. You know how many movies I end up not going to see because trailers or spoilers from promotions took the wonder away. I DONT WANT TO KNOW THE STORY ELEMENTS BEFORE SEEING IT!
The Guest,Gotta publicize their stunt casting for the views.
The Guest,I haven‚Äôt seen any announcements. Because I‚Äôm not subscribed to or follow anyone or anything that would announce. Just something to ponder.
The Guest,They are desperate as people are cancelling their subscriptions en masse. Lack of content and lack of funds.
The Guest,Does a Disney+ employee mod this sub?
The Guest,"I heard that Baby Yoda is going to guest star, too. I wasn't going to watch until they said he was joining!"
The Guest,"Put it this way, imagine who they're *not* announcing."
The Guest,"It's promotion. The Ahsoka announcement blew up, why wouldn't they announce it? Star Wars characters appearing in a Star Wars show isn't really a spoiler."
The Guest,rofl
The Guest,But I don‚Äôt care. So tell me so I can avoid it.
The Guest,üòÇ it's really funny advertisement strategy .
The Guest,Corona virus isn‚Äôt surprising enough for you shut up
The Guest,"Many (most?) countries haven't even had all of season 1 released yet, and you're bitching about season 2 spoilers. Get a grip."
The Guest,"Disney doesn't give a shit. They put out the Far From Home trailer before Endgame came out and confirmed that it took place after EG, even though at that time Spider-Man was dead in the universe. 

I mean, we all knew everyone was coming back already, but it's another thing for them to just outright confirm it and spoil the mystery. They just care about marketing."
The Guest,Notice how up you rarely see Disney releasing press releases first.
The Guest,"I mean any ""leak"" like it gets it's marketing worth in gold by the reaction to the news. Disney doesn't care about surprising anyone. They've mastered the comfort, family media mixed with fanboyism and will continue on that path until it isn't profitable. And announcing big names and cameos gets people talking."
The Guest,"I think the only reason they were able to keep Baby Yoda under wraps was because it didn't involve a live actor, so there was no agent to brag about it to the Hollywood Reporter"
The Guest,"Yeah, shitton of self-control for Disney to not make BabyYoda merch before the shows even aired. This is Disney. They merchandise EVERYTHING."
The Guest,OP probably doesn‚Äôt care about ‚Äòmost shows‚Äô
The Guest,"It's not so much the casting, as that the character appears at all."
The Guest,"""Spoiler culture"" is getting out of control. Nobody should care or consider it ""spoiled"" knowing a character appears."
The Guest,Research has shown people love to be spoiled to

The Guest,yeah i just want television and film marketing to change their business model to serve my desires whats the big deal
The Guest,Disney can just have my social security number and do whatever.
The Guest,I'm leaving today.
The Guest,"Indeed, it was such a pleasant surprise. I guess it's hard being unsullied with certain things."
The Guest,You might want to unsubscribe to the forum your posting in right now...
The Guest,But you're on r/television
The Guest,You have no evidence that people are cancelling their subscriptions on masse. Analysts based on whatever they use to predict subscribers numbers have actually said in March there has been evidence of high growth due to the coronovirus. They also have plenty of content and with a lot of value. A lot of new content? Not necessarily but a lot of value for each piece of content out there.
The Guest,"Btw, that was Sony, not Disney.

Spider-Man is a Marvel Studios movie, but Sony is in charge of the marketing."
The Guest,As they should. Company's goal is to make money. They know you're still going to see the movie if you were this worried about it.
The Guest,Did they really spoil the actual mystery?
The Guest,They have the financial backing to make one hell of an NDA I'm sure.
The Guest,"I bet it's George Clooney making cooing noises and gurgling, like the time he voiced a dog in South Park."
The Guest,"Yeah, I remember everyone calling them idiots for not having merch ready ,but, it would've leaked. *And*, I think if it leaked, there would've been a ton of cynicism heading into the series (i.e., ""They made Baby Yoda to sell toys"" which .. well, is still true, but, the character is damn endearing)."
The Guest,Same thing with Groot/Baby groot merch.
The Guest,"they know they have your money.

They know Disney will take you"
The Guest,"True, like we had heard Daniel Craig was going to be in Star Wars, turns out he was just a stormtrooper."
The Guest,"I understand people want to be ""surprised"" - but I think the better surprise to seeing how it all plays out, not the result.

When someone spoils something for me, it hypes me to want to see how it plays out myself."
The Guest,"People who were already going to watch the show. 

By announcing actors, they are almost certainly drawing in more viewers"
The Guest,Bill Burr was in the trailer.
The Guest,Burr was def announced way ahead of time. All of the guest actors were from season 1 lol
The Guest,Naw. Doing fine. Thanks.
The Guest,"And yet not required to read every post, or check every day, evident by not seeing any announcements. 
: )"
The Guest,No they didn't. This complaint is stupid as fuck.
The Guest,"Just to make you feel old, that episode was over 20 years ago."
The Guest,"Plus Disney didn‚Äôt want Mando merch to drown out their Rise of Skywalker merchandise sales. Which, ironically, it did anyway. Everyone just waited for Baby Yoda shit to land and nobody bought anything from Episode 9."
Princess Sarah,I didn't know they were doing a crossover with DC Comics.
Princess Sarah,"I'm just sitting here, waiting for someone to say if it was good or not."
Princess Sarah,"I really wanted to like this, but it was not very good. I'll keep watching because I love this period of history, but I'm not very optimistic that I'll last more than 1-2 more episodes unless it improves markedly.

Fight scenes were terrible, acting was stilted, CGI was just... wow. Awful. And this last complaint might be a little nitpicky, but the king of France speaks with a goddamn English accent. "
Princess Sarah,"I don't remember what I thought of Vikings after the first episode back whenever that was, but the season opener of Knightfall was pretty forgettable. Acting was weak, poor CGI, pacing was horrendous - too much happens too fast. I really hope this gets better, because it is not looking good after this first showing. "
Princess Sarah,It was awful. Big let down. 
Princess Sarah,"Was alright.  Wierdly, I liked the main actor a lot, but not so much the main *character* he plays.  Like, we're supposed to like him because he cares about helping people and whatnot, but then he's also banging the queen (for some reason?), which makes him a massive hypocrite in like at least 3 different ways...

The subplot with the jews feels like something they should have introduced later, rather than in the pilot. Would have given some other characters/plotines more room to be established.

Also, Game of Thrones has totally ruined me at this point as far as medieval battles and CGI. The whole opening was just weak in comparison, but maybe I'm being to harsh there and just let it slide, since they obviously don't have that sweet HBO budget.

Some decent mysteries and questions about where things will go from here are set up, so there's material there for the rest of the season to pan out well.  We'll see though.

I'm probably not going to be running to the TV every week to check this out, but it could be worth a binge-watch once the first season is wrapped up."
Princess Sarah,"A little late to the party but figured I'd throw in my two-cents.

It's definitely a wonky show. Some moments are pretty damn bad, but some moments are also really cool. The opening scene was definitely the hardest to get through, the CGI was bad and the timing was weird. But after that it's pretty good minus a few moments. 

The costume design is also really good, I enjoy the look and feel of the show, even if it's a bit ahistorical.

The fall of the templars is certainly an under-explored part of history. I don't know whether this show will give it the tragic/fascinating look it deserves but it certainly has potential. 

Overall, not fantastic, but certainly not terrible. I'll wait and see what the next few episodes have in store. 
"
Princess Sarah,"Terrible. The pacing is super fast so there is no time for anything to sink in. The episode did a terrible job establishing what exactly the viewer is suppose to care about. The Jewish subplot seemed pointless. The battle scenes were a mess with the awful slo-mo and the constant jump cuts with the super zoomed in camera. The entire thing just felt like cheap day time television. Definitely not what I was expecting based on the trailer for this show.

I feel bad for Simon Merrells. He is a great actor and doesn't deserve this punishment. To go from Spartacus to this is depressing. "
Princess Sarah,"I am going to withhold judgement as it took Vikings a couple of eps to get good.  I did have issues with the premier though.  SPOILERS BELOW... 

First the combat... I'm not sure what to think about the slow motion initial combat scenes.   They just don't seem to make the combat have a proper flow.  Can't really put my finger on it but I didn't like it too much.  I did really like the helmet cam, thought that was pretty cool.  Second when they attacked the brigands on the road to defend the Jews...  WHERE WERE THEIR HELMETS?!?!  I mean okay, you want to show the star fighting I get it, but the rest?  I did like that they had shields but, I saw several strikes with the blade where the knights totally and completely exposed themselves.  Don't think men who have been fighting for years would have done that.  I did like that I saw no twirly bird crap like you see all the time in GoT.  Very much appreciated that.

On to the plot.  Again this was the first ep and I hope it gets better but meh...  A little too predictable for my tastes.  Who didn't see the ship carrying the grail getting wrecked coming?  Of course the main character is going to have a romantic interest that will eventually lead to a lot of trouble.  Shocker, the mentor died.  Of course the Jew who started the whole expulsion thing was not a Jew.  Oh, surprise Landry didn't know what to do with mentor's sword.  And finally the big shocker, the peasant boy's girl gets killed and now he's going to be a Templar!  

I am curious as to how they are going to develop the plot and will be watching to see if it gets better.  Overall I was not impressed but am hopeful.  We'll see!  "
Princess Sarah,"*spoilers alert*
I thought the action and the plot were intriguing, but the main character let me down. For someone who is supposed to be upholding a sense of duty and honor, he is one shameless piece of crap. First, he betrays his oath of abstinence (let's be honest though, no one follows that). But the main thing that put me off was his disloyalty to his friend King Philip by sleepin with the Queen, that was a show of weak moral on his behalf."
Princess Sarah,"Garbage, turned it off as soom as i saw that they were in paris and everyone was speaking with english accents, even the king of France!! 

Like come on, they got the accents so right with Vikings, and then they go and do this? Such a let down. 
"
Princess Sarah,fucking love this show
Princess Sarah,"It was full of cheese, and littered with overplayed tv tropes. The introduction to the love interest made me physically cringe. As a history nerd I was somewhat upset that they made it about the grail, but even more upset that they revealed it as just a cup in the first half of the first episode. I'll still probably give it a couple more episodes to come into it's own though, but GOT or Vikings it is not. "
Princess Sarah,Terrible. I could barely make it through the premiere. 
Princess Sarah,Was pretty awful. These History channel shows really don‚Äôt have much to do with actual history. 
Princess Sarah,"It was watchable not the worst thing I‚Äôve seen recently but looked kinda cheap in the special  effects department and the fight were a bit hammy and cheap. 

I‚Äôd give it 6/10 "
Princess Sarah,Im not sold. I want to like it but it was a little cheap? But I still like it more then kingdom but it doesnt rival Vikings at all.
Princess Sarah,pretty good for a season 1 premiere. 
Princess Sarah,"I don't like it. The CGI is cheap and it seems overacted. I feel like I'm watching a daytime soap opera. 

Quality wise, comparing Knightfall to Vikings is like comparing Spartacus to Rome. 

EDIT: upon reflection, even Spartacus fulfilled a fairly specific niche. I can't think of too many kinds of people that would enjoy this show. "
Princess Sarah,I liked it.
Princess Sarah,"Having seen the second episode I can definitely say it's better, the pope is amazing. Never thought I'd say that."
Princess Sarah,I thought it was awesome. Enjoyed the first episode and I am DVRing the rest to come!
Princess Sarah,So Godfrey is he the same Crusader that is portrayed in Kingdom of Heaven?
Princess Sarah,imdb says Renner is an EP not in the cast
Princess Sarah,A bit late? Lol it premiered days ago
Princess Sarah,"Not the best start, being historically inaccurate.
1: The siege of Acre ended with the templars surrendering the city, and its people along with the templars were granted free passage to Cyprus, in exchange giving up the kingdom of Jerusalem.
2: According to several accounts from both sides of the siege, the saracen siege engines could not even reach the coastline, much less a ship who had already passed what looks like a hundred meters of water.
Lazy writing when there sure could be ground for some tense negotiation and character development in the shows pilot. 
"
Princess Sarah,yeah definately not the best start it almost a exact replica of the first season of the musketeers bbc show
Princess Sarah,"Apparently. according to HBO, the cause of Friday the 13th was that a Templar master was fucking the wife of a King"
Princess Sarah,Love this show cant wait for next week
Princess Sarah,"In season final, they shot two diff endings. The one NOT shown was the baby being named ""Joan of Arc""....yes, that one...... who grew up to be what we now know. The mother in this tv series- story was Joan the Queen of France to King Philip in this series. I wish they would have shown this ending, instead. Oh well......"
Princess Sarah,"It's already out?! I thought it's coming next year. 10 episodes season, right?"
Princess Sarah,I liked it i understand what people are saying could have been slower and maybe hour eps build into it more but i liked it certainly better than a certain other show
Princess Sarah,"I thought it was pretty good overall. Some cheesy lines, and it felt like the opening battle was a bit too low budget ‚Äì¬†but otherwise, it was solid. Some really awesome moments, too. "
Princess Sarah," Much of the Knights Templar ""official history"" we read about in schoolbooks is fiction anyway, so the authors didn't have much authenticity to work with in the first place. There are more interesting lost stories starting to come to light, such as a regiment that came to San Francisco around 700 years ago, see the book Coded History Haight Ashbury  at CodeHistorydotcom   This particular Knights Templar regiment's emblem was the bear and California's state emblem is the bear, and Knights Templar Commandery No 1 was originally in Haight Ashbury.  Also in movies and TV the gleaming artificially white teeth on a medieval person always makes me cringe.  They could at least yellow the teeth a bit.   "
Princess Sarah,"I also enjoyed the pilot episode.

""OH NO! SOMEONE ACTUALLY ENJOYED THIS SHOW! BETTER THUMB THEM DOWN TO MAKE MYSELF FEEL MORE SECURED!""

lol, reddit point means nothing to me, so suck it."
Princess Sarah,The story is a mess. I can't stand the constantly flipping sides as if people change in a flip of a coin.
Princess Sarah,"They had subject matter that has such rich history and actual entertaining drama, and they spat on it. They fictionalized a plot. They should have started at the founding of the order, and then run the course of their fall. A Grail quest, bah, they could have foot noted the Grail as one of the possible possessions they were believed to have concealed. Even that is a rather strong conjecture. I feel like they threw us into a half-assed attempt to create another GOT rival instead of a well thought out history of more factual events. What a waste. I don't think it will make it to season 2. "
Princess Sarah,"Desuuuuus vault. This show is like walking dead... I'm only watching because (zombies apocalypse niche) hur hur hur templar knights, and crusaders niche

Also those cheesy lines, set up, music, and bad cgi screen lol. It gives off a very C rated indie any jones feel. Dat production value/budget brings it up to like a C-"
Princess Sarah,"I thought it was a pretty solid premiere, I am looking forward to next week already. This show has some awesome potential. Consensus seems to agree:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Knightfalltv/comments/7i1vgw/knightfall_episode_discussion_s01e01_youd_know/?st=JAW3CI06&sh=8b50abb6"
Princess Sarah,"It was awful. I don't expect it to get any better. Historically inaccurate. It's nothing but low-grade fantasy fodder.

It's another false history written by Americans for a certain American demographic. It's no wonder the kids are growing up with zero factual knowledge of world history."
Princess Sarah,"Comes across as bgrade at best. Typical History channel show, poor cgi and acting to boot. Cant imagine what people find so good in it."
Princess Sarah,"Thoroughly average. Strongly dislike that kid. Most insensitive character award of the year. Far too cliche of a subplot storyline with the whole ""Peasant boy loses his homestead and beloved and joins the army for vengeance"". I hope that jewish lady gets a bigger role. Oh. And well done acting-grandmaster. I'm fairly sure you banged the queen. Good work. Now we are going to have a fucked up succession crisis.
"
Princess Sarah,Me too!
Princess Sarah,It sucked duded.
Princess Sarah,It was bad.
Princess Sarah,"its really fucking good, do urself a favour and watch it from the beginning."
Princess Sarah,Because no one likes the French that's why. Our accents are so much better
Princess Sarah,I hated the first episode of Vikings. I had to watch it like 5 times to finally get past the first episode. After like three episodes I thought Vikings was pretty good.
Princess Sarah,"I agree on the banging the queen part. It felt super forced  and honestly also a little unrealistic. I have a hard time understanding why they would even risk having an affair let alone that the main character should be very religious as a templar even with that lost battle.

I kinda liked the jew plot but maybe they shouldnt have solve the whole problem in one episode. It felt a little rushed like you said.

Overall there stuff I liked but everything I liked was also kinda flawed."
Princess Sarah,"Agree with you 100%. After the opening, I was a bit like WTF. But then it got better. It was at its best in the quieter moments, seeing our knights in the streets, etc. The smaller skirmishes. We have to remember, many shows open with a bad pilot. There‚Äôs potential here... I remember disliking Vikings at first, but now I love it."
Princess Sarah,:( not what i wanted to hear 
Princess Sarah,"You translated my thoughts into words. Super hushed, awful fight scenes, no suspense or world building. TV showrunners think that their audience has the focus of a mosquito apparently. 

However, the cavalry charge at the beginning was great. Finally, someone using lances for fuck sake."
Princess Sarah,Not to mention the show didn't leave itself much time to live.  1291 + 15 years puts the story in 1306... one year before the Templar's purge from France.  This has no where to go even if it did end up catching on.
Princess Sarah,"> The Jewish subplot seemed pointless.

Only reason I saw for it was reunite the father and daughter with Landry."
Princess Sarah,"I agreed with you - but then I remember HATING the first episode of Spartacus. First three or do actually. But god fuckin damn, what an incredible masterpiece that came out to be. Fingers crossed this follows, because the Templars are pretty badass. "
Princess Sarah,except Spartacus is also a steaming piece of shit.
Princess Sarah,Shit.
Princess Sarah,"You were expecting what, Kingdom of Heaven? I actually agree with your assessment but went in expecting this to be watery gruel. You know they won‚Äôt treat the subject matter with any gravitas, they‚Äôll feel like they have to fluff up the story with superfluous dressing (‚Äúthe holy grail goes back further than Christ‚Äù), throw in some ham-handed PC token characters, do the whole obligatory but entirely shallow love-making scene (God forbid they actually develop some sensuality and leave it at that). Hitting all the targets of boring TV they expect to drag out for eight seasons."
Princess Sarah,"This guy watches 'The Walking Dead', don't listen to him."
Princess Sarah,"See the two of us completely disagree with the pacing. Maybe I have just watched too much TV, but I am getting sick of shows that try and stretch things out and spread out the plot at too slow a pace. Too often I watch a 13 episode series and think that it would have been better as a 6 or 8 episode series. So watching this episode I found it refreshing that things were moving so quickly. 

Now I am not saying that this is amazing television or anything but I can easily respect the pacing decision."
Princess Sarah,"> The pacing is super fast so there is no time for anything to sink in. 

The fact that you have a TWD flair kind of makes me question this. Like is it ""super fast"" relative to TWD? Because then it would basically just be normal pace."
Princess Sarah,"Hahaha! Spartacus. I enjoyed it, because I‚Äôm a sucker for that kind of show, but you can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs actually a properly good show as if it‚Äôs a downgrade coming to this. This is just like Spartacus."
Princess Sarah,You thought the Jewish thing was a subplot? Dude! That was what the whole episode was circled around!
Princess Sarah,"Yeah bro. That's the vibe I got from the opening siege alone. Turned it off after. The action cuts were so terrible, felt like TWD. Can't do another TWD. "
Princess Sarah,[removed]
Princess Sarah,"I really enjoyed Spartacus. And Rome (wish there was more). But I see your point, this is just an  much lower level."
Princess Sarah,Kingdom of Heaven story ends in 1187.
Princess Sarah,"Godfrey is just a popular name for the setting, Godfrey of Bouillon was the first Christian ""king"" of Jerusalem."
Princess Sarah,"Ha ...if you're talking about Viking , the quality of Knightfall is shit compared."
Princess Sarah,Yeah I was cringing the entire episode.  Dismounting to fight the last battle scene would be like the allies throwing away their guns at Normandy and attacking with bow and arrows.
Princess Sarah,"Man you are spot on. I really wanted this show to be good. The subject matter is endlessly interesting but they really screwed it up. I'm not a purist so historical accuracy isn't that important to me if the story is good and it's well acted but this is bad on all fronts. Boring story, bad acting, uninteresting characters. Every week I decide to give it another chance but every week I find myself completely uninterested in what is happening. I don't understand how they can make and Vikings and then think this show is good"
Princess Sarah,Don't expect accuracy and enjoy it for what it is. Was Braveheart accurate? No. Was it a good movie? Most think so yes. 
Princess Sarah,To be fair the people who are most likely to visit a shows subreddit are people who already like the show.
Princess Sarah,"Whoa there, typical history channel show? So I guess Vikings is an exception then?  I was looking forward to knight fall but think I'll skip it for now."
Princess Sarah,"> Typical History channel show, poor cgi and acting to boot.

Can you imagine reading this in 2007 and thinking how stupid that sounds. "
Princess Sarah,[deleted]
Princess Sarah,"Everyone has different tastes. No harm in watching the first episode for yourself. It wasn't my cup of tea, but maybe this is just going to be one of those shows that becomes popular and I just don't 'get' it."
Princess Sarah,"Haha! I also thought the knight charge was the ONLY part of the show I thought was well done.

For some reason I was getting a weird Shannara Chronicles vibe from the show with less cheesy fun "
Princess Sarah,Why can't the purge be a part/end of the story? 15 years is a lot of years for a show to cover.
Princess Sarah,"The reason is actually because the Jews being arrested, banned, and forcibly took their property to sell at auction by Philip IV because he owed them a ton of money about a year before he did the same thing to the Templars for the same reason. It makes sense to have the Jewish exile of 1906 in the show, and I suspect that having Landry have a personal connection with the father and daughter is to give what happens to the Jews some personal stakes and to foreshadow the fall of the Templars. "
Princess Sarah,"Meh. I thought it was fun. The show was intentionally over the top and kinda cheesy, but the cinematography was pretty good."
Princess Sarah,"Completely disagree.  

This seems like one opinion on Reddit there is a page  on Reddit with 50+ posts that dig the series so far.   That's where the discussion is:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Knightfalltv/comments/7i1vgw/knightfall_episode_discussion_s01e01_youd_know/?st=JAW3CI06&sh=8b50abb6"
Princess Sarah,It feels like a show for teenagers who just want to watch people get 'wrecked' in big battles. Yet it doesnt even do this well. That first battle at the siege of acre looked like something from a documentary reenactment. I wish History Channel would approach there shows with a degree of seriousness. This show is a joke.
Princess Sarah,"Lol believe me. I know how much of a train wreck the walking dead is, but ive been hate watching it since season 2 and now i feel like i have to follow through to the end. Im trapped."
Princess Sarah,[deleted]
Princess Sarah,I‚Äôd agree if the showrunner of Vikings hadn‚Äôt bragged about how accurate his show is. I had to take a ton of history classes at University so the randomness of some changes and interpretation of some events just bug and annoy me. I know it‚Äôs a TV show but I can‚Äôt change that such things bug me. 
Princess Sarah,Got haha
Princess Sarah,And the helmet camera view baha terrible show.
Princess Sarah,You're really gonna compare this pile of shit to Braveheart? 
Princess Sarah,"Yeah, lets ask the fans... what a great consensus!"
Princess Sarah,"Man, I have no idea why, but it generally seems like this sub hates Vikings. I find it to be a fantastic show, with different and interesting characters, and a likewise story to follow. Dialogue between King Ecbert and Ragnar is golden. Hell, there weren't even a season 5 (which started last Thursday) premiere discussion. "
Princess Sarah,"I've been watching Vikings every week since the start and have been really looking forward to Knightfall. It continues to have potential. The acting doesn't seem quite as good. I was disappointed that they aren't wearing any helmets (and dismounted) for a battle which seems quite silly. But it still felt solid. It is much more grand in scope than Vikings, which didn't need much CGI and had small scale battles. This had a huge battle for an opening sequence. If you compare it to Kingdom of Heaven you'll be disappointed. But it's a cable TV show. I plan to keep watching."
Princess Sarah,Definitely. Unfortunately I feel Vikings fell back into the History Channel trend in season 2. A real shame since it was such a great first season.
Princess Sarah,I dont know even back then there were tasteful ways of doing cgi. This is just over the top reliance on a technology they dont know how to use effectively.
Princess Sarah,"The helmet shots were awesome. It's meant to show you how trapped you feel, fighting. One of the more realistic aspects of the show too."
Princess Sarah,"Add me to the ""finally a good cavalry charge on TV"" team.
Wtf was up with the charge straight into the bandits' pole arms?"
Princess Sarah,The first episode skipped 15 years.
Princess Sarah,Because they're probably going to focus way more on the fictional Templar conspiracy shit rather than the history of the order
Princess Sarah,The people on the subreddit of Knightfall like Knightfall? What a shocking turn of events.
Princess Sarah,"Not quite sure why you are responding to me, and not the dude who wrote the review, but whatever. "
Scent of Love,The prick turned up to court each day in a rented Rolls Royce. Not really sure what the message he was trying to make was.
Scent of Love,Gonna chime in on this one and say I have no idea how the people of Britain let this guy fucking win during his season. Like there were absolute pieces of garbage that season and he stood out the most. The show even allowed his now ex-gf to break up with him IN THE HOUSE on an episode after he had sex with another contestant LMAO.
Scent of Love,People are so stupid.
Scent of Love,I read that he made 40k from his OF around the time he posted the video. I hope he has to pay her every cent of it.

Scent of Love,Holy fucking loser Batman
Scent of Love,"Saw him on 2 seasons of The Challenge and it was obvious he was a major asshole. He had some fun moments but he didn't know when to stop and took things too far.

It was rough watching some of the girls fall for his ""bad boy"" charm over and over (specifically Georgia and Kailah). 

In retrospect that scene where Wes and Bananas stuck a photo of Kailah's boyfriend up above her bed was probably a low-key effort to remind her she was about to cheat on her boyfriend for an absolute prick."
Scent of Love,Celebrity is quite a stretch
Scent of Love,Eww. He *drips* douchebag.
Scent of Love,Maybe Channel 4 can stick a camera up his arse so we don‚Äôt miss any of the action.

Scent of Love,I hate everything about this headline.
Scent of Love,"I have never seen this person, so I guess even winning Celebrity Big Brother doesn't make someone much of a celebrity."
Scent of Love,These guys trying too hard to prove their masculinity. What a joke.

Scent of Love,"It‚Äôs crazy this shit stain got 21 months for posting a fucking video, versus that mega shit stain QB who only got 6 months for beating the shit out of his gf. It‚Äôs a very backwards, fucked up system we got"
Scent of Love,"For context, he will only serve half of this sentence and be on some bullshit probation for the remainder."
Scent of Love,"Not long enough IMHO, arrogant prick."
Scent of Love,Never heard of him.
Scent of Love,"If he‚Äôs put on the sex offenders register, will he banned from travel and social media? I really hope so would be nice for him to disappear from consciousness. 

Oh, and I hope prison is thoroughly unpleasant for him. But he‚Äôll probably be protected on the nonce wing."

Scent of Love,"Disappointed that he turned out to be an actual prick. For what I saw when he appeared in those reality shows my GF watches, he was pretty hilarious. Managed to rub everyone the wrong way. Especially those idiots of the MTV Challenge shows who take themselves way too serious. But fuck him for putting this video online and he got what he deserves"

Scent of Love,Maybe he was trying to make sure that every single person who saw him loathed him. The crime itself probably was enough but he could have wanted the extra assurance.
Scent of Love,Trying to be an Andrew Tate alpha dude bro? Because apparently doing sex crimes is fine as long as you own luxury cars
Scent of Love,He‚Äôs probably a big Andrew Tate fan
Scent of Love,"Must have been trying to let everyone know what a massive cunt he is, as if his previous actions hadn‚Äôt already proven it to anyone watching. Not that I condone anything bad happening to him but maybe going to prison as a sex offender will show him the error of his ways, although being a high profile prisoner will probably afford him more luxuries than the average person would receive"
Scent of Love,How do you know it was rented
Scent of Love,Imagine the type of people who watch celebrity big brother and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll find your answer
Scent of Love,"People vote for the people they want to see more of next week. It's visual clickbait that ends up winning, not because we like these people, but because we like to judge them. 

So this weird symbiotic relationship exists where assholes try and be mega-assholes just to keep the eyeballs glued to their antics. And the viewers get what they want just the same. 

My word for 2023 is ""disengage"". Really I shouldn't even be reading a reddit thread about the guy, it is absolutely what he wants and will perpetuate this sort of personality proliferating."
Scent of Love,"Many idiots think of people like him as ""alpha males"" unironically... they think they are ""powerful"" and ""real men"" and other shit like that, since they believe themselves to be like that or worse, wish they would be like that, and thats why they vote for that.

Then you have some women that like ""bad boys"" i.e. assholes they think they can ""tame"", when we all know assholes will stay assholes....

Thats sadly how most of reality TV works, the biggest dicks and assholes always win, women and men.

I mean look at Francesca WhatsHerName from Too Hot to Handle on Netflix, she won, when she was not only clearly there for Clout only, but basically fucked over everyone, was a total bitch and basically sold herself for some internet fame... and she still has a huge following because there are too many idiots and lowlifes that love people like that as described above... people are insane."
Scent of Love,"In Australia when it first started the person who usually wins is just a genuine compassionate down to earth person with empathy.

Most have had good positive careers after it and in talk shows and are just good people.

How the fuck do these cunts keep winning now? Is that what people inspire to be like now?"
Scent of Love,"Well, this is the same show that produced Andrew Tate, so‚Ä¶"
Scent of Love,"Didn't watch celebrity big brother but did see him on The Challenge.

He came across as a ""douche with a heart""  

* He would cheat, but be honest that he cheated and show some remorse

* he would lie, but show some remorse for the lie

* he would act tough, but talk about it being a front

* (not a big brother thing but in the challenge he had a string never quite attitude even against much bigger people that made him popular)

On the challenge he played up a character  pretty well.  The bad boy with a heart of gold.  People eat that shit up.

The girl in the video met him on the challenge and ate that shit up.  People love an asshole who looks to have a soft center"
Scent of Love,None of these shows are chosen by the public. It is all decided by marketing and money.
Scent of Love,"This entire genre of media is fucking appalling trash, that's how. Its fans are just as awful."
Scent of Love,Area you trying to rationalize reality TV? Go touch some grass
Scent of Love,People are so ~~stupid.~~ horrible
Scent of Love,Which beckons the question why we‚Äôre giving them more publicity
Scent of Love,He‚Äôll probably be paying that in legal fees.
Scent of Love,Holy shit that guy is huge
Scent of Love,I don't understand anything that happened in this video
Scent of Love,The narcissistic wound in public format
Scent of Love,Lol! Just watched that. What a fucking pussy.
Scent of Love,"Ironically, after all his attempts at appearing Alpha, he looks just like David in Schitt‚Äôs Creek.

‚ÄúEeew, David.‚Äù"
Scent of Love,The Challenge is the show I know him from. Wes and Bananas teaming up for that was hilarious.
Scent of Love,"Ahhhh

Bear from the challenge....

He was fun on the challenge but being a douche on that show won't make you stand out. Pretty much all of them are douches

Him being a little guy who fought with a ton of heart is what got him fans."
Scent of Love,"I haven't got to this season yet, but I've seen Kailah and I hate hearing this. She's someone I hate due to a lot of her actions, but she's so pretty in exactly the way I like with dark hair and tats."
Scent of Love,"In the UK he sadly is. This trial was constantly reported on by our tabloids and even the BBC. 

This guy is a scumbag and should absolutely have no celebrity following, but some people live for following this stuff. See also Chris Brown still selling out tours."
Scent of Love,"The great natural culmination of Big Brother (the UK version anyway) was the blurring of the lines between celebrity and non celebrity Big Brother.   
     
When it started back in the late 90s, it was just some people in a house and you watched them on TV. It was the only reality TV there was. Pre-Facebook world, any ‚Äòsocial media‚Äô that existed was just bored teenagers listing their favorite bands.       
Then the celebrity one was a charity version of ‚Äòall in a house‚Äô only it was people who were known to the public due to being high profile in some form of entertainment (music, acting, sport, comedy, etc.).       
       
Slowly people started to realise that success on reality TV could be the gateway to ‚Äòa career in being famous‚Äô and being on other TV, so more and more people were less ‚Äòjust in a house‚Äô and more trying to achieve notoriety as a springboard to fame.     
And in the celebrity one it became seen as about tacky famewhores and associated with being ‚Äòwashed up‚Äô, so they were increasingly scraping the barrel of who was ‚Äòfamous‚Äô.    
The original meta-culmination of this was when they had a non-celebrity-pretending-to-be-a-c-list-celebrity on celebrity Big Brother, which then naturally made her a celebrity.    
       
But then the third act topped it, as social media became more universal and challenged broadcast TV in importance.      
Now you still have attractive young people who want to be famous (aka the people that go on Big Brother), but if they are serious enough about that to be a good Big Brother contestant, they already have a set of high profile social media accounts with many followers unrelated to their real life. They also likely also interact with similar social media personalities (and date similar) so they can all put it on their social media, etc. They‚Äôre already ‚Äòscene‚Äô if they‚Äôre hungry and importantly attractive enough to become scene, and therefore celebrities.    
       
So by the end both celebrity and non-celebrity versions was an indistinguishable collection of hot 20 something‚Äôs who had already got off with each other for likes and ad revenue on various media platforms. Only the celeb version would also have a washed up American star with poor mental health who needed the money for legal issues thrown in to interact with them.      
     
That‚Äôs the point that it became clear ‚Äòthe kids‚Äô make their own reality-fame these days and it was pointless to broadcast people who constantly broadcast themselves.       
       
Big Brother became a perfect window onto the changing nature of fame."
Scent of Love,"Ohhhh he posted Georgia...from the challenge

They were both fun to watch on the challenge.

(Yes total douche but everyone is a douche or recovering douche on the challenge. It's part of what makes the eliminations so fun)"
Scent of Love,"Hilariously, I‚Äôm pretty sure that the contestants are supposed to be celebrities before joining the show (that is, they aren‚Äôt becoming celebrities because of the show, they are supposed to already be famous). 

Of course, there‚Äôs no way to get a genuine celebrity with a real career to agree to do something like this, so the casting people have to go with a bunch of nobodies anyway. Checking Wikipedia, the people who were on that season are mostly from other reality shows for example."
Scent of Love,"The genre is circular. You are famous by being on reality TV and that feeds back in to the celeb side of reality TV. It just eats itself because no one else wants anything to do with it, because its beyond useless trash."
Scent of Love,"Just hoping this wasn't America's version of Celebrity Big Brother, which only ran opposite the Winter Olympics."
Scent of Love,"I saw him on the challenge.  Charismatic douche

Fit in well on the challenge as they are pretty much all douches or recovering douches."
Scent of Love,"I mean, his onlyfans and twitter is full of videos of him sitting on a huge dildo and fucking himself with objects. Can‚Äôt be more masculine than that!"
Scent of Love,I can't find it
Scent of Love,"If he posted it on his only fans, then it's not public so no it won't be online forever"
Scent of Love,"But he is also a registered sex offender, and all that entails"
Nakee,"‚ÄúThe police officers told the outlet that there were no signs of foul play ahead of the Philadelphia native‚Äôs death, noting that several cans of compressed air ‚Äî which can be used to clean dust off computers ‚Äî were found near her body.‚Äù üòû

Nakee,"Damn just 35 and presumably in good physical condition, very sad"
Nakee,"Reading other sources on her death suggest she may have huffed dust-off canned air. Regardless, it‚Äôs a very sad situation."
Nakee,Huffing ‚Äúdust off aerosol‚Äù used on computer keyboards. All while dog sitting in someone else‚Äôs house. Sad outcome all the way around. Tragic. RIP
Nakee,"This is a first hand account from someone who used to huff ""dust off"", the canned material that was found near Melanie's body. Holy crap...why would you ever touch this stuff? https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3peliu/never\_huff\_dustoff/"
Nakee,Well that‚Äôs a disturbing story. I hope her family and people was dog sitting for are ok.
Nakee,"So sad, she was hilarious and seemed like a good person."
Nakee,What does this do to her Primitive Survival Rating (PSR)?
Nakee,...she didn't die in any way relative to the show.  She was on the show 9 years ago...why is this a news article?
Nakee,The dog did it.
Nakee,"She huffed her way through cans of air, sweet dreams."
Nakee,She wanted to walk on sunshine üòû
Nakee,"I was very disappointed to discover that the ""deadline"" source was not a news site exclusively for celebrity deaths"
Nakee,She die on the show?
Nakee,[deleted]
Nakee,Who?
Nakee,Man that sucks. Those guys probably want to sell their house and move now. Or walk by that room and remember their dead friend forever...
Nakee,So ?
Nakee,..Was deadline created specifically to report celebrity deaths? I see it has more lively articles as well.
Nakee,[deleted]
Nakee,In all honesty I‚Äôm surprised this didn‚Äôt happened earlier‚Ä¶
Nakee,"SADS? 

Climate pox?

We may never know..."
Nakee,[removed]
Nakee,This is so sad. These contestants suffer so much during their ordeal.  It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if she brought some sort of tropical bug or disease back with her.  God rest her soul.
Nakee,Was she jabbed?
Nakee,Vaccine deaths
Nakee,"her legacy in life was she was on a show naked .... oof.  
atleast she died doing a good deed- seems the doggos ok"
Nakee,I wonder if it‚Äôs one of those deaths from natural causes that has absolutely nothing to do with the Covid boosters
Nakee,Walkinnon dundhine
Nakee,Don‚Äôt forget your towel.
Nakee,"It's a terrifying thought that you never know when the last time you do something is.

Was that the last time you called your mom? Maaaaaaybe."
Nakee,Scotch guard
Nakee,Clickbait.  She didn‚Äôt die while filming the show.
Nakee,"Whatever chemical is in there I can taste if someone within my vicinity has sprayed it, absolutely makes me nauseous."
Nakee,Incredible
Nakee,She looks familiar. Rest in peace.
Nakee,"Apparently it‚Äôs really easy to die using Dust Off to get high. Can easily knock your heart into an arrhythmia and kill you on your first go.

Nakee,Man it‚Äôd suck to be really passionate about cleaning and then randomly die and have everybody thinking you were walking on sunshine :(
Nakee,It‚Äôs Prescott.  This should not be surprising.
Nakee,She was my friend. We grew up together in Philly went to school together for 12 years. Everything people are saying about her being an amazing person is all true. It's sad people are here making fun of her. You didn't know her or what she went through or why she might have been using duster. It pisses me off. You didn't know her. They never should have released that info. I can't imagine what her family is going through.
Nakee,"Yea, that's why me and my friends stopped doin that shit. A kid died one town over, and we said ""oh shit, fuck that... just smoke weed and drink beer"""
Nakee,It can also be used for huffing.
Nakee,Her primitive survival rating now drops from a 7.8 to a 6.3
Nakee,There are a ton of people who do this stuff and eat weird shit that you think is healthy but aren‚Äôt actually healthy. Like all of those people who only eat organic pasture raised everything but try to cure cancer with fruits and exercise
Nakee,"Sometimes heart defects go undiagnosed, or a blood vessel in the brain just bursts."

Nakee,Very SADS
Nakee,‚ÄúI‚Äôm walking on sunshine!‚Äù
Nakee,Huffed dust-off canned air?  Is that something folk get high off of?
Nakee,"My neighbor died like this.  She was buying cases of it from Walmart.  She left her two kids behind with no other parent.  It‚Äôs not even enjoyable, it‚Äôs just disconnecting from your senses for a few seconds.  If your life sucks enough you want to do this there is something bigger wrong with your life you need to figure out and get taken care of"
Nakee,Damn dude that‚Äôs horrible
Nakee,What a fucking stupid way to get high‚Ä¶
Nakee,"My moms friend had a son who died like that...really bad ""drug"" to do. You'd actually be safer doing coke. Victims of the drug war"
Nakee,"Fuck I‚Äôve done that many times before (not recently, not again)

It‚Äôs real bad"
Nakee,Suddenly glad I bought I mini-electric blower to save on workshop cleaning costs...either prices on the electrics will soar or the cans will be banned
Nakee,Why would someone huff that? Is it to get high?
Nakee,"This is the problem with this show, they are using addicts to get contestants and all they get in return is sickness, disease, injury and a useless survival rating badge. 

This show used to have people actually skilled to be in these special circumstances. They still label the contestants as ‚Äúexperts‚Äù with types of ‚Äúyeah my experience is taking pictures of butterflies, so I am outdoors a lot, and that makes me a perfect candidate to survive a lava flow in Java while living under a rock infested with snakes‚Äù

This show is the biggest con and they are crippling people baiting them with the promise of non existent tv fame."
Nakee,AirDnD
Nakee,Source?
Nakee,Sounds horrible
Nakee,[deleted]
Nakee,The most worthless rating system in tv history.
Nakee,Takes her down to 5.2
Nakee,"[Because she chose to huff air duster rather than eat a sandwich, her PSR drops from 7.6 down to a 1.0 rating.](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/w6ybim/melanie_rauscher_dies_naked_and_afraid_contestant/ihi6dj6)"
Nakee,A straight 10. She can survive anything now.
Nakee,because she died
Nakee,Why is this something that upsets you ? Were not allowed to discuss a former television personality dying on a sub called r/television ? Fuck off lol i hope nobody shows up at ur funeral.
Nakee,Because they realize they can title it in a misleading way
Nakee,"I assume it's cuz she developed enough celebrity on the show to get an obit. You see a lot of these where the person's sorta famous, but you still need a reminder of where you knew em from in the headline."
Nakee,"If there is evidence that the dog did it, the evidence was probably planted there by the real culprit, the cat."
Nakee,"Corey Kasun, a rep for the Prescott Police Department, confirmed to TMZ that the reality star was dog sitting in the city while the homeowners were out of town. Upon their return, they discovered Rauscher dead in their guest room.

Police reported no signs of foul play or drug use. Rauscher did not leave a suicide note and the dog she was minding was fine.

Rauscher was a contestant on Naked and Afraid in 2013 and its spinoff, Naked and Afraid XL, in 2015"
Nakee,"you could, you know, read the one paragraph article smh"
Nakee,Literally just read the article lol
Nakee,"Weird assumption you‚Äôre making there. Maybe she sinned and stuff and is burning in hell now, naked and afraid, of course. ;-)"
Nakee,And they have to legally disclose her death for 3 years if they try and sell
Nakee,You must have a pretty sad outlook on life to make A common until like this out of absolutely nowhere. I mean it‚Äôs Reddit but man what the fuck LOL sigh.
Nakee,"What do you think your comment is accomplishing?

Just writing to let us know you're a dick head?"
Nakee,"Look at this guy, quoting South Park like the clever funny man that he is. How original! In response to someone‚Äôs passing too, oh you are a gem. Really. I hope you fall down a flight of stairs."
Nakee,You think she dropped dead spontaneously at someone‚Äôs house while dog sitting  from Covid?
Nakee,I know the police announced that she wore hats so they are looking into that as a potential cause.
Nakee,Does it matter? I got the HPV shot when I was in middle school if I died today would you ask if I was vaccinated against HPV?
Nakee,"Yes, I‚Äôm sure someone knows."
Nakee,Lmfao
Nakee,"I see a lot of downvotes, but nobody addressed the question."
Nakee,Yup no one ever died before the covid vaccine
Nakee,Are you Anti-Vax?
Nakee,Vaccine in a duster can?
Nakee,It says she was huffing compressed air‚Ä¶ where have you got the impression this is in any way related to Covid?
Nakee,"When I was a young teenager I remember reading something in a magazine about inhalants. It was about some kid who was huffing something with friends for the first time and just randomly died. It freaked me the hell out. I did quite a few drugs in my later teens and early twenties, but I never ever ever did so much as a single whip-it. It just seemed so risky, especially for a high that lasts for like a minute."
Nakee,"I took care of kid in the ICU who was huffing that. We had to shock his heart with a defibrillator every 45 seconds for 13 hours because that shit was so cardio-toxic. Never seen anything or been part of anything like that night. Just waited for it to clear out of his system and support him. Kid lived with minimal issues.

Edit: word"

Go Ahead,"This is turning into the ""this could have been an email"" of award shows."
Go Ahead,">The 79th Golden Globe Awards, set for Sunday, *will highlight the philanthropic efforts of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association* with winners announced intermittently throughout a 90-minute gathering at the Beverly Hilton, the HFPA revealed on Tuesday.

So it's an entire night of damage control as the article ends with

>fallout of last February‚Äôs Los Angeles Times expos√© about the HFPA‚Äôs conduct and demographic makeup. The resulting uproar led many Hollywood constituencies to boycott the HFPA and prompted NBC, their longtime broadcasting partner for the Globes, to decline to air a Globes ceremony in 2022

lol 'can't boycott us if we didn't invite you' thing?"
Go Ahead,"You won't come to our awards? Fine, we'll just have our own private dinner, with hookers, and blackjack!"
Go Ahead,Just let Gervais read out the winners on youtube. He was always the only good thing about them anyway
Go Ahead,So just actors giving each other trophies in front of each other? Sounds riveting. How many of them are gonna show up in sweatpants this year?
Go Ahead,"For people wondering ""why have it exist at all""...

There's two mutually beneficial purposes.  

For the studios and industry, it's considered to be like the pre-season of the major awards and promotion cycle.  You want your promotional campaigned actors/films to have a strong showing here in order to build momentum for other awards.  Sometimes an underdog can surprise here, and bombing at the GG's can sometimes scuttle an otherwise promising prospect.

For the organizers, their purpose was always self-aggrandizing and being fluffed by celebrities and pandered to by Hollywood.

Since both main purposes can still exist, the event remains.  It's viability and significance take a hit of course, so going forward it will become a calculus for each side as to whether or not it remains worthwhile."
Go Ahead,We can just keep it that way from now on.
Go Ahead,Have any awards shows got an audience nowadays?
Go Ahead,You know there's people bummed out they can't watch this on tv. That makes me sadder than anything.
Go Ahead,"So, as usual?"
Go Ahead,"But the whole point of the Globes is to see a bunch of celebrities trying to hold it together for an entire night. No one actually takes the award seriously. 

Just cancel the entire thing already."
Go Ahead,Someone still watches these award shows?
Go Ahead,Win-win.
Go Ahead,Does anyone even watch award shows anymore? I got super tired of the political speeches that celebs love to give.
Go Ahead,The only correct way the Golden Globes should be produced
Go Ahead,So the only new thing is the lack of television coverage?
Go Ahead,"As if it wasn't weird enough to have a night devoted to a bunch of rich douchebags patting each other on the back. Now they decide to make it even weirder by doing it in private.

What an odd world we live in."
Go Ahead,I would guess that a lot of celebrities dread going to these things like the plague.
Go Ahead,"So, an email?"
Go Ahead,Then they end up announced the winners through a Twitter thread
Go Ahead,"If it's not televised and has no audience, did it really happen?"
Go Ahead,"I only check the results of Oscar and golden globe the morning after, makes no difference to me."
Go Ahead,I'm a little disappointed that they are just avoiding a show at all. I actually enjoy watching award shows for the film industry.. so just finding out this morning that the show is nowhere to be found and isn't happening.. lame.
Go Ahead,Not broadcast because not enough people want to watch it anymore and I believe that is because they have become political they're no longer about entertainment. They are a soapbox for entertainers to promote their agendas. For me that is why I don't watch any of that award ceremonies anymore.
Go Ahead,Sounds like it IS turning into an email‚Ä¶.
Go Ahead,"In fact, forget the dinner!"
Go Ahead,*africanamericanjack
Go Ahead,Exactly.
Go Ahead,An industry event being only for the industry isn‚Äôt a weird thing.
Go Ahead,"No actors wanted anything to do with it so it's just HFPA members announcing their picks then likely just sauntering off the stage, depressed they can't rub elbows with the Hollywood elite anymore."
Go Ahead,"I mean‚Ä¶that goes for all industries, not just the film industry: peers awarding peers."
Go Ahead,"It's not that different than how Cannes works though, and nobody ""shows up in sweatpants"" for that."
Go Ahead,how many of them are going to get into politically charged acceptance speeches? or is that only reserved for the photo op?
Go Ahead,"i mean, you don't have to watch..."
Go Ahead,It has pretty much been this way for me all along.
Go Ahead,The Oscar's is one of the top rated telecasts every year for the most part
Go Ahead,And Oscar too
Go Ahead,And the blackjack
Go Ahead,[deleted]
Go Ahead,Funnily enough I‚Äôm actually more interested in watching that than I am the actual show.
Go Ahead,[deleted]
Go Ahead,Someone should give them an Emmy.
Go Ahead,"I mean sure. But they are a big deal for the industry and for those not winning anything it is a networking opportunity. Honestly, it is kind of weird that all these industry events were ever televised."
Go Ahead,i think you're missing the sub context of what OP meant with their comment.
Go Ahead,[deleted]
Go Ahead,Natalie Portman Jr.
Go Ahead,"Her acting was so understated, she really didnt have that 'child-actor' acting at all, where kids talk like theyre from the 50s. "
Go Ahead,"Perfect cast, especially 011. I hope to see them all again next year."
Go Ahead,"Just watched this show in two sittings, fucking fantastic!"
Go Ahead,She's awesome isnt she?! What a series.  
Go Ahead,Yeah with such few lines but the astounding ability to portray haunting intensity through her face alone. It's impressive. 
Go Ahead,"Those kids were extraordinary in so many ways in this series. My 12 year old was as spellbound as I was, as we wasted most of the weekend glued to the screen till the very end."
Go Ahead,"Just googled Millie Brown. Apparently, there is a performance artist by the same name who appears to enjoy throwing up food coloring and calling it 'art'.

The show is damn good too. [Her work](http://imgur.com/a/XUSAG)"
Go Ahead,Just finished it.  I thought all the kids did a pretty great job.  The teenagers too.  
Go Ahead,She is amazing but a number of the actors in that show were also amazing.
Go Ahead,"Now that you mention it and single it out... Your right. Totally flawless performance. Don't remember thinking of her as anything other than the character.

Incredible depth for someone so young."
Go Ahead,"My favorite scenes were when Winona Ryder's character was communicating with her son through the lights. ""Are you safe?"" and ""R.U.N."" just chilled my blood"
Go Ahead,"I felt like the children outstaged nearly all the adults. Winona was just full on scenery-chewing crazy in every scene. It was fun, but also completely ridiculous. "
Go Ahead,She made Winona Ryder's acting look tepid by comparison. She outacted her in one scene together in particular with few lines. 
Go Ahead,"""Science is neat, but I'm afraid it's not very forgiving."""
Go Ahead,Loved it. Knew nothing going in. I'm right in the sweet spot for the target audience of this series.  2 four hour sessions to complete it and I'm wishing for more.
Go Ahead,"All the acting was pretty great. Don't discount the direction though. Even brilliant kid actors can languish with bad direction and writing. I haven't seen any of their other work, but the Duffer Bros. really seem to understand how to use kid actors in a way that is relatable that we haven't seen a lot of since the 80s classics like ET and Goonies. "
Go Ahead,Why not Emmys?
Go Ahead,"What is it really about? I want to watch the first season, it looks SO good"
Go Ahead,"All the cast was amazing. Eleven, the mother (Winona), Jonathan, the big sister, Toothless, the doctor.  

The black kid was kinda annoying though."
Go Ahead,The casting was great. 
Go Ahead,I am waiting for Conan to have all the kids on his show. 
Go Ahead,"Love the show, kinda hated Winona Ryder for most of it, very shrill and annoying lol, that was her only mode throughout the show :("
Go Ahead,"eh to me the show was merely ok, not sure why there is so much glowing praise, I suppose there are worse thing you can watch to pass the time.    
I might have benefited from watching one show a week but then I'd miss out on discussions like this one.     
All in all I'd recommend it to other people and will most likley watch season 2 but I don't think I'll be sitting down and rewatching season 1 at any point. 

Edit: cool beans, not being super hyped for a show is apparently disproved of. "
Go Ahead,[deleted]
Go Ahead,"At first the only reason I watched the show was to see the scene where 11 flips the van, but the rest of the show was awesome as well "
Go Ahead,[deleted]
Go Ahead,"It's definitely a kids show. Not much substance in plot or dialogue! It's hard to get good child actors, so the poor acting on most of their parts can be excused. People are drawn to it, so they can forgive the obvious deficiencies. Funny how far nostalgia will take a series when the other areas of the show are quite lacking. There is no way this won't get a second season (it is neflix, after all), so those who love it will be happy again next year!"
Go Ahead,and Turd Globe to Whiny Whinona Ryder...
Go Ahead,Stupid americans have such amazingly low standards for content it mystifies me. You people also voted Full House to be the best show on television at one time.
Go Ahead,Sexual Eruption. 
Go Ahead,"I was thinking that! The directors have done a great job with these kids. It's not just the line delivery, but the faces and the body language were all on point. 

Can they be the new cast of IT?"
Go Ahead,Dustin was the best! By far the smartest kid. 
Go Ahead,"I love how he's in the background shaking his head like ""wtf man"" and wiping his hand off"
Go Ahead,"I like how they do annoying kid stuff (stupid fights, yelling ""WHAAAT!?!"" at their parents, etc.), but it somehow comes off as relatable and endearing where it's just grating in other movies/t.v. shows. "
Go Ahead,"I strongly disagree. The child actors (outside of the older kids and Eleven) were awful. Poor delivery of often cheesy dialogue. Their acting reminded me that they were acting constantly which really broke the immersion often for me. Their interactions, especially their little arguments and fights, came off contrived and inauthentic."
Go Ahead,"Yup.  Those big brown eyes.  A little Leon, a little V for Vendetta.  I was doing the math in my head and thinking, ""Wait, was she really pregnant in Revenge of the Sith?"""
Go Ahead,This is exactly what my roommate said right when she walked in and saw her on the screen.
Go Ahead,"I hate this with all my heart.  It was one of the most aggravating things about the first couple of Harry Potters.  Once the kids started getting killed, it made it tolerable.

I can't stand that cadence."
Go Ahead,Probably helped she had like seven lines throughout the show. She's kind of the Iron Giant. 
Go Ahead,"They definitely left it open to continue the same story, but I also wouldn't be surprised if they went like American Horror Story and do a separate story with the next season. The latter also seems to fit with the theme of '70's and '80's pulp sci-fi."
Go Ahead,[deleted]
Go Ahead,I admire your self restraint to sleep somewhere in the middle.
Go Ahead,I can't imagine a better way to have spent the past 2 days.
Go Ahead,That's so fucking bad for you
Go Ahead,"I think her and David Harbour (the Sheriff) had the most nuanced performances, but yeah, the whole cast was great. "
Go Ahead,"The only one I would argue for was Hopper (the Chief, played by David Harbour). He played it pretty understated the whole time, and you could definitely see by his body language when he was manic or stressed without him resorting to Winona Ryder's slightly over-the-topness.

I just thought it added a lot more power to some of the later scenes once you begin understand how driven he is, and for what reason."
Go Ahead,"Any rational person would be full on scenery chewing crazy after about ep 2. The fact that she wasn't institutional by the end is a bloody miracle, same goes for a fair few of the characters who brushed off the stuff... well."
Go Ahead,"You can't really blame Winona for the performance though. Her character was supposed to be like that (for good reason...her child was found dead, but she knew he wasn't)...and Winona played it well."
Go Ahead,She played it so well though. She knew she believed all this crazy stuff was going on but she also knew how crazy it seemed to everyone else. 
Go Ahead,Winona definitely annoyed me until near the end when she started to pull it together. 
Go Ahead,"Agreed, definitely."
Go Ahead,I just wish the kids weren't constantly screaming and yelling at each other. Bring it down a notch.
Go Ahead,"Because it won't be eligible until next Emmys, and the Academy tends to have a short memory. Also doesn't tend to reward kid-themed horror-dramas on streaming channels. "
Go Ahead,Yeah Golden Globes don't have nearly the weight an Emmy does. 
A Very English Scandal,Yay. I really want Claire Foy to have a good career after the Crown. She was fantastic in it.
A Very English Scandal,His career has had a renaissance hasn‚Äôt it? Good for him. She was stellar in the Crown. She did a good Desert Island Discs. Some interesting revelations.
A Very English Scandal,"Glad to see Paul Bettany in more stuff, I hope more of the WandaVision cast get roles out of it."
A Very English Scandal,Anyone else find it funny that Vision wears glasses?
A Very English Scandal,Will Mephisto be in it tho?
A Very English Scandal,"I'm so happy to see people appreciating Bettany, he's been one of my favorite actors since A Knight's Tale."
A Very English Scandal,"Paul Bettany got that MCU career boost, and it makes me so happy."
A Very English Scandal,I LOVE seeing Paul get more work aside from Marvel stuff. He is such an amazing actor.
A Very English Scandal,Nice to see WandaVision's already puttin' my boy back in the spotlight.
A Very English Scandal,"As long as we‚Äôre doing the whole Paul Bettany thing,  can we get another Master & Commander?? Goddamn what an excellent movie that was, and the way they left the first one off it‚Äôs *begging* for a sequel"
A Very English Scandal,">Sarah Phelps (Dublin Murders) wrote the series, which will unfold in three 60-minute episodes and which will investigate the role institutional misogyny played in how the duchess was shamed in society and vilified by the press and the judicial system.

From Vision to fact, stay tuned"
A Very English Scandal,Does Bettany get any sleep? Feel like he's in a ton of stuff recently.
A Very English Scandal,[deleted]
A Very English Scandal,"How the **hell** does this constitute a Season 2?  They're two different miniseries with two different titles and two different writers. The first one *(A Very English Scandal)* was written by Russell T. Davies *(It's a Sin, Years and Years, Doctor Who)*. This one *(A Very British Scandal)* is written by Sarah Phelps‚Äîthe writer of *The Dublin Murders* and all those recent Agatha Christie ""adaptations"" (which are kind of nothing like the books).

It's like *The Terror.* If you go in thinking it'll be like the first one, you're going to be disappointed."
A Very English Scandal,Fuck yes. The world deserves more Bettany.
A Very English Scandal,Am I the only one that thinks Paul bettany looks way too old for the women he‚Äôs romantically paired up with on shows? Especially wandavision.. he just looks soooo much older than her.
A Very English Scandal,"the first season was so damn good.  I don't know anything about british pop culture, so I have no idea what this divorce is all about (yet prior to wikipedia in the next 10 min).  So, paul bettany ftw, claire foy ftw, you have my interest"
A Very English Scandal,Hell yeah!! Love Paul Brittany!
A Very English Scandal,"Claire Foy is so darn good. Paul Bettany is as well, but everyone already knew that! üòÄ"
A Very English Scandal,Have a huge crush on Claire Foy
A Very English Scandal,FLOURISH!!!
A Very English Scandal,What is A Very English Scandal Season 2 if not Paul Bettany persevering?
A Very English Scandal,Doesn‚Äôt Paul know his career is over?  /s
A Very English Scandal,I'll watch anything with Claire Foy. She's fantastic.
A Very English Scandal,The title: Snitches end up with Stiches in Ditches
A Very English Scandal,Is Kerry Washington going to be doing an accent or will they just dub her over
A Very English Scandal,"The mystery of the ""headless man""......"
A Very English Scandal,"No. You vision now. 

Find Wanda plz."
A Very English Scandal,"I'm not familiar with the series, so I read A Very English Scandal to be a very English *Scandal.* I thought they were adapting the ABC series for UK politics. Figured if the US can adapt so many UK series, what's the harm in it being the other way 'round for once? Silly me, but that would have been quite interesting to watch."
A Very English Scandal,"Paul Bettany was on a downward slope before Marvel gave him a chance to show his stuff, now he is practically a household name. Good for him!

Edit: because he was big before marvel but right before Avengers he wasn‚Äôt doing so well."
A Very English Scandal,I hate anthology shows to pieces but they‚Äôre both excellent actors and Russell T. Davies is God.
A Very English Scandal,Is Snowpiecer TV as good as Snowpiecer Movie?
A Very English Scandal,Not saying I have a mondo crush on Claire Foy...but I have a mondo crush on Claire Foy
A Very English Scandal,"In case anyone else is wondering like I was, Claire Foy is as far as I can tell unrelated to Mackenzie Foy (starred in Interstellar)."
A Very English Scandal,[deleted]
A Very English Scandal,So is it gonna be about a different scandal i presume?
A Very English Scandal,Who picked Paul Bettany‚Äôs glasses? Jeez
A Very English Scandal,"So long, darling."
A Very English Scandal,Anyone else think this was a transitioning post upon first scroll?
A Very English Scandal,Oh wow can‚Äôt wait to not watch the first season
A Very English Scandal,"The title screams no one cares, thank you for that"
A Very English Scandal,"Funny, I just binged the first season yesterday. Looking forward to more funny and messy scandals."
A Very English Scandal,There was a season 1?
A Very English Scandal,Wandas gonna be pissed
A Very English Scandal,Season 2? I'll make sure to keep it in my.. Vision!
A Very English Scandal,He was the frontrunner to replace Matt Smith in the Crown but couldn't due to scheduling conflicts.
A Very English Scandal,WandaVision season 2
A Very English Scandal,He looks like if Tyler Oakley was a sun dried tomato üçÖ
A Very English Scandal,I GUESS PAUL WASNT DONE IN HOLLYWOOD!
A Very English Scandal,"Paul Bettany will always be, to me, the homeless gambler in a knights tale with Heath Ledger"
A Very English Scandal,"Guys, I think Margaret‚Äôs Mephisto"
A Very English Scandal,Anyone else thing he could play navalny?
A Very English Scandal,"It‚Äôs hard to see him in anything other than marvel films/shows even though he‚Äôs a fantastic actor. Heck, the first time I was introduced to him, he was naked haha"
A Very English Scandal,"Sarcastically downplay a very serious situation. 

The end."
A Very English Scandal,"Yeah, but will he have a philosophical face off with his synthetic pseudo-clone?"
A Very English Scandal,ViShawn
A Very English Scandal,But will we finally see who the cameo was about?
A Very English Scandal,Oh no. Wanda is going to be pissed.
A Very English Scandal,Is it possible Claire Foy is ACTUALLY playing Mephisto?!?!
A Very English Scandal,Who is playing mephisto ?
A Very English Scandal,"So going by the title, will the scandal involves drinking tea along with fish and chips then a game of cricket?"
A Very English Scandal,I really don‚Äôt care about the actors who portray my favorite characters. I don‚Äôt know who they actually are for the most part.
A Very English Scandal,How very English of them.
A Very English Scandal,"They're putting new actors on the show. If a show changes all its actors in the course of several seasons, it is still the same show it was at season 1?"
A Very English Scandal,He was fired because of his stupid dumbass fucking glasses
A Very English Scandal,Why is it suddenly a 'British' scandal when the focus moves Scotland?
A Very English Scandal,They look like a knock off version of Wanda and Vision
A Very English Scandal,Paul Bettany is a fun Name to say
A Very English Scandal,"Dear Paul Bettany, stop looking exactly like Robert Webb. It is confusing."
A Very English Scandal,She was amazing in Wolf Hall. Best Anne Boylen ever!
A Very English Scandal,She‚Äôll be fine as long as they don‚Äôt try to shoehorn her into any more roles like Girl in the Spider‚Äôs Web.
A Very English Scandal,I feel the same way about Paul Bettany after WandaVision.
A Very English Scandal,I just got to season 3 and found the actor transition jarring. She was literally talking to the Kennedy's in season 2 and one year later completely different person.
A Very English Scandal,Yes. Check out the Upstairs Downstairs reboot where she gets to play a character more like her sister in The Crown.
A Very English Scandal,"I highly recommend ***Unsane*** is you haven't seen it.

I had great expectations for her as Lisbeth but *The Girl in the Spider's Web* was a let down. *The Electrical Life of Louis Wain,* releasing later this year, looks really intriguing as well."
A Very English Scandal,She did first man and Unsane after the crown.
A Very English Scandal,[deleted]
A Very English Scandal,"She was great in The Promise too, since it hasn't been mentioned yet."
A Very English Scandal,Crazy. I just started watching The Crown today after the BRF drama from this past weekend. It's been on my queue list forever and it's really good so far.
A Very English Scandal,"She played the younger sister in the rebooted Upstairs, Downstairs and she was captivating. You could tell she was going to be a great actor."
A Very English Scandal,"I really liked her in First Man, which was my first time seeing her"
A Very English Scandal,So weird to see her In girl with the dragon tattoo.
A Very English Scandal,"I believe I read he was literally talking to his agent about how maybe he just wasn't going to be getting the good roles in Hollywood because X or Y, and then the studio called and said, ""So, you up for a bigger role in the MCU?""

edit: Looked up the exact details!

>""I had just had a meeting with a producer, who will remain nameless, who told me that my career was over. He said 'You're done, you're done in this town,'"" Bettany told BBC Radio 1 of a shouting match he had at the time.

>""I stepped out into Hollywood and I sat on the sidewalk with my feet in the gutter and I thought 'F--- me,"" Bettany recalled after the meeting with the producer went south"".

>""My phone rang and it was ['Age of Ultron' director] Joss Whedon and he said, 'Do you want to play the Vision in the next 'Avengers' movie?'""

>""I sort of looked up to heaven and thought karma's very quick these days ... and [I] flipped the building behind me the finger,"" Bettany said. ""It happened just like that. I sat down and my phone rang. Very funny. But you know if I had a dollar for every time somebody told me my career was over, my career could be over."""
A Very English Scandal,"At this point I‚Äôll watch anything with Paul Bettany in it. And yes I‚Äôm rewatching Priest this weekend, fuck it"
A Very English Scandal,Yeah after Legion it looked like his career was over.
A Very English Scandal,Fun fact: Paul is about to turn 50 years old
A Very English Scandal,"Paul‚Äôs career was over, his own words, when he got the JARVIS gig. Love that he is back at it!"
A Very English Scandal,He was amazing in Manhunter Unabomber. Should have gotten an Emmy for that.
A Very English Scandal,Paul Bettany was an established actor long before he was in any Marvel movies.
A Very English Scandal,I think it's safe to say John Krasinski will be more famous than ever
A Very English Scandal,He‚Äôs been working steadily for over 20 years now.
A Very English Scandal,It's a Clark Kent thing he's going for.
A Very English Scandal,"I believe that it‚Äôs because he has a hypersensitivity to light and needs to wear glasses in order to counteract that, I could be wrong though"
A Very English Scandal,[deleted]
A Very English Scandal,Any idea what glasses those are? I‚Äôve been looking all over for them
A Very English Scandal,I'm glad that someone ia out there asking the real questions.
A Very English Scandal,I hope Ralph Bohner auditions for it
A Very English Scandal,"The word ""devil"" does appear inside *Very English Scandal.* That's all the proof I need."
A Very English Scandal,"I would love to see him do another comedic role like Chaucer again. Clearly, we see he has the chops for it."
A Very English Scandal,"Ah yes, the film where his opening scene was actually his opening."
Deliver Us,"Wow, that sounds good"
Deliver Us,"Murray Bartlett is quickly turning in to one of my favourite tv actors. What a huge transformation from his white lotus role. Amazing work. Nick Offerman, as usual, is an absolute god damn treasure."
Deliver Us,"Phenomenal. The reveal of Bill as a prepper with a Fleetwood Mac blues song is one of my favorite character reveals of all time. The whole episode is much different from the game obviously but this is how you tell a story. It‚Äôs so fucking beautiful. I‚Äôm almost mad I ruined it for myself because when Frank was talking about his plans for his last day, I said if I were Bill I‚Äôd just kill myself too. So it softened the blow but doesn‚Äôt take away from how incredible that whole hour was"
Deliver Us,üçì
Deliver Us,"Although I really missed the banter between Bill and Ellie from the game, I was amazed at how they created that entire backstory for Frank and Bill just from the letter they found with his body in the game. I watched this episode twice and then followed it up listening to the HBO podcast.   
The writing on this show is amazing and I hope other video game adaptions follow suit."
Deliver Us,"For those interested in how Frank and Bill's story played out in the game:  
  
>!Bill's alive when Joel and Ellie arrive, but Frank has left. Bill tells Joel that he used to take care of someone, but not anymore, says it only would have gotten him killed. You pick up hints throughout the level that Frank got tired of surviving without actually living and left. Bill never softened up like he did in the show, and he and Ellie but heads a lot. Bill warns Joel that Ellie will probably get him killed, but eventually acknowledges she can handle herself.!<  
  
>!After escaping some infected, they find Frank's body hanging by a noose in a building with a suicide note. Frank got bit soon after leaving Bill. He says in the note that Bill was right that he couldn't take care of himself, but he was still glad to be gone because he always hated Bill's guts. Bill is obviously saddened by this but doesn't want to admit it. As Joel and Ellie leave, Bill asks Joel if they're square, and when he says yes, Bill says ""Now get the fuck out of my town.!<  
  
[Frank's note.](https://i.imgur.com/W5b39xF.png)"
Deliver Us,Ron Swanson gets to be Ron Swanson in a completely unrelated show. You couldn‚Äôt ask for a better casting role. ‚ÄúYou new world order bastards.‚Äù
Deliver Us,"It was definitely a divergence from the source material but this was SO much better. That part of the game works fine in the game, but this was an really excellent way to adapt the source material. Though I kept being worried Bill was gonna not grant Frank his wish and he was gonna take off and do it himself (somehow). It wasn't until he downed that glass of wine that I was able to relax a bit.

Also, as a gay man, though it's becoming more common, it's still rare to see great gay love in media that isn't just trauma porn. This could easily have become trauma porn... but it wasn't? Tragic, but also very sweet. And seeing two men grow old together is even MORE rare. It was all just really nice to see and I like how they tied it into Joel's feelings for Tess.

EDIT: Just editing my comment about trauma porn to make it clear I'm saying this episode was not that, since I can see how it might've been vague."
Deliver Us,"Without any spoilers.

I am assuming the episode is lower rated because of review bombing due to certain relationships being presented with Bill? And not that the episode itself is actually bad?

If I go now on Imdb it has a 8.4 out of 10. There are 5,642.. 1 STAR reviews. The 1 star reviews make up 20% of the overall reviews. There were 1 star reviews for the first 2 eps, but they made up less than 1% of the overall reviews.

Which, leads me to believe that this is just a bunch of homopbhobic people lashing out about the episode."
Deliver Us,"This is why all that talk of adaptations needing to stick to the source is not entirely correct.

You just need good writers that respect the source, don't have to follow it 100%.

Also very good to know that Craig Maizin can write some good old ""classic"" drama. He's not just an ""end of the world"" expert."
Deliver Us,It‚Äôs refreshing for apocalypse show to talk about how important love is to survival. Usually they go into just kill and betrayal so much but never much into why it‚Äôs worth to fight to survive
Deliver Us,"Finally a network not afraid to give us the hot, gay Nick Offerman sex scenes we all have always wanted."
Deliver Us,"My daughter played the game. I knew nothing about it, but watched with her because she seemed very excited and I was curious. I‚Äôm glad I did. Same as the game or not, that episode was incredible."
Deliver Us,"I woke up this morning and decided to rewatch it while I did my morning jog on the treadmill. Went ""It won't be as sad the 2nd time, I got this.""

Did you guys know jogging is extra difficult when you're crying?"
Deliver Us,Two amazing performances in this episode. Wow. I was mesmerized the entire 80 minutes.
Deliver Us,"You NEVER see movies or TV shows where gay men grow old together. Let alone in a big budget entry in a massive genre IP.

It's usually two hot bisexual women played by two straight actresses one of whom dies two episodes in to make the other one sad."
Deliver Us,"This has to be one of the best cases of how deviating from the source material can make the new medium better. I played the game, I knew Bill, but I did **not** expect this whatsoever. But it's so good, it makes perfect sense for television.

Also, Andor has now gotten mentioned numerous times in this thread, it's on my list but it seems like I need to watch it ASAP!"
Deliver Us,"""I like you old. Getting older means we're still here.""

Hits a lot harder when you realize that these two men lived through the AIDS epidemic, too."
Deliver Us,"It felt to me like a strong episode of The Leftovers, and I can't give a show a higher compliment than that"
Deliver Us,"What's hilarious to me are the people who dislike it saying ""it didn't move the story forward!"" as if the Bill's Town section of the game wasn't just mostly a character development filler arc to get a car, all of which was accomplished in the first and last 20 minutes"
Deliver Us,"I think this is going to be the episode people mention when talking about the show. LOST had ""The Constant,"" The Leftovers had ""International Assassin,"" and TLOU is going to have ""Long, Long Time."""
Deliver Us,Anybody who liked this episode would probably get a lot out of watching the series Station Eleven.
Deliver Us,"Oh my God, I started crying as soon as Frank stated what he wanted for his last day!"
Deliver Us,Cried my damned eyes out. Beautiful episode
Deliver Us,"I really thought it would be one of those overhyped/overrated episodes but it was more special than I expected. It feels like 3 maybe even seasons worth of what Walking Dead is trying(but failed) to tell. If Euphoria can win acting awards for hype alone, then this one deserve it even more."
Deliver Us,"Honestly I think we can start to move past judging this show as just a ""Game to show adaptation"". It's absolute top tier television, period."
Deliver Us,I wonder if the ‚Äújackboot fucks‚Äù line was an intentional callback to Nick‚Äôs role in Fargo
Deliver Us,"I'd say there's been some equally good episodes in recent memory:

* **The season finale of Severance**; I've never felt that much tension watching a TV show. I'm not even as in love with the series as most people; I thought it was merely OK. But that last episode, man, is transcendently good.

* **House of the Dragon, episode S1:E8** The old King ascending the throne for the last time and the dinner party afterwards, in particular.

* Maybe a bit long in the tooth now, but that **third episode of Arcane** is still sticking with me. I used to play the game. I knew about the plot twist going in, and it still floored me.

With honorable mentions to the last episode of Better Call Saul, a few episodes of Attack on Titan, and For All Mankind in general. I feel like the Boys, Invincible, Andor, and maybe even the most recent episode of Vox Machina (S2:E6) should be in there as well.

And I bet a bunch of episodes of shows I don't watch. There's a lot of good television these days."
Deliver Us,Nick Offerman and Murray Bartlett absolutely deserve award nominations for their performances in that episode. Beautiful!
Deliver Us,I thought it was brilliant and on par with Andor's prisonbreak scene within the past year
Deliver Us,"I really like the different directions the show has gone from the game. The expanded back stories of smaller characters, the early days of the fungus, etc. A shot for a shot TV show wouldn't add anything, IMO the whole point of recreating a story in a new medium is to add to it or portray it in a way they the other medium could not. Frankly, I don't know what you could do differently in a TV show from a game, they're both visual and the game of course has cutscenes, so expanding the world is an awesome way to differentiate the show from the game and make it worth watching."
Deliver Us,"Didn't expect it to be that good.   
It hits so hard when the episode ends too. Damnn!"
Deliver Us,I like how they changed up the way the relationship ends in the show than the way it played out in the game.  They made Bill likable!
Deliver Us,"It was a great episode. Great setup of the theme of finding purpose in a world so utterly hopeless and bleak, which we get to observe now in Joel and Ellie's story."
Deliver Us,[removed]
Deliver Us,"almost brought me to tears when Ellie was reading the letter out, and i know nothing of the game /  story.

&#x200B;

masterfully written and acted. got to care for 2 old guys in the space of 45 mins more than you do for most character in an entire series"
Deliver Us,"Absolutely amazing episode. The acting, the music, my tears. So much heart in one episode."
Deliver Us,"All I could think at the beginning was ""Uh oh Ron Swanson"" but Offerman turned it around and became emotional and tender. Needed this episode to show that love didn't die off with the end of civilization."
Deliver Us,"I didn't expect to cry half the episode. After Bill got shot and they showed Frank in a wheelchair I was holding back tears and got choked up a couple times because I thought I knew where it was going. I didn't expect a double suicide.

I cried more this episode than I did with Sarah's death in game and on the show, I didn't think that was possible."
Deliver Us,"45 year old man here. That scene with the rings brought me to tears. The games brought me to the show, but performances like this episode will keep me watching for sure."
Deliver Us,I love that Bill got a happy ending with Frank!
Deliver Us,"Fantastic episode and academy award level acting. 

A wonderful, touching description of diverse, different gay men - Neither falling into cliches and caricature of gay men which is the Hollywood standard.


Bravo. üëè Bravo!"
Deliver Us,I could not stop crying. So beautiful
Deliver Us,I got Leftovers Season 3 vibes from this episode. That is a good thing. A very good thing.
Deliver Us,"I haven't seen a realistic depiction of masculine gay love in any form of media worth watching in I don't know how long. I'm a straight, married, cisgender father and this episode not only made me tear up, but made me have so much more appreciation for Nick Offerman than I have had for any actor in the last decade. Amazing performance, writing, and directing. 

If this doesn't win the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance , or a Golden Globe, everything is wrong with both bodies."
Deliver Us,Would i enjoy this knowing nothing about the game?
Deliver Us,"The episode was amazing for san many reasons, with the portrayal of Bill and Frank's love obviously being the frontrunner, but one of the things I don't see is how it breaks so many rules in the postapocalyptic genre we have now. As soon as we meet Bill, it's made very clear that he has nothing to offer. Frank knows, seemingly, just about everything in the damn world and when Bill gets a chance to show off as the heart to counter Frank's mind at the piano, we see that Frank's emotions run about a mile deep too. Now, the two tenants in play for the genre are 1. It's about what you have to bring to the table, and 2. If you haven't suffered to the point of breaking and becoming something new, you're not done suffering. The whole episode I was waiting for Frank to train Bill, or Bill having to take up the survivor mantle after Frank dies, or at the very least for the uneven power dynamic to come into play since Bill can't pull his weight. Surprisingly, it was none of that, and I think it showed the bravery of Bill and Frank to not stop hoping they could live the lives they want, without reservations, and the bravery of the show to say ""They deserve love because they want it. And that's the only reason they survive as well as they do."""
Deliver Us,"They made it a bottle episode. Compare to TNG's ""Inner Light"", The Magician's ""A Life In The Day,"" or Adventure Time's ""Puhoy.""  They're all tearjerkers."
Deliver Us,Lots of butthurt dudes in threads popping up around Facebook
Deliver Us,"Oh good, this wasn't bleak enough without me being sad for dead gay Ron Swanson.

*sigh*

Amazing episode, 10/10. Only real problem I have with it is it feels *real* early in the series for a kind of a break from the main cast, especially since they haven't had a lot of time to develop the Joel/Ellie relationship. I feel like this would have fit better as an EP5-6 but I'm getting from the other replies that this was a super early game character and they kind of had a ""window"" to do anything about it. Still works, just not where I'd put it if I could get away with it."
Deliver Us,I didn‚Äôt expect such a beautiful love story in a show about surviving in a post apocalyptic world filled with fungus zombies. They were both brilliant  and there was so much chemistry between them!
Deliver Us,"Everyone: Episode three of this show will blow your socks off


Me: Oh there's probably shitloads of zombies and shooting and explosions


TLOU: *Hehehehehe*"
Deliver Us,"Wow it's almost like if you follow the script of the game and add to it but don't take way from it then it becomes an amazing tv series. 


Holy shit who knew."
Deliver Us,"I didn‚Äôt get to see the episode until last night, unfortunately on Sunday night I saw a couple of reactions to the show online that slightly spoiled the episode for me which was a bummer. But even with that I still cried. Very emotional episode and really well written. Experiencing a relationship from start to finish that sparks and ends during what is essentially the end of the world felt pretty unique and was handled so tenderly."
Deliver Us,"As a gay guy, I enjoyed seeing a gay relationship on a show that is *not* a queer show. Usually when i see a gay male couple, its often in a show directed toward a queer audience. I was really glad to see such an authentic depiction of gay romance without being a satire, or part of a punchline. Perfectly done."
Deliver Us,I watched this last night and my partner and I can‚Äôt stop talking about it. Was one of the best I‚Äôve seen in a long time.
Deliver Us,I need to go back and rewatch it from a different perspective.  I just finished playing the chapter with Bill in the game and enjoyed it so much I was looking forward to that Bill in the show.  I was disappointed in the representation of him as his game persona was still ingrained.  I‚Äôm sure I will enjoy it much more if I‚Äôm not expecting the video game character.
Deliver Us,[removed]
Deliver Us,Yupppppppp.
Deliver Us,"Max Richter's 'On the Nature of Daylight' was the violin song if anyone was wondering. Also featured in Shutter Island and Arrival. 

Such a goddamn slapper of a depressing tune lol."
Deliver Us,it was good but this is silly
Deliver Us,"Why was Bill standing in the middle of the street with a sniper rifle shooting at them instead of behind cover, what did that scene serve?"
Deliver Us,"I‚Äôm sorry but y‚Äôall say this every time something good comes out. Y‚Äôall said the same about mando , said the same thing about bcs. Can we please go back to using realistic measures not everything is ‚Äúone of the greatest tv episodes in recent memory‚Äù"
Deliver Us,"I balled my eyes out. and I said the same thing to my wife. For me, It was on par with the San Junipero episode of black mirror."
Deliver Us,"Stop using ""subvert our expectations"" as a catch-all term for offshoot storytelling/world-building."
Deliver Us,"I wonder if the writing went this route for a secondary reason as well.  The writers had a difficult decision.  I'm sure they started off with the concept of Bill from the game and I was really looking forward to this portrayal.  The problem is the more back story you create, the more unlikeable ellie's relationship with Bill becomes.  As the show runners want Joel to gradually like her and become her protector, they also want the viewers to do the same.  It can be a struggle to get viewers to like precocious young girls.  There was no need to make it harder.

>!If Bill is alive when Joel/ellie arrive, her comments to a grief stricken and broken man would take her character backwards.  Stealing items from him and making fun of his gay porn might make viewers hate her.  Bill allowing Frank to change the town‚Äôs vision was the only real change.  The rest of the episode was the alternate universe result of that decision.  In both the game and the TV show,  Joel has a decision point as well.  He can wallow in the past or move forward  !<

Both universes exist and they are the ideal result in their individual worlds.  I wonder if those who hate the episode are missing the point of both stories."
Deliver Us,"It was great, even made my eyes misty at times, but no it's not one of the greatest TV episodes it recent memory.

People need to chill out with their tlou hyperboles lol"
Deliver Us,"I was sat in my front room at 6am crying like a baby.  I'm 47 years of age.

&#x200B;

It was one of THE great episodes of television."
Deliver Us,"Disclosure, I didn't play the games

I thought the episode was pretty good but IMO it is a little too self contained that I felt like the writers went out of their way to make me feel sad and emotional with no payoff or relevance to the overall story. I would have liked if Bill somehow continued to live on and ran into Joel and Ellie and Joel got to see/learn from a person who managed to find love and joy in such a bleak world. That's my only criticism of it though, the episode was very well made and memorable."
Deliver Us,Sobbed. Ugly sobbed. What an episode.
Deliver Us,"Another week, another post about the greatest episode of TV in recent memory.   I think people around here have no long term memory."
Deliver Us,"It was such a brilliant episode and fantastic alternative to the story we already know, the only thing I'm sad about is that we didnt get to see bill and ellie's banter."
Deliver Us,Exactly my thoughts. It's been a long time since something hit me this hard.
Deliver Us,"Oh, need to tune in soon on this one.ü´¢"
Deliver Us,"It was good. Felt a bit overly familiar though, especially with that Max Richter music which is so overused."
Deliver Us,"Had me tearing up, very rare occurrence. Bravo."

Deliver Us,They took a hard left with Ron Swanson lol
Deliver Us,Absolute masterpiece of an episode
Deliver Us,That was a masterpiece. Watched it again and find it even more beautiful. 10/10
Deliver Us,"It's been a few years since we've gotten a great ""watercooler"" show. We live in a golden age of television, but this is special in my opinion."
Deliver Us,"Honestly, Last of Us is weird, because I enjoy the show a lot, but I have so much less interest in Joel and Ellie than in the prequel sequences."
Deliver Us,"I hope this means we'll also get an episode following Ish, whether it be in this season or Season 2. I don't think we ever find out what happened to him in the game, but I remember going out of my way to try and find all of the notes, so it would be really to see his story played out."
Deliver Us,It was a very welcome deviant from the game story with how the expanded on and changed the outcome for Bill and Franks story. Though Andor prison episode is still up there for greatest episode in recent memory for me lol.
Deliver Us,This episode made me cryüòÇüòÇ I haven‚Äôt cried in years!?
Deliver Us,Well said & beautifully expressed‚Ä¶. Totally agree‚Ä¶.
Deliver Us,I never got to say goodbye to my best friend and to my dad when they passed away in 2020. I wish I had spent a proper last day with me just like frank and bill were able to do.  I cried so much.
Deliver Us,Totally agree! This episodic was touching and so well done.
Deliver Us,I‚Äôm just blown away how good this show is.
Deliver Us,"That was an outstanding bit of writing, directing and acting."
Deliver Us,"thought it was a really great episode of TV. would I have liked to see the set pieces from Bill‚Äôs level played out in live action? Hell yeah i wanted to see Pedro hanging upside down headshotting infected. But that isn‚Äôt what the creators of the show are trying to do. They‚Äôre doing something different and it really works. Besides, I can always just play the game if i want to experience that!"
Deliver Us,Yes it was
Deliver Us,I just watched S1 White Lotus and had no idea that was Armond in that hole!
Deliver Us,This is the most beautiful and moving episode of tv I‚Äôve ever seen. It reminded me a lot of The Magicians episode A Life in a Day.
Deliver Us,"This episode turned me into a crying, snotty mess. It hit really hard."
Deliver Us,Definitely my favorite episode so far
Deliver Us,There was a personal reveal on watchmen that was better IMO. But yeah this was damn good.
Deliver Us,"great ep, craig mazin should make all the game adaptations"
Deliver Us,I don't think iv cried like that in a TV show on years. Unexpectedly touching
Deliver Us,Meh
The Uncanny Counter,We don't call it that
The Uncanny Counter,You just blue my mind
The Uncanny Counter,The OC is a great show imo one of the best teen dramas
The Uncanny Counter,This is the most important thing I‚Äôve read all day.
The Uncanny Counter,"Seeing as how Arrested Development was highly inspired by the sitcom Soap, a simply named parody of soap operas, I don't think it's too crazy that Arrested Development shares many storylines with a modern soap opera. 

This does however sound like it could be a scene in AD:  a producer at Imagine Entertainment greenlighting any and every project as long as it's about a real estate development company based in New Port Beach haha!"
The Uncanny Counter,*Oh whatchya sayyy...*
The Uncanny Counter,Don't call it that.

The Uncanny Counter,"> This is like my 3rd time watching The OC

This is the first time this sentence has been typed."
The Uncanny Counter,I can't believe you've only just noticed!
The Uncanny Counter,But you said...
The Uncanny Counter,"Oh OP, you blow hard"
The Uncanny Counter,"Mine too, when I red that"
The Uncanny Counter,"Well, the first couple of seasons. And it gave us the power of Pete Gallagher's eyebrows. It also introduced us to Chris Pratt, and later birthed Gossip Girl and then Seth married Blair. Large legacy, actually."
The Uncanny Counter,I really liked Gossip Girl and been told the OC is just as good
The Uncanny Counter,"Soap operas are often ridiculous and ciclycal, like a sitcom but with only some subplots being an actual comedy.

 The result of a six-months long murder subplot in soap operas are often the protagonists discovering pretty logical motives and means for a certain suspect to do it, only for the writer to make a completely different character the murderer for either reasons which nobody knew about or by the character suddenly shifting its personality from ""can't a harm a fly"" to ""cold and calculated"".

In other words, which was flickering the lights? Nosferatu."
The Uncanny Counter,That you always meant weeeelllll...
The Uncanny Counter,"It's so fun to say! 

Where's yogalates in AD? I don't remember that."
The Uncanny Counter,"I‚Äôve watched it more than 3 times, might give it another watch soon. Love the show."
The Uncanny Counter,I just did my third rewatch. Fantastic show for it's time.
The Uncanny Counter,"I'm genuinely about to rewatch it for the second time, so no. Smart-arse."
The Uncanny Counter,"I'm afraid I prematurely 'blue' my load on what was supposed to be a dry run, so to speak."
The Uncanny Counter,Ryan and Seth are sibling goals. My absolute favorite thing about the oc is the parents actually having their own stories.
The Uncanny Counter,"As an Everwood fan, I feel compelled to point out that it precedes the O.C. in Pratt's filmography."
The Uncanny Counter,"The OC is fantastic and I highly recommend it. Pretty much the only part that I don't like are the Oliver episodes in season one, but the rest are great. And the music is so good!"
The Uncanny Counter,"its great it starts off maybe a bit slow but a couple of episodes in its awesome, i loved gossip girl as well"
The Uncanny Counter,Wellofcourseyou diiiiiiiidddd...
The Uncanny Counter,Pretty sure Lindsey goes to cardio bar.
The Uncanny Counter,Did that not too long ago.. the show holds up and is maybe even better than I remembered!
The Uncanny Counter,Yeah I also suggest one tree hill after OC they are classics in my opinion
The Uncanny Counter,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmd1qMN5Yo0
The Uncanny Counter,Also Lindsey is kirstens half sister!
The Uncanny Counter,"I watched this on AMC+ and I agree. It was a beautiful show, if a little bleak. Too bad there hasn't been much talk about it, maybe due it being in Italian I guess."

The Uncanny Counter,I'm really looking forward to watching this
The Uncanny Counter,"I would like to recommend this series. A book adaptation published in 2015. A flu epidemic begins in 2020 and all adults die. The virus is in everyone and starts to activate when person reaches reproductive maturity and after a while it kills you. the dead is dead, lots of possibilities for those who survived? it's not the case this time and this makes the show even more depressing.

we start watching this story 4 years later with an ordinary day and watch a short section from the life of two little ones where their routines are disrupted. a few characters are added to their lives, all of them represent very well, how this world can affect children with different characters and what it can turn them into. Chapters 3 and 4, which contain examples of this, frankly disturbed me a lot.

..................spoiler ahead..................

especially angelica was a very chaotic character, watching her past made feel even worse. it represented how cruel children can be when there is no guide or authority. Although there is no such epidemic, it also showed that children in this capacity exist in our world. I was so sure that the scene where angelica and her friends play masterchef was post-pandemic that it gave me chills to see that mind existed when everything was normal. No wonder this psychopath evolved into something like that in the future.

.................spoiler ended......................

For those who want to watch it, first of all, it's a slowburn series, but it's not boring. Since the characters are children, they are not revolutionary with the dialogues, yet still captivating, it does not make you wanna pass forward. It is clear where the story will go, from the very beginning, but it still makes you wonder. it felt so real.  
  
they effectively used flashbacks. they completed each character very well with past scenes. The cinematography and music are amazing. It is shot in a reality that does not hesitate to make the viewer feel uncomfortable. In some scenes, I said how did they shoot these scenes with these kids. There were scenes that make my eyes teary in the last two episodes.  
  
It ended in a good spot. some got confused in the last scene, but I think the voice-over monologue that starts right before the scene is descriptive enough for the scene.

finale spoiler ----------------

What distinguishes human beings from all other animals is the ability to ""imagine"" and tell ""stories"". Because it's ""only through stories"" that ""nothing ever really dies"". Unbelievable things can happen, the chaos of the world can find a meaning. And what seemed the end of everything, may turn out to be an extraordinary, new beginning.

in stories you can hope for a better world and keep believing and dreaming. but this is not a story. this is life. and if there is a cure, they are not the one who will find it. this is global pandemic, its in the air and in everbodys blood. there is not some miracle family out there. if there is, then they just killed them by meeting them.  but there isnt. its their hopeful dream. anna almost adolescent and astor my poor baby. :( all alone on that ship. :("
The Uncanny Counter,Great write-up. You should post this.
The Uncanny Counter,"im still not over its beauty and harshness. definitely gonna read the book. ordered it already. and thank you, i may post it later."
The Uncanny Counter,Holy shit I‚Äôm not reading all that
The Uncanny Counter,"I asked AI to provide a TL:DR for this, and the result was:  


The show The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power is poorly written, unrelated to the source material, and has unengaging characters. The plot relies on coincidences and gimmicks, and it seems as though set pieces are driving the plot and characters rather than the other way around. The show appears to have been written by an algorithm that analyzed popular elements in fantasy shows and movies and created a show based on that data. The sets and costumes are repetitive and small, and the CGI is not impressive. The actors are unknown and the showrunners have no experience. It is suggested that the show may have been a failed experiment in using an algorithm to write the plot based on data from Amazon's content, as part of a long-term strategy to create shows that people will pay to see."
The Uncanny Counter,No but it‚Äôs probably written by a giant writer‚Äôs room that has rights to an IP without having rights to much source material and that had to develop a script around a show rather than the other way around. So it just kinda sucks.
The Uncanny Counter,This post is the definition of tldr.
The Uncanny Counter,I like to smoke weed too.
The Uncanny Counter,committee written scripts have had this problem long before AI was a thing.
The Uncanny Counter,"would be a good post for r/shittyfantheories

not gonna find much of an audience for it here"
The Uncanny Counter,This is dumb
The Uncanny Counter,"The show wasn't written by an AI, it was just written with the corporate approach to franchise building, which is about as close to AI generation as human writers can get."
The Uncanny Counter,This shitty post is ai
The Uncanny Counter,"I don't know why shitting on this show is some people's favorite past time. It's simply not that bad, it's just not good for the amount it cost. That's not how you review a show though? Im not grading them on the price they paid for their writers room vs their sfx budget. I'm grading them on the quality of the show. This is a world where the CW exists and you're one starring rings of power. Get over yourself. The show has *some* fantastic acting and is beautiful to look at. If you don't like it cause it's boring or disjointed or the main character isn't doing it for you. Fine, but seriously. It's not a terrible show. That review you say was deleted sounds like something a well-read person who didn't actually watch the show at all would post to review bomb them, so no surprise it was deleted.

Also, the show exists because Bezos and his kids love LotR. Terrible reason to spend a billion, but the main focus wasn't making money. If it was they could have spent that money on a marvel director and just said copy Disney.

Edit: also what the hell are you talking about RoP is made to formula? The pacing, plot, and journey wheel are weird as fuck. If anything it's made worse because it's not formulaic. They tried to balance it around the elements they wanted to focus on and made it wobbly as shit in the process."
The Uncanny Counter,"Is like stretching too much butter over too little bread, writ season large with a billion dollar price tag"
The Uncanny Counter,You wrote an entire dissertation to post online because you didn‚Äôt like a tv show
The Uncanny Counter,"Its not ( i hope ) - But you are not far from truth. And I am sure there is hard work on such AI as we speek.  


However,  I think they use the same process like Disney is doing of late.

They don't write a story in traditional sense, but film many versions of scenes. Than they show this to test audience, and whatever scene gets best reaction, is included.

Than this is returned to writing team and they have to stitch these scenes into a narrative.

&#x200B;

I know, it sounds nuts. And actually is. This is what creates these Frankenstein shows"
The Uncanny Counter,Maybe it was just written by humans who suck at writing.
The Uncanny Counter,Christ I hate reddit
The Uncanny Counter,"A nice opinion, but was this written by *Netflix AI* ??? Dun dun DUNNNN!!!"
The Uncanny Counter,"I never really had a problem with the show and liked it. I will say that I have watched all the movies, trilogy and prequels, also the animated stuff. I have never read any of Tolkien‚Äôs works, so I‚Äôm guessing that may be where my disconnect comes from concerning the problems with the show."
The Uncanny Counter,I ain‚Äôt readin all that. Happy for you though. Or sorry that happened
The Uncanny Counter,"The plots and writing were good for a couple of the storylines. Most notably Durin/Elrond and The Stranger/Harfoots stories. The Elf/Proto Orc story was decent till it wasn‚Äôt, but the Galadriel stuff was just bad. My thought is they had multiple writing teams for each storyline, which is they are so different in style and pace. Not AI but too many writers and not anyone doing quality control to keep them all equally engaging. As for the discrepancies in the lore, it‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt have the rights to anything. They‚Äôre just patching together bits and pieces that won‚Äôt get them sued."
The Uncanny Counter,"I was fully onboard with RoP right up until the episode where they went from scenes of traveling by sea, to full gallop, to fighting orcs, and victory in the span of 15 minutes.  It felt like someone punched me in the stomach then stood over me laughing.  I have no illusion that season two can right this, this is a core failure of production."
The Uncanny Counter,This is a kind of weird conspiracy theory I can get behind.
The Uncanny Counter,">the most emotionally intelligent show ever made, Better Call Saul.

With it wrapped up I've been watching it now.

Quite the impressive show!"
The Uncanny Counter,"To be perfectly honest, I believe you just offended AI‚Äôs."
The Uncanny Counter,"I‚Äôm going to have to agree with you. 

The show is mess, the characters they chose to include are a mix of bad choices (Galadriel sat out the Second Age for instance), odd additions to the story (creation of Mordor, proto-hobbits, etc) and a serious question about where the budget went. Like, the CGI shots of Numenor looked good. However, when they decide to finally field an army, the most powerful mortal force ever to be seen in Middle-Earth is a handful of soldiers on horseback. We‚Äôve seen much more impressive armies in lower budget shows at this point‚ÄîI expected something to at least rival GoT Battle of the Blackwater, but instead got a battle scene that could have been out of Xena Warrior Princess or one of the other 90s Sword and Sandal shoes. 

The only protagonist characters that were borderline interesting were Elrond and Durin, and they didn‚Äôt seem to have any actual purpose to their story in the end, except to provide a story for the MacGuffin mithril plot device, neither of which ultimately have anything to do with‚Äîother characters ultimately being included to finish that story. The only interesting character is the fallen elf that is trying to care for his orcs. 

But yeah, if you told me that Chat-GPT was fed the LotR appendixes and told to round out the script, I would totally believe it."
The Uncanny Counter,Curious what source material you‚Äôre speaking of‚Ä¶
The Uncanny Counter,GTFO with this shit
The Uncanny Counter,I don‚Äôt get it. I like the show.
The Uncanny Counter,Amazon wasn't allowed rights to the original works. They are working off of the encyclopedia.

LMAO plots relying on wild coincidence is nothing new. The original trilogy works the exact same way. Wild coincidence that Aragorn was at the Prancing Pony when the hobbits showed up, wild coincidence that the Rohirrim showed up to kill the orcs therefore saving Merry and Pippin."
The Uncanny Counter,"That's a lot of words to not really say a lot. As has been stated, it's based on a collection of ideas and timelines and (yes) locations in a book that's not really a novel. They are just filling stuff in and have to hit major points. If they took 3 seasons to build Mt Doom then people would also complain about that."

The Uncanny Counter,">It feels like it was written not by writers, but by an experimental machine-learning algorithm

Well, the showrunners are Mormons from northern Virginia, so... almost the same thing."
The Uncanny Counter,I said this exact thing to my brother halfway through the season. I really think it was.
The Uncanny Counter,"Interesting idea, horrible show. Makes sense to me!"
The Uncanny Counter,"The show is hella disappointing. I mean they could just have Sauron arrange the forging the rings, give them out, trick a different kingdom in each episode and focus on the people who knew better and tried to stop him."
The Uncanny Counter,"Great post, insane how people are so lazy to read. Your points especially in the first few paragraphs are spot on about the shows flaws. One of the worst things ive watched"
The Uncanny Counter,"I‚Äôve now finished Amazon Prime's The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power.

The show has many, many faults, but most of all I do not understand how it is so poorly written - devoid of logic; little if any discernible relationship with the source material; undeveloped, inconsistent, and unengaging characters.

The whole plot relies on wild coincidence, transparent mystery, and baffling gimmicks. Far from characters driving plot, and plot driving set pieces, it seems to be a case of set-pieces driving plot, which then drive the characters.

It feels like it was written not by writers, but by an experimental machine-learning algorithm that has conjured it having watched Jackson's movies, and most contemporary fantasy shows, then worked out what bits proved most popular on the internet, and fashioned a show from that. The thing actually looks fairly good, by the standards of fantasy shows, if you like gritty action-adventure.

So what went wrong?

Here's some bullet points on the plot.

It's all about halflings, which is a Great Big Fucking Mistake (Seriously, Tolkien, halflings). Halflings are like orcs. They're one half hobbit, one half, whatever. Orcs are short, nasty, and evil. Halflings are short, nasty, and dressed in a fashion that, from the high angle, looks like a cheap fan-art illustration. These both seem like a clear mistake, but it's not.

The whole thing follows a contrived, confusing plot: it is the (hilariously inane) story of the late Elrond finding out about his halflings, and getting revenge on his slob of a nephew Frodo, and rescuing up with a slightly less disgusting slob of a nephew Boromir. That's it. He finds out, he fights a battle against his halflings, he rescues his halflings. Done.

There's also his over-indulgent love interest, as well as his gollywog nephew and his loser son. And a completely unoriginal strain of Celtic mythology, which re-interprets everything as ""the hidden kingdom"". And a lot of stuff about a red mist over the heads of white people, who subsequently become completely insane.

The whole thing is just ludicrous, despite the relatively high production values. At one point, Frodo and Aragorn clash, but are both completely focused on The One Ring. I mean, really.

There are absolutely no moments of humour or pathos, which at least mean the actors can enjoy their acting.

And then there are so many stupid people in it."
The Uncanny Counter,It was written by people who saw lotr movies one time or something lol.
The Uncanny Counter,I love this take and I wouldn't be surprised if that were the case.
The Uncanny Counter,I liked it and disagree with ur reasons for disliking it.....soooo....am I AI?
The Uncanny Counter,"Wow I actually read this whole post congrats. Your analysis of ROP is quite accurate, and as someone who desperately hoped it would be good that hurts a lot. It's going to be forgotten so damn quickly."
The Uncanny Counter,"Thank you for taking the time to post this. I think it‚Äôs a very interesting theory and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this is the route the writers took. It‚Äôs shitty to see how many people are discrediting this post, simply because they are too lazy to read it."
The Uncanny Counter,What a miserable pile of wasted potential this show was.
The Uncanny Counter,"God there are some dogshit responses to this thread. You really want to take the time to comment on the length of OP‚Äôs post? It‚Äôs a fast read, and the time you took coming up with a pithy response could‚Äôve been spent, at the very least, skimming it and picking up a few arguments.

OP, I haven‚Äôt seen the show yet, but I‚Äôve had this same hunch for recent movies. The new Star Wars movies, for example. They‚Äôre written very strangely, and the respective scripts ignore some of the bedrock principles of creating a compelling story. 

I have a hard time believing that human beings would write what we saw, but I have a very easy time believing that it‚Äôs the end result of exhaustive internet-sweeping, data-crunching, software generation. 

I don‚Äôt think your opinion is crazy at all, and the people in this thread outright dismissing it haven‚Äôt been paying attention. Did you really think big data‚Äôs endgame was selling you jewelry and electronics?"
The Uncanny Counter,It's almost like the showrunners are talentless hacks who only got the job because they used to work with JJ Abrams.
The Uncanny Counter,That's an insult to the AI.
The Uncanny Counter,This is very rude.
The Uncanny Counter,I liked it
The Uncanny Counter,"This whole response was written by AI. RoP was fucking great. The hobbit plotline was sweet and fun and a great setup to the movies, the rings of power plotline had a great twist that I only saw coming near the end. The Southlands plotline was awesome and explains a main geographic piece of middle earth not yet explored that makes perfect sense. 

These haters are the same ones that say Andor was boring or whatever terrible takes they bring about Terminator 2 or whatever classics you're all too young or dumb to understand."
The Uncanny Counter,I loved Rings of Power.
The Uncanny Counter,Man people really have a hate boner for that show. Y‚Äôall weird as fuck
Space Brothers,"Roiland:

I didn't particularly think Season 5 was bad, but Season 6 is f\*cking amazing. It really is a f\*cking quality season.""

S6 premieres September 4th on Adult Swim"
Space Brothers,"The weird thing is my reaction was ‚ÄúI liked last season. It had some good episodes, like vat of acid, the train, ricks bathroom planet, the heist one‚Ä¶‚Äù oh those are all season 4 and I have no recollection of s5 despite having watched it for sure."
Space Brothers,There‚Äôs only one solution for earths pollution!!!!
Space Brothers,"Season 5 was okay, it had its moments, wasn‚Äôt as bad as guys on here always make it seem like it was dogshit and unwatchable, it was probably the weakest season but was still worth watching"
Space Brothers,It just seemed like the stories were just convenient filler around action/montage scenes.
Space Brothers,I understand why people hated the incest baby episode but I still thoroughly enjoyed it
Space Brothers,"I'm likely to enjoy it regardless. Not even guilty pleasure, I just like the show. It's nice that there's not so much time between seasons. Hope they do more with Evil Morty. Unless that last bit was it, but who knows."
Space Brothers,[deleted]
Space Brothers,Plot Twist: They‚Äôre all episodes to do with the incest baby.
Space Brothers,"I mentioned this was when season 3 was first airing and feeling not-as-good as the previous two seasons, but season 1 and 2 of a show being *incredible* followed by gradually more convoluted and lazy/parodic writing is a trajectory that Dan Harmon's work has had since his days doing web series for Channel 101. If you watch his series from there 'Water & Power' it did the exact same thing all of his TV shows have done -- started off with a clever premise well-executed but which gradually becomes utterly bizarre and haphazard and just not good.

I personally think Dan just gets bored after awhile, or can't help but over-think his work to death."
Space Brothers,I thought season 5 was funny as fuck
Space Brothers,"Honestly after season four, especially the train episode where they poked fun at how ridiculous the canon stuff was, I really started just liking the episodes that weren‚Äôt really connected. It definitely feels like the canon stuff is forced sometimes, but season five was also just a bunch of decent but forgettable episodes. Not terrible but just like whatever"
Space Brothers,"Shows don't have to get bigger and dumber, the first 2 seasons were so good... and the other seasons are alright too but they drip of try-hard."
Space Brothers,Season 5 was just really really out there as far ideas go when the US army was fighting back wave after wave Mortys sperm monster to stop them reaching his sisters giant egg to avoid the creation of a giant incest baby I had to turn to my mate and admit that I don‚Äôt think my IQ is high enough to get Rick and Morty anymore.
Space Brothers,"Hot take: Justin is what made those early seasons of Rick and Morty work compared to Dan. 

While I think Dan does amazing work, you can tell when his concept of the ‚Äústory circle‚Äù and meta commentary gets way to up in its own ass. Rick and Morty is best when it is just light hearted wacky adventures with some fun sci fi troupes mixed in.

Solar Opposites has been a prime example of this and just from interviews Justin has seemed way more passionate and involved in writing process"
Space Brothers,I'm completely happy with Season 5. Is every show or season going to be the *best one ever?* No. As a whole it's a fantastic show.
Space Brothers,Season 5 was all sex jokes. There are other funny things to write about. It was just sort of one-note for me. Seasons 1 and 2 were the best.
Space Brothers,"I thought its been very mediocre since S3E2, with a few outliers like the Citadel one. 

Season 4 and 5 are both forgettable compared to Seasons 1 & 2."
Space Brothers,"We can just call it a ""gas leak year"" and move on?"
Space Brothers,Season 5 had its moments. Every time I think of Bruce Chutpants I get a good chuckle.
Space Brothers,Mr Nimbus and the Morty getting wine and battling and entire civilization episode was without a doubt the best written episode of Rick and Morty. Hilariously funny and so detailed and layered that it dominated that season and they could never top it.
Space Brothers,I'm starting to like Solar Opposites more than Rick and Morty.
Space Brothers,"Incest space baby was pretty bad but the rest of the season was ok, and they really stuck the landing with the evil Morty subplot"
Space Brothers,That's what they all say
Space Brothers,Rick and morty has just been weird since season 2. I honestly don‚Äôt know what overall happened to the show. Even the hype is somewhat dead. The long hiatus‚Äôs didn‚Äôt help it. I didn‚Äôt even hear about season 5 that much when it was coming out. There‚Äôs still a few golden episodes but I‚Äôm not calling it one of the best things on tv anymore.
Space Brothers,I‚Äôm glad to hear this because I am a big fan of the show but season 5 completely lost me and I never ended up finishing the season. I‚Äôve never just given up on a show that I loved like that before lol I‚Äôll definitely go back and finish before the S6 premiere knowing this
Space Brothers,Forgive me but hasn‚Äôt every season been a weird one? And I mean that with all the love in the world.
Space Brothers,"Good, I want to have fun, classic Rick and Morty adventures."
Space Brothers,"I thought season 5 was fine, honestly. My main hope going forward is that someone tells the writing team that you can only make so many ""joke"" references to incest before it starts becoming obvious that someone on the staff is indulging a kink."
Space Brothers,When 2025?
Space Brothers,I rewatched the season and enjoyed it way more than the first time
Space Brothers,The Vindicators 2 shorts give me hope for this season.
Space Brothers,I honestly thought the finale last year was their way of being done with canon. I know Dan Harmons not big on it and they basically just tied up all the loose ends with evil Morty and the citadel of Ricks. I figured it was nothing but random wacky adventures from this point on.
Space Brothers,I did not even watch s5 yet... Are there good places to watch it from Canada
Space Brothers,"I thought Season 5 had some of the best episodes of the series.  We got the Mr. Nimbus episode, Planetina episode, the big story reveal montage episode, and TWO CROWS!  Sure there were some low ones in there, but I wouldn‚Äôt dismiss the season as bad."
Space Brothers,"So I'm guessing season 6 will be on par with season 4 at the worst? I mean there's no harm in taking a break if the death of a person has affected you this much.

If he agrees that season 5 wasn't that good, maybe hopefully they will come out and say it was non-canon? Because that's what it felt like to me. The way that they retconned things and made episodes that had no substance yet pretended to be serious like the fake breakup and rickternal friendshine episodes made it feel like that they were just some silly bits."
Space Brothers,"Is justain even present in the writing room anymore? I was under the impression he only really does voices now.
Sad to hear about the death, I didn't know.
Either way lookin forward to the new season I'm a big fan of roiland so if he thinks it's awesome then that gets me exited."
Space Brothers,"and by weird, he means simply awful. like, not funny at all, and all the subtle character development exchanged for endless wordplay i can honestly hardly follow."
Space Brothers,Season 5 was the worst season so far. Hopefully they rebound in season 6.
Space Brothers,"Validates my thoughts that S5 was messy. It was like the writer's knew what the show was about, but not what made it good. Some of the fanboys will swear there was nothing wrong and people just wanted to complain."
Space Brothers,"I don't like Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon because they won't stand by their decision on what this show even is. They want to make fun of the concept of syndication while being a syndicated show at the same time. Like, pick a lane you fucking hacks. I'd respect you more if you flat out said ""this show has a canon story and you have to watch in order to follow it"" or if you said ""this is just a random stupid fun times show with no stakes"" but trying to do both is dumb and annoying."
Space Brothers,"I don't get the season 5 hate, I thought it was a return to what made the show great. Season 4 was the bad one for me, the train episode, the dragon porn episode, all that self-referential meta bullshit, etc etc"
Space Brothers,This show has been garbage since the middle of the third season.
Space Brothers,"Season 4 and 5 were almost completely dogshit. Dragon orgies and giant incest babies? Like come on. Wasn't even funny just uncomfortable, and I have pretty dark humor."
Space Brothers,I thought they parted ways
Space Brothers,"I kinda felt like s5 was a little awkward for some reason, I did like it but I definitely felt something off and I thought it was jus me"
Space Brothers,"IDK, season 4 was really bland for the most part.  Didn't even watch season 5 yet, maybe I should binge this weekend."
Space Brothers,Do a house of cosbys cross over event.
Space Brothers,Season 5 was soo bad.
Space Brothers,That's exactly what I want to hear!  ..so I don't trust it..
Space Brothers,I thought it was great. The vat of acid episode is in my top 3.
Space Brothers,"5 was weird, but I just rewatched and it's great. Mr Nimbus is fucking incredible."
Space Brothers,#I.... Am Mr Nimbus!
Space Brothers,"Give the people what they want, Give us Mr. Poopybutthole in season 6."
Space Brothers,‚ÄöA weird one‚Äò ü§£it was shit
Space Brothers,season 4 and 5 were whack
Space Brothers,I liked season 5. Idk what everyone‚Äôs deal was.
Space Brothers,Season 5 was better than Season 4.
Space Brothers,Am I crazy? I loved season 5. I thought it was one of the most creative and enjoyable seasons of television I‚Äôve ever seen.
Space Brothers,When I saw the sperm episode it was probably the hardest I laughed in a long time.
Space Brothers,Too bad you can‚Äôt watch it anywhere
Space Brothers,"Season 5 was good, now season 4 was ass."
Space Brothers,Too little too late. Undid 4 seasons of work with super bad dialogue and writing.
Space Brothers,Last season was cringe. Every episode was try hard poop jokes or some weird shit.
Space Brothers,Season 5 was terrible.
Space Brothers,"Even for Rick & Morty standards, season 5 was pretty weird, and not in a good way. Easily the weakest season so far in my opinion. Kinda glad to see that even the creators realize this."
Space Brothers,"I'll be honest, I've been pretty cringed off the show since season 4. Seasons 2 and 3 had really good episodes but even then had some cringe episodes. They just got way more cringe as it went on."
Space Brothers,I couldn't even finish one episode of this trash.
Space Brothers,"I haven't watched since S3, is it worth it to catch up?"
Space Brothers,"They should have let Dan go after season 3 because season 5 wasn‚Äôt the problem, season 4 was the problem.

Listening to the commentaries of season 3, you can clearly hear that Dan is trying to force the show to be less continuous, and is just gushing at the idea of not having to write anything meaningful and instead just let the animators draw cool shit.

And what did we get for 4?  Just the same re-hashed tropes about Jessica but now with fucked up animations and you-really-have-to-suspend-your-disbelief-that-there-shouldn‚Äôt-be-any-consequences-after-this-one scenarios because it‚Äôs the rule of cool from now on.

Justin having been on Adventure time should have known how to balance weirdness with meaningful continuity, and should have pushed back on Dan making everything just meaningless.

So promises on season 6 based on season 5 are completely meaningless and just shows me they have no idea where they got lost."
Space Brothers,Literally every episode of Rick and Morty is a weird one. Can't wait for season 6
Space Brothers,"I stopped watching when I realized the show would never end. I‚Äôm a big fan of shows with over arcing plots but after season 4, I decided that this show would probably never get the resolution I am looking for."
Space Brothers,Person who works on the show and wants the show to be successful talks up show would be my usual view on this sort of message but I believe him.
Space Brothers,"Well of course he's going to say this, would you say anything to criticize your own work before it's out?"
Space Brothers,cant wait for that in.... 2026?
Space Brothers,I mean is anyone expecting him to say his upcoming work is crap?
Space Brothers,"9 years and we're just getting the 6th season... yeah fuck off. Dwindling fan base due to shit cooperation. Move on and let RNM sink, focus on solar opposites since it's good. Keep the wall interesting but not the focus of the show.  Harmon keeps talking about the new shows, reboots, etc, but who cares!? Make the show you're supposed to be making! People, stop caving to this shit, just because we're the consumer doesn't mean we can't bitch."
Space Brothers,Season 4 with the god damn train metaphor episode was so fucking pretentious.
Space Brothers,We can all agree the sperm baby was the worst episode but what about the stupid Thanksgiving episode. Bruh‚Ä¶thought they solved their presidential disagreement season 3 episode 10. Turning into a Turkey to get a Presidential Pardon is dumb af.
Space Brothers,TIL this show is still on. I loved season 1 and 2 but quickly lost interest after that.
Space Brothers,"Season 5 gets way too much shit.

It starts and ends very strongly, some of the best episodes of the entire show. The first two and final three episodes are all great. The middle of it can be a bit hit or miss but there's still fun to be had in them and none are outright *bad*.

Anyway, looking forward to season 6."
Space Brothers,I faded out after 2 seasons. Should I keep going?
Space Brothers,"At least he acknowledges it. Solar Opposites S1 and 2 were far better than season 5, can't say the same about season 3 though. Can't really blame him though massive drop in writing quality it's a by-product of getting your show renewed until season 10. Same exact thing is happening to South Park, worse even since the movies deal."
Space Brothers,"I liked 5 a lot, 4 was BAD though"
Space Brothers,I liked 5 more than 4. It felt more ‚ÄúSchrabby‚Äù.
Space Brothers,"Yeah the entire season 5 I was expected for a twist that would explain why everything was so bad. Hopefully this will come in season 6 then.
 
I started worrying this had to do with Harmon taking a step back, we all saw what happened to Community when they tried to get rid of him. He might be an asshole, but he's the heart of those shows."
Space Brothers,I jumped ship at the first 10 minutes of season 5. They truly ruined such a once great tv show with their sick agendas.
Space Brothers,"I honestly feel like season five was great, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a single season I can point out that‚Äôs worse than the rest. I like story developing but filler episodes always seem to have cooler storylines and better jokes."
Space Brothers,"I never care, keep 'em coming! I love this show because it isn't predictable or cookie-cutter like most shows."
Space Brothers,I enjoyed watching S5 so I'm pretty hyped for S6!
Space Brothers,"Dan Harmon said somewhere‚Ä¶maybe his podcast‚Ä¶anyways, he said that once they signed the 8 season contract with adult swim, he could finally just treat this as a 9 to 5 job or whatever, a more regular thing and he wasn‚Äôt going to kill himself or his staff by overworking them in attempt to make amazing tv. That he would not do what they did for the early seasons. And he joked about the apparent quality change. So, while I will still happily watch and not be overly critical, I am curious to see if the show regains some of its early season magic. And besides all of that, sometimes shows exhaust some of the things that initially made audiences love them so much."
Space Brothers,"That really sucks, I lost interest and wish I had the effort to jump back in but they lost my attention. It was a great run."
Space Brothers,"I've been pretty happy with Rick and Morty. Loved Season 3, can't really complain about the others. Glad Season 6 is looking solid."
Space Brothers,To be fair‚Ä¶
Space Brothers,I'm glad this is acknowledged. I can't wait for season 6.
Space Brothers,I hope so cuz I totally lost interest in the show
Space Brothers,"It should have just ended like so many other American series (I'm looking at you Lost et al)  
So much greed only to keep pumping out, at best, mediocrity. The last season I stopped watching it was so bad."
Space Brothers,"I barely slogged through season 4, never watched season 5, the show lost everything that made it enjoyable imo"
Space Brothers,"Everyone is so damn critical. Just enjoy the god damn show. It is finally Al something creatively different. Check out solar opposites on Hulu too. People today are the reasons shows get cancelled so early. ‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm not going to jizz my pants with laughter every episode? Guess I‚Äôm out.‚Äù JFC chill the fuck out."
Space Brothers,I hated season 5 and felt it was dreadful. Sorry they lost their producer and friend tho
Tower of God,">HBO Max Adds Death Note, ~~Hunter x Hunter~~Hiatus X Hiatus, Food Wars!, Tower of God Anime

Ftfy :P"
Tower of God,Are they going to have all of HxH or just stop at seemingly random points like Netflix and Hulu?
Tower of God,"Is Tower of God any good?

Edit: well I‚Äôm definitely going to watch it now"
Tower of God,"I love that a ton of shows are getting more exposure left and right, but you're doing fans a dis-service by constantly cutting the episodes half way through the entire show.

I know it has to do with streaming/dub rights, and it isn't their fault, but Netflix has Hunter x Hunter up to episode 80. HBO has the show up to episode 99. Netflix doesn't even have the entire One Piece dub up-to-par, and are advertising it like crazy. It literally encourages fans to find it through illegal means on the internet to finish the show, and that usually means fans stick to that website they found the show on to watch other shows, and they eventually un-subscribe."
Tower of God,"I watched HxH on HBO max last week and they only had up to episode 99 and that seems to still be the case.

Right in the middle of Chimera Ant arc so yay"
Tower of God,Where‚Äôs Cory in the House?
Tower of God,"Never watched any, but Food Wars ( which... is an anime about cooking ) has probably the most banging anime theme I've ever heard.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jThJGRbFbI"
Tower of God,will this give Togashi the drive to continue hunter x hunter? :(
Tower of God,"""adds"" deathnote  wow netflix lost a good show lol"
Tower of God,"Tried giving Hunter x Hunter a go this weekend but couldn‚Äôt get past the pedophile, Joker rip-off of a villain. 

Not really interested in a grown man beating the shit out of a little boy while seemingly getting aroused doing it."
Tower of God,Maybe one day we‚Äôll see the Dark Continent üòë
Tower of God,"That's often the issue with along anime. Short show with one or two seasons, no problems. 100+ episode shows, you're probably better off raisin' yer flag, me hearty."
Tower of God,"Think that has to do with dub licensing, I think CartoonNetwork/AdultSwim had an exclusive for a while. Even though the show ended in 2014, the dub only finished airing in 2019. 

HBO Max does stop at a random point, 99 episodes in."
Tower of God,It stop episode 99 and they don't have in sub. They only have it in Dub.
Tower of God,Oh no I'm watching it on Netflix now
Tower of God,It's really good so far. I'd say the weakest element is the MC but the supporting cast is really fantastic
Tower of God,I just started watching it a few days ago and binged quite a few episodes. Love it.
Tower of God,The worst part about it is that it isnt longer.
Tower of God,"It's a really poor adaption of the source.  

Best analogy I can give you:

Think of the source webtoon as a Harry Potter novel.  

The anime adaptation is the equivalent of turning that Harry Potter novel into a 20 page children's picture book, where they decided to cut out and dumb-down all the mechanics and intricacies of the world because they don't think their new target audience can handle it.  

There's actually a really good comparable in the show with Harry Potter's world.  In Harry Potter, their world revolves around magic, it's used to fight, as well as many other things.  Millions of different and unique spells!  Tower of God has something very similar, except the anime adaptors decided they would dumb it down, so their jobs animating would be easier. 

Imagine Harry Potter, except magic is now only 1 or 2 spells and EVERYONE only uses those spells .  Now imagine they try to tell the same Harry Potter story, all the plot points are roughly the same, just a complete absence and wonder of magic which is the core of the series.  Now imagine doing that in 15 pages.  

Yeah, I'm not a fan of the adaptation after having read the webtoon.  It hurts me when new fans start with the anime.  It's like, I tell you the show ""FRIENDS"" is great, but your first experience with it is in a foreign country where all the actors are dubbed over with voiceovers of the native tongue, with their own interpretations of the original dialogue.  You come back and tell me you saw it and it was alright.  But you didn't really ""see"" ""FRIENDS"".  Not really the same, but I've gone so far off track that this is a good stopping point as any. 

Read the webtoon instead!"
Tower of God,Yes it is. Reccomend the manga as well!
Tower of God,Yes!
Tower of God,"As others have said it is a good show. Yet, the first and second episodes are the weakest. The show throws you into this world and you (and the main character) are left to piece things together. The show gets significantly better with each episode until a great end to the session. Give it three episodes and you will know if you are into it."
Tower of God,"I'm really been liking it and I'm the sort to like series that leave you with more questions than answers and tie up a lot of the intrigue of the season with a spectacular finale.  A lot of people have taken to comparing it to certain exam/tournament arcs from other animes, but I feel like that hardly scrapes the surface of what is going on in Tower of God.  I'm fascinated by a lot of what has gone unsaid so far.  What are the worlds that these characters are from like?  What is the ultimate purpose of sending people up the tower even if the reward is a wish akin to godhood?"
Tower of God,The first season is basically the prologue afterwards but it gets pretty great after
Tower of God,"IMO, the first episode is boring af, i didn't want to continue, the artsyle, the story, character, pacing, music... it's... generic

but then i force myself to watch more, and by the 3rd episode, i love it, i literally finished the whole season in 1 day,"
Tower of God,It's weird. It's definitely worth the watch for that weirdness.
Tower of God,Fans can see the rest of One Piece on other services like Funimation and Crunchyroll that is legal. I know that Hulu has One Piece around episode 700ish in sub only.
Tower of God,Time to raise the jolly Roger!
Tower of God,"Netflix still has it, same with Hulu and Tubi (Tubi is sub only)."
Tower of God,Hopefully Togashi overcomes his health problems.
Tower of God,"Only an issue on non-anime platforms. Get Crunchyroll. All of HxH and One Piece.

It doesn't have everything but it's got a lot. I'd like to say a majority but I really don't know how much anime is out there."
Tower of God,Just imagine if comics followed the same model. I could see another 50s level of moral panic when parents discover what is Identity Crisis and what happens there if it was adapted in television two years after being published.
Tower of God,Netflix is unreliable with a lot of the anime they have. They just got One Piece and I know they aren't going to try to get all of those episodes.
Tower of God,It stops at tthe end of an arc. You're good to continue.
Tower of God,Bam just seems like a blank slate.  How exactly did Bam and Rachel survive in their world?  Why was it a hardship that they endured together?
Tower of God,I would recommend reading the webtoon its free
Tower of God,"the webtoon has several hundred chapters

Free online"
Tower of God,"> The show throws you into this world and you (and the main character) are left to piece things together.

A.k.a. It doesn't talk down to the audience.

For a similar style, you could check out <see username>."
Tower of God,"read the webtoon

its free online"
Tower of God,"Well the Dub went on hiatus for a long time at 574, I think that just released another 12 episodes in 2020. But it's nowhere near the 935 episodes that are subtitled."
Tower of God,"Honestly part of me kind of hopes the guy just hangs it up and finds a happy retirement. He obviously feels a deep desire for it to be finished one day but I think he's agonized both mentally and physically over his work to a degree that doesn't feel right. Some of it was pushed on him, some of it was probably done out of a sense of obligation. Its too bad because he seems like a really thoughtful guy."
Tower of God,Wasn't that reason why Yu Yu Hakasho ended that way. It was in the 90s. He still has health problems.
Tower of God,That stinks. Guess I'll start watching on something else
Tower of God,Well bam lives in a cave with no interaction with anyone else besides Rachel.
Tower of God,"Alternatively, swallow his pride and partner up with an artist to draw for him while he still writes and does character design. Get a ONE/Murata thing going on."
Tower of God,"> Honestly part of me kind of hopes the guy just hangs it up and finds a happy retirement.

The rumor is that his wife has started to help him on hunter x hunter   his wife is most famous for sailor moon"
Tower of God,Partly. Their are also stories of his editor literally locking him in a room and forcing him to draw to meet his deadlines.
Tower of God,"tbh, the animation quality and pacing falls off hard after the arcs they already have on there. I'd say if you're interested in the series, watch up through the end of where netflix goes to, and read the manga from there if you're into it."
Tower of God,I think he gets his wife to help him which considering she created sailor moon is a pretty good substitute.
Tower of God,You can tell she's a major contributor to the art. The linework has gotten consistently smoother and neater over the years. Togashi always had a more scribbly texture to his lines. I think the end of the chimera ant arch was 100% him though. You can feel the pain in every mark.
Tower of God,Up until they said Korea I had no idea which systemic religious sex crimes they were going to expose. Keep 'em comin'!
Tower of God,"10 years for three rapes, release, and subsequent rape..."
Tower of God,Thought this was going to be about the moonies.
Tower of God,"Aside from the documentary, I‚Äôd love to see what Netflix attorneys filed to nullify the injunction. 

Could you imagine the things that were submitted during the discovery period?  That‚Äôs a documentary all to itself."
Tower of God,"I‚Äôm not sensitive at all, I eat up horror and documentaries about uncomfortable topics, but this one is very brutally straight forward.

Like, there‚Äôs no sleepy drone footage of the protagonists hometown accompanied by slightly tense piano music to slowly set the mood, the first episode is an interview of one of his victims crying and describing being raped.

I think it speaks to how important the producer felt telling the story was and how much built up energy and oppression JMS created over the past few decades."
Tower of God,There are korean christian cults all over southern california. There are kids who are indoctrinated in these systems even to this day. I wish these churches get exposed for what they do.
Tower of God,Blows my mind what some people can get others to do for them using religion.
Tower of God,I grew up in a korean cult. Not a sex cult for the followers but I suspect the higher ups did whatever the fuck they wanted including marrying a 16 year old when the leader was 40.
Tower of God,"A kpop idol had to release a statement through his company about his family‚Äôs involvement so this is bringing a big wave in Korea. And that same cafe that was ran, JMS, is apparently off the map in Naver, Korea‚Äôs search engine. Creepy stuff."
Tower of God,"OMG!!! I‚Äôm actually shaking right now. I went to this church back in 2013 when my brother and sister in law dragged me to go. It was a branch in Tustin, California. They were suuupes wild."
Tower of God,"We watched the first two episodes last night.  Way jacked up.  

It‚Äôs the same playbook used by pedos throughout the ages.  

One more ‚Äúman of God‚Äù using the scriptures to literally screw children."
Tower of God,"I tried to watch it but for some reason they decided to use ""interpreters"" rather than just having it subtitled and it sounds like a bad dub."
Tower of God,Man the idea to get an injunction really backfired because now I want to know what they‚Äôre trying to hide.
Tower of God,Cultist leaders abusing power.  Religion in a nutshell.
Tower of God,Is there a particular reason why South Korea has so many weird religious cults?
Tower of God,"""I've been involved in a number of cults both as a leader and a follower. You have more fun as a follower but you make more money as a leader."" - Creed Bratton."
Tower of God,Korea needs to reject Christianity. They were brutally colonized by missionaries.
Tower of God,Started this without even really paying attention to what I was selecting have some noise as I fell asleep. My eyes are closed and then wide open as some of the first shit you hear had me ready to vomit and murder someone at the same time.
Tower of God,"Holy betrayal, Batman!"
Tower of God,Reverend Moon?
Tower of God,"and that is why i dislike religion so much. because the people that are in religions are mostly weak minded people and they are easy prey for the ones in power.

also for any rape victim. i ask you this. would you feel more safe when the rapist is dead, or still alive and knowing he will eventually come out of jail?"
Tower of God,Is this a good documentary? I added it to my list because I've never watched a documentary in another language and I watched so many KDramas.
Tower of God,Cool now do the Catholics of America
Tower of God,The only thing crazier than Korean Catholicism is American evangelism.
Tower of God,"I tried to watch this documentary, but to me they also used the victims to sell their documentary.  The doc used full footage of the victims naked and did not blur out an parts. It just felt like re-taking advantage of women that were brain washed and cult abused. I had to end it."
Tower of God,Religious people be like: ‚Äúcome to our church so we can molest u‚Äù
Tower of God,Do jehovah's witnesses next
Tower of God,IMHO I can‚Äôt wait for all organized religion to die‚Ä¶. The harm it‚Äôs caused far outweighs any good.
Tower of God,Don't have religion where you idolize the leaders. Having religion could even apply to those who claim to believe in science. The scientific methodology is one where you test to determine if a hypothesis is false or not false. Because it isn't false doesn't make it true. Science is akin to forever chipping away at a slab of marble to determine the sculpture underneath. True science can only determine correlation and not causality. Statements of absolute causality are not statements of science but of religion.
Tower of God,Why are Koreans so prone to cults?? I can kindda see why the Chinese government ban religious cults the likes of falungong from arising.
Tower of God,Will this involves the moonies?
Tower of God,Every single religion has coverups rarely do they self report!
Tower of God,All religions are a sex and money scam. Every single one.
Tower of God,Anywhere else to watch it? Canceled Netflix due to the new password restrictions
Tower of God,"Cool.

Now do Evangelicals in the US.

EDIT: To be clear, I think this is a great documentary and I'm glad they won the right to air it.  I'm saying I'd like to see this trend of exposing gross religious organizations by documentaries funded and platformed by major media companies continue on."
Tower of God,Unrelated to the film itself but I wish it had either been titled *In the Name of God* or *A Holy Betrayal*.
Tower of God,Man Koreans are not gonna like this one lmao
Tower of God,how about a documentary on american religious leaders?
Tower of God,If any of those guys are gay they are probably only into white guys
Tower of God,"How about sticking it to Scientology? Or the fundamentalist Mormons, et al. I don‚Äôt care about some ‚Äúleaders‚Äù in Korea. Go after the predators at home and I might be impressed."
Tower of God,Netflix sucks haha
Tower of God,[removed]
Tower of God,"Good news, for sure, though I started watching this earlier this week and the production struck me as super odd. Might be a cultural thing, but the set design and editing is incongruous given the subject matter. 

Disclaimer: I only watched the first 15 mins of the opening episode."
Tower of God,"Religion doing what religion does.  But people want to be lied to, so on it goes."
Tower of God,The world is really fucked up.
Tower of God,">3rd March

btw"
Tower of God,"Yep. Was part of this cult before here in one their American branch and knew they we‚Äôre sketch since the beginning. Definitely members would manipulate to ‚Äúevangelize‚Äù people. It‚Äôs flat out sad how many people are brainwashed and devoted to this cult and the leader. Insiders think that the media is just persecuting him and acting as a ‚Äúdevil‚Äù to bring down the ‚Äúwill of God‚Äù. His 10 years of imprisonment acts as Jesus dying on the cross to save us from our sins. His sermons are so boring and majority of the time, he just talks about himself."
Tower of God,"LPT: don't join cults, especially ones where the leader claims to be be God or claims to be speaking for God. Actually, just don't join any fucking cults."
Tower of God,"Oh some one sued to stop it. I wouldn't have watched it otherwise but now, straight on to the list."
Tower of God,Seriously though. Are there any NON religious sex cults?
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,">Let me tell you a dark, mysterious, and magical tale. The story of how an original idea becomes a multi-million dollar TV series that eventually got dumped in the garbage.

>The story of Carnival Row begins long before there were streaming wars fought over market share. In 2005, Travis Beachum, a recent college graduate, had his first spec script bought by New Line Cinema. The ‚Äúdark neo-noir fantasy thriller‚Äù called A Killing on Carnival Row soon grabbed the attention of directors like Guillermo del Toro and Neil Jordan. After years of development hell, Amazon Studios bought the script in 2015 and decided to turn it into a big-budget fantasy series.

>Amazon‚Äôs streaming catalog in 2015 was a strange place. Their first original drama series Bosch had just aired. The idea was spreading through Hollywood that this streaming thing Netflix pioneered might just be The Thing that propels TV production into the digital age. Netflix already had gritty, critically acclaimed Marvel shows, and House of Cards was getting nominated for Emmys every year. Netflix even blew $80 million dollars on the Wachowski sisters‚Äô insane sci-fi fever dream Sense8. Amazon needed something big. Something original.

>Carnival Row spent several years in development with Guillermo del Toro attached as a serious creative partner. He was going to produce, direct, and co-write the show alongside co-creator Rene Echeverria and Beachum. Del Toro and Beachum previously worked together on Pacific Rim, with Beachum being credited for the story and co-writing the screenplay. Thus, Carnival Row was set to be a huge original fantasy series, Amazon‚Äôs answer to Netflix‚Äôs big budgets and the new dark fantasy TV market that Game of Thrones opened up.

>But by 2017 del Toro was no longer attached in any form. The show eventually premiered in 2019, starring Cara Delevingne and Orlando Bloom. It received a mixed/poor response from critics. The series was bloated, bland, and not worth the investment in an age of Peak TV when 1000 great shows are competing for your attention.

>Carnival Row was always going to be a weird sell to audiences. Its neo-noir ‚Äústeampunk with fae folk‚Äù gimmick is a niche interest even in the fantasy community. But for those who love that genre, there‚Äôs a lot to love in Carnival Row. It has extensive world building, lots of political intrigue, and pretty bland characters you can project anything you want onto. If you‚Äôve ever wanted to see pixies fly around Victorian Streets or a satyr-esque creature read by candlelight in a three piece suit then you‚Äôre in luck.

First six paragraphs"
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"> The writers knew this season would be the last, there is a concrete conclusion, and yet Carnival Row is still spinning its wheels up until the last few minutes. The creators built themselves a huge sandbox, but they don‚Äôt seem interested in playing with any of the toys they threw in

I mean, they‚Äôre trying to bring everything to a conclusion. Not the time to play around, unfortunately. I liked season 1. When Amazon releases season 2 (in full) I‚Äôll finish it up.

Series aesthetic reminds of those fantasy shops that were ubiquitous before LOTR: Enya on a CD player, no licensed merchandise, just fairies, frog statues, tarot cards, and reflective sphere bird baths, with a kind and vaguely stoned old hippie smiling behind the counter."
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"Good show. Unique and entertaining but COVID killed the show. Such a long break due to COVID that many have lost interest. I had trouble remembering what happened during Season 1 from three years ago, even with the recap."
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"This show isn't very good and yet I find it pretty watchable

The themes it deals with are worthwhile at any rate."
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"Part 2 of the nevers just released too, with a similar fate"
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"Travis Beacham, how much suffering can one screenwriter endure? I forgot his other show Hieroglyph had an unceremonious end, that he wasn‚Äôt back for Clash of the Titans 2 or Pacific Rim 2, then walked off his own show Carnival Row which went from deltoro to delevinge, plus his AMC show went nowhere, I hope he finds some success"
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,Let's just scoop up the remainder of that budget and spread it evenly over Wheel of Time...maybe take the leftover drippings and drizzle them over a new adult animation in the works?
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,Amazing how every fantasy show has basically failed besides GoT this last decade
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"I enjoy the show even if it's not quite good. It was just nice to see something wonderful and unusual. It doesn't talk down to its audience either which helps. A lot of genre stuff right now - they bring in novice writers who are more activist than writer and you get a terrible polemic and then when you voice your discontent are called horrible things.

The show deals with racism and colonization themes in a decent manner."
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"It's not a great show, but it's enjoyable. Moreso than Rings of Power and Wheel of Time, by a long shot"
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,Cara has cool looking eyes though
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,[deleted]
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"So I guess we can add this to the list of things that Guillermo del Torro was initially attached to and dropped that would have been interesting to see his vision for. Bummer.

His departures often seem related to conflicts over creative decisions too. You‚Äôd think executives would be confident in his abilities by now and just let him do his thing."
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"Bland and like everything out there or niche and only appealing to a small audience, you kind of have to pick a lane.









Anyways, it's worth watching for how they bring the world to life alone. It's so lived in, the costume design is fantastic, and it feels like there is little pieces of lore in every frame."
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"I agree with this assessment. 

- What I wanted: A world where humans merged with the magical realm to create a steam punk world.
- What I go: A Victorian drama about politics with a subplot of flying people who are slaves."
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,">Series aesthetic reminds of those fantasy shops that were ubiquitous before LOTR: Enya on a CD player, no licensed merchandise, just fairies, frog statues, tarot cards, and reflective sphere bird baths, with a kind and vaguely stoned old hippie smiling behind the counter.

Like every other woman whose teen years took place in the '90s, I am a sucker for this exact aesthetic, so maybe Carnival Row is much more my sort of thing than I'd always thought it'd be?"
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"Three years, huh. Feels like alot longer..?"
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,Was it really COVID‚Äôs fault? They took a few months break during the initial lockdown but went back to shooting by the end of 2020 and it‚Äôs been wrapped for literally years now. Covid didn‚Äôt shelve the show for over two years.
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,I‚Äôm surprised this show gets so much criticism. I think it pretty efficiently tells a grandiose story with many important subplots. I was kind of lukewarm when the second season came around but started it and was hooked! I went back and rewatched the first season and could appreciate so much more without having to figure out who was who the second time around. Philo‚Äôs story is gut wrenching. His self loathing is really coming to a head in the second season but its origins in the first season are so well told. Cara is really exquisite- I can‚Äôt think of a person that embodies a fairy like her but her acting is great as well.
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,It is not good.  I find Cara‚Äôs acting lacking.  Stopped watching after the first few episodes.
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"Except *The Nevers* has been removed from HBO Max, and if you try to watch *The Nevers 1B* on Tubi, it's nowhere near the streaming simplicity of watching anything on Amazon Prime.

It's not only FAST, so you get ad breaks, it's ***linear*** (i.e., NOT on-demand). *You have to watch it live.* And Tubi in their infinite wisdom of attempting to minimize ad revenue as much as possible or something, is airing it for three days in *four-hour blocks in the middle of the day*. So, if you have a normal job/life schedule? Viewing this is probably not a doable thing."
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"It is such a shame, he‚Äôs a really nice chap too. We used to chat on Twitter back when it was a nice place to hang out, and he was so excited about his upcoming film with huge robots."
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,Nein?
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,They do a horrible job picking stories to make into shows
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,Ironically  a lot of fantasy series that were claimed to be next GoT have all failed. Like rings of power and wheel of time
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"I remember back around 2011, there were a shit ton of fantasy and period shows released. The only ones with lasting impact were Game of Thrones, Vikings and you could make an argument for Spartacus."
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"Arcane is superb on every level, but God only knows when we'll see a second season (or, she said darkly, whether or not Netflix will cancel it on a whim before then)."
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,Vox Machina enters the chat; fucks shit up.
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,Ironically  a lot of fantasy series that were claimed to be next GoT have all failed. Like rings of power and wheel of time
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,Okay‚Ä¶
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,Wasn‚Äôt that Foundation not Carnival Row?
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,That was almost certainly not this show since they never shot at the same time.
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"> His departures often seem related to conflicts over creative decisions too. You‚Äôd think executives would be confident in his abilities by now and just let him do his thing.

If you run into assholes all day, you're the asshole. Maybe he's just difficult to work with."
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,Sounds like Bryan Fuller.
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,Probably so on the nose you‚Äôll smell the patchouli while watching
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,">if you have a normal job/life schedule? Viewing this is probably not a doable thing.

Does knowing how to use qBittorrent count as having a normal life?"
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"Oh man, Gundam!?"
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"Totally. Dug Pacific Rim and the first season of Carnival Row. 

Hung with him at SDCC a couple of times, and he‚Äôs just a super nice, super passionate dude."
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"Watched three eps so far, pretty happy with it! I like how the one guy has a firearm and it's totally useless most of the time."
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"If you run into (incompetent and creatively bankrupt) executives interfering all day, you're the executive interfering? lol"
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,except he is extremely prolific as director? He just has a lot on his plate lol
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"Ehh, not nessecarily. With The Hobbit, for example, it was clearly a case of the studios fucking around (which also harmed Peter Jackson‚Äôs efforts)"
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"Looking at his credits, it's not super clear what Fuller actually does"
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,I'll amend: ...viewing this *legally...* :)
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"The audio mix is pretty bad on th e torrented version , had to triple my TV volume to get audible conversations."
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,Pacific Rim.
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,Being prolific doesn‚Äôt stop a creator from being hard to work with. See: stanley Kubrick
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"As a director? No, not really.  He's directed 5 movies and 7 episodes of TV (mostly animated) in the past decade. As a writer, kind of.

He's no more prolific a director than M Night Shyamalan"
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"Yeah, he loves doing wild shit and studios hate that"
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"This is of course hypothetical.

But my ethics run to having a membership for a dozen+ different streaming services and if I want to watch a show that is on a service I dont have I will buy that membership to watch that show and if that service has other things to keep me interested then congrats you won me as a customer.

But at some point, if you make it too difficult to watch legally, I will hypothetically resort to um alternative methods."
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,'Twas a very bad joke. The joke was that Pacific Rim is like... Kinda Gundam-y. Except Pacific Rim is *fucking awesome*.
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"Stanley Kubrick has a reputation for sure but Guillermo has been around for decades and if anything has a great reputation

I personally believe he would just rather leave a project than have executives butcher his vision, which probably happens to the vast majority of projects, period. 

Refusing to sellout doesn‚Äôt make him an asshole. Obvi this is just my opinion and for all I know he‚Äôs a nightmare, but I really don‚Äôt think so."
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"You are far from alone. But... justifiable ‚â† legal.

I'm retired and have no life, so I sat through the ads and watched it live. Because I'm *damned* if HBO Max's attempt to stem their losses is going to stop me from adding to the ad revenue that will (hopefully) kick back to the creators of the show.

And the rumor is when Roku get the episodes, they'll be on-demand. Just saying, sailing the seas isn't the *only* path to take here, either."
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"Sorry, I wasn‚Äôt giving Reddit my full attention, and I don‚Äôt know enough about Gundam to spot a joke. 

I‚Äôm with you on Pacific Rim though - I think it is the only film I‚Äôve ever been to see at the cinema on my own, twice."
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,I don‚Äôt know what this means; but I‚Äôm pretty sure I hate it.
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,‚ÄúStars‚Äù
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,I‚Äôll give it a chance‚Ä¶seems like a rip off of Are You The One
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"The end of Netflix as we know it? Once these companies turn to reality-tv, it seems to end their overall relevance.

See: TLC, History Channel, MTV, A&E, etc."
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"So shock of netflix shoving trashy ""Dating"" shows down our throat 

They even tried to make the Circle a dating show"
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"You are vastly underestimating the popularity of these shows. People sub to Netflix just to watch them and they're cheap to make, it's a cash cow. My girlfriend and her friends are absolute addicts to this type of TV. Outside of premiere weekly television like HoTD and maybe now TLoU, these types of shows are easily the last stand of ""watercooler talk"" television. 

Plus, Netflix released their 2023 catalogue yesterday, only on Reddit after looking at their list would you think they are in any sort of trouble lol."
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,HBO Max is pivoting to more reality shows as well
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,">They even tried to make the Circle a dating show

I mean, not really. This season was ""singles only"" but it's not like they changed the point of the game to be finding love. Plus most of the catfish weren't actually single anyway."
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"They made a point to call it ""the Circle: SINGLES"" 
Seems like they were meaning for it to go a dating avenue."
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"My brother and I used to watch Beast Wars in the mormings and I loved it. But it never really clicked with me (cut me some slack I was super young) that it was like the same Transformers. My brother became like the biggest Transformers fan you'll meet and the main series just never did it for me, I still remember the shock when he said ""But you liked Beast Wars"" and I finally realized it was Transformers"
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,I loved Beast Wars. I haven't watched it in years so I can't remember everything but it was brilliantly written and had a lot of great characters. Highly recommended.
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"I loved this show, my dream is for a company to remake it with modern visuals because man is it primitive looking now lol."
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"I absolutely love this show. Unfortunate, the sequel Beast Machines missed the mark. >!Episode where Dinobot dies is top tier and I cried the first time I watched it. Still get choked up during his speech . Ravage remade as an assassin: incredible.!<"
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,Loved it as a kid. Rat trap was my boy
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,I fuckin loved Cheetor. I might just have to watch this again.
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"I remember a great scene where Rhinox finally loses his cool and levels a bunch of Predacons with his chain gun. That happened, right?"
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,I found out that it was called Beasties in Canada because the broadcaster thought Beast Wars was too violent of a name. Weird.
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"Oh my god I loved Beast Wars. I watched it back when it was originally on and then revisited it a few years ago when it came to Netflix. I was shocked at how well it held up, and even if the CGI was janky it was still vibrant and it had great action sequences. I loved the air of mystery surrounding the story and every character had stand-out moments. I'll never forget >!Dinobot's death!<.

I watched a little bit of Beast Machines but didn't get all the way through it. I saw the Transformer's trailer the other day and wondered if it was related. Beast Wars is the only Transformers content I've really experienced, but I'll keep an eye on the new movie's plot at least.

Thanks for this appreciation of a core childhood memory."
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,Man I know I‚Äôm going to be disappointed with this movie
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"Clicked on the link to see the new upscaled version and I noticed something that I never did in the original broadcast or when I watched the dvds. When Megatron asked his navigation computer if they were on the right planet and if there was energon, the computer shows the image of the globe and for a brief moment, you can see the continent of Africa."
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"Holy crap I had episodes recorded on VHS tapes when I was a kid. Even had the toys of the original models and the new gen beast wars. Dinobot will always be my favorite.

This new movie will likely suck, but thank you for bringing awareness to the Beast Wars series!"
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,Rat Trap was my dude! I remember being blown away by the transmetal storyline and not only because I wanted the toys.
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"In Canada it was called Beasties and the intro reflected that.

Unless I watched it on Fox."
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"I'm so glad that someone posted this. I was just yesterday thinking that in the era of shows like *Andor* and *Doom Patrol*, television presents the greatest opportunity for meaningful pulp storytelling. 

While I am (in principle) excited for *Rise of the Beasts*, I know in my heart that no overstuffed spectacle - however well intentioned - will serve the fiction as well as *Beast Wars* did. Make no mistake: *Beast Wars* is flawed. Its CGI is outdated, and its visual storytelling in the first season is confusingly structured and awkwardly paced. Throughout all three seasons, characters are introduced and are killed off to little fanfare, and the prevailing sense is that yes, this was a show that was designed to sell toys.

*That being said* \- the creatives did an incredible job working with the resources at their disposal. The performances are across-the-board excellent, the plotting is compelling and fun, and when the show flips a switch somewhere in the middle of Season 2, it becomes high art. I do not think that this is superlative. Episodes like *Code of Hero* and *Transmutate* deserve to be regarded among the best of their era. Dinobot, a cantankerous turncoat with a fixation on honor - who transforms into an inaccurate, Jurassic Park-derived version of a velociraptor - is still one of my favorite characters in fiction. The best of the show is *that* well drawn.

If you have time to kill and can suffer through the show's troughs and languors, you will not regret it."
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"My old neighbor loved Rattrap. Maybe too much. 

Was a great show back in the day."
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,That show did not mess around when it came to killing off characters. It was tough for me to handle as a kid haha.
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"I still have my old Beast Wars toys from when I was a kid, hopefully this means they‚Äôll increase in value!"
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,I rewatched it earlier this year while taking care of my baby and it was still amazing.  Can‚Äôt wait for the baby to be old enough to appreciate the series.
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"I see a lot of love for Rat Trap, but Waspinator was just as hilarious."
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"I never thought I‚Äôd see the Beast Wars in live action. I remember watching the episodes live on TV way back in the day. I had a bunch of the toys, seriously it‚Äôs why I like Megatron, who doesn‚Äôt love a T-Rex."
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,">explores the very concept of what it means to be a hero

If you know, you know: üíîüíîüíî"
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"I knew the scores for the existing movies were bad but dayammmm. Except Bumblebee, which is like 60 points higher than the average of all the others."
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"I was planning on rewatching it recently, was one of my favorite shows when I was a kid."
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,Hey yo my guy just post the War Planets upscale link and we'll have the trifecta
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,The use of Biggie smalls sample in the trailer (i'm a fan) didn't add anything to the concept at all.  That's a signal to me that the movie will be a jumbled mess of random ideas thrown together.
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,Fucking loved that show. I found out about transformers through beast wars. Reminds me I should probably watch that trailer.
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,Not one person who watched best wars (or beasties in Canada) ever had anything bad to say about this show. Beast wars is the transformers I grew up on and the show only gets better as you get older and watch the show.
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"Also, if you‚Äôre checking that out, or re-checking that out, it was made by the same company that made *Reboot*.

https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyVcP_7NqrrvziNbvFzn_LRUaa3JEX4TP"
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"This was Beasties in Canada, why? No idea. I loved the Zone on YTV, Addams family, DBZ, Hey Arnold. Simpler times."
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"Still a good show, but it wasn‚Äôt the first cgi show.  Reboot predated it by 2 years.  It was made by the same company, Mainframe."
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"I suggest everyone interested search the podcast ""what a cartoon"" and find their beast wars episode"
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,Loved this show. Can you talk about how you AI up scaled the series?
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"I was a massive Beast Wars fan as a kid. Had a ton of the toys and I eventually got the first two seasons on DVD, but never got the 3rd."
To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,I'm excited for the kids who grew up watching Beast Wars to have their nostalgia crushed like the kids my age did with the original Michael Bay films.

To The Abandoned Sacred Beasts,"Am I going crazy? This was called ""beasties"" when I was young, I swear!"
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,InuYasha went on for way too long. I lost interest and dropped off watching it years before it was over.
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,Seems kinda meh.
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"Seems really unnecessary imo.

Does everything from the 90s need a reboot or sequel? No."
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"i tried rewatching it a few years ago and couldn't get through much of it, i forgot how episodic it was and i can't do anime like that anymore."
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,">InuYasha went on for way too long. 

Let me tell you about a little show called One Piece..."
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,The InuYasha anime was from the 2000s
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"Good to see it making its way to the west properly, I've had to rely on torrents online when I'd rather support the show officially"
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,Gimli playing an elf! Gimli playing an elf!
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"Alright, it's been years since I've read the book, but here are my thoughts:

**The positives:** 

1. Manu Bennett as Allanon. Fucking badass.

2. John Rhys-Davies as Eventine. Badass. 

3. Some of the visuals. (The Ellcrys, I like the sort of post-apocalyptic feel they've put into the story, the books never really struck me as looking like that.)

**Some mehs, but I can get over:**

1. Some of the characters weren't how I pictured, mainly Wil.

**The bad:**

1. Eretria. She seemed shoe-horned in this early into the pilot. (Isn't introduced until like a third of the way through the novel.)

2. SPOILING THE FACT THE FUCKING DOG IS A DEMON WHAT THE FUCK GUYS "
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,I'm watching for Manu that man is AMAZEBALLS!
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"Watched it with the family. We all liked it. I don't mind the teeny bopper shit. The only other YA'ish show I watch is The 100, so I don't feel like I'm drowning in it.

Haven't read the books. Liked the fast paced style, It wasn't hard to follow. Looking forward to next week.

"
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"I've read all Terry Brooks shannara books.  I really want to like this.  Trying to ignore the huge differences from the books - I know they have to adapt to TV.  Amberle is crazy hot, action scenes are good, and the sets are amazing.  The only thing I actively disliked is the characters just travel instantly, with no time reference at all."
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"hey there, outside perspective with no prior knowledge to the story here.
I enjoyed it, visually very beautiful and the premise and story building in the first episode left me interested in knowing more. my only issue so far is the mild MTV teen drama vibe I get from it, I was actually happy all the chosen were killed off just so the pretty boy Teen Wolf looking boyfriend was killed off. I mean it definitely won't replace Game of Thrones for me but so far I am casually optimistic"
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,The Ellcrys looks spectacular visually realized
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"Cool that this was shot in NZ, I'm watching all like, yep been there, been there, drove past that last week. As a complete newbie, I think I liked it. Yes it has a decidedly tween vibe (probably not helped by all the lyric'd music), it felt a little rushed and I'm a little confused as to what is going on but i'm hoping it will calm down and become clear in time. I actually thought it turned out way better than I imagined it would, just from reading the short show blurb online.



Let me be the first to say it's always nice to see something other than Crime dramas and reality shows on TV."
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"When you read the books, did anyone picture Allanon with a fucking fade?"
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,Why in the hell is this on MTV?  Why waste a fantasy show on a network that is only interested in superficiality?  Such a waste.
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,Poppy Drayton is the prettiest woman I've seen in a while 
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,Body painted FF nudity.
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,The weirdest part of all this is watching a fantasy series with some apparent effort and production quality broken up by ads for literally anything else MTV makes. 
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"Something else to note, those who haven't read any of the books.

This show (first season?) is based off of the SECOND book, ""The Elfstones of Shannara"". 

The first book, ""The Sword of Shannara"" is basically all the backstory shit Allanon mentions in the episode. Wil's dad went off to not!Mordor to kill not!Sauron with the sword. (It's also basically the same plot as Lord of the Rings.) "
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"Trying hard to enjoy it but the forced dialogue takes me out of it instantly. 

Also, while I understand they're appealing to a certain audience, they really screwed over the beautifully animated intro with the music."
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,Loving Gimli as King Eventine 
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"Posted this on /r/fantasy:

They are definitely going for the young adult audience with it. I read this book maybe 20 years ago, been rereading it. And the show is much more YA than the book. I think given the age the book was going for, it fits.

Visually is great. The sets, effects, its really quite amazing to see the books come to life. Thematically, they are really pushing the plot of good vs evil, and magic has a price. (Allanon is scarred and drained after using magic, while the demon Dagda Mor seems to relish in the use of power). Those are big themes in Brooks work.
My biggest gripe isn't the acting (get to that), its the breakneck speed the plots unfolding. They are moving really fast between scenes and not giving enough time to explain one thought out digest it before the next. If I hadn't read the books I'd probably be really lost right now. There's a lot of story they aren't touching because they don't have time. Kind of reminds me of how much history and subtext they have to cut out of the GoT TV show to fit it into an episode. A post-show primer (or maybe the MTV app) could help.

The acting could use work. I think that's the young actors mostly there, but given the demographic, it can't be helped. It might be awkward having a 30+ year old playing Wil. John Rhys-Davies is really good, and Manu Bennett is a good Allanon. The rest, maybe when the plot calms down, and they can breathe a bit it won't feel so rushed. My biggest fear was the acting was going to be awful. It isn't, but hopefully it gets better.
As a book reader in his 30s, I'm still enjoying it. Yes it's quite CWish, but its YA. I think as long as you don't go into this expecting GoT (which its most assuredly not), thematically I think it's true to Brooks' writing. You're not going to get incest, murder, and politics. It's much more straightforward.

I'll keep watching."
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"Oh look, another teen-romance-fantasy-action-drama set in the ""dystopian american future"" with ""runners"" and ""choosen people"". Oh, is that city of gondor?"
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"I love fantasy but this is a bit too MTV-y for my taste. Sounds pretty bland and generic so far. I'll be giving it the 4 episode trial simply because it IS fantasy but I don't have high hopes. Then again, I almost gave up on The 100 and it turned out pretty nicely toward the end of the first season.  

Anyway, the part I really liked about the episode was the Gauntlet sequence, 90% because of the music. I am a sucker for production music. On that note, if somebody could point me in the right direction where to find the actual score (not the distracting and unfitting lyric songs), I would be eternally grateful. "
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,What bothers me most about the show is the music.
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,I'm severely dissapointed with the premiere.  Allanon was the only bright spot. The young actors are really bad. The dialogue is bad. The butchering of the story is bad. The gauntlet was pointless.  The elves were already an egalitarian society so it seems forced way to build suspense and it also failed to at that.  Amberle running away from her duty was just a better story. Where are the forests surrounding paranor? The dadga mor is an ancient druid corrupted by the ildatch? Patchwork story borrowed from the wishsong which makes me think this season might be both books 2&3 and we won't get a brin or jair and Wil will get the wishsong . I almost hope it gets canceled so the rest of the shannara books get saved from al Gough and miles millars meat cleavers?  Am i freaking out too much? Can someone talk me down from this ledge? 
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"its fine. 7/10. if they can drop all the cheesy lines and teen drama shit, they can actually do well with this show considering Manu Bennett is badass af."
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"Im loving it so far! Was a huge fan of the series in my younger years but can barely remember any of it excet for main plot points and characters, so I wasnt going into this in full nerd mode ready to be pissed off by any inaccuracy.
That being said, I fucking loved it! There are a few moments which are painful teeny, but I didnt mind the overall Hunger Games vibe, I actually think they struck a very good balance between that and the darker stuff which they showed no remorse in putting out. It also is a nice touch they dont drag thru stuff like they always do in tv shows, they go thru events pretty quickly and that helps keeping the interest up.
Cant wait to see how it evolves, but so far Im 100% hooked."
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"Didn't read the books,  but must say that this show was not the best. Way too much teen drama blah blah blah. Terrible script. The druid was the best part in my opinion, but even that is a stretch with such a shit script.  Ya can't win them all.  MTV ya suck balls. You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain MTV, and by villain, I mean a cold turd on the floor.  Also Aarron Eckhardt is a cold turd. Blab."
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,Eritria? The way they said it in the show sounded like the African country.
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"I never read the books and haven't been following this, but the dialog is really making me cringe with the clash of accents. Is it supposed to be intentional that they talk back and forth between fantasy to contemporary accents? Are they immigrants or foreigners? Even people in the same family speak very differently."
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"Not liking it, the dialogue is cheesy and the non-stop music is annoying as fuck.

Edit: Also, [this guy](http://i.imgur.com/6GSxdzD.png) has the most punchable face in the history of television."
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"I have not watched the show yet, but was a big fan of the books.  It looks like the story is from Elfstones, which is interesting because Sword is the first book in the series.  Any idea why they started with the second book?"
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"I recently read 'Elfstones of Shannara', but I don't recall Amberle actually TRYING to become one of the Chosen.  All I remember is that she was selected by the Ellcrys, but then ran away soon afterwards.
"
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"Can we get reviews from *non-book readers* here? I get it, it's not as good as the books. But it's not a book, it's a TV series that coincidentally based on the book series. The faster you understand that, the better you realize that the show is going to give its own flare and direction. I am thoroughly enjoying this series and waiting for episode 7 now."
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"Not sure if I will be able to stick with this. Maybe it is just me, but I get the impression it was filmed to air in something other than 16:9. Some of these scenes are weird almost like they are zoomed in and cropped like a bad pan and scan. It is extremely obvious in the first few minutes so much so I recorded another airing thinking MTV ran the SD cut on the HD feed on the one I originally recorded."
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"God that was dreadful. I've only read the first book, but I can't imagine it's very faithful, right? And the horrible Hunger Game-esque costumes and visuals, teeny drama vibe, horrid acting..."
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"Let's spoil the fact the dog is the mastermind in the first episode.

Brilliant job, guys. 

(Seriously, it was like a big reveal in the book.) "
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,I think the most surprising thing so far is that they actually meant it saying 'limited interruptions'. One commercial per break. 
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,Really like the visuals and premise but the teen actors are mediocre
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,I guess I better not watch this based on what I see here.
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"Just finished. Read Elfstones when it was first released and a dozen times since. As a TV show on its own it was awful (acting, dialogue, music oh my fucking god the music). As an adaptation of the book it was an absolute abomination. A part of me just died.

That being said a lot of shows start weakly and grow into something better. I'll keep watching in the hopes it improves. If for no other reason than to see the Reaper do some reaping.

Final thought: fancy-druid-extendo-weapons?? What the hell is that all about?"
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"For a show that seems to have made all of its casting decisions based on looks, they ended up with the most generic looking cast. How can so many people look so good and so boring at the same time?

Sadly, there is no chance of this show appealing to people who enjoyed the books. I'm not sure who it was meant to appeal to."
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"If you liked it, lets try to breathe some life into /r/TheShannaraChronicles and chat about Ep 2 next week!"
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,I watched it for a few minutes and immediately lost interest. It feels like a nice coat of paint on a CW show. I do think it's cool that they are trying for some original programming and not reality shows but it feels really poorly written. Well.. I've never read the book(s) or whatever so maybe I'm not the target audience.
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"With each successive episode, the mini-series diverges even further from the book, but that's their prerogative.  Some differences are more trivial than others, but they're piling up.  The main character names are kept the same, at least, although there are some characters and certain sub-plots which aren't in the book.  I mean, what's up with the Utopia hoedowns and troll sacrifices?  Plus, the Reaper has barely been a factor.  "
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"Why do they even bother calling this show ""Shannara"". It has long since ceased to be remotely related. I'm expecting Zombies and Vampires to show up soon..."
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,I love the cheesy stuff so excited to check out the pilot
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"I haven't read the book. But I liked what I saw.
On another note, I watched the Eragon movie before I read the book, and I hated it. I didn't read the book until a friend of mine convinced me the books were a lot better."
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,Seriously? Now I've got to see this.
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"Gimli playing the ruler of elves who is friends with Deathstroke playing a druid.

What a time to be alive"
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"Shit how didn't I get it

I kept thinking ""he sounds so familiar"" while watching but couldn't connect the dots"
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"> post-apocalyptic feel they've put into the story, the books never really struck me as looking like that.

The post-apocalyptic aspect was brought more fully into the book much later when Brooks' various series were tied together."
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"I feel like the dog thing is because they feel like they need scenes of the Changeling and Dagda Mor talking and relaying info and didn't think they could do it without showing where she/it is. Disappointing, but a possible reason. "
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,Seriously that is a huge reveal wasted in the pilot
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"I have to agree with you about the spoiler on the dog. Plus I'm still on the fence about Bennett being Allanon. I like the actor but I'm not sure if he was cast right for the roll. I mean, Allanon is supposed to be really tall. Almost 7ft if memory serves me. But  I'll wait after a few more episodes before I give my final judgment on that. The thing that really bugged me was when they went to Paranor. It's supposed to be a keep. Not a hollowed out rock. It looked like a tomb than a keep. And even felt like one too. It is visually stunning. And a little more than I imagined the world to be. I've read almost all the books. And I completely agree with them starting off with the second book (Elfstones). It's a lot more of an emotional book than the first one. I hope the show will end the same way."
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"What you mean by dog being a demon? It was pretty clear the shapeshifter was in the room while they were discussing it, even tho I tought she was just one of the guards....and its not like she keeps the dog shape throughout the episodes...."
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"I know this is a week old, but seriously, the thing about Manx pissed me off. We shouldn't find out about him until the last few episodes!"
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"I *love* the post-apocalyptic nature and how it really feels like part of the setting. The way the elves dress reminds me of some Star Trek episodes. Likewise with their architecture, very pseudo-futuristic and I like it a lot."
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"If The Champion of Capua is in, so am I!"
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,There he is!
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,Life Is Stranger spotted
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"> characters just travel instantly

Yea. They made it feel like Shady Vale, Paranor, Arborlon are all located just a few steps from the Space Needle. "
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"This is my biggest gripe as well. There is absolutely no sense of time or scale. Like, does this all just talk place in the same neighborhood?"
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"> my only issue so far is the mild MTV teen drama vibe I get from it

That's an interesting use of the word ""mild""."
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"Same boat here. No nothing of the world, enjoyed the stupid cheese and fantasy. Slade Wilson was great, teen romance plot is dumb but fun soap. Perfect guilty pleasure tv show."
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"I understand from with no reference, its OK or better TV show.  But in that case why not just make up a story, like game of thrones did? (At least I think they did, I've never read or seen the show)   Instead you pick a series that already has a die hard fan base and screw with it, you can expect some feedback.   I personally will just re-read the book and skip the rest of this show/series."
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,Surprisingly close the mental image I had in my mind when reading it.
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,I'm surprised at the shooting location. The books are set in post-apocalypse Pacific Northwest US and Canada. I would have thought they'd shoot in BC.
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"yeah same here, i haven't read the books(or new of them before this show) and i like the show.

i am a sucker for ""B-rated"" stuff cause i can just enjoy stuff even when the actors aren't that great. It actually  made me interested in the books and am planning to read em.

I'll keep on watching the show cause i like the worldbuilding and don't find it horrible :)"
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"Yeah, I thought it was okay... certainly not as bad as a lot of people are making it out to be. I did find it a little forced, but, hopefully, now that some of the world building is out of the way, it'll get better from here on out.

Also, I thought the visuals were pretty good most of the time."
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"No, I pictured him like this, since there is a picture of him in the actual book: https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/fc/12/44/fc124458a448b4a8b554107dccc4565e.jpg"
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"I always pictured him as an older and more weathered walker boh

http://i.imgur.com/qt7aYLp.gif"
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,I was on set. She's even prettier in real life.
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,Agreed.  A show highlight.
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,">broken up by ads for literally anything else MTV makes. 

What ads did you see? Mine were literally nothing MTV makes because the first hour my only commercials were those ridiculous anti-smoking ads."
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,That's why I love DVR. Just fast forward through them. 
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,The music was the best part. Their target audience is young adults since it's on MTV.
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,I KNEW he looked familiar. 
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,He's great. I actually think all the primary actors are doing decent or above so far. 
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"As a reader as well, I enjoyed it. I understand the necessity of rushing things a bit to start to draw a TV audience in, and the YA feel worms IMO. The acting is average at its worst, which is okay for me early on outside Allanon and Everyone, who are great. Personally I think I liked Poppy Drayton the most. I feel like Wil's actor needs to grow into it a bit but he did fine. "
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"I see a lot of people liking Manu Bennett as Allanon which surprised me, I haven't read the books (though I now plan to), but I was guessing his acting was going to be a problem for people. I feel like he is particularly wooden and lacking in range, far more so than his recent turn on Arrow. But maybe that woodenness is faithful to the books?"
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"y, i feel that most people that watch it are ""older"" who expect maybe a bit more grown up stuff, even tho they probably read it when they were teens, what i think the books audience is (haven't read them so can't confirm)"
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,I haven't read the books and I don't feel lost. I do read a lot of fantasy though so I guess it helps :D 
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,it never stops. drove me insane. 
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,I didn't even notice the music. Could be worse.
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"I have only gotten to the part where Will's mother dies, so I saw Allanon wake up.    Now I have read all of Terry Brooks stories, but this story was the first I read, so more than a decade ago.   In my mind Allanon was always close to 7 feet tall with a frame that was very strong, but not heavy.    This guy is what 5'11"" and 190 wet or so?   plus i don't remember the staff having a blade on it.    

I was so hoping whoever did Lord of Rings would have done Terry Brooks novels as a great movie instead of TV butchering it.    Think if TV did Tolkien's stories before the movies came out, it would have lessened the interest/joy of the movies I think.  Same here."
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"ye, I actually had to stop after 30 minutes. Couldn't take it anymore. Runners, ""chosen ones"", dysopia, teens, strong female lead who don't need no man, cheesy lines, over-explanation like ""as your servant and loyal friend I will take care of it"". 

I cringed, the concept art looked cool, but 30 minutes was enough to scare me away forever."
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"Can't argue with the inconsistency of the accents used, but technically, the Shannara series take place in the far future where technology brought the downfall of Man and magic rose in it's stead (hence why you see cars and helicopters and such). So, I think one could give this show a pass for not using tradition 'fantasy' dialects."
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,">  fantasy to contemporary accents

Not having watched the show yet, what exactly is a fantasy accent? Like, British?"
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,The dialogue in general is terrible and cringe-worthy. The story is somewhat interesting but the show takes a step back every time someone opens their mouth.  
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"The music, omg it was so over dramatic and heavy handed. It was in almost every scene. It pretty much ruined the entire show for me."
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"I could barely get trough the first two episodes, I was thinking about how intrusive the music was the whole time. Very rarely the music was actually adding so something, but most the time it was just tooo much. Way too much. Contemplating wether to watch the rest just because of this."
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"WOW, looks a lot like my idiot manager form my previous job. Now I won't even want to watch this."
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,The first book was considered too much of a copy of The Lord of The Rings
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"> I have not watched the show yet, but was a big fan of the books.

Umm, I have some really bad news for you...."
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,"It really deviated from the book, and not in a good way. I tried to like this series, but I kept thinking to myself, ""this was so much better in the book."""
Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon,It took me a moment to realize you weren't making a Simpsons reference.
Rich Man,"My wife and I were just watching his role in Columbo, and I had told her about ALL the other roles he had performed throughout his VERY long career. What a great resume. Godspeed, Bill Smith."
Rich Man,He played a number of Blaxploitation villains as well. It‚Äôs always a delight when he pops up in a movie or show.
Rich Man,"This one hurts. William Smith was one of my favorite character actors; he elevated any role he was in. And, as I was informed not long ago, apparently he spoke fluent Russian and taught at UCLA. He was truly a Renaissance Man. Rest in Peace William."
Rich Man,"He was awesome in Red Dawn. Matter of fact, he was awesome in everything,"
Rich Man,"Reminds me of *The Goy‚Äôs Teeth*:

http://vimeo.com/104193227"
Rich Man,Colin Hanks was fantastic in this scene. Really felt natural. Great actor. 
Rich Man,Lorne Malvo  is a cool guy 
Rich Man,"I've only recently started to catch up on the series, and after the fist 5 episodes of season 2, I think I still prefer the first season. I see most people say the first season is good, and that the second season is a masterpiece. Honestly, I enjoyed the first season immensely more. It had a lot more of the dark comedy elements I loved about the Fargo film."
Rich Man,"Fargo is pretty much parable porn.
"
Rich Man,That was very good. Do you have to try knowing there will still be misery?
Rich Man,"Kinda like the give unto ceasar quote by jesus.

Everyone tries to use it as an example of jesus liking taxes or supporting the roman government.

Really it was just about how you shouldnt get so worked up over things in this life that you cannot change and just try to live good and wait for eternity or whatever. "
Rich Man,Very well done parable.
Rich Man,"I'm re-watching Season One again for probably the sixth or seventh time. 

It is probably in my top five favorite pieces of television ever."
Rich Man,Wasn't for nothing. Suffering was reduced. Rich man was not a fool and his choice was valid.
Rich Man,[deleted]
Rich Man,Exactly.
Rich Man,Well of course it does. The scene is a clear allusion to the Coen Brothers's work.
Rich Man,But what happened to the goy??
Rich Man,"Is that the actor who plays Sy in the last season, damaging a company's car ? Talking about a certain Sy's funeral, and wrecking a car ? And asking if he and Sy are the same person ?"
Rich Man,Whats that from?
Rich Man,"He was fantastic in the whole series, loved him"
Rich Man,*Aces.* ;)
Rich Man,I agree. I couldn't get into season 2. 1 was filled with flawed characters all tied together by the nigh supernatural evil of Malvo. Season 2 has no Malvo.
Rich Man,lol just stay with Season 2 until you finish it. You'll see.
Rich Man,"Definitely.

The way I see it is the rich man interpreted his actions as giving his life to a good cause. In fact it is more like he gave his death to a good cause. He gave his material belongings, and nothing else. "
Rich Man,"Suffering wasn't reduced because his suicide created new suffering in his friends and family; in the people who discovered his body; guilt in those who received his organs; and so on.  

His choice to give away all his money at one time meant that it would no longer be productive.  Thus he could not grow his wealth, and, as a consequence, was prevented from distributing a greater sum of money over the course of his life.  By shifting his wealth from productive to non-productive outlets, he put people out of work, causing additional suffering.  

Ultimately, though, a penniless dead man cannot work to ease suffering.  By draining his resources and killing himself, he essentially ended any chance of him doing additional good in the future.  

The man was a fool and died for nothing."
Rich Man,"It's a very, very common parable. "
Rich Man,"I mean, the show is based of one of their movies."
Rich Man,Who cares
Rich Man,Darude - Sandstorm
Rich Man,A Serious Man
Rich Man,A Serious Man from the Coen brothers. I personally think it's their best movie. 
Rich Man,"It kinda does, he just becomes Malvo like (malvoish?) later in the season."
Rich Man,"Thornton's portrayal of Malvo was the type of magnetic villain performance that Bardem displayed in No Country for Old Men. 

Karl Weathers and Mike Milligan are the only characters that seem to pop on screen in season 2. All of the main characters do a fine job, but season 1 offered primary and tertiary characters that I became incredibly invested in. I'll reserve judgement on 2 until I finish, however."
Rich Man,I really like this season although for some reason my mind completely forgot that rumour girl(Allison) had a child and was really confused as to who she wanted to check up on.
Rich Man,"> The show is about a group of women who simultaneously gave birth without being pregnant.

The show is not really about those women. They are pretty much forgotten."
Rich Man,I just wish they would show more of their powers. Five and Vanya are really the only ones that get to show off their powers a lot.
Rich Man,"Rarely do i set aside 10 hours of my day for a single TV show, but by episode 4, i knew i wasn't doing anything else"
Rich Man,"I really enjoyed the music selections for the 2nd season. I had listened to The Dead South - In Hell I'll Be in Good Company months ago and loved it.
I was very surpised to hear it in the show. 

[Dead South Video](https://youtu.be/B9FzVhw8_bY)"
Rich Man,Five is an amazing actor
Rich Man,"Agreed. Found the first season sort of just OK, and only started the second season out of boredom. Was pleasantly surprised. The second season was significantly better."
Rich Man,The only thing I didn't like about season 2 was the assassin's. Hazel from season 1 was so memorable. These guys were as boring as IKEA furniture.
Rich Man,">They kept the music that some people seemed to bitch about.

Who would bitch about the music? It's legitimately some of the best music choices in any TV I've watched. The songs were picked perfectly and the covers were amazing. The randomness was perfect."
Rich Man,"I loved the Hazel and Cha Chi story line, but i loved the sibling stories way, way more, and this season is all about the siblings.

Five is just amazing all around."
Rich Man,"Yes, Very fun show! My only gripe is the inconsistency of Vanya's powers. Sound, kinetic blasts, flight, healing, I mean, there was no need for all that"
Rich Man,"I love both season 1 and 2 but I thought Klause was a lot better in season 1.  He had such an amazing character arc and I felt like he just reverted back to who he was at the beginning of season one and didn't really come out of it at all on season 2.  Felt kinda flat which was a bummer.  Also Diego's obsession with JFK got old.  

Other than that, choreography, music, plot, acting, all great.  Super entertaining."
Rich Man,The swedes+handler were a straight downgrade from Hazel and Cha Cha. Everything else was pretty great
Rich Man,"Everyone is so USELESS, except for Five <3

And his commentary on how useless everyone is brings me back every time. I'm like YES, but we've got this Five."
Rich Man,Okay but can somebody please tell me why tf Diego was so obsessed with saving Kennedy from being assassinated? Like eerily focused on it like it was his sole mission on this Earth even with much much bigger fish to fry - did I miss something? That whole plot motivation made zero rational sense to me
Rich Man,I think some of that is owed to the complication of the first season's exposition being unnecessary in the second season. We understand the commission and their purpose. We get the relationships they have with eachother. We know why number 5 is the way he is.
Rich Man,I think season two carried on season one's biggest problems - but Umbrella Academy has given us the best X-Men adaptation we might ever get.
Rich Man,Check out doom patrol. It has that weird but fun story line. The villains are pretty cool too.
Rich Man,"The actor playing number 5 is super talented, especially in like the 2nd to last episode.

I wonder how much the music licensing cost for the show. Theres a hefty number of songs that they made very good use of"
Rich Man,awesome season.  Vanya still annoys the hell out of me though.  How is it that Ellen Page is somehow the worst actor of the entire ensemble.
Rich Man,I watched both seasons this past weekend. Loved it. The chaos created in that family with the father issues so mimics my own. It gives me hope the kids will find their own way. Great show.
Rich Man,Also I think it's a pretty excellent example of what an adaptation should be: keep all the good part of the original material and change all you can't keep (basically everything that worked as a comic books but wouldn't translate well on screen) by storylines or details that create a much more coherent TV show.
Rich Man,"Loved season 1, loving season 2 so far (half way though). As to which season is better...I think I lean slightly to S1, but it's close."
Rich Man,"I liked it, but I do feel like they kinda brushed the Vanya issue under the rug, sure, she lost her memory but she gained it back and there was really no issue to the families neglect for her or the fact she is basically the Dark Phoenix in terms of power the umbrella world (although Lila may have something to say about that). I just felt like that story carried more weight to it. Maybe they'll tackle it again in season 3. Maybe Hargreaves will see the power and deem her worthy of being a Sparrow. My guess is Hargreaves interaction with the umbrella academy showed how inept they were without him and decided to recruit differently."
Rich Man,"I thoroughly enjoyed the second season. It started strong, but I wasnt really locked in until the interrogation scene. I dont want to spoil it, but I literally said ""holy shit"" out loud, and  then had to stick with it till the end.
Lots of predictable moments and threads, but still enough ""twists"" to keep things interesting.
Fuckin Butthole Surfers man.
The music direction was spot on."
Rich Man,[deleted]
Rich Man,"I feel so against the grain. I‚Äôm halfway through right now and it seems like a pale retread of season 1 with less intrigue, less interesting side characters outside the Hargreeves, less weirdness. Everything is less. 

Hopefully things turn around in the next half here but man season 1 was much, much more fun than this."
Rich Man,[deleted]
Rich Man,"Loved it.  Just couldn't get the nagging thought ""why does Diego care so much about JFK?"" Out of my head."
Rich Man,"I completely agree. I started season 1 because a friend recommended it to me. Through the first 7 or so episodes, it was pretty slow paced, but it was interesting enough for me to come back for a bit more. But season 2 hit the ground running. Episode 2x1 was a bit like season 1, but once Five started doing his thing, it got fun.

Some of my favorite changes (spoiler free):

* Diego and Luther are a lot more funny as the butt of the joke. It felt like both of these characters in s1 were so mopy, dark, and brooding. ""Woe is me, I'm gonna go play some John Mayer and complain about how terrible my life is"". While they do that in s2 as well, the tone of their scenes is so much more different. We can laugh at them, which makes them a lot more entertaining. The Olga scene is the epitome of this.
* I absolutely loved all the space that they gave Ben to be an actually fleshed out (hehe) character. He didn't just tag along with Klaus like s1. He had real conversations and arguments that showed who he is/was.
* It was socially relevant. I'm sure it wasn't planned since the Floyd protests just happened, but the entire season took place in the middle of the Civil Rights movement of the 60s. Seeing how racism existed in that context and comparing it to how little things have actually changed 60 years later was haunting and beautiful.
* It forced characters to make real consequential decisions that impact normal people. Characters like Ray, Sissy, Harlan, and Dave were fantastic for humanizing the characters. I'll throw Lila in that group as well. But we got to see what our main characters' priorities are and how they balance the relationships with these characters with their duty to save the world.

Overall a great season with a super interesting twist ending. I can't wait for season 3."
Rich Man,The less vanya there is the better it gets.
Rich Man,"Maybe because I'm an uncultured swine in comparison to some of the fine civilized and educated folks on here but, I really enjoyed season 1.

 Binged it right away.  Though slow, I didn't find it to be the worst show.  I'd rather watch season 1 then Jessica Jones season 1 or 2 and that's a hard thing to say since David Tenant made an awesome bad guy."
Rich Man,"I just finished S1 after stopping halfway through many months back. 

&#x200B;

It was late at night and I should of cut the TV off but decided to watch S2 opener....was blown away and ended up watching the first 3 episodes of S2. Fingers crossed we get more seasons!!"
Rich Man,"My one complaint though is that the narrative keeps rewarding Number 5 for his toxic behavior. Number 5 keeps asserting himself as the group leader and the favorite of his father, yet he is a total dick that keeps trying to bend his siblings to his will."
Rich Man,am I the only one hating season 2 so far(im 5ep in and will finish it)? will i get downvoted into oblivion or are there others?
Rich Man,"One of the best shows on Netflix. 6 episodes into season 2 so far. Production values are through the roof, and I love the music!"
Rich Man,"I have a question, maybe I forgot but in season 1 did Allison's power kill people or do supernatural things? For example in the first episode she said ""I heard a rumor that I blew your minds"" and everyone's head exploded but I don't remember her power ever working like that. I thought it was more in line that they'd blow their brains out with their own guns."
Rich Man,"Anyone looking for a superhero story with a darker atmosphere would also really enjoy ""The Boyz"" on Amazon Prime. Probably the only prime original I would go out of my way to recommend to someone."
Rich Man,"In my opinion, they do gay characters extremely well, unlike 99% of other shows in TV, they aren't just gay, they have, sometimes several, something else's that makes them, them, which so many other shows just don't understand, just being gay doesn't make them a good character."
Rich Man,Im surprised that the managed to run the same plot over again. It would be like The Good Place doing a rewrite of the first season for the second season.
Rich Man,[deleted]
Rich Man,The cover of Adele‚Äôs song in Swedish in episode 5 was amazing to listen to. Just finished episode 7 and enjoyed the Backstreet Boys as the new words of the cult.
Rich Man,">not the CW superhero bullshit

Good to know because some of those shows have the worst writing."
Rich Man,Binged it this weekend with the kids. Really enjoyed it. Loved the pop culture references all over.
Rich Man,"Interesting, I thought it was a solid B+ season, with season one being A-. Both were good, but season 2 didn‚Äôt wow me."
Rich Man,I feel like we are being astro turfed honestly. The show is fine but it's being so weirdly acclaimed on here.
Rich Man,"People bitch about the music wtf? That's like, the best part"
Rich Man,"I dunno I‚Äôm on like episode 7 of season 2 and I think season 1 is way better. I have no idea what the source material for the show is about but this season seems to have way less plot.

And yes the music is ridiculously distracting. It‚Äôs a good soundtrack but if I wanted to hear a bunch of greatest hits I would listen to iTunes. It‚Äôs cheap to keep a viewers attention just because you put frank sinatra over a fight sequence or something."
Rich Man,I thought season one had too much needless drama. If someone tells me they stopped that I'll gladly watch S2
Rich Man,Did number 1 seem dumber to everyone or was that just me?
Rich Man,I love Klaus.
Rich Man,I agree with all except their should‚Äôve been more hazel :(
Rich Man,"I couldn‚Äôt get past the episode with the random dance number in season one. I really did dig the story until they point however that scene was such a cliche it totally turned me off to the rest of the show.

It sounds like I should get over that and finish up season one so I can dig in to season two. Thank you for your review!"
Rich Man,"I really enjoyed the second season, but the things I liked most about it come with some serious caveats.

The sound design, for example, is great. UA is really good at the use of music to set tone, especially to give a more whimsical air to fight scenes. A very good thing to have, given how even the best fight scenes these days seem more mundane by comparison to the thousands of identical scenes in other pieces of media. The sound MIXING, though, was atrocious. Every second scene seemed to include a wild shift in audio volume, which would have worked for dramatic effect if it wasn't such a radical change. Some scenes I had to change my volume setting from 70 to 10 and back again just to keep up with the dialog and not piss of my neighbors.

Similarly, as I said I really like the fight choreography, particularly the way superpowers get used, such as the [spoiler](#s 5v5) fight. As soon as anyone picks up a gun, though, they take a big dose of stupid pills. The soldiers at the start walked right up to each other's faces before firing their guns, ignoring the enemy soldiers right in their lines [in an attack that was conceptually stupid to begin with.](#s How/why did the Soviets even manage to perform a land invasion of the states that reached Dallas and THEN nuke the US along with their own soldiers?) Later characters with guns had a clear line of sight to main characters in narrow straight halls, cornrows, and open fields; and the MCs just ran away in a straight line. No powers, no cover, just running in a straight line. You literally couldn't ask for an easier shot! I get that they are all expendable mooks and the MCs have plot armour, but it was just so flagrantly impossible to miss so many perfect shots that I found it completely pulled me out of the action.

Expecting realistic gun physics out of a show like this is kind of missing the point, I suppose, but I hope they make it a bit less blatant and silly. There's no excuse for the audio mixing, though, they gotta fix that. 

Long wall of complaints aside, I was 100% along for the ride and enjoyed the plot, particularly the fish out of water 60s stuff. Good light entertainment with just enough twists and turns to keep it fresh."
Rich Man,"I fell for the Swedes. Though according to the Swedish fan population of the show, the actors spoke very bad Swedish... I still fell for them."
Rich Man,"Not seeing any love for Lila, easily my favourite addition for this season!"
Rich Man,My only disappointment is that I scarfed it down in two days and now I have to wait another year for more :(
Rich Man,"Are you kidding? This season was a dumpster fire. Barely anything happened for 7 episodes then a bunch of absolute nonsense happened in the last 3. It was stylish and the music was good but apart from that it was a complete mess. There is no internal logic or consistency to the powers, essentially 0 character development and everyone is too stupid to use their powers at all effectively apart from 5. In fact I felt a lot like 5 in this scene - frustrated at the idiocy and incompetence of everyone else in the show. 

It was also lolrandumb for the sake of it. AJ is a fish! How QuIrKy. Shite."
Rich Man,Is it really much better? I kind of hated the first season so I've being skipping it.
Rich Man,"The music director definitely deserves an award, among others"
Rich Man,[deleted]
Rich Man,Garbage show.
Rich Man,"My biggest problem with season one was that there was no introduction to the characters or universe we were put into. Stuff just happened and they expected the spectacle to be enough to keep us watching. You can't have a payoff if you didn't make a buildup.

Shows like LOST or the Good Place were able to use obfuscation and mystery with great effect on the storytelling. While UA seems to fumble a bit on setting the scene. This last season was an improvement - perhaps because they employed common stereotypes about the civil rights era and the American south. Having a greater understanding of their universe and some knowledge about the sibling dynamics from season one - I was able to follow along for season two much more than the first season."
Rich Man,"Really? I found episode 1 of season 2 to be pretty bad to the point that we are not very excited about watching the next episode. Not because of the plot itself, that's fine.  


Blame the writing or the directing but many of the scenes did not feel natural or credible.   


Take the part where Klaus ends up stealing a truck from a guy at a bar. That whole sequence felt like it was made by complete amateurs. The conversations and interactions didn't flow well at all. they all felt clumsy. And then near the end of that scene we go from Klaus sitting right in front of the guy who just saw him grab his keys and confronting him about it, to Klaus somehow being outside the bar with a huge lead on everyone giving him way too much time to just grab the truck.  


Could've ended up with the same result but with a much better crafted scene."
Rich Man,"They definitely stepped up their game (""improved"") the ridiculousness of the bad guys being unable to accurately hit anything with a gun.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed season 2, but c'mon, 1000+ people with machine guns shooting at the heroes from 50 yards and not a single hit?  That moment was probably the worst offender of guns being unable to hit the heroes that I have ever seen in my life.  It really took the show down from a 10/10 to about a 9/10 for me.  

Still a 9/10 though - despite some of the gun scenes, I really like the show."
Rich Man,"I didn't enjoy it as much as OP did. I thought that the show could have been cut by 1/2 and would have told the same story better. I think it's a pacing issue that is noticeable in a lot of the shows the network produces, the notable exception being ""Stranger Things""."
Path of the Dragons,"The Cannibal should be cool to see, hopefully they stop pretending Sunfyre doesn‚Äôt exist since they‚Äôre one of the most important dragons in the story and probably has the deepest bond with their rider."
Path of the Dragons,"Sunfyre, Silverwing, Dreamfyre (Drogon, Visceron and Rhaegal‚Äôs mom), and then two of Sheepstealer, Grey Ghost and Cannibal?"
Path of the Dragons,Can't wait to see the dragon casting for the roles.
Path of the Dragons,Some coked up HBO Executive: More dragons.
Path of the Dragons,I was really hoping for some new houses instead
Path of the Dragons,"Yo, new dragon just dropped!"
Path of the Dragons,Give us Sunfyre!!
Path of the Dragons,But how many new houses??
Path of the Dragons,Yoshi the Terror
Path of the Dragons,Can‚Äôt wait!!
Path of the Dragons,"Please, please, please, please, please Sheepstealer. My favorite part of the Dance"
Path of the Dragons,"Guys, I think he‚Äôs gonna finish the book."
Path of the Dragons,Hell yeah! Gotta love surprise :)
Path of the Dragons,I heard 4 new dragons
Path of the Dragons,"Why not new , non-book dragons?"
Path of the Dragons,Feeling the heat from all the TLOU talk.
Path of the Dragons,Not really my main draw
Path of the Dragons,Give us better characters. Hard to root for anyone on this show because they're so painfully boring.
Path of the Dragons,Spoiler for Season 3: ‚ÄúSix New Dragons‚Äù
Path of the Dragons,How about some regular fucking people. Targs are boring af
Path of the Dragons,"Sure, dragons are nice.  But what the GoT fans really like are confusing time jumps and ‚Äúthere‚Äôs only 5 people in this world‚Äù story lines."
Path of the Dragons,Does that make up for all of the terrible people in the show?
Path of the Dragons,"They really do treat viewers like they‚Äôre 9 years old. Just write a decent show, the ‚Äòdragon count‚Äô is irrelevant"
Path of the Dragons,Probably going to be shit they are already distracting us with 5 Dragons Coming Soon because I bet they don‚Äôt have any story line to speak of
Path of the Dragons,Who gives a shit. Show me more of Westeros. I‚Äôm tired of this Succession ripoff cloaked in Kings Landing bullshit.
Path of the Dragons,"I'm going to be optimistic, but the fact that they're promoting the number of dragons particularly does not bode well."
Path of the Dragons,I‚Äôd take one good episode over five more dragons
Path of the Dragons,"imma be real, i don't really care about the dragons. i want more drama and human on human fights. even if it's not realistic, I like the one guy vs a ton of people fights.

I also wish they'd stop making the one girl out to be some kind of hero or good guy. She's literally a horrible person. She's not done anything to help anyone but herself. She's not fit to rule. She's done absolutely nothing for the people of the kingdom. But the show keeps acting like she's some great heroine. She literally SA her bodyguard. She's in a position of power and he had no choice to but comply. He even protested. But now he's the bad guy somehow."
Path of the Dragons,"Five NEW dragons? In a series about the decline and ultimate DEMISE of almost all dragons and the house that controlled them?

Sure why not. 

Totally exactly what the author envisioned in his books."
Path of the Dragons,are they an actual upgrade? I'd be disappointed if it was just a colour swap
Path of the Dragons,I had heard about a ‚Äòbig dragon battle‚Äô at the end of season one and was anticipating a huge battle between all 13 dragons. I was so disappointed‚Ä¶
Path of the Dragons,Make it 6
Path of the Dragons,I‚Äôve already lost track though
Path of the Dragons,Ooo lovelay
Path of the Dragons,Woah sooooo cool
Path of the Dragons,That's... fine I guess.  I don't really care. I hope they are dragons with cool stories. I like cool stories.
Path of the Dragons,Dracarys.
Path of the Dragons,"""I WANT AN ARMY OF DIDGERIDOOS. 50,000 DIDGERIDOOS!!!"""
Path of the Dragons, Next season is really gonna miss Paddy Considine
Path of the Dragons,"You know, I‚Äôm kinda tired of dragons and of all the things I had problems with in the show, the # of dragons wasn‚Äôt even part of it"
Path of the Dragons,Just write a good story.
Path of the Dragons,People in comments acting like s1 was full of dragons. There was actually about 10 minutes of screen time the dragons had
Path of the Dragons,Sunfyre is the one I'm most excited to see.
Path of the Dragons,"Made sense to exclude Sunfyre as Aegon didn't really have much impact to the plot until the final few episodes, whereas most of the other dragons were important to moving the story forward (chomp chomp)."
Path of the Dragons,"Cannibal, Sunfyre and Dreamfyre are almost sure to be some of those 5 new dragons."
Path of the Dragons,Sunfyre is a male dragon
Path of the Dragons,Hopefully they left Sunfyre mostly out of S1 because they want to make sure the CG is given the love it deserves.
Path of the Dragons,I thought we already saw Dreamfyre? Wasn‚Äôt that the one young Aemond saw in the Dragon Pit?
Path of the Dragons,"Technically we've already seen Sunfyre and Dreamfyre. My guesses are Silverwing, Sheepstealer, Tessarion, the Cannibal and Moondancer/Grey Ghost."
Path of the Dragons,"im excited most for tessarion and daeron. Im really hoping they make daeron a good dude compared to his brothers. So far the show pretty much shows the greens being pretty awful, complex sure, but theyre not great people."
Path of the Dragons,Tessarion the Blue Queen has most impact after Sunfyre and Vhagar.
Path of the Dragons,"> Dreamfyre (Drogon, Visceron and Rhaegal‚Äôs mom)

it would be nice if the series confirms this theory."
Path of the Dragons,I thought danys dragons hatched from eggs which were found in the shadowlands beyond Asshai(Jorah says this at Danys wedding to Drogo).. so how could Dreamfyre be their mom?
Path of the Dragons,Benedict Cumberbatch I hope
Path of the Dragons,Chris Pratt. For them all.
Path of the Dragons,"Gotta catch em all, right Jenkins?"
Path of the Dragons,It is their house
Path of the Dragons,For some reason this scene immediately came to mind: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntKtkOE3DLI&t=132s
Path of the Dragons,"Guys guys guys guys guys‚Ä¶I have an idea for season 2. Guys guys guys GUYS GUYS GUYS‚Ä¶it‚Äôs great. Picture this. Visualize this with me!

Imagine‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶dragons‚Ä¶.."
Path of the Dragons,Honestly HOTD made me realise how little I actually cared about the dragons and Targaryens in general (other than Dany) and just wanted more politicking between the houses of the great families of Westeroes. So much of the scheming in HOTD seems to be a step down from the original series (compare Larys to Varys or Little finger or Otto to Tywin).
Path of the Dragons,"This, we need Westoros to feel like a complex and sprawling kingdom of heterogeneous houses with compelling back stories and personal motivations.
That was my favorite part about the setting in the first half of GoT, and why I still love the later books."
Path of the Dragons,"If they follow the books, bext season should have the following houses highly involved in addition to the season 1 houses: >!Lannister, Stark, Baratheon, Arryn, Tully, Blackwood!<"
Path of the Dragons,The next phase of the story will have jockeying for the loyalty of houses
Path of the Dragons,It wouldn't mske sense for him to appear in a major role until season 3 unless they really rush through events.
Path of the Dragons,*vietnam flashback sequence of GOT S7/S8*
Path of the Dragons,Aemond and Daemon are not boring!
Path of the Dragons,"Aemond, Daemon, Viserys, Helaena."
Path of the Dragons,Totally agree. The only interesting characters are the psycho murderers. The show has no heroes and no mystery. It's just a soap opera melodrama that sometimes has a dragon or an action scene. I'm not very excited for more of it.
Path of the Dragons,the time jumps are over. you can relax and keep up now grandad
Path of the Dragons,"there were no confusing time jumps

and this is a smaller story than the mainline asoiaf books. a smaller cast is appropriate."
Path of the Dragons,Hopefully they‚Äôll get a decent show for season 2
Path of the Dragons,Garbage take
Path of the Dragons,"I don‚Äôt know, this seems like yet another example of a news article picking one sentence out of several things the showrunner was asked about, and acting like that was a big announcement or something."
Path of the Dragons,"This is just what happens in the books. As the war goes on, more dragons get involved."
Path of the Dragons,"Uh, this show is based on a book the author wrote, and the author also works on the show. In the book, there are 17 dragons alive at this time, but we just haven‚Äôt seen them all yet. Now that the war is starting, you will see more dragons."
Path of the Dragons,"Clearly you haven't read the books if you think the Dance of the Dragons was the demise of the Targaryens.  I mean, there's a whole second civil war between two Targaryen factions with the Blackfyre Rebellions."
Path of the Dragons,That's exactly what happened in the book.
Path of the Dragons,"All the dragons we've seen so far have had different, unique looks. Not just different colors. So I don't see why it'd be different for any which are added later?"
Path of the Dragons,"Sorry someone hyped you up for that. The encounter between the biggest dragon Vhagar and youngling Arrax in the Stormlands can hardly be called a battle if you ask me, even in the book."
Path of the Dragons,‚ÄúI love this dragon more than I love myself.‚Äù
Path of the Dragons,There is a short still of him in the background at the start of the episode in which Aemond claims Vhagar. Also his silhouette at the end. He's golden with a bit of pink and long straight horns as far as I can remember.
Path of the Dragons,"Sunfyre should have been in the coronation scene, that was the whole point of having that ceremony at the dragon pit. Instead we got the weird meleys scene."
Path of the Dragons,"Pretty sure Dreamfyre is the larger dragon young Aemond sees in the Dragon Pit, though it wasn't named."
Path of the Dragons,"I couldn‚Äôt remember, it has been a few years since I read F&B."
Path of the Dragons,Forgot about that. Not actually sure which dragon that was. Could have been.
Path of the Dragons,Forgot about Moondancer and Tessarion. They‚Äôre very strong candidates.
Path of the Dragons,A little early for Sheepstealer isn't it?
Path of the Dragons,Still better than they ever were in the books.
Path of the Dragons,It would be really cool but if the theory is true their eggs are already long gone at this point in time.
Path of the Dragons,Elissa Farman ran off with 3 eggs of Dreamfyre‚Äôs that she stole. It‚Äôs a common theory supported inconclusively by the text that these are the eggs that Dany eventually hatches. GRRM has refused to confirm or deny.
Path of the Dragons,It‚Äôs a much smaller story so that makes sense.
Path of the Dragons,"Compare where the development of those characters was at the end of the first season of GoT to the end of the first season of HotD. If anything, HotD has developed the characters more because it has a smaller, more focused ensemble, so it can spend a bit more time with each one."
Path of the Dragons,"First season of GoT was Lannisters vs Starks with a sprinkling of other character motives. Same number of factions in the first season of HoTD. 

You will get your politicking and more Houses now that the Dance has begun."
Path of the Dragons,The Targaryens become far more interesting without the dragons. They basically become a regular house and have to play the Game of Thrones far more than they did before
Path of the Dragons,I've been thinking about how some of these obviously very prominent houses don't seem to exist by the time of GoT. So that leads to two conclusions: either they were wiped out (either in this upcoming conflict or sometime after) or they simply weren't mentioned in GoT for whatever reason (such as they declined to the point where they weren't major players at all).
Path of the Dragons,"Season 1 of GoT had mostly the Starks and Lsnnisters politicking around the Baratheons, and later more houses joined.

Similarly HotD had the Hightowers and Velaryons politicking around the Targaryens, and if they follow the story the other houses should get involved."
Path of the Dragons,"I agree, the dragons are the least interesting part of the show for me"
Path of the Dragons,"But that's not the story of HoTD, I am not sure why you are expecting a carbon copy of GoT. This is a civil war story, where the other houses would play an ancillary role."
Path of the Dragons,"I feel like >!Stark and Arryn!< are more likely to get a few key scenes, but they don't really enter in a big way that early in the conflict."
Path of the Dragons,All painfully boring
Moriarty the Patriot,"Who hates Starlight though?

**Edit:** who would‚Äôve expected 4 simple words to get so much feedback? Sounds like people overwhelmingly enjoy Starlight as a character, which I‚Äôm glad to see."
Moriarty the Patriot,This seems like a meme from the boys
Moriarty the Patriot,Why the f would anyone hate Starlight?
Moriarty the Patriot,"I mean, I don't like what they're doing with her character as it seems they can't fully decide what her powers are, or have her make rational decisions but that's not on her at all."
Moriarty the Patriot,Rule 1 as a celebrity: don‚Äôt read the comments.
Moriarty the Patriot,"The [Variety.com](https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/the-boys-erin-moriarty-fan-hate-starlight-1235362487/) article links to a [post on Moriarty's Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/CiMAC6wu7DK/) which has a picture of an [Instagram user's](https://www.instagram.com/butcherscanary/) opinion piece.  The user's Twitter page has a [link](https://medium.com/@butcherscanary/istandwithstarlight-the-betrayal-of-erin-moriarty-by-the-boys-fans-c47c3c4323b9) to the opinion piece on medium.com.

The lede is buried at the end of its fifth paragraph.  The issue is, ""unsolicited commentary on her <Moriarty's> appearance.""  It's not about her character, the plot, or Nazis.  ""Unsolicited commentary on her appearance"" flooding Moriarty's Instagram feed.  The author found it upsetting.  So does Moriarty.

I'll reserve my opinions on unsolicited opinions on her appearance.\*  I will say it was shitty having to jump through so many hoops to get to the damned point.  Dozens of posts here supposing or assuming what the issue is, when it could have been written in the first paragraph of the first link.

\*No I won't.  Would you want to wake up in the morning and see strangers commenting on your appearance?  No?  Then don't do it to her or anyone else.  It's creepy.  Just don't.

&#x200B;

edit:  A lot of people are providing more comments, trying to educate me as to what she may have done to change her appearance and how it affected the show.  Thing is, I don't really care.  The level of my concern is literally a footnote in my post.  I'm infuriated by having to dig eight layers to find out the root cause of the conflict when the Variety author or OP could have stated it up front.  It's a waste of time and if there's one thing I cannot stand, it's wasting time on the Internet."
Moriarty the Patriot,"""I‚Äôve opened up a vein for this role...""

She may be a little dramatic here... lol"
Moriarty the Patriot,"Moriarty:

>I do feel silenced. I do feel dehumanized. I do feel paralyzed. I‚Äôve put blood, sweat, and tears into this role (over & over & over again), I‚Äôve grown UP in this character‚Äôs shoes (\*emphasis on grown up - we change & evolve mentally AND physically). So with that I say: a) thank you to [butcherscanary](https://medium.com/@butcherscanary/istandwithstarlight-the-betrayal-of-erin-moriarty-by-the-boys-fans-c47c3c4323b9) b) this does break my heart - I‚Äôve opened up a vein for this role and the misogynistic trolling is exactly what this role (Annie) would speak out against and c) everyone‚Äôs going through their own battle(s); let‚Äôs not add to that. I will never intentionally (and ESPECIALLY) publicly, add to yours. This has only strengthened my empathy muscle and to anyone who comes at me: I see you, I I don‚Äôt hate you, I only empathize and forgive."
Moriarty the Patriot,"A few months back there were a *lot* of posts about her, accusing her of having had plastic surgery and saying she's ugly now. It was a crazy onslaught that lasted for a week and haven't really seen anything else pop up about it until now."
Moriarty the Patriot,"Wow first time hearing about this, I guess they went on twitter?"
Moriarty the Patriot,"The writing for Starlight‚Äôs character and her conflict with Hughie was just really bad this season, Moriarty is still a good actress"
Moriarty the Patriot,#IStandWithStarlight
Moriarty the Patriot,"I don‚Äôt think anyone really hates her? Her character was just written fairly poorly this season. 

Starlight and MM‚Äôs moral stance against Soldier Boy just didn‚Äôt hold up when clearly Homelander was so much worse. Her powers were also really weak and underwhelming so her character caught some flack for that. 

Unrelated but Erin did get some bad work done on her face and lost a concerning amount of weight between S2 and S3 which was a shame to see. Starlight showing up to S3E1 with a new face made me feel a bit disconnected from the character."
Moriarty the Patriot,Nobody is hating in the character or the actor. This is just click bait drama designed to farm clicks out of nothing.
Moriarty the Patriot,"Alright downvotes inc.. I‚Äôm about the be that guy.

It‚Äôs not the character or the acting, it‚Äôs the terrible plastic surgery that continues to get worse each season. Sorry."
Moriarty the Patriot,Actress with complete access to every single platform with millions of followers: I HAVE BEEN SILENCED
Moriarty the Patriot,"I feel like every headline from this sub that makes it to all is bullshit, these unpopular opinions aren‚Äôt even relevant. Just clickbait that at best features some rando on twitter saying something insensitive.

Can we start moderating this?"
Moriarty the Patriot,Acting as if people are prejudiced against aspects of a show is straight up just a decent marketing tactic now.
Moriarty the Patriot,I actually think it's the opposite! My only dissspoinment with her character was that they didn't make her MORE powerful. That move she did on soldier boy just seemed too weak for all the buildup. Make her stronger and stop setting her powers to look weak!
Moriarty the Patriot,"Meh. Sometimes characters make the hit list and it sucks, but it is what it is. 

Maybe she should spend some time with Wil Wheaton, Alison Arngrim, Jack Gleeson, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen or a host of other actors who got hated on for the role they played. Some were villains, others were just annoying, but it happens and they get a pile of hate heaped on them undeservedly.  

In most cases I don't think it has anything to do with their gender or race, it's just the character rubs people the wrong way and the asshats come out of the woodwork and use whatever works to get under their skin."
Moriarty the Patriot,Lmao we can hate the character without hating the actor. Did jack Gleeson cry about us hating joffrey?
Moriarty the Patriot,"I wonder how much legitimate criticism of her character she is taking to heart when it has nothing to do with her, and everything to do with the writers.

Because at this point, I do hate Starlight, but it's not because of who is portraying her. It's entirely because of the writers completely mishandling her."
Moriarty the Patriot,These ‚Äúfans‚Äù should be going after the writers of The Boys for building up Starlight‚Äôs character and then having almost everything she does be underwhelming. Don‚Äôt blame Erin Moriarty she is just playing a character and is doing the best with what she is given.
Moriarty the Patriot,I understand the sentiment but IDK if I can ever trust someone with that last name.
Moriarty the Patriot,"Just shows you that celebrities are people too, even if 99% of the fan base loves you the ones that hate you will ring the loudest."
Moriarty the Patriot,Do they really hate her?
Moriarty the Patriot,Do people have to get their nuts in a knot about everything.  You can dislike a character without being misogynist.
Moriarty the Patriot,"Just a clickbait article, I‚Äôve never seen anyone complain about starlight"
Moriarty the Patriot,"Imagine feeling silenced and dehumanized by a couple dozen anonymous social media accounts like wtf

**What the fuck happened to ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt feed the trolls‚Äù?**"
Moriarty the Patriot,"The hate I‚Äôve seen is for Starlight‚Äôs power being useless and for her screwing up the plan in season 3, while trying to take the moral high ground over hughie when it doesn‚Äôt make sense.

No one hates Erin as an actress for the role, they just don‚Äôt like that her character gets built up only to not be useful in the mix of things.

Best example of the hate/criticism the character is getting would be Bran in GoT, similarly built up to be powerful but was ultimately a major letdown. Don‚Äôt remember his actor throwing a fit over it though."
Moriarty the Patriot,Where were those misogynists in season 1 and 2? Widespread criticism against Starlight only started in season 3 and only after a couple episodes.
Moriarty the Patriot,"its not ""the boys fans"" its losers on twitter who have no life being loud while the rest of us, the majority, just like the show silently. social media is a lightning rod for mentally ill people who need attention and incessantly need to share their opinions, and when no one gives them attention or validation they turn bitter and throw hate at other people to feel better about themselves. social media is a toxic cesspool, celebrities should know better than to give a shit about it"
Moriarty the Patriot,You can criticize and dislike her character without it being tied to misogyny. What are these people saying?
Moriarty the Patriot,How are you a fan of the boys but also misogynistic? The show literally makes fun of you
Moriarty the Patriot,"I'm completely OOTL on this and the article doesn't help. What exactly is the trolling it is referring to? Were the ""fans"" commenting on her lack of powers? Her weight? What?

I just see an indignant person waving the flag for an actress - which ... Good for them... But it doesn't line up with the headline."
Moriarty the Patriot,She‚Äôs the only character who isn‚Äôt a piece of shit. Genuinely shocked and sad that she‚Äôs experienced backlash for such a good performance.
Moriarty the Patriot,Are these the same people who are pro-Homelander and dont see the subtext about Trump?
Moriarty the Patriot,"Anytime anything is criticized now it's just racism, sexism, etc. The memes came true. I'm sure the criticism is because everyone is sexist, it can't be because of scenes like Starlight using her maximum power to shove Soldier Boy 1 inch back"
Moriarty the Patriot,"No one hates Erin. The only toxicity there was this season was people being concerned for her health due to her extreme change of appearance. She got horrible plastic surgery and lost so much weight where she drastically changed visually, so people were concerned. That's it. This all seems to stem from personal issues that she herself has.

The only other criticism I've seen for starlight is from a character standpoint. Like inconsistency of her powers. But everybody loves Erin. No one hates her, no one's misogynistic towards her. There's crazies in ever Fandom but seriously I've never seen a shred of hate towards Erin. 

Any criticism towards Erin was due to fans being concerned about the insane amount of plastic surgery she got in a year. It's so jarring and pronounced that Amazon put a smoothing filter on her face on multiple scenes. She also had a massive weight loss so people were scared that she was anorexic or unhappy. It all came from a place of love. Her being upset is obviously about this conjecture seeing as she emphasized ""growing and changing"".

I'm all for body positivity but if a public figure alters their appearance drastically then people will comment. Hardly anything came from a place of hate, and if there was any hatred it was the .0001% of fans that are trolls. People questioned Mackey Rourke crazy plastic surgery too, it's not sexist. If anything Erin I one of the most beloved actors on the show which is why there was concern. And most of the comments were supportive, just concerned that she altered her appearance so much and lost so much weight to near anorexic levels at the same time. It's obvious she's having some issues with herself and projecting them upon all fans just because she saw a handful of criticism for her plastic surgery. 

I'm so tired of seeing actors supported to godlike degrees yet still screaming racism, sexism, and whatnot. No one's more privileged than actors like Erin. No one's more supported than beloved actors like Erin. Yet she gets a bit of criticism from crazies or genuine concern from loving fans and labels all fans misogynistic? Seriously?"
Moriarty the Patriot,"Holy shit, let people like or dislike whatever characters they want."
Moriarty the Patriot,"Personally I've not heard anything negative about the show at all. It must be horrible to hear negative things about your work, but these people are a very vocal minority. Just ignore these fucks. It's a disservice to the good people you do like the show and character to moan about these dicks."
Moriarty the Patriot,Life imitates art.
Moriarty the Patriot,This is some quality meta shit right here. Life imitating art.
Moriarty the Patriot,"I like her. Her character this season was pretty shit tho, but that‚Äôs on the writers not her."
Moriarty the Patriot,I say fake news just to keep people fighting and talking about The Boys.
Moriarty the Patriot,People hate starlight? when characters like stormfront are in the show??
Moriarty the Patriot,"Uhhh, what?Never seen anyone say something negative about Starlight. Another one of these articles where 5 people on Twitter apparently equates to the entire internet."
Moriarty the Patriot,"So I‚Äôm seeing a lot of articles about her look changing or her getting surgery. Most of the articles below are written by women. I can‚Äôt really say that it‚Äôs misogyny that people are talking about her looks. Labeling it as misogynists talking about her is wrong and off putting to cry wolf.

That said it would suck to have anyone talking about your looks online regardless of why

Moriarty the Patriot,Unless they hate all the women in the show it‚Äôs not misogyny
Moriarty the Patriot,"Don‚Äôt give idiots credibility 
there will always be people who are the loud idiot minority. Social media gives them a megaphone. Can we not just stop listening to the fringe and treating it like it‚Äôs a normal or a relevant representation of how the vast majority think?"
Moriarty the Patriot,"The best solution? Don't take character criticism as actor criticism. Separate yourself from your character.

Hating Starlight, if anyone even does, shouldn't mean anything to Erin personally. This is silly."
Moriarty the Patriot,"Honestly I don‚Äôt remember seeing any massive hate about her at all this season? Like a couple of times people were like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs dumb Starlight!‚Äù, but it‚Äôs not any different then all the other dumb shit the main cast does or say."
Moriarty the Patriot,She's mostly just plain and kind of boring. But that's the writers fault not the actresses
Moriarty the Patriot,"I'll add to this PR. ""The Misadventures of The Boys and Starlight!"""
Moriarty the Patriot,All it takes is one person on twitter to complain about something mundane like this then suddenly it‚Äôs ‚Äúmisogynistic racist alt right trolls HATE thing you love!‚Äù And this not only pulls away from them from any and all criticism and also generates clicks as well. They literally use hate to fuel online traffic it‚Äôs disgusting.
Moriarty the Patriot,"She's one of the more compelling characters on the show. She represents that ""good girl"" in popular culture‚ÄîBritney Spears in '99, who breaks bad, in her own way, and risks everything like Jane Fonda in '73. Her superpowers are kind of meh, but her story arc is fantastic."
Moriarty the Patriot,"I'll admit I disliked starlight...this season, I think she was great the previous seasons. To be fair though the reasons I disliked her had more to do with how the producers made her act as apposed to the actress herself."
Moriarty the Patriot,Pretty sure she‚Äôs more upset people were making fun of her plastic surgery and some rumour that they had to beauty filter her face the whole third season.
Moriarty the Patriot,Most Starlight criticism I‚Äôve seen has been about what appears to be plastic surgery the actress had done. I haven‚Äôt seen much criticism of the character itself.
Moriarty the Patriot,"No one hates Starlight. 

People hate bad writers and bad writing. Big power-up just to slightly push a guy backwards and fall down? No effective use of her powers at any point?

Who the fuck twisted reality and lied to her?"
Moriarty the Patriot,Can't you hate a character for being stupid?
Moriarty the Patriot,"Lol I swore this was a bit at first, where are these thousands of imaginary fans of the boys who hate starlight? 

Unreal you can write an article on manufactured controversy because of a dozen mean Instagram comments and tweets by incel dumb asses as if that‚Äôs comparable to the overwhelming amount of fans who like her and her very popular character

The fact the writer and actress herself strongly imply she‚Äôs being let down by the boys and her costars is deranged, what are they supposed to do, police her comments on her posts?"
Moriarty the Patriot,"2 questions: Who hates Starlight, and what does Erin feel silenced about?

Seems like she's giving the vocal minority a lot more credit and attention than they deserve."
Moriarty the Patriot,I don‚Äôt hate the character but every time anything happens with her she just glows her eyes and I‚Äôm confused as to what she‚Äôs actually capable of so it feels cringe every time‚Ä¶ but I don‚Äôt understand and have not heard of any hate in her lol.. feels like a reach tbh
Moriarty the Patriot,Isn‚Äôt that the point of her character?
Moriarty the Patriot,"Much like fight club, a significant percentage of The Boys fandom doesn‚Äôt get that they are the ones the show is saying are villainous."
Moriarty the Patriot,"This thread is the perfect example as to why The Boys discussion has turned insufferable and why most people won't engage with it.

You guys know that it is perfectly possible to consume a work of fiction without interjecting your irl opinions and events all the time? That some of us couldn't give an flying fuck about any narrative and just like to see the spectacle? Is that too much to handle?"
Moriarty the Patriot,Can I not like Starlight AND not be mysoginistic?
Moriarty the Patriot,The Boys actually has better written females than many other shows
Moriarty the Patriot,They are deliberately looking hard for hate content on Starlight because I haven‚Äôt seen a peep about it. Agenda pushing needs to stop.
Moriarty the Patriot,"Maybe don‚Äôt assume that people who don‚Äôt like starlight are misogynists because she‚Äôs a strong female character?‚Ä¶ I could legitimately see a number of reasons why a person might not find her character particularly compelling. I like her, but she‚Äôs not exactly my favorite either.

Maybe just ignore negative criticism like a healthy and well adjusted adult. Some people won‚Äôt like you or the character you play. Deal with it."
Moriarty the Patriot,"The easiest way to get free press for your TV show these days is to say ‚Äúwhy are fans okay with (RIDICULOUS FANTASY ELEMENT OF SHOW), but not a character who is not a straight white male?‚Äù"
Moriarty the Patriot,People hating a fictional character shouldn't make you feel anything
Moriarty the Patriot,"Back when she was upset with Hughie for being a dick to her because of his insecurities like all of r/TheBoys was shitting on her because ""I would do the same thing if I were him"". I felt insane in the discussion threads"
Moriarty the Patriot,She talking irl or like in the show?
Moriarty the Patriot,"I think her character hasn't be handled well, I feel like Kripke and co doesn't know what to do with her, a clear example of this is the fight in the final episode of season three when >!she used her superpowers with Hughie's help and tried to harm Soldier Boy, all she did was push him and he wasn't harmed!< (but to be a little fair, he is indestructible so it wouldn't be that easy at all to destroy him) but still, that scene was underwhelming, they could have done so much better. 

I think it's valid for the fans to voice their opinion about how she could be written so much better but I've seen hate towards Erin, not the character, people making some rude comments about her appearance calling her anorexic and drug addict, I've seen these rude comments on this sub and r/TheBoys, even on Twitter and Youtube and It's disrespectful."
Moriarty the Patriot,Starlight is both my and my bf‚Äôs fave character
Moriarty the Patriot,I think this helps me understand why the knee jerk reaction to women being criticised is that the critics are sexist. She‚Äôs a good character and decently written while perfectly acted. These fucking trolls make proper criticism difficult to Separate from sexism.
Moriarty the Patriot,Starlight is my favorite
Moriarty the Patriot,WHAT THE FUCK? Starlight is one of the best characters in the show
Moriarty the Patriot,"Even better: they‚Äôll find a way to incorporate this into the show, or at least into one of its brilliantly satirical Vaught news updates, only further burning the Incels that don‚Äôt like her."
Moriarty the Patriot,Again internet doesn't represent what people think .Twitter is a minority of a minority .We don't know who is behind an  account so stop taking what the internet is saying seriously
Moriarty the Patriot,"If anything, her mom should be hated for keeping too many secrets from Starlight"
Moriarty the Patriot,Had no idea some people didn‚Äôt like starlight
Moriarty the Patriot,"How can anyone watch The Boys and hate Annie? What the actual fuck? Fuck those fans, Im gonna gatekeep right here and say if you watch the show and are still misogynistic you didn‚Äôt really watch it and aren‚Äôt a fan‚Ä¶"
Moriarty the Patriot,"I agree, who tf hates starlight ? Butttt‚Ä¶ its a tv show viewers are supposed to like or dislike characters"
Moriarty the Patriot,How can anyone hate starlight
Moriarty the Patriot,"Amazon must be suggesting this show to the people with the worst media literacy. Like literally season 1 story includes misogyny, her reckoning with religion and it‚Äôs role in misogyny, and the deep being a perv. A large part of this show is the standard women live to vs men"
Moriarty the Patriot,Unfortunately it appears life is imitating art.
Moriarty the Patriot,Is this actually playing out like the show? Dafuq are these guys like that stepdad to MM‚Äôs daughter?
Moriarty the Patriot,"Why would anyone hate her, she‚Äôs a literal guiding light for hughie"
Moriarty the Patriot,Life imitating art?
Moriarty the Patriot,"I wasn‚Äôt a fan of her character in season 3, but it‚Äôs not against the character just the plot really. I don‚Äôt like when main characters take moral high grounds against other main characters, it‚Äôs just an annoying plot line for me."
Moriarty the Patriot,"I feel like they did her character dirty in s3. She seemed to take a backseat for the most part, and her climax scene was kind of a let down. But that's the writer's fault"
Moriarty the Patriot,Wait! what? People hate starlight? I'm sorry Erin I don't believe you.
Moriarty the Patriot,"I just think starlight is the weakest main character, I don't mind the actor playing her."
Moriarty the Patriot,"This is absurd. Maybe a couple of outlier dicks have been saying mean things, but that always happens! Why is she so focused on what they're saying? She's literally a movie star, get over it."
Moriarty the Patriot,"I don‚Äôt dislike character, but the acting is weird, everyone else in the show feels pretty real, but Starlight‚Äôs dialogue feels like it‚Äôs from a soap opera or something imo"
Moriarty the Patriot,The people that complain about Starlight are not complaining because she is a woman. It's because they write her bad sometimes. For example in the finale against SB she had her big moment with a big buildup to her superpower. What happened? She only knocked him on his ass for 2 seconds. All that buildup for nothing.
Moriarty the Patriot,Her powers are pretty lame. Boohoo.

Im Standing on a Million Lives,"Variety is clear in their report that it comes from a mix of Nielsen ratings and HBO Max streaming

>‚ÄúThe White Lotus‚Äù Season 2 finale drew record high viewership for the HBO drama, scoring 4.1 million U.S. viewers Sunday.  
>  
>That‚Äôs up a whopping 46% from the series‚Äô previous best, which was the sixth and penultimate episode of the Sicily-set second season on Dec. 5. For Season 2 Episode 6 of ‚ÄúThe White Lotus,‚Äù 2.8 million viewers tuned in that Sunday night, a number calculated from a combination of Nielsen‚Äôs measurement of linear viewing on the linear HBO channel and Warner Bros. Discovery‚Äôs proprietary viewership data for streaming on HBO Max.

[https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/white-lotus-finale-ratings-season-2-1235457986/](https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/white-lotus-finale-ratings-season-2-1235457986/)"
Im Standing on a Million Lives,Nielsen's accreditation was revoked last year for unreliable data. Big take away Nielsen ratings isn't accurate They do not accurately track and never tracked every viewer.  It's data collected from pool of willing participants whose watch habits are put in statics to drive ad sales.
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"HBO Max asked not to be included on the list. And I don't know even if they were included, they'd have enough viewers to even place."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"Nielsen hasn't been reliable for the last decade at least. So, no."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,No. Why are you thinking that?
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"What many don't realize is ratings are mostly irrelevant to a subscription business model.  All that matters is having loyal subscribers, with low churn.  It actually doesn't matter if they watch, just that they keep,the subscription going.  And HBO excels at keeping long term subs going.

Think of it like a gym membership.  The gym doesn't make more or less depending on how much the members show up, they make their money as long as members don't cancel.  Member stay home month after month instead of working out?  Doesn't matter to the gym's bottom line.  

HBO just needs to have prestige offerings that keep subscribers from cancelling.  Ratings is a quite indirect metric to them."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,HBO doesn‚Äôt care about live viewers
Im Standing on a Million Lives,Fucking Nielsen üòÇ
Im Standing on a Million Lives,I always watch it the next morning on Max while I‚Äôm on the treadmill.
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"I don't know about lying or anything but I am one of the very few people who didn't find Season 2 all that interesting.  It wasn't bad, but it was the same old ""Look at the rich douches be rich douches""  MO in a different locale.

The finale was so slowly-paced I almost fell asleep."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,Seriously? Manifest over white lotus? What kind of idiots are they polling. I guess white lotus is too erudite? I thought manifest was awful. Terrible acting and impossibly slow.
Im Standing on a Million Lives,Probably because it looks super boring and no one take about it like GOT or anything special
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"What HBO lie about ratings? I just saw the Nancy Pelosi documentary already has 132.5 million viewers, one of the highest in HBO history and it doesn't even run until tomorrow night!"
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"So sad that Stifler‚Äôs mom had to die, what a great comeback for her."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"HBO shows are being axed left and right at the moment as part of the Warner/Discovery merger cost cutting drive.

If The White Lotus was performing badly we'd hear about it. Personally I gave up on both seasons half way through(I like Mike White so gave the series a second shot this year)."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,Nielsen is outdated.
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"Idk I haven‚Äôt talked about this show with anyone but my IG was filled with memes from my friends yesterday. I think a ton of people watched it! Sure, it wasn‚Äôt as strong as season 1 but it was a lot of fun."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,haha nielsen... crooks.
Im Standing on a Million Lives,People aren't watching it on the cable tv channel. Cable is dead...
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"The Neilsons are a load of crap. They might have been accurate a long long time ago before cable and DVR's and the sheer amount of people viewing but there's no way their magic formula accurately predicts who is watching what with the sample size of reporting they actually have. 

When I was in college for broadcasting I was considering researching the Neilsons for my Masters thesis to disprove their system works even back then. No way its accurate today after the explosion of options and even more people watching. 

(I never did the research or get the degree but their being removed from accreditation validates my opinion. )"
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"I see a lot of people talking about it on twitter when its on, so I believe it."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,Bloys said only a year ago that Euphoria was an anomaly as around 75% of its viewership came via streaming. He mentioned it was 50/50 for most HBO shows.
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"All that confirms is that the data is being leaked to Variety from WBD themselves and they are issuing Nielsen data for linear and their own data for streaming. What counts as a ‚Äúview‚Äù in this situation is anybodies guess? Remember the old days when Netflix counted 2 minutes as a view? Without a defined metric we have no idea what WBD considers a ‚Äúview‚Äù to be in their internal metrics. 

I think the weekly Nielsen data will give us a clearer picture of how The White Lotus stacks up directly against other shows."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,What I never understand is how these hbo shows keep getting ‚Äúbest ratings for an episode yet!‚Äù Headlines. Are people seriously jumping in to serialized dramas towards the end of the season?
Im Standing on a Million Lives,Their data has always been shit. Not everyone who watches TV is a nuclear family with 2.5 kids and a dog. But that seems to be the majority of their ‚Äúsample‚Äù audience.
Im Standing on a Million Lives,With online engagement growing. And streaming being a thing more and more shows were cancelled due to low views only to find out Nielsen was wrong and they actually had huge audiences
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"The ""why"" is because media companies are getting tired of Nielson and if they can avoid working with them, they will. [Warner earlier this year dropped Nielson for ad measurements.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradadgate/2022/01/20/networks-and-advertisers-are-looking-to-replace-nielsen/?sh=4b334d0381bb)"
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"> HBO Max asked not to be included on the list.

HBO Max has been included for the second half of this year, at least in the acquired charts. *Game of Thrones*, *House of the Dragon*, *Friends* and *The Big Bang Theory* have all charted in there for several weeks since being included."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,HBO are now active in Nielsen. As are Peacock. The only major holdout now is Paramount.
Im Standing on a Million Lives,[deleted]
Im Standing on a Million Lives,They said why they are thinking it. (Whether they are right or wrong is another matter I have no knowledge about.)
Im Standing on a Million Lives,Because they‚Äôre lying.
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"Yup. As long as a subscriber perceives some value and stays, the actual viewership number doesn't matter. It's not an advertiser revenue model"
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"A gym doesn't mind if people subscribe and then stay home, but it also wants to keep those who actually do come happy. If you have a smelly gym with old equipment people are going to drop out and go to the better gym down the block. You need to maintain the equipment and even bring in new stuff. Content on streaming is like that equipment. If you don't maintain it eventually people get the impression that your streaming gym isn't that great and consider ending their subscription."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,It's definitely the opposite of super boring
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"I'm not going to lie, I was starting to find her kind of annoying by mid-season. She had some great lines at the end though."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,White Lotus seems to be hitting a pretty similar demographic as Euphoria.
Im Standing on a Million Lives,You‚Äôve never binge watched a show to catch up and watch the last couple episodes live?
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"Yes lol I didn‚Äôt start this season until like ep 2 or 3 bc I knew I had time then I watched week to week 

Soooo much better then feeling u need to binge a season in day, ppl got lives lol"
Im Standing on a Million Lives,Yes.
Im Standing on a Million Lives,I mean I understand it for a show like house of the dragon but not really a show like white lotus
Im Standing on a Million Lives,Its been a growing problem for 15 years. The sample size doesn't reflect the actually population.  DVR wasn't counted up till 5 years ago or so.
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"Since the linked article is almost a year old, I can give an update.  The major tv company I work for is starting an overlapping trial run, reporting to both Nielsen and ComScore.  Some smaller networks might become FAST or exclusively ComScore but we still have to see if Madison Avenue (ad sales) will accept alternate currency on the  bigger networks."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"The streaming ratings chart is a different chart than the OP is talking about; it's based on amount of time watched rather than actual number of viewers. Weekly shows are less likely to place on that chart than all-at-once releases just because of there being less new stuff to watch at once, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're actually getting less viewership. (It's just more spread out.) Also, I'm not sure where you're even seeing the Movies chart; the only options for me are Streaming, TV, Advertising, and Games."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"What would they achieve by lying? It's good, bad show? Number too high?

Edit: I checked premises seems like bunch of rich people on vacation drama, meh. I could care less."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"HBO spaces out and strings out their tent pole shows over months and years.  The White Lotus just wrapped but nobody will cancel because The Last Of Us is starting soon.  When it ends, Succession will come a couple weeks later, etc."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"All of that means nothing if you're trying to imply HBO is the ""smelly gym"" of the subscription business, which is utterly false.  

HBO has prestige programs, but if you were to look closely, they really only fill just one evening of programming per week.  It doesn't matter though because their ""gym"" is considered to be state of the art."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"Agreed. HBO Max is going to have creator consequences at some point. HBO has always been a prestige brand that reputation is crunbling under Zaslav. 

Canceling shows happens, removing them from the platform, not airing nearly completed projects is different. Westworld had dipping ratings, I understand why it got cancelled. It does feel like a disservice to not at least finish with a short season or movie.

Regardless, it was a HBO flagship show and they are removing it entirely.

If i was a creator or talent I wouldn't want to sign up for that potential if i had the choice. 

If Apple capitalizes they can fill the void of high quality television. HBO is not maintaining the equipment and spitting in members face."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,Even shared some of the same cast.
Im Standing on a Million Lives,White Lotus is a who done it mystery.  If you miss the finale you can‚Äôt talk about it on Monday.
Im Standing on a Million Lives,Closer to murder mystery but sure
Im Standing on a Million Lives,It's a phenomenal show
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"It's why it's been the best pay channel/app for decades. They figured out scheduling and peak viewing days without ad interference years ago. Even with the new parent companies over the years, they've maintained a curated catalog of hits."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,I mean because of this I just sub a few months per year.  I‚Äôm not paying for a year round sub when I have already seen the back catalog.  HBO is not putting out enough new original content to justify a full time sub.  It is only worth it if the back catalog is new to you.
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"I wasn't implying anything about HBO specifically, I was merely pointing out the flaw in your logic using your analogy. No gym nor streaming service can just rest on their laurels hoping people just forget they're subscribed to them, they have to give people reasons to subscribe, stay subscribed and actually come to the gym/streaming service on a regular basis.

And HBO doesn't only program one night. Sundays is still the main night, but they also expanded into Monday recently, they run comedy specials and stuff like Bill Maher over the weekend, they have movies, and since they started HBO Max they have stuff coming out during the week as well (e.g. I tihnk Hacks would drop, like, Wednesdays). All this expansion was their version of how a gym might buy new equipment, offer new programs/classes etc. 

The complicated part about running a state of the art ""gym"" is that it has to stay state of the art."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"Westworld hasn‚Äôt been a flagship show in years, and I‚Äôm willing to bet the numbers reflect that- I‚Äôm sure as soon as I ask this, half a dozen people will come out the woodwork to offer anecdotal evidence that doesn‚Äôt really mean shit, but I‚Äôll ask anyway: how many people do you think rewatch Westworld? How many do you think meaningfully engage with the show as a whole, and watch past the first season? The answer to that is likely incredibly few people do, otherwise they wouldn‚Äôt be getting ready to take it off the platform. 

Reddit seems convinced that Zaslav is at war with art, that he gets off stomping on all the pretty things of the world but that is simply not true. Discovery is just having to be financially practical in a business where very few are; if streaming is going to still be around by 2030, then the other guys are going to start doing the same cuts too."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"You'd be in a minority.  HBO subscribers tend to be on autopilot for years.  

> It is only worth if the back catalog is new to you

That's an even more minority position.  I promise you that many, many subscribers love re-watching Oz, The Wire, The Sopranos and dozens more series.  They don't lose any worth when they're no longer ""new""."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"The person I was arguing with deleted their comment but I wrote all this shit out so I'll just argue with myself lol...


> HBO isn't a some crappy run down gym that nobody likes.

You're bizarrely focusing on this as if I specifically meant that HBO was bad and not just using this as an example for why people wouldn't go to a gym. You can move on from this, as I never meant that HBO specifically was bad right now.

>HBO has mastered the craft of stringing one season after another, one hit program after another. How you going to claim they're ""resting on their laurels""?

Do you even know what that expression means? Resting on one's laurels means not putting any extra effort in because you believe what you've already done is enough. That is pretty much exactly what you said. If HBO only has to fill one night of programming and keep a bare minimum of ""prestige"" TV flowing, how is that not resting on their laurels?

I don't even agree that this is what they're doing ironically, but that is what you said.

>HBO feature programs add up to one night's worth of programming. Old movies and really old standup re-runs are not what we're talking about. Nor are HBO Max dumps. I never said HBO airs their A list programs all on one night, just that if you added them up over the course of a week, it works out to one full evening of marquee programming.

You actually didn't say that it adds up to one full night of programming.

Also that feels like a moving target. What is one night of programming to you? The old broadcast days of 8 to 11PM? Or something else that would more suitably fit your narrative? 

Not that it really matters because you're just wrong about this. Whether you add it up in hours, minutes, or whatever else it's way more than one night of programming. A broadcasting hour is 40 minutes of contents + commercials, more or less. That's 2 hours on a standard night. HBO often has more content then that on Sundays alone.

It also feels kind of absurd to write off a lot of their content the way you just did. It's not ""old"" movies and standup, for instance they literally just put a new standup special one this past weekend from Atsuko Okatsuka (haven't gotten around to watching it yet but saw her live this past summer, she's really funny). They make original movies, WB movies premiere on Max now (for a while there they were even releasing movies day-and-date). HBO Max ""dumps"" include consensus great shows like Hacks and Peacemaker. Not to mention talk shows like Maher, Oliver, documentaries, reality shows. They're even streaming goddamn Sesame Street. 

We can argue all day and night how much of that is ""prestige"" but all of that is part of the reasons people have to stay subscribed. One or two ""prestige"" shows a week is not enough to justify a subscription anymore."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"Much like we only have anecdotal evidence about people who still want to watch/rewatch Westworld, we don't really have any concrete information about how removing it entirely from streaming existence is a sound financial move on Zaslav's part. They haven't really confirmed why they're doing this shit, only speculation about tax write-offs and saving on creator residuals. Just because they did it doesn't mean it makes sense, people and corporations make shitty financial decisions all the time. We can assume it makes short term financial sense if their aim is to drastically reduce costs now, but you can't deny that they're risking doing long-term damage to their business and brand."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"I understand the canceling, it sucks, I disagree with it but i understand it.

Removing it from the platform is something else. Tons of people put a lot of work into that. That is at war with art even if it isn't the intent (the bottom line obviously is). It also was once their flagship, the first season being one of my favorite seasons of TV and met with critical acclaim.

From a creators/talent perspective that is off putting that the work we did can be removed or a show/movie that's nearly done in production can be junked."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"Westworld s4 averaged 4 million viewers an episode. Way down from its peak audience but shows like Succession s3 and Winning Time were only averaging 6 million an episode. 

Westworld was not performing great but it was not doing that much worse than some of HBO‚Äôs other most recognisable shows. The thing that hurt Westworld was the season on season degradation and the very high production costs. It was a flagship show but it was not delivering flagship numbers by the 4th season. 

Pulling it entirely from HBO Max is still a weird choice as it remains one of the networks most recognisable shows."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"The Nielsen ratings for TV, which people are maligning in other posts, showed a 75% drop in viewership between season 1 and 4."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"But why, if something isn‚Äôt being watched in the numbers necessary to justify its hosting, should a show stay on streaming in perpetuity? Look at regular old tv- does Taxi still air in primetime on NBC or has it be quietly phased out of the schedule entirely? Shows end, and they get pulled from the air, it‚Äôs the circle of life. Maybe they‚Äôll bring back limited edition home media releases, but then again that‚Äôll probably go over like a lead balloon too, since the internet hates any kind of change from the norm whatsoever"
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"And? HBO Max launched while the show was on the air and Nielsen still doesn't really know how to accurately measure streaming audiences. Most people watched S1 linearly and S4 on streaming.

Of course viewership (and quality) dropped and frankly I don't even blame them for cancelling the show (although HBO should be above that four seasons into a big show and just let them finish it) but that doesn't justify nuking it off their platform entirely either."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"I don't want to go all Lucille Bluth on you but how much could hosting it in perpetuity really cost? I'm sure hosting costs considerable money but it's not at all the same as dedicating primetime broadcast time to an old show. The math in primetime involves the opportunity cost of ad sales and is drastically limited to 2-3 hours a night. Whereas the entire point of streaming is that those shows are meant to live there in perpetuity as a feature for anyone who wants to watch them at any time. Taxi is readily available on Paramount+, to use your example, and I'm sure many fewer people are watching that than a big profile HBO show that literally just ended.

And if the argument is that they can use this as a form of marketing to artificially create scarcity in order to re-release it, then that isn't ""change"", that's just kowtowing to corporate greed."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"The show just recently ended for one. It's just really bad optics, again if I'm a creator I understand the risk of my show not getting renewed/canceled. Obviously if it comes to that you hope you're told ahead of time to wrap things up but that's not always possible.

The risk of it being removed is another level entirely. Especially for the HBO brand which has a certain reputation, a bottom line grab like this to avoid royalties to cast/crew and just from a art stand point sucks.

There could be a business argument for it for sure but it's at complete odds with the creators. It also very well could make you lose out on talent in the long run hurting your business model.

If you do enough of this you burn everyone even if it's smaller shows consumers and creators alike."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"Nielsen does have a measurement of streaming shows, that includes HBO Max. It's just that Westworld stopped being popular and was super expensive to make. House of the Dragon appeared in top positions in that Nielsen streaming rating, for example. 

Now for the why they're taking Westworld out of the streaming, it's because Warner Bros Discovery is broke and needs to cut costs wherever it can. Having the show available on streaming means paying residuals to the cast and production company, so they took it off. They did already with some less popular movies (The Witches remake, Locked Down) and series (The Nevers, which I liked). They have access to the streaming numbers better than anyone. Very few people must have been watching that and the number of people unsubscribing due to that must be smaller than the residuals of recent properties. 

WBD last quarterly result showed a loss of 2 billion dollars, debt of 55 billion and market capitalization of 22 billion. WBD must cut corners and invest very, very wisely, because its debt is getting more expensive and a recession is coming. I do wonder if having a streaming service of their own was wise. Only Netflix has so far made it profitable, and very recently at that. The other services are all burning cash, which was fine when interest rates were zero and venture capital funded anything technological. Now, with a looming recession, with this inflation and with WBD being the worst media company in financial terms? I predict HBO Max's library is going to get smaller and the service might even be sold or discontinued on the long run."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"The costs WBD wants to cut by taking things off the air are concentrated mostly on residuals, the payments that are made to cast and crew of the show while it reruns or is available on streaming platforms. 

WBD is heavily, heavily in debt and bleeding money (last quarterly report had a loss of 2 billion dollars). We're talking about a company that has 22 billion in market capitalization and 55 billion in debt. The company has to make investments to remain operational, but it's also going to cut lots of costs, abd it's going to invest only on the best, most sure thing properties. That's why Zaslav talks so much about Superman, Harry Potter and is axing other less known  properties, even when they're related (DCEU Black Adam, Batgirl or Fantastic Beasts)."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"I'd like to reiterate, fuck Caillou."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,here's a [good read on Total Drama Island](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/uptttz/animation_the_tragedy_of_total_drama_reunion_how/) from the r/HobbyDrama subreddit
Im Standing on a Million Lives,This was a great read.
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"That was quite the word vomit, and I remember Teletoon fondly as a kid watching it on weekends during sleepovers at friends places. How are you going to write all that and not mention some greats like:

-	Roughnecks (Animated Starship Troopers)
-	The Oblongs
-	Undergrads
-	Mission Hill
-	The Critic
-	Tripping the Rift

And some weirder ones like Home Movies, Quads!, and god knows what else I can‚Äôt quite remember. I do recall Cybersix being a little over my head as a kid though and thought the main character was actually a dude for awhile lol.

Edit - I also rewatched the entirety of Roughnecks recently and it actually holds up pretty damn well. The voice acting is done well, and even though the CGI is from that era, it was really well done. I had never seen it all the way through when I was younger due to missing episodes and their infamously bad release schedule, but it was well worth the time to watch. The last season got cut short and it could have ended more cleanly, but I still enjoyed it thoroughly even after all these years."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"I was there for the silver age. 

I really liked Delilah and Julius. 

And one I didn't see mentioned later on was Detentionaire. Came in 2011-2015 and was pretty good."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"I remember watching Undergrads and Clone high on Teletoon, you mentioned so many shows I totally forgot about....What a loss, but it was time."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,Teletoon was such a big part of my childhood. I used to watch scooby doo every day after school.
Im Standing on a Million Lives,Neds newt was the shit. You missed Dragon Ball
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"Omg I forgot about Megababies. The theme song immediately started playing in my head. I LOVED Braceface and For Better Or For Worse! Ugh I grew up on Teletoon, from the mid/late nineties till about 2004. This post was so nostalgic."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"This post was a huge nostalgia trip for myself. Just thinking back there are so many shows that I enjoyed that actually were Teletoon originals and I just didn't realize it - it's kind of amazing! Teletoon circa 2005 through 2009 was my favourite period, mostly because of all the cool action-adventure shows that premiered in that time. I loved watching Chaotic, Bakugan, Spider Riders, Atomic Betty, and Skyland. I did also enjoy 6teen, the first season of Total Drama Island, and Johnny Test, but I never watched them consistently. From their earlier blocks, I will always have a soft spot for The Tofus, What About Mimi, What's with Andy (though admittedly I mostly watched the Romanian dub for this), Rescue Heroes, Maggie and the Ferocious Beast, The Kids from Room 402 (mostly the Romanian dub again)...and the theme song from Flying Rhino Junior High will still occasionally get stuck in my head :P 

I just hope that all these shows will be made more accessible for more folks to enjoy in future and not get put into an inconspicuous vault/removed from streaming without warning."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,I just bought the entire Redwall book series. 20+ books. Hoping it gets another shot at the screen because it's prime for adaptation imo
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"I grew up in Quebec and teletoon was my childhood. I remember it had the best animated series out there even before series that had continuity(not episodic) was a thing. Redwall, silvering and toad patrol were amazing."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"My parents didnt want to get more than the basic tv package, we didnt have the Teletoon channels, much to my chagrin.

Channel 44 for us, I think that was the french version.

We had to make do with VrakTv (25) and YTV (70?)."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,Anyone remember Untalkative Bunny? That's the first thing that comes to mind when I think of Teletoon
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"Man I thought I was the only one who remembered Mega Babies.

Also shout out to weeknights from 8-9pm when The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show was on."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,Delta state was the shit!
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"Don't forget Clone High! The late night era with Undergrads, Oblongs, Mission hill and Clone High was the best."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,Dragon Ball was on YTV
Im Standing on a Million Lives,I knew I was forgetting one. Clone High was amazing.
Im Standing on a Million Lives,It was on both actually
Im Standing on a Million Lives,I seem to remember Sons of Butcher playing in that era with those shows but that might‚Äôve been YTV
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"Ah, I see now. They aired 13 episodes in 1997. So yeah you're *technically* correct, but I think most Canadian kids who grew up in that era would remember it as a YTV show."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,Saw that too and I swear they had more than 14 episodes. It was a long time ago so who knows
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"Really really interesting, but this is so inside baseball I bet most people here wouldn‚Äôt care."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"RTL played a massive part in getting the Sixties swinging in the UK. The BBC didn't generally play pop music, but the English language Radio Luxembourg *did* and could be picked up easily on the UK."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"4 years ago when I first started browsing Reddit, this sub was more of a place where people used to care about these sort of things. It's gotten more mainstream now ig."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"This is how commercial television in the Netherlands started in the 1980s. Legally the TV network called RTL was from Luxemburg and thus operated as a foreign TV channel. Every morning at 6 am they showed a 15 minute Luxemburg language program. This went on for years until Dutch law was finally changed to allow commercial networks.


It is funny how such a small country had an enormous media impact."
Im Standing on a Million Lives,To be fair this article is solely about European television. So doubly isolated from popular American concerns.
Im Standing on a Million Lives,"This is one of my favorite shows out right now. I like the British one a little more, but watch them both equally!"
Im Standing on a Million Lives,Good! It's great show
Im Standing on a Million Lives,I was so confused for a second as there are already four series. I hadn't realised that the US had done their own version
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"Another way to write this headline 
‚ÄúHBO had the biggest hits on TV for 2nd consecutive year‚Äù"
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"HBO needs to teach their movie counterparts (WB) the importance of screenwriters, because they‚Äôre the ones responsible for delivering quality! HOTD and TLOU are so damn good!"
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,Maybe this will make execs notice you should be hiring writers who love your ip and not writers who hate it/just use it as a vehicle for their own shit ideas.
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"Sony to Neil be like ""please make part 3, we have consoles to sell & more money to make!"""
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"I knew it!

&#x200B;

Second season, just like Dragon, is gonna be huge, man HBO just doesn't miss."
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"Well deserved.

I for one am so happy they didn't mess with the story.  Too many adaptations just do lip service to the source material and end up being completely different.  This just upsets the existing fanbase, especially when the adaptation is bad to boot.    Here they had a stellar story and didn't mess with it often recreating scenes that were near identical to the game.    It was so awesome seeing it come to life without significant changes other than cutting things for brevity.    

Here's hoping they do the second game similar justice as it's story is just as worthy of being adaptated straight up though I can see how they might tinker with way they tell the story in that they'll show the stories of the dual protagonists at the same time rather than separately."
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"Discovery really underestimated HBO, I hope this means that they aren't going to try and control more in the merger and still take risks on shows."
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"You know what's the best feeling in the world after every good news about this show? 

It's knowing that the salt mine that is The Last of Us 2 subreddit are seething with hate. Absolutely love it. 

Good news. Can't wait for season 2."
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"HBO needs to pick up the Witcher man, which they won‚Äôt do because they have Westeros, but I still dream of what could have been"
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"TLOU is a rare example of a big production team having respect and understanding for the source material. Most of the time, Hollywood follows the business model of  taking a generic script and sticking a known IP in it to gain publicity (see- Halo TV)."
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"I played the game a couple times. Once on ps3 and then ps4. But I didn‚Äôt it so long ago I was able to watch the show and not know exactly what was going to happen scene to scene or what was change or the same. The game definitely has you feeling more attached to Ellie and Joel together as you play as Joel and it‚Äôs your job to keep Ellie safe. So some of the stuff in the show didn‚Äôt hit the same. Also, I found when I played the game I sided with Joel almost fully. Like he was doing the the wrong thing for the right reasons. But being removed from controlling him and watching it play out on a tv show, I feel I got the intended effect. And it definitely makes Last of Us part II more obvious how that plays out."
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"Damn. This is impressive.

Imagine how Halo show could‚Äôve been if they actually respected the lore."
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,The writing has been superb.
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"I liked TLOU wayyy more than HOTD and I‚Äôm saying this as someone who loves GOT and who didn‚Äôt play the TLOU game.

TLOU felt way more streamlined and easier to follow. Maybe it‚Äôs like not really comparable as they‚Äôre different thematically and stylistically, but I remember numerous times during HOTD being like ‚Äúwho‚Äôs that guy again?‚Äù Or ‚Äúwhy are they doing this again?‚Äù

TLOU is solid storytelling and great acting. Coming into it with no background, my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed ourselves far more."
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,Praise Druckmann. Well deserved achievement. It goes without saying that TLOU Season 1 has probably surpassed viewership records for Game of Thrones Season 1 when it first aired as well
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,This is the way.
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,It‚Äôs because House of the Dragon didn‚Äôt cast Pedro Pascal
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,It‚Äôs a copycat industry so be on the lookout next year for the newest video game adaptation series: Turok Dinosaur Hunter on Showtime
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,So for the fifth straight year some very vocal people who told me a show or a movie was going to bomb for being too woke were wrong? Say it ain't so....
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"It‚Äôs a good show. The ending felt rushed and a bit of a flop for my wife who didn‚Äôt play the games. I think they could have done better with Joel thinking about everything, slap in a ton of flash backs and actually show the action more. 10 more minutes would have been great."
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"They really have to stretch. HOTD still had more peak viewers, but to make TLOU look better they have to go to ""full season viewers"".

Isn't it enough that TLOU did good? HOTD had almost 2 million more viewers on air date."
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"I must applaud the show's comittement to the source material, but the execution left me wanting. I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as HotD.

Ellie not being able to swin paid off with her nearly drowning while trying to reach the hospital near the end of the game, but that was cut from the story. Instead we got a flashback, which explains why Ellie is immune, which undermines why it has to be Ellie that needs to die in order to produce a cure. 

Action setpiece, tense sequences where you sneak past Clickers, or move through spore-filled underground tunnels (which wouldn't work anyway, given how they changed the cordiceps), the show could have used more of those."
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,House of the Dragon season 2 and Last of Us season 2 are going to pull huge numbers is what you're telling me. HBO wins on both counts.
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"While the show has been strong I feel like they‚Äôre making changes to make part 2 make more sense. So much deconstructing of Joel as a strong survivalist. Too much Ellie making jabs at Joel and not enough of Ellie and Joel bonding. It took 6+ episodes before we got any survival bonding. This show feels rushed and it feels like Druckman is changing so much just to make part 1 make part 2 make sense. Part 2 made so little sense vs part 1. 

I haven‚Äôt hated this but as I went through this show it got worse and worse imo. I am not looking forward to the less well received part of the Last of Us getting more love. This first season has felt rushed in ways."
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"Great HBO, now do oryx and crake!"
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"Kid asked me why did Marlene task a single man to deliver Ellie across the country when she managed to teleport there before them with a big armed crew?

I didn't know what to say"
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"Man, I really hope HBO picks up a good Sci Fi IP. That would be the ultimate trio.

Bring back FIREFLY please"
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,Bring back WestWorld!
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"I never played the game or seen anyone do it.
So i didnt know what to expect when i started watching this series.
After the 2 first episodes i pre-ordered the PC release for the las of us, after 5 episodes i jumped on youtube and watched jacksepticeyes playtrough of the last of us 2.

I don't know why i never bothered earlier, but goddamn this is some good shit."
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,God I Hope so
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,Well deserved. The Last of Us is the better show with better source material and audiences clearly agree with that sentiment
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,Pascal Power.
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,Now get the rights to Red Dead Redemption. Adapt the 2nd game first and then the 1st.
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,HoTD > TLoU
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"Don‚Äôt care, HOT D still better üëç

TLOU was pretty good but it didn‚Äôt really blow me away. A nice 7/10 show, maybe 8. Was never gripped like I was watching my Targ friends weekly"
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"Unpopular opinion but to me this show was way overrated. Boring, characters making dumb decisions, like walking around unattentive. I enjoyed Raised by Wolves and From much more."
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"The most overhyped tv show I've ever seen. Just wait, it's not even going to be close to House of the Dragon in terms of award nominations"
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,I'm happy these two shows got made but at the same time it makes it hurt even more seeing things like Wheel of Time and The Witcher with c tier writers with no respect for the source material.
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"As an experiment in turning a video game into a show, I thought The last of us was really great sometimes. The last episode however, did not work for me at all."
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"And people try to say that hbo is the worst streaming platform. HBO is by far the highest standard when it comes to making quality content, it‚Äôs not even close."
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,Is the season over yet? Can I pay for one month of HBO and watch it all at once?
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,if only they did halo correctly.
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"hey, i didn‚Äôt have time to follow the show this last month, was it good?  did it feel like a video game movie addaptation?"
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,[deleted]
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,Its a much better show so thats great
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,Good
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,It was pretty lame compared to HOTD.
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"Excellent, TLOU was so much better."
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"Why does anyone care about this kind of thing? If it‚Äôs good it‚Äôs good, do we really need to know who‚Äôs watching which more?"
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"It's a bit like comparing the heights of new NBA players to Minut Bol.  They are all frigging giants.

I'm just impressed that HBO has managed to keep its quality > quantity in an era that seems to be all going the latter (at least in terms of it's original scripted content, not so much the streaming service licensed content)."
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,The nice part about The Last of Us compared to House of the Dragon is that you can see things on your TV screen when you watch it.
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,Good. It was better.
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"Well deserved. 

Craig Mazen does it again"
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"Well deserved. Great casting, even greater writers."
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,Deserved. It's a better show.
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"No surprise. HOTD was a pretentious, often boring disappointment. TLOU wasn't perfect but at least met my high expectations."
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,I honestly didn‚Äôt like house of the dragon but loved TLOU but that‚Äôs just my opinion
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"Hype is a powerful thing.

I watched it all and thought it was okay. The game is superior."
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,My favorite thing about The Last of Us is that there were no late night misunderstandings that dropped the entire European country into a bloody war and made a family slowly kill each other over the course of decades which resulted in one of their descendants losing it 270 years down the line and burning a city down :)
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"That's because ""The Last of Us"" wasn't a mediocre show trying its damnedest to ride the hype of a show that came out ten years ago."
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,Now let's get them to do an Uncharted series on HBO. Can Craig do comedy?
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,Good. Screw Game of Thrones and everything that spawned from it in the cinematic spectrum. They did us so freaking dirty with that last season.
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"I couldn't finish HotD, got to episode 5 dragging my feet. I watched TloU every Sunday night, it was a better show for me personally, but I think my opinion is from a biased perspective, I played the game, but never read the story about HotD so felt less invested"
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,It's a vastly better show
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,Not surprised.  House of the Dragon was awful
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,I dropped off hard with House of Dragons. I got to episode 8 and just forgot about it.
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"This season felt so rushed

Episode 3 spent too much time away from Joel and Ellie. That episode being longer than the finale is a shame

The lack of infected is a damn shame

Walking dead season 1 was much better"
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"Almost as if respecting the source material has its pay offs. While HOTG‚Äôs been doing great job at sticking near the source material, the fuck up that was Game of Thrones season 8, has tarnished the brand‚Äôs reputation. IMHO."
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"HoD sucks donkey balls.
That‚Äôs why."
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"I didn't care for house of the dragon. Just didn't grab me. I feel like the only one. On the other hand, I loved TLOU."
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,Not watching any gOt spin-offs as revenge for season 8
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,I couldn‚Äôt get into either show. I think I‚Äôm over GOT and zombie type shit. I‚Äôd like to see more dramas about real life again. Plus that girl in The Last of Us just makes me want to turn of my television.
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,Was it really THAT good???
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,It was better.
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"fuck that game of thrones lite boring ass bullshit

this isnt even close"
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,HotD is the definition of mid and I'm tired of holding my tongue
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,This always ends each episode with a ‚ÄúOH NO!‚Äô It‚Äôs always a long week until the next episode!
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"Loved both.  HBO is back, baby."
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"That‚Äôs crazy, as HotD was loads better, imo. It even came from the public falling out that was Got season 8."
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"I can't watch shows like these. I have the attention span of a gnat and I get bored, really bored."
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"Yeah, because house of the dragon sucked in comparison"
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"If it keeps sticking close to the games, it‚Äôs going to jump from Game of Thrones Season 1 to Season 8, in only two seasons. I am a fan of the games, but The Last of Us Part 2 is a narrative dumpster fire."
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,What‚Äôs the appeal of the shitty incest show? Are people really that degenerate?
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,It's worth pointing out that HotD went up head to head with NFL football
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,‚Ä¶. Because it is FUCKING AWESOME
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,Can‚Äôt wait for season 2
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,Fucking Obviously
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"I‚Äôm still not really healed from how the last few seasons of GoT went, and House of the Dragon seemed played out by the time it started. I needed more substance than watching a show that uses soft core porn as it‚Äôs backbone. The Last of Us was one of the best shows I‚Äôve seen in a while."
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"Of course it did. It's a much better quality show. 

George RR Martin is done. Dont care about that man and his little universe anymore."
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,It was better than house of the dragon but doesn‚Äôt even compare to the game.
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,HOTD was awful. Just a politics show for the casual viewer.
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,Not bad for a show that is so boring.
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,‚Ä¶because it‚Äôs a much better show
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"Yea bc house of dragons sucked
I‚Äôm surprised white lotus didn‚Äôt beat house of dragons"
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,They both have horribly unlikable main characters.
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"If any HBO producer is reading this

Do you see what happens when you put effort and hire good writers?

But that doesn't mean we want a pletora of bad/mediocre zombies shows now, ok?"
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"Yeah, It's still winter outside. House of the Dragon ran through the summer. Not very fair numbers."
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"Fungos \&gt; drag√µes, simples."
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,"It's pretty good, even though it commits the fucking sin of having the word fuck said way too many times in the fucking script. To the point I can fucking hear it coming before the word fuck is out of the actor's mouth. It really lessons the fucking impact of fuck when it's said every fucking few minutes. 

Otherwise, it's good. Fuck."
DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai,Two shows with terrible writing‚Äîsave for episode 3 of TLOU which was brilliant!
Double Fantasy,I really really really hope this is good.  I'm glad we're at at least getting two seasons.
Double Fantasy,[deleted]
Double Fantasy,"Absolutely brilliant news. The books are amazing but the film (The Golden Compass) was a disaster.

I can't wait for this. Seems like a solid cast as well."
Double Fantasy,[deleted]
Double Fantasy,[deleted]
Double Fantasy,"From the casting news, I assume they were going to tackle just the first book for the first season. This announcement makes me immensely excited, because Will is my favorite character in the series.

The more I think about it, the more I hope they introduce the subtle knife at the end of the first season. "
Double Fantasy,Had there been any report of a release date? I didn‚Äôt see it in the article. 
Double Fantasy,"I'm probably the only one who enjoyed the movie, even after reading the books first. Always have low expectations for the movie. Nonetheless, I thought they did the best they could with the threat of Catholic (marketing) excommunication over their shoulders. I really hope they finish the trilogy this time...one of my favorite series.

&#x200B;"
Double Fantasy,"The article describes Coulter as a protagonist. Am I misremembering the books, is the article wrong, or will the show change the plot? Wasn't Coulter majorly evil?"
Double Fantasy,"Awesome news. Loved reading these books in college for the first time. And then bummed about how 'Disney-ified' the movie was despite the great casting. 

A BBC miniseries should give the book trilogy the treatment it deserves. 

Lin Manuel Miranda as Scoresby is really bizarre though. "
Double Fantasy,Please don't fuck this up. Please don't fuck this up. Please don't (you get the idea).
Double Fantasy,I assume this has no connection to the movie from 5+ years ago?
Double Fantasy,"So happy, they are my favourite set of books.....was pretty sad the movie never really lived up to them but hopefully a TV show can give the characters & world the development they need"
Double Fantasy,Great. I can‚Äôt wait to get my heart broken by the ending again. (I was in 7th grade and sent an ANGRY LETTER to Phillip Pullman telling him he was cruel and unfair.) lol. 
Double Fantasy,"Some of the casting seems bizarre - Ariyon Bakare as Lord Boreal? Isn't the whole point of his character is that he's an old, white establishment Government dude with a creepy penchant for kids? 

Like, Lyra's world has some backwards-ass politics that are a throwback to Victorian times. It seems weird to diversify the cast for that reason, especially when there'll be so many opportunities to do so when we visit our world and are able to contrast it with Lyra's."
Double Fantasy,So happy for this. I'm probably the only one who actually liked The Golden Compass and was waiting for a sequel since.
Double Fantasy,Very cautiously excited for this! Fingers crossed.
Double Fantasy,"I didn't realize that it was getting a television series, which is awesome. Plus, I didn't know that it was known under a different name. TIL"
Double Fantasy,I am currently reading the second book and in love with the series. Hopefully the show doesn't disappoint.
Double Fantasy,Maybe the show will be SO amazing and popular that I can finally find a good quality aelethiometer (how do you spell it?) to decorate my bookshelf. Movie and book props usually are easier to find when the movie or book does well. Fingers crossed!
Double Fantasy,"If you've read the Golden Compass, make sure you read the sequels. They're insanely good and well worth the read. "
Double Fantasy,"They were also filming for something Philip Pullman related in Oxford last month, may be related since the books are linked there I think?"
Double Fantasy,"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell was excellent. I trust BBC will deliver, and the casting has me really excited. McAvoy, Keen and Miranda are all talented and charismatic."
Double Fantasy,I have suuuuch high hopes for this after that mess of a movie. 
Double Fantasy,Reading this for the first time right now.  Fucking pumped for a show that does it justice.
Double Fantasy,This Trilogy was the Lord of the Rings for my childhood. I hope it gets the respect it deserves.
Double Fantasy,AKA Narnia for Anti-Theists.  
Double Fantasy,"I absolutely love that series, this is the first I've heard about the it being taken on by the BBC. The film suffered from having all mention of religion removed from the plot which destroyed the story. I have high hopes that if anyone can be trusted to not fall into that trap its the BBC"
Double Fantasy,They had me at armored polar bears.  Should have started with that honestly.
Double Fantasy,"Honestly I thought this was just gonna be a miniseries. Eight episodes is a lot of episodes for a British tv show, bbc must be really committed to this. I wonder if the next season is going shoot right after the first one or they‚Äôll wait or a couple of years cause James mcavoy is a busy actor "
Double Fantasy,The most recent prequel book was amazingly good.
Double Fantasy,"How does the budget look though? It would need the production value of an HBO show to real do that universe justice. The movie did a great job, less so with everything else (they didn‚Äôt even finish it like wtf). "
Double Fantasy,"I'm both highly excited (!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) and hopeful it will be good.

Re read the books recently. They really aren't for kids or adults, they are for both. It's amazing."
Double Fantasy,They wouldn't do this unless they were really confident in the series. Fingers crossed!
Double Fantasy,Please be good please be good 
Double Fantasy,Loved the books or the first and some of the 2nd but the 3rd is bonkers But will make interesting tv.
Double Fantasy,"These are on my ""to read"" list but that title: ""His Dark Materials"" always struck me as odd.  Almost like a badly translated sentence or accidental double entendre."
Double Fantasy,Things are gonna get controversial when they show god... 
Double Fantasy,Just now finding out people didn‚Äôt like The Golden Compass? I loved that movie!! Even had it on VHS
Double Fantasy,"Meh the first book was good... the other two not so much. Very disjointed, and at times obviously and awkwardly agenda-driven, storytelling."
Double Fantasy,"I didn't really like the books, but I hope that this is a good adaptation.

Post-edit: Wow, I guess I can‚Äôt have a different opinion and still wish the project well, I see"
Double Fantasy,Okay but what about more Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norell?
Double Fantasy,"When the movie came out I was dating a guy who came from a hardcore evangelical family. He was not religious whatsoever. Every so often his mom used to drag me to her church. The pastor went on and on about this movie, about how it‚Äôs the liberal agenda and they‚Äôre trying to poison the minds of young people to become godless free thinkers, how it was the obligation of every Christian to speak out against this abomination of a movie. With all the horrible things going on in the world, they were worried about a freakin movie. Crazy. "
Double Fantasy,"Damn, I've really gotta finish those. "
Double Fantasy,"This is AWESOME!   
I was so disappointed in that dumpster fire of a movie I didn't think anyone would ever touch His Dark Materials again.   
BBC will put the effort and money into it that the series deserves;  the odds of this being an excellent production is high.  "
Double Fantasy,Yes! 
Double Fantasy,Have they announced who is going to play Will yet? I couldn‚Äôt find it in the article. Cannot wait for this! 
Double Fantasy,Nice. I really liked him in Independence Day.
Double Fantasy,"I liked the movie alright, but I think having more time to explain things will be so much better. Really looking forward to this."
Double Fantasy,Good to see a classic get another chance at the screen.
Double Fantasy,"These books are a family favorite! We were so let down with The Golden Compass Movie, and a series is way better than we could have hoped!! "
Double Fantasy,Lets hope this is a sign of good faith
Double Fantasy,"The Golden Compass, Attempt #2!"
Double Fantasy,I hope I can watch this in the US. This was one of my all time favorite trilogies.
Double Fantasy,"Just been rereading this series, was thinking today how it would be great if someone made a series of it! Had no idea this was happening!"
Double Fantasy,Awesome.
Double Fantasy,"I read the trilogy and was disappointed the movie didn't make enough to do a proper treatment.  Glad there was enough love for a TV series. 

One of the neatest stories associated with the series as far as I am concerned is that Pullman went on to write a series of detective novels about a young girl who solved crimes in Victorian England.  They made a series of those on the BBC starring Billie Piper, the first companion of the new Doctor Who when that show was revived. On her new show she worked with Matt Smith, and recommended him to the producer when they were looking for a new Doctor Who. 

I was familiar with Lin-Manuel Miranda, but the first time I heard about Hamilton the musical was when he showed up on an episode of John Oliver to rap about Puerto Rico.  I remember saying,  ""Isn't that the guy from House?"""
Double Fantasy,The movie still haunts me. Why did I even watch half of the first movie is beyond me
Double Fantasy,Still waiting for something to do with Wheel of Time..
Double Fantasy,Fuck yes. I‚Äôve been waiting for this forever 
Double Fantasy,Yes! 
Double Fantasy,We might get a good adaptation now. 
Double Fantasy,I literally just finished this book today. Like its sitting right next to me at the bus. I cried at lunch when I read the ending. If they make this movie bad again I'll be really sad. I want to see them drag that angel into the abyss!!!
Double Fantasy,Spoilers******_
Double Fantasy,HOW DID I NOT KNOW THIS WAS A THING? Finally (hopefully) an adaptation worth more than used toilet paper!
Double Fantasy,yaaaas!
Double Fantasy,FINALLY!!!!!!!! We‚Äôve been waiting for years!!!
Double Fantasy,This better be good. 
Double Fantasy,Major spoilers in the article-sheesh!
Double Fantasy,I must be the only one that liked the movie without reading the books. I thought the cgi on the daemons and the polar bears were really great for the most part. And I really like the casting. But I'm excited to see where the tv series will lead and how that world will expand.
Double Fantasy,"Wait, didn't the movie flop? I kinda wanted to see the 2nd at least but they never gave it a go :("
Double Fantasy,"""Doubles?"" I thought they were already making the whole thing. Suddenly I'm scared again..."
Double Fantasy,Fantastic! Funnily enough I just finished The Golden Compass for the second time! Haven‚Äôt read them in 12-13 years! Excited to read them as an adult and equally excited for the series.
Double Fantasy,Anyone else read the title as something extremely dirty
Double Fantasy,Colour me excite!
Double Fantasy,"Oh my god, I'm so excited by this! When I was younger, I started trying to write a script for this, for a TV adaption. It was awful, (I was 12), but I loved it!

I'm also thrilled that Pullman himself is an executive producer of the show! That gives me great hope for the quality. I hope it stays reasonably true to the books, too. "
Double Fantasy,I'm hyped. 
Double Fantasy,True
Double Fantasy,I really hope this has high production values.
Double Fantasy,I am tentatively EXCITED AS FUCK 
Double Fantasy,"This is awesome news, I‚Äôm reading the books right now and it is a complete masterpiece. Pullman deserves to have an adaptation done right. We all deserve it. This is an amazing story worth reaching more audiences. "
Double Fantasy,Fuck yes. The ONLY concern I have (I'm sure BBC had as well) is that every shot should require CG since the humans always have their daemons with them. Seems expensive unless it's cheesy.
Double Fantasy,Oh man I had no idea this was happening!
Double Fantasy,"I still cherish the one good thing to ever come out of that disaster of a film, the replica of the Alethiometer. It's surprisingly well made."
Double Fantasy, I really really really hope this is good. I'm glad we're at at least getting two seasons. 
Double Fantasy,"I really liked Northern Lights / The Golden Compass, but felt like The Subtle Knife and The Amber Spyglass really fell flat for me. I'll be into this for the adaptation of Northern Lights at the very least."
Double Fantasy,Really couldnt get into those books. 
Double Fantasy,"If this is being produced for Brit TV, there's a fair chance it might actually be good. 

When they produce complex works for the *American* audience (such as the Golden Compass movie), they have to dial the IQ down by about 95 points.

"
Double Fantasy,James McAvoy and Anne-Marie Duff working together again might be interesting as they're now divorced IRL. Also I hope they fix some of the problems with the books- part 3 felt jarringly unlike the first two.
Double Fantasy,Do yo dare to click it? https://www.reddit.com/r/bbc
Double Fantasy, Read that as ‚ÄúHis Dank Materials.‚Äù Had to do a double take. 
Double Fantasy,I was struggling trying to understand what the title of this thread meant until I remembered that it‚Äôs also a TV channel.
Double Fantasy,I wonder how long it will take the BBC to change characthers into minorities for diversity.
Double Fantasy,bbc lol how do people say that without laughing lol
Double Fantasy,"well they completely ruined ""Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell"" one of my other favorite books...hope they don't do they same with this."
Double Fantasy," Big Black Cock doubles order of ‚ÄúHis Dark Materials‚Äù 


"
Double Fantasy,Wonder if they‚Äôll show the protagonists murdering God. 
Double Fantasy,"Yeah well, what about HER dark materials?"
Double Fantasy,HYPE HYPE PLS CHANNEL SHERLOCK SEASON 1 ENERGY AND NOT SEASON 4 ENERGY
Double Fantasy,"Will be interesting to see how it translates to TV. Much more interested in Will as a protagonist than Lyra.... So much so, I might skip over the first series if Lyra annoys me as much as the book version did.
I was the target audience when these came out. Read them for my big sister (school librarian) for age recommendation and summarizing for hwr. It was hard to recommend the first book at all. Lyra I wanted to punch in the head where as Will not just kicked ass, but was relatable (recommend just skipping the first because Subtle knife was that much better). The biggest thing, however, was the way it read (to me) which was super peer pressury -  ""if you don't agree with Lyra you're wrong' kind of stuff. 
The last book pushed it's agenda soooo hard that it felt sooo predictable and was a bit of a yawn. "
The Day I Became a God,Up until they said Korea I had no idea which systemic religious sex crimes they were going to expose. Keep 'em comin'!
The Day I Became a God,"10 years for three rapes, release, and subsequent rape..."
The Day I Became a God,Thought this was going to be about the moonies.
The Day I Became a God,"Aside from the documentary, I‚Äôd love to see what Netflix attorneys filed to nullify the injunction. 

Could you imagine the things that were submitted during the discovery period?  That‚Äôs a documentary all to itself."
The Day I Became a God,"I‚Äôm not sensitive at all, I eat up horror and documentaries about uncomfortable topics, but this one is very brutally straight forward.

Like, there‚Äôs no sleepy drone footage of the protagonists hometown accompanied by slightly tense piano music to slowly set the mood, the first episode is an interview of one of his victims crying and describing being raped.

I think it speaks to how important the producer felt telling the story was and how much built up energy and oppression JMS created over the past few decades."
The Day I Became a God,There are korean christian cults all over southern california. There are kids who are indoctrinated in these systems even to this day. I wish these churches get exposed for what they do.
The Day I Became a God,Blows my mind what some people can get others to do for them using religion.
The Day I Became a God,I grew up in a korean cult. Not a sex cult for the followers but I suspect the higher ups did whatever the fuck they wanted including marrying a 16 year old when the leader was 40.
The Day I Became a God,"A kpop idol had to release a statement through his company about his family‚Äôs involvement so this is bringing a big wave in Korea. And that same cafe that was ran, JMS, is apparently off the map in Naver, Korea‚Äôs search engine. Creepy stuff."
The Day I Became a God,"OMG!!! I‚Äôm actually shaking right now. I went to this church back in 2013 when my brother and sister in law dragged me to go. It was a branch in Tustin, California. They were suuupes wild."
The Day I Became a God,"We watched the first two episodes last night.  Way jacked up.  

It‚Äôs the same playbook used by pedos throughout the ages.  

One more ‚Äúman of God‚Äù using the scriptures to literally screw children."
The Day I Became a God,"I tried to watch it but for some reason they decided to use ""interpreters"" rather than just having it subtitled and it sounds like a bad dub."
The Day I Became a God,Man the idea to get an injunction really backfired because now I want to know what they‚Äôre trying to hide.
The Day I Became a God,Cultist leaders abusing power.  Religion in a nutshell.
The Day I Became a God,Is there a particular reason why South Korea has so many weird religious cults?
The Day I Became a God,"""I've been involved in a number of cults both as a leader and a follower. You have more fun as a follower but you make more money as a leader."" - Creed Bratton."
The Day I Became a God,Korea needs to reject Christianity. They were brutally colonized by missionaries.
The Day I Became a God,Started this without even really paying attention to what I was selecting have some noise as I fell asleep. My eyes are closed and then wide open as some of the first shit you hear had me ready to vomit and murder someone at the same time.
The Day I Became a God,"Holy betrayal, Batman!"
The Day I Became a God,Reverend Moon?
The Day I Became a God,"and that is why i dislike religion so much. because the people that are in religions are mostly weak minded people and they are easy prey for the ones in power.

also for any rape victim. i ask you this. would you feel more safe when the rapist is dead, or still alive and knowing he will eventually come out of jail?"
The Day I Became a God,Is this a good documentary? I added it to my list because I've never watched a documentary in another language and I watched so many KDramas.
The Day I Became a God,Cool now do the Catholics of America
The Day I Became a God,The only thing crazier than Korean Catholicism is American evangelism.
The Day I Became a God,"I tried to watch this documentary, but to me they also used the victims to sell their documentary.  The doc used full footage of the victims naked and did not blur out an parts. It just felt like re-taking advantage of women that were brain washed and cult abused. I had to end it."
The Day I Became a God,Religious people be like: ‚Äúcome to our church so we can molest u‚Äù
The Day I Became a God,Do jehovah's witnesses next
The Day I Became a God,IMHO I can‚Äôt wait for all organized religion to die‚Ä¶. The harm it‚Äôs caused far outweighs any good.
The Day I Became a God,Don't have religion where you idolize the leaders. Having religion could even apply to those who claim to believe in science. The scientific methodology is one where you test to determine if a hypothesis is false or not false. Because it isn't false doesn't make it true. Science is akin to forever chipping away at a slab of marble to determine the sculpture underneath. True science can only determine correlation and not causality. Statements of absolute causality are not statements of science but of religion.
The Day I Became a God,Why are Koreans so prone to cults?? I can kindda see why the Chinese government ban religious cults the likes of falungong from arising.
The Day I Became a God,Will this involves the moonies?
The Day I Became a God,Every single religion has coverups rarely do they self report!
The Day I Became a God,All religions are a sex and money scam. Every single one.
The Day I Became a God,Anywhere else to watch it? Canceled Netflix due to the new password restrictions
The Day I Became a God,"Cool.

Now do Evangelicals in the US.

EDIT: To be clear, I think this is a great documentary and I'm glad they won the right to air it.  I'm saying I'd like to see this trend of exposing gross religious organizations by documentaries funded and platformed by major media companies continue on."
The Day I Became a God,Unrelated to the film itself but I wish it had either been titled *In the Name of God* or *A Holy Betrayal*.
The Day I Became a God,Man Koreans are not gonna like this one lmao
The Day I Became a God,how about a documentary on american religious leaders?
The Day I Became a God,If any of those guys are gay they are probably only into white guys
The Day I Became a God,"How about sticking it to Scientology? Or the fundamentalist Mormons, et al. I don‚Äôt care about some ‚Äúleaders‚Äù in Korea. Go after the predators at home and I might be impressed."
The Day I Became a God,Netflix sucks haha
The Day I Became a God,[removed]
The Day I Became a God,"Good news, for sure, though I started watching this earlier this week and the production struck me as super odd. Might be a cultural thing, but the set design and editing is incongruous given the subject matter. 

Disclaimer: I only watched the first 15 mins of the opening episode."
The Day I Became a God,"Religion doing what religion does.  But people want to be lied to, so on it goes."
The Day I Became a God,The world is really fucked up.
The Day I Became a God,">3rd March

btw"
The Day I Became a God,"Yep. Was part of this cult before here in one their American branch and knew they we‚Äôre sketch since the beginning. Definitely members would manipulate to ‚Äúevangelize‚Äù people. It‚Äôs flat out sad how many people are brainwashed and devoted to this cult and the leader. Insiders think that the media is just persecuting him and acting as a ‚Äúdevil‚Äù to bring down the ‚Äúwill of God‚Äù. His 10 years of imprisonment acts as Jesus dying on the cross to save us from our sins. His sermons are so boring and majority of the time, he just talks about himself."
The Day I Became a God,"LPT: don't join cults, especially ones where the leader claims to be be God or claims to be speaking for God. Actually, just don't join any fucking cults."
The Day I Became a God,"Oh some one sued to stop it. I wouldn't have watched it otherwise but now, straight on to the list."
The Day I Became a God,Seriously though. Are there any NON religious sex cults?
The Day I Became a God,I hope this series continues to expose more cults in Korea.
The Day I Became a God,"I just want to ask if anyone else felt like this was fake or dramatized when first watching it? 

Not trying to be offensive because I watch sooo much true crime, something about this felt a bit staged (the interview, having the victim play an iPad video, film stalkers outside a hotel). I just didn‚Äôt want to get duped with a horrific story but being told by actors. Again, I am not saying the story isn‚Äôt true - it‚Äôs disgusting and I fucking hate religion. I especially seek out religious docs as I was brainwashed southern baptist as a kid. I hate to hear these stories! 

Just a vibe and didn‚Äôt see anyone else mention it."
The Day I Became a God,"r/Shincheonji_Korea
It‚Äôs a place to discuss about cults in Korea including JMS"
The Day I Became a God,"I still don't understand why the mother in episode 6 ""Baby Garden of Death"" didn't say her son was murdered in court, and still stuck to his heart failing? What was the point when the case had gotten that far and lied just to hate herself and wish death upon herself everyday? Did I miss something?"
The Day I Became a God,"After having just read the Pope John Paul II and the sex abuse cover-ups, I was really hoping it would be the Catholic Church."
The Day I Became a God,I would subscribe to a series where they did an in depth dive into every sect. If they find no evidence of a particular group they name drop them. I guess that would be an evolving form of journalism.
The Day I Became a God,"I say, do the USA next!"
The Day I Became a God,I know its a messed up system there and you only get real time if you dont have money in korea
The Day I Became a God,"religion is the only part of society that coddles adults for submitting their critical faculties to a cult and wailing on about how more important their imaginary stories are than anything else going on in the objective reality we share. And you wonder how this hasn't been a magnet and cesspool for literal millenia, grifting entire societies for private ""sacred"" time with the children of the community, huddled around a bunch of decrepit old perverts.  Theism is child abuse, pure and simple. You want to con junkies and people who are at the bottom of their lives and have had all their defenses beaten out of them? That's one thing. Indoctrinating children before they've developed any cognitive defenses against shitty iron-aged emotional injunctions can fuck. right. off."
The Day I Became a God,Reminds me of ‚Äúsilenced‚Äù about the sexual abuse and Kentucky sentences at a Korean school for the deaf.
The Day I Became a God,Do they have any history of this sort of thing?
The Day I Became a God,"Even though some viewers criticized JMS episodes for being too explicit, but in fact, those episodes were somewhat censored by the production team themselves. According to the director of the series, what was captured in those first three episodes was only about a tenth of what the victims actually suffered.


He said one of the reasons they brought the project to Netflix was to expose reality of those crimes. But even for Netflix, he had to watered down description of sexual assaults of JMS cause it was too upsetting for the viewers. Some of crew memebers suffered traumas for days after covering the case he said."
The Day I Became a God,"The first thing you hear in the documentary is an audio recording of a rape in mid-intercourse, with some old man voice asking if the victim had an orgasm.  I did see the first minute or so of the interview, but I decided I didn't really want to see how far it was going to go after that."
The Day I Became a God,"I was kind shocked they showed video of nude girls with blurred faces and unblurred bodies right after the stories of how he was raping teenagers. Aside from not being sure how old any of those girls were, it seems extremely exploitative of Netflix to just expose that to the public. It's fresh victimization even if only a handful of people know who they are."
The Day I Became a God,"I have friends who turned to them and haven't heard from them in years. After joining they only ever wanted to hang out with me at their church events -> indoctrinate me.

Oddly enough they also said that Catholicism was satan or something. I also remember them believing that the end of the world is soon."
The Day I Became a God,"I dated a woman for a short time who was a member of one of these cults in CA, only I didn't know it until I looked up the name of her ""pastor.""

Her ideas about certain things were just bizarre and didn't make sense with my understanding of most sects of Christianity."
The Day I Became a God,Midnight Mass on Netflix was a documentary üòå
The Day I Became a God,"You will find predators in every system, willing and able to abuse their power dynamics."
The Day I Became a God,"Religion is just a medium.  You can look at all the things that happened in Hollywood, that have nothing to do with religion to see that all it takes is generic promises from someone who appears to hold power to get some people to do things.

This isn't excusing people using religion in such a manner, just showing that religion is method, not the base reason these things happen."
The Day I Became a God,"its literally built off that. The entire premise is that you must believe something without evidence, without understanding even. simple blind faith is required at the root of every religion.

anyone willing to believe in that is obv going to be more susceptible to other ideas with no proof, esp when they believe these orders are coming from God. Even easier if you can justify any of your ideas with weird interpretations of a text like the bible. And once you get some believers, their entire families usually get brought in"
The Day I Became a God,"For real. Over the last 10 years I've noticed more and more how awful religions can be. People use this *coughChristianscough* as an excuse to do awful and hateful things. I get it that not all religious folks are bad, but it's difficult to not be jaded."
The Day I Became a God,An extra pernicious part is how religion will make a point to call the parts of you they use to exploit as a ‚Äúvirtue‚Äù
The Day I Became a God,"Reminds me of Tool‚Äôs song, ‚ÄòOpiate‚Äô"
The Day I Became a God,If anyone prefaces their morality with religion.  There is zero morality.
The Day I Became a God,i did too! weird way to grow up eh! there were some good times though. i think about the people a lot.
The Day I Became a God,Name?
The Day I Became a God,Is this related to the unity Church?
The Day I Became a God,"You can change it to Korean audio with subtitles, but yeah it's annoying because then any English audio will be in Korean if there is any."
The Day I Became a God,just put the CC on then
The Day I Became a God,"You can change this in the audio settings, FYI."
The Day I Became a God,"I can‚Äôt do any dubbing. I have tried but when I see the words not line up with the mouth, my brain just cringes and I have to turn it off"
The Day I Became a God,That‚Äôs what I want to know! So many and so similar around the same time!
The Day I Became a God,Saying JMS and those cults are Christianity is like saying Trump is a far left liberal.
The Day I Became a God,Conformist societies fall easy prey to this kind of crap (see MLM schemes)
The Day I Became a God,"You'd assume, but no. Smaller, more modern ones. 

I wouldn't be too surprised if Netflix did try to do something on the Moonies and ended up being much more hamstrung than this."
The Day I Became a God,Its a good documentary  but its pretty hard to watch. The first 5 min of the 1st episode has a sound recording of a rape. It gets pretty gory too.
The Day I Became a God,"Pentacostals too. I've only heard testimonials from friends who have left churches of those denominations, but they definitely had wild experiences"
The Day I Became a God,Then do a series. All American religions.
The Day I Became a God,Organized religion is sinister sh!t.
The Day I Became a God,"Or that Koreans are much better about reporting cults, rather than trying to hide shit?"
The Day I Became a God,Do you think Chinese have freedom to make such documentary?
The Day I Became a God,üôÉ
The Day I Became a God,Well it‚Äôs made by Netflix so I‚Äôm gonna assume no
The Day I Became a God,You showed them.
The Day I Became a God,"*Keep Sweet, Pray, and Obey* and *the Keepers* are both pretty interesting"
The Day I Became a God,"Give Jesus Camp a watch if you haven‚Äôt already, gave me some un-invited flashbacks."
The Day I Became a God,"Dude, delete this. There are tons of documentaries on US evangelicals and the shit they get into.  This just shows you're too lazy to look before posting."
The Day I Became a God,The only problem with that is that its too many documentaries too little time to make them. They already have a small mountain. The supply overtakes production regardless of demand.
The Day I Became a God,There's actually a ton of them.
The Day I Became a God,"Netflix has 37 episodes on Scientology, in ""Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath"", and 4 episodes on the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-day Saints, in ""Keep Sweet: Pray and Obey"".

They also have a lot of other documentaries focusing on religious movements and cults."
Coffee & Vanilla,I've had a crush on her since her 1 episode in The League
Coffee & Vanilla,"loved her in grimm, haven't seen her in much of anything before or since (lincoln rhyme, a few random guest appearances on shows I watched), and since it's law & order, sadly it's not gonna change."
Coffee & Vanilla,Now THAT is a name
Coffee & Vanilla,"She should just play her character from Grimm, that would shake things up for the L&O formula."
Coffee & Vanilla,"Seems like this is for a guest role, likely as an attorney for the defense, vs a longer-term role.

As a side note, I am glad L&O dropped Anthony Anderson for Mehcad Brooks. That should be an upgrade."
Coffee & Vanilla,"Like the drink, and spelt the same"
Coffee & Vanilla,"Alright good for her. I really loved her in Grimm and its a shame she's not really appeared in that much else since then.

Certainly will be amusing to see her play a lawyer again, especially if this turns out to be a recurring role."
Coffee & Vanilla,Caffeinated or decaf?
Coffee & Vanilla,This show is still going?!?
Coffee & Vanilla,Is it 2013?
Coffee & Vanilla,"Who was she? I'm rewatching the series now and don't recall. Onto season 3 now

Edit: oh she worked at the couple's retreat!"
Coffee & Vanilla,She was great in Grimm.  Really wish they could bring that show back.  So much lore was left untapped with regards to the various factions.
Coffee & Vanilla,I imagine she was applying for SAG and there was already someone with her birth name and she was hurriedly looking around for something as a last name and then noticed she had a Starbucks in her hand.
Coffee & Vanilla,There's also a John Vodka out there.
Coffee & Vanilla,Who?
Coffee & Vanilla,"it was a surprise hit for me. weekly cop show with fairytale elements, so I only checked it out to get it out of the way and start once upon a time, which sounded a lot better. still haven't started ouat, maybe later this year, but watched all of grimm. the girlfriend (can't remember her name, she's in superman now) made it really hard to watch from the beginning, but it had a bunch of good characters, interesting story and cases, mostly good stuff. then in the final season I couldn't wait for it to finally end, after season 3 or so it all went downhill. these days I'd probably stop watching and I don't expect to get too far with ouat either, or I might just fast-forward irrelevant storylines or characters."
Coffee & Vanilla,Nope. Claire Elizabeth Coffee. Plus I had a classmate all through high school with the last name Coffee.
Coffee & Vanilla,"I just started Ouat after finishing a Grimm rewatch, and still being on a bit of a fairy tale kick.  I'm undecided on the show, but I like the guy they got playing Rumplestilskin, and the Actress that played Claire in Lost is Belle.  That's enough to keep me watching for now.

Edit also on the topic of Grimm what I'd like is a prequel set when the Royal's were at their peak.  Grimm's and Wesen working with and against the Royal families.  Wesen are more primal.  I found that lore really interesting and unexplored."
Coffee & Vanilla,"Probably misremembering it, probably was Covfefe."
Coffee & Vanilla,"the cast of ouat (main or otherwise) also made me more hopeful, don't think I knew anybody from grimm beforehand, so I'm still looking forward to some good times."
Coffee & Vanilla,">Edit also on the topic of Grimm what I'd like is a prequel set when the Royal's were at their peak. Grimm's and Wesen working with and against the Royal families. Wesen are more primal. I found that lore really interesting and unexplored.

Oh man, that would be so cool. I'd utterly love that."
Coffee & Vanilla,If you enjoyed DS9 check out Babylon 5.
Coffee & Vanilla,"OP calls himself non-fan. Watches every single episode.

I think you need to re-assess your self-identity. You are now a Star Trek fan."
Coffee & Vanilla,"I was having the hardest time remembering Enterprise so I left it blank as a fitting tribute.  All I could muster was the theme music, uniforms and Jeffrey Combs.  If you find anything in my post helpful, then I'm glad[.](http://www.letswatchstartrek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/4-15.jpg)"
Coffee & Vanilla,agree with your ratings pretty much wholeheartedly.  Old Man Anime to describe Picard made me genuinely chuckle because it's so true
Coffee & Vanilla,"'No one told me that it was a horrific Twilight Zone style stage play where the crew of a starship would encounter existential threats and horrors.'

YES this is the perfect summation of TOS.  There are still scenes that give me the creeps decades after watching re-runs as a kid in the 80's."
Coffee & Vanilla,"> Where was Capt. Picard‚Äôs intense loving relationship with Data? It is the driving force in Picard but doesn‚Äôt exist in Next Gen.

From memory, this is something that starts coming though in the movies. Especially Insurrection (Oh no, Data is in trouble, lets ignore orders, blow off this diplomatic mission and redirect an entire starship across the sector to help him) and Nemesis. 

So it wasn't unexpected to see in Picard, just the intensity."
Coffee & Vanilla,Thanks for an actual quality post instead of just a casting announcement link
Coffee & Vanilla,"As a long time Star Trek fan, I have very few issues with your summaries and ratings. 

And, yes, the first Star Trek series you watch, does tend to be your favourite. I grew up with reruns of the original series in the 1970s, and that remains my favourite."
Coffee & Vanilla,"  Nice I agree with you on most of it, though I'd put Voyager as more average than bad. 
  Gave up on Lower Decks at episode 1.. maybe I'll try it again someday.

  If you haven't seen the movies with the original crew, watch those, they are actually good unlike the forgettable Chris Pine ones."
Coffee & Vanilla,"Thanks for this, it's cool to see someone's entry point(s) into Trek! I will say you're missing out on a big chunk of cool stories if you haven't seen the movies yet! My favorites are the ones with the TOS cast, but the TNG and JJ Abrams alternate universe ones are fun too. It could be fun to watch those in a random order too?

>Where was Capt. Picard‚Äôs intense loving relationship with Data? It is the driving force in Picard but doesn‚Äôt exist in Next Gen. The two shows seem connected in setting only which is bizarre.

I think this is something that gets developed in the TNG films (which take place after the tv show, and before Picard), particularly First Contact, Insurrection, and Nemesis. (To me, I think the Picard show works better when I think of it as a follow up to Nemesis and the 2009 JJ movie, rather than as a follow up to TNG)."
Coffee & Vanilla,"\> Do not start at the first episode of the first season and expect a good time.

Except in Ds9's case, it actually is.

Most of your take is fairly on, and this coming from a snob 40+ year fan.  I don't agree with most fans on r/StarTrek about anything, so nothing I type is any kind of general consensus, just a pretty informed one.

Glad you sat through some of the crap to see the gems, though."
Coffee & Vanilla,I'm a few episodes behind on Prodigy but I mean to go back...it has enough charm in places that I enjoy watching the episodes. Also Gwyn is portrayed by the same voice actress who portrays Jinx in Arcane so that's interesting I guess. I think she may be getting type-cast as a person with blue hair lol
Coffee & Vanilla,"Thanks, OP. That was a fun read!"
Coffee & Vanilla,[deleted]
Coffee & Vanilla,What are you referring to the TNG chief engineer being a creep towards woman?
Coffee & Vanilla,"Voyager is a bad show that I love.

>A starship‚Äôs crew being made up of loyal service members and rebel deserters could have been done better.

The thing that annoyed me was that I believed we would see two different approaches to problem solving. What we got was: the Maquis are like Star Fleet personal, but they are a bit emo.

But the show does have a good vibe.

I think Deep Space is terrific. But yes, the Bajor part of the storyline became difficult to care about.

You have to see the (original cast) movies, Spock dies, Kirk meets God, middle-aged Uhura does an exotic dance, and whales travel through space and time."
Coffee & Vanilla,"Agree with the ratings (though my take on Picard would be *Star Trek Picard: The Search for Emotional Validation*) except for *Enterprise*.

I've been trying for years to actually understand the big *meh* for *Enterprise*. Tbf, I hope to never, ever hear the opening titles for it again and the fan-service for the last episode was Mimbari-level-boneheadded, but I thought the show itself was quite good even when its experiments didn't quite work out."
Coffee & Vanilla,Are you Luke Rhinehart?
Coffee & Vanilla,"I'm not a huge trek fan, but I've watched it on occasion and use to watch it back in the day.  I've thought about giving Lower Decks a try.  I've been apprehensive because it's animated, but there have been a surprising number of good adult animations lately that have changed my mind, so...  Worth it?"
Coffee & Vanilla,I‚Äôm watching DS9 for the first time now.  It was on after SNL when I was younger but always fell asleep in the first 20 minutes.  It does have a bunch of interesting characters.
Coffee & Vanilla,">	 the second in command is a man-child, etc.

This is such a toxic way to refer to having hobbies outside of work."
Coffee & Vanilla,"You gave Voyager a Bad? All other opinions are null and void! But seriously, Voyager is the most fan friendly entry point. It has all the themes present in Star Trek, if not a bit watered down while still maintaining enough action to keep your average viewer interested. It is by far my favorite series."
Coffee & Vanilla,Watch the Movies especially the ones with the next gen crew in them
Coffee & Vanilla,"Last year, I re-watched all of Trek in broadcast order. I'd seen the first five series multiple times, but hadn't given the new stuff a proper chance. It was an interesting experience. Breaking up most of Voyager with the best of Deep Space Nine really made Voyager easier to get through. And I had forgotten just how genuinely terrible ""Into Darkness"" is, not just as Star Trek but generally as a film. My ultimate goal went unfulfilled, as I had to tap out little less than halfway through the third season of Discovery. It and Picard really took a lot out of me, so after ""Unification III,"" I gave up on Disco, watched season 2 of Lower Decks (which is easily the best of the new stuff), and moved on with my life."
Coffee & Vanilla,"The behind the scenes of Voyager are pretty crazy. The original idea was to have it be the two warring crew types, the rebels and Federation, be an ongoing storyline. Along with a darker, more survival oriented mission (when do you break Federation rules when you're all alone and need to survive), with the Voyager ship gradually adding new alien technology as it traveled. Becoming kind of a cobbled together warship in later seasons (they kind of do this later but just with Borg tech).

But some people just wanted TNG 2.0 instead. Angered some of the writers (like Bryan Fuller, who went on to help create Discovery) and actors like Robert Beltran who admits to making his acting more wooden in protest of his character's beginning arc being squashed.

Add in that they got scared of losing the younger demographic after they sent Mulgrew and Picardo to appear on MTV and realized how much older they appeared than casts of other shows. So Rich Berman came up with the idea of having a ""borg babe"" in a skintight suit join the crew, making most of the stories about her, pissing off Kare Mulgrew in the process, who was partially sold on the show by her being the first female Captain and a role model."
Coffee & Vanilla,"Voyager has some of the best Trek episodes. Sure there are things I wish were different about it but the online circlejerk about ""wasted potential"" is always tiring and too repeated."
Coffee & Vanilla,"I think it's kind of hilarious you rated Voyager as bad, but it's your favorite :D.   I LOVE Voyager, but absolutely accept that there are huge aspects of it that are subpar and even annoying.  There are peaks and valleys in all trek series and Voyager had by far the greatest peaks for me.  The Doctor and Seven were just sublime, like I almost didn't care about anything else, I loved their storylines so much.

LOL that Enterprise didn't even get a description.

Also really appreciate the description of Picard as ""old man anime"".  I couldn't even get more than a few episodes into Picard, for all the reasons listed.

As a pretty casual fan of star trek (I haven't even watched all of the series because I've always just known that I would hate DS9) I kind of agree that Below Decks feels like the surprising winner overall."
Coffee & Vanilla,Haven't seen Babylon 5 yet.  Thanks.  I'll have to check it out[.](http://www.letswatchstartrek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/12-6.jpg)
Coffee & Vanilla,How many Centauri does it take to change a light bulb?
Coffee & Vanilla,I go back and forth on it.  Star Trek fans are passionate and have built up a culture of their own spanning decades that I'm not that familiar with.  We can definitely talk Trek though[.](http://www.letswatchstartrek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/st182-1024x769.png)
Coffee & Vanilla,"You haven‚Äôt watched the movies?


The first is weird and long. 

The second is amazing. The third is an ok sequel to that. The 4th rounds off the trilogy with an amazing comedy adventure. 

The 5th is weird and ambitious but only ok. 

The 6th is great. 

Then there are TNG movies and your mileage may vary. I personally adore Generations and am luke warm about first contact (which most people love). The others are ok. 

Then the reboots, 1 is fun 2 is awful 3 is good"
Coffee & Vanilla,"Enterprise Seasons 1-3 are pretty meh, but the new direction (new showrunner) of Season 4 is splendid, and best watched after you've seen the other stuff, since there are so many throwbacks to earlier things.  (The finale still sucks though.)"
Coffee & Vanilla,"Seasons 1 and 2 of Enterprise are mostly forgettable rehashes of the other shows with a few scattered highlights. Season 3 gets better with a dedicated arc and a bit more thought being put into the story. But season 4 is great, something I'd happily sit next to some of the best seasons of the better shows. It was just too little, too late.

Conceptually, Enterprise is a hard sell because prequels are in many ways anathema to Star Trek as a whole. It's about going forward, not looking back. But I think there's a lot of merit in seeing the ""missing link,"" as it were, between us and Picard. Or at least between us and Kirk. Ultimately, Enterprise's biggest failure is the same as Voyager's before it: it completely squanders its own premise by accepting mediocrity. The only difference is, the Network called Enterprise on its shit and it tried to get better. Voyager just meandered for seven years and never cared to improve."
Coffee & Vanilla,Thanks for reading.  Wasn't sure if any humor would come through[.](http://www.letswatchstartrek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/5-5-1024x767.jpg)
Coffee & Vanilla,I'd say the Picard/Data relationship begins with **First Contact**. **Generations** maintains the established dynamic from the show with Data and Geordi being besties but that changes completely for movie number eight.
Coffee & Vanilla,"There's a bit of it in the show - several times Picard talks to Data like a (stern, emotionally distant) father, but yeah a lot of their relationship seems to have been built in the off-screen years between movies. It makes some sense, the Enterprise never stopped having adventures, we just stopped seeing them; that doesn't make it good screen-writing though."
Coffee & Vanilla,"Yeah, apparently watching Picard then Next Gen AND skipping the older movies is the reason for the disjointed feel.  I appreciate all the fans responding and helping me understand[.](http://www.letswatchstartrek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/204-1024x766.png)"
Coffee & Vanilla,"Nice, I chose r/television because I'm not in the fandom and was worried about putting myself out there.  Old Trek is so weird and cool.  It's interesting to see how it has changed over the years[.](http://www.letswatchstartrek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/79.png)"
Coffee & Vanilla,"Maybe you are right.  I was hard on Voyager because I'm biased and love that show.  Like a teacher grading their own children harder than the others.
As for Lower Decks, *wej Duj* and *I,Excretus* were my top episodes but no worries if it wasn't for you[.](http://www.letswatchstartrek.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/68-400x306.png)"
Coffee & Vanilla,"I have fond memories of Voyager from when it first aired and definitely remember enjoying many of the characters, but I tried re-watching it a few years ago and found the writing so bad it was unwatchable."
Coffee & Vanilla,"I was prepared to get roasted, but your comment put a smile on my face.  Have a good one[.](http://www.letswatchstartrek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/6-12-1024x758.jpg)"
Coffee & Vanilla,It's like running a marathon and then being asked to run another couple blocks.  I just can't right now.  I'm glad it's going well though[.](http://www.letswatchstartrek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Picture-910-300x229.png)
Coffee & Vanilla,LeForge has a few scenes where his ineptitude with women crosses the line.  It always involved using holographic women in ways that made me uncomfortable.  Especially when they were holograms of real women that he knew or met later.
Coffee & Vanilla,"The Leah Brahms stuff.

Geordie gets it on with a holographic version of her, then acts like she's the weird one for getting mad when she finds it."
Coffee & Vanilla,"Negative, but I hope it's a compliment[.](http://www.letswatchstartrek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/12-Data-Redemption-part-2.jpg)

Edit: I just looked him up and I assume it's about rolling dice.  If I genuinely don't care about an outcome or I find myself wasting time mulling over a decision I will absolutely flip a coin or roll a die.  In my experience, I usually lean towards one decision as the coin is in the air or I just do what the coin says and move on."
Coffee & Vanilla,"The second season won me over.  I'd recommend watching *wej Duj* and *I, Excretus* and then making up your mind.  But some shows aren't for everyone so no worries either way[.](http://www.letswatchstartrek.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/15-400x301.png)"
Coffee & Vanilla,"I get that animated Star Trek is weird, but you seem to have a problem with animation in general. There are countless amazing animated shows enjoyable for all ages! Like the DCAU shows, Avatar - The Last Airbender, the list goes on"
Coffee & Vanilla,It wasn't a reference to his hobbies.  I didn't like his uninterest in commanding his own ship or moving up the Chain of Command.  The worst was when he forced an Admiral to apologize to him during a life and death moment where the Admiral needed Riker to pilot a shuttle.
Coffee & Vanilla,"We had similar experiences.  There are so many Trek shows, books & movies now that there is something for everyone.  No need to force yourself to enjoy the whole thing.  I'm hopeful about Prodigy (introducing Trek to my nephew), Strange New Worlds and Lower Decks S3[.](http://www.letswatchstartrek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Picture-98-300x229.png)"
Coffee & Vanilla,"Check out the Battlestar Galactica reboot series if you haven't already. One of the very best sc-fi shows in TV history.

Also...

>Kirk defeating a genetically superior superman by beating him with a pipe

...was pretty damn funny."
Coffee & Vanilla,"It'll be interesting doing B5 after doing Deep Space.  They ran mostly at the same time back then, and there's a ton of history about the overall similarities.

B5 is hard to watch now, but if you sat through the worst Trek, you can handle it.  B5 is what modern ST still hasn't touched, a real space opera.  The closest thing lately is the Expanse, which of course, credits B5 as it's main influence."
Coffee & Vanilla,"Big definitely-worth-your-time for *Babylon 5*. B5 is heavily arc centric and the broadcast order is a bit of a mess at times for various reasons.

There are a [couple suggested viewing orders](https://babylon5.fandom.com/wiki/Viewing_Order). I use the Historical Order ([found here](https://babylon5.fandom.com/wiki/Ideal_Viewing_Order)) when re-watching but the [Lurker's Guide](http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/countries/master/eplist.html) is also pretty good with the caveat that ""In the Beginning"" should be near the end because it is very, very spoiler-heavy and, while technically something of a prequal, is told from a timeframe almost at the end of the series (see [Viewing Orders](https://babylon5.fandom.com/wiki/Ideal_Viewing_Order) for placement).

Also, the [Lurker's Guide to Babylon 5](http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/countries/master/eplist.html) is an amazing resource for episode viewing, containing a lot of feedback from JMS on the episodes and addressing questions."
Coffee & Vanilla,"That's easy: Only one. But in the old days of the Centauri Republic, hundreds of servants would change thousands of lightbulbs at our slightest whim!

Better question: how do you like your spoo?"
Coffee & Vanilla,At some point in your journey you may have to ask yourself: what else has Alice Krige done?
Coffee & Vanilla,I have seen the three Chris Pine Star Trek movies but they were not part of this quest.  One day I'll go back and watch the movies.  Thanks for the mini reviews[.](http://www.letswatchstartrek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/3-1024x770.jpg)
Coffee & Vanilla,"It's perfectly dry, and I love the eventual realization during your *TNG* summary of ""Wait... is *Picard* just early 2000s fan fiction?"""
Coffee & Vanilla,"Glad you liked the episode ""Lower Decks"". TNG S7 is pretty darn inconsistent, but it has some all-time greats."
Coffee & Vanilla,"No... It still feels disjointed.

But it probably feels extra disjointed when you watch it in the wrong order."
Coffee & Vanilla,"r/startrek isn‚Äôt that bad, but the majority of people posting are die hard Deep Space 9 fans. They would still appreciate your detailed post."
Coffee & Vanilla,"My wife was the Trekkie and she introduced me to the shows. We collectively agreed to erase those episodes from our memory. True LaForge isn't actually a creep. He's a warm-hearted, jolly but serious when he needs to be engineer, who is best friends with Data.

Worf's bad father routine is necessary to help him grow in DS9. Although I never enjoyed those episodes, watching DS9 back-to-back after TNG put his character in a bit more clarity. 

> The second-in-command is a man-child

Man don't do Riker like that, he grows a lot during the show."
Coffee & Vanilla,"I'll add it to the list.  Thanks, Scienscatologist[.](http://www.letswatchstartrek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/27-1024x769.jpg)"
Coffee & Vanilla,"Man I love Sci-fi of all sorts but B5 is definitely hard to watch for the first time now.  Don't think I've ever made it past the first couple episodes.   Andromeda is a little easier with the 'remaster', does drag on a bit, very monster of the week."
Coffee & Vanilla,"Like my wives...I want someone else to deal work them.


How do you confuse a Vorlon?"
Coffee & Vanilla,Thor 2!
Coffee & Vanilla,"The 4th movie is one of my all time favorite ""comfort"" movies. It is definitely the one I have re-watched the most. Like the Princess Bride or the 5th Element or Back to the Future it is one of those movies you can turn on any time and be entertained."
Coffee & Vanilla,[deleted]
Coffee & Vanilla,"It's a totally different show by season 2, but it's still what it is."
Coffee & Vanilla,"Near Ulkesh, do a Kosh."
Coffee & Vanilla,Why skip the first?
Coffee & Vanilla,"It used to be so funny. So many jokes that landed in just a few seconds. Now episodes don't even end properly. The writing was so good before. Some people say it stopped being good at season 10 but I really enjoyed it till season 13 with the episode of Lisa's robot Linguo being one of my favourites.

Also the new slick animation and art takes away from the charm of the earlier seasons."
Coffee & Vanilla,"currently on season 6 and freaking loving it! 

It‚Äôs such a hilariously wholesome show that is sometimes like a big yellow hug on the soul"
Coffee & Vanilla,"I really like S22 only because that's when I started watching Simpsons weekly, and I watched it on repeat, because I was too young to understand it wasn't as funny as the golden age.

So it has its own little section in my heart."
Coffee & Vanilla,It‚Äôs still watchable even today but nothing is beating the first 19 seasons.
Coffee & Vanilla,"Agreed, but what I will say is that I decided to jump back in from the last couple seasons, and the co-showrunner Matt Selman is clearly a 90s Simpsons fan.

The episode that he runs have something much closer to that vintage humor and character-based conflicts."
Coffee & Vanilla,Yo. That is spot on. Once it went to computer driven graphics vs animation I was out
Coffee & Vanilla,"I‚Äôm a few seasons from the end and there are definitely a few episodes every season that are like ‚Äúhere are a bunch of funny ideas that we couldn‚Äôt really fit into an arc of storytelling so we‚Äôre gonna shoot them at you like a shotgun and hope you don‚Äôt notice there‚Äôs no real plot.‚Äù   But they tend to be really funny, presumably because they get to keep all best jokes without really worrying how they flow."
Coffee & Vanilla,Which seasons did he do? Might give them a shot.
Coffee & Vanilla,That's a trip... People in charge of the writing of the Simpsons now are young enough to have grown up in the Golden Age of its run.
Coffee & Vanilla,"He joined the writing staff in 1997 but looks like he became one of the showrunners about 4 seasons or so back, unless I'm wrong and it was earlier.

EDIT: Also, Mike Reiss returned for an episode this past season. For an episode about true crime podcasts, the writing was near 90s level."
Blue Spring Ride,[deleted]
Blue Spring Ride,"Great write up!


I'm not familiar with most of these, and I watch a shit-ton of TV and movies. I really like the effort, and the writeups are perfect in length.


Again, not knowing these a lot, is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show? (Nothing against non English speakers of course) 


Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.


Totally agree with the couple from White Lotus being great characters, I much preferred season 1 (which seems like a hot take) but those two, specifically the woman, were very interesting characters to me."
Blue Spring Ride,"""hidden gems of 2022 for me"" might be better title for this post.

i must admit some of these plots engaged my curiosity. im gonna look for them. rhanks for the list."
Blue Spring Ride,"How you pick what to watch? I‚Äôm overwhelmed with all these shows in Netflix and I always seem to pick the limited series or those talked about in reddit, especially regarding to the foreign shows or K dramas. There isn‚Äôt much write-ups or reviews in English."
Blue Spring Ride,I am glad and surprised Prisma is number one. Well deserved
Blue Spring Ride,"This is Going to Hurt: I'm a medical student and I thought I'd seen every medical show but this one is on my list now! I've heard that this show shows the reality of a doctor's life without all the glamor of medicine.

Blue Spring Ride,"Insanely odd for the 2 anime to show up to be an average romcom (with crazy production value) and a good but lesser known sequel.

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Blue Spring Ride,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
Blue Spring Ride,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.
Blue Spring Ride,No Atlanta? Both seasons last year were incredible
Blue Spring Ride,Pachinko is the most slept on series of 2022
Blue Spring Ride,"1. She hulk
2. Ted lasso
3. Ms Marvel
4. Harley Quinn show
5. Lord of the rings
6. Spy x family 
7. Chainsaw man
8. Loki
9. Mob psycho
10. Hot D"
Blue Spring Ride,Which ones did you see? ü§î amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?
Blue Spring Ride,"> is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
Blue Spring Ride,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
Blue Spring Ride,üôÇüíï
Blue Spring Ride,It‚Äôs great but it‚Äôs depressing.
Blue Spring Ride,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
Blue Spring Ride,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
Blue Spring Ride,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
Blue Spring Ride,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7‚Ä¶ cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
Blue Spring Ride,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
Blue Spring Ride,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
Blue Spring Ride,Oh my bad. I‚Äôm late to the party.
Blue Spring Ride,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
Blue Spring Ride,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

damn. guess i gotta hurry and check this one out now. lol."
Blue Spring Ride,"You should check out Kotaro Lives Alone, such a good show!"
Blue Spring Ride,"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven‚Äôt managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
Blue Spring Ride,I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!
Blue Spring Ride,I think no one really understood what the white lotus was about in season 1 and now that they know it‚Äôs just a fun satire it has a much broader audience

Blue Spring Ride,"It took a bit for me to get into the first episode, but I‚Äôm interested. I don‚Äôt know why they even brought back the dead body aspect of the first season. It was never really about who died or who killed them.

Love Aubrey Plaza‚Äôs character. Some of her quirks hit a little too close to home."
Blue Spring Ride,"We watched the first episode of S2 yesterday and are instantly hooked, really curious to find out who died this time!"
Blue Spring Ride,Season 1 was a great unexpected guilty pleasure of mine each release night. Very much looking forward to the same in season 2.
Blue Spring Ride,"I wonder how many viewers were habitually tuning in at the same time as House of the Dragon. I figured HBO is trying to make it a routine to switch on HBO at 9. 

I bet once this season of White Lotus ends another show will be right there the week after."
Blue Spring Ride,"Ok, the real question is was that really Theo James‚Äô giant schlong or a prosthetic?"
Blue Spring Ride,"""Season 2 episode 1 of popular show gets more viewers than season 1 episode 1 of brand new, unknown show.""

No shit"
Blue Spring Ride,"I keep meaning to watch this, need to get on it instead of rewatching older HBO shows constantly haha!"
Blue Spring Ride,"Personally I thought the first season was suuuuper overhyped, and I was just baffled that it got so much awards attention. Jennifer Coolidge was an exception, and obviously HBO could tell, which is why they kept her. I hope Season 2 has more substance.

Watching rich white people be shitty and self-absorbed at the expense of others isn't inherently funny. You have to actually be funny, too. Otherwise it's just real life.

ETA: Will never say no to another Molly Shannon cameo, tho"
Blue Spring Ride,I had no idea it was back.
Blue Spring Ride,"GF brought me to watch this show. 

Season 1 was fun. Season 2 seems good so far. Good to see Michael (Sopranos). Great actor. 

Will miss Diddario."
Blue Spring Ride,[deleted]
Blue Spring Ride,is this an anthology or a continuation of season 1?
Blue Spring Ride,I watched season 1 and enjoyed it quite a bit but never really tried to analyze deeply what it was about. What are you saying it is truly about that everybody missed?
Blue Spring Ride,"I heard the writer of School of Rock was making a comedy about a Hotel with ultra rich people, and was like, Fuck, I have to watch that."
Blue Spring Ride,"> it‚Äôs just a fun satire 

It is absolutely more than that - there are super dark undertones.

A lot of the first season is about the sense of narcissistic entitlement of elites and the sad spectacle of people circling around them hoping for advancement or love at their own peril. Sort of like a more comedic ""The Great Gatsby""

2nd season seems to be going down the same path."
Blue Spring Ride,"whiteness. season 1 was about whiteness.

season 2 is about sex."
Blue Spring Ride,Someone had a lot of fun with that track
Blue Spring Ride,Yup. Good episode that setup the characters quite well. Rico still a dick.
Blue Spring Ride,Brilliant to add Aubrey Plaza to this show. Also I love how they have her playing the 'straight man' for once.
Blue Spring Ride,Every hbo show is a hit now. Cz hbo max is now popular.
Blue Spring Ride,"Mike White, the show creator is pretty amazing. Enlightened is worth seeing"
Blue Spring Ride,This show confuses me with it‚Äôs popularity. I couldn‚Äôt even make it through the first episode.
Blue Spring Ride,Monster hit? Nope.
Blue Spring Ride,It didn't even hit 2 million viewers. Not really a monster hit...
Blue Spring Ride,"Your definition of ""monster hit"" must be very loose, lol. This is critically popular, yes because the media likes to jerk off to itself but it's not like it has a huge viewership."
Blue Spring Ride,"My first thought when I saw this scene was, ‚ÄúThat girl looks like Angelina!‚Äù Lol it took me a minute"
Blue Spring Ride,That‚Äôs so cool!
Blue Spring Ride,"Satire and murder mystery, proven track record, both genres"
Blue Spring Ride,"She‚Äôs playing against type too, kinda love it. And Chris moltisanti!"
Blue Spring Ride,"I didn't see a trailer or any ads for season 2, I was going to watch off the strength of season 1 alone, but when I saw her on the boat.....I was stoked."
Blue Spring Ride,GTFO AUBREY??
Blue Spring Ride,"Yep, and the annoyance of having to see and skip the ad for this every time I watch HotD also ensures I will never watch it."
Blue Spring Ride,"Everyone loves a murder, especially when you have to guess who did it. It‚Äôs one of the oldest tropes in fiction. 

I think it works really well in this show; you‚Äôre watching all these interesting characters reveal more about themselves and then you suddenly remember that someone is going to die soon."
Blue Spring Ride,Because she didn‚Äôt like Ted Lasso? Or the watching streaming while the world ends?
Blue Spring Ride,"HBO has always aired their shows on Sunday nights at 9:00, though, so this isn't really anything new."
Blue Spring Ride,Sunday at 9 is the HBO prestige drama slot. The few shows I watch live are Sunday nights on HBO
Blue Spring Ride,"Probably The Last of Us, hopefully with Succession S4 close behind."
Blue Spring Ride,"> I figured HBO is trying to make it a routine to switch on HBO at 9.

That's... that's been the airtime for their flagship series for decades"
Blue Spring Ride,hbo's been doing the disney+ thing for years
Blue Spring Ride,I sure hope so. HBO has been delivering. Whens succession? Gotta be soon.
Blue Spring Ride,Probably the nevers
Blue Spring Ride,Prosthetic. He discussed it in an article.
Blue Spring Ride,Last season ended in August 2021...
Blue Spring Ride,[deleted]
Blue Spring Ride,"I think it‚Äôs satire showing how the rich guests ruined the lives of the workers, then faced zero consequences. 

The hotel manager got killed, while the guest who killed him walked free. The Hawaiian worker who was told to steal from the family got arrested, while the parents bonded over it. The spa woman got screwed over by Jennifer Coolidge, while JC met her future husband. First episode another Hawaiian worker has a baby on the job."
Blue Spring Ride,No I‚Äôm in the same boat as you. The way the show was presented in the beginning was as being way deeper though and I‚Äôm sure it can be if you try super hard but don‚Äôt think that adds too much to the story in all honestly
Blue Spring Ride,Narcissism. Greed. Is the underlying tone I get. Making satire of the nature of the characters and the people that tolerate them.
Blue Spring Ride,Money makes people assholes.
Blue Spring Ride,"It's not that deep, just poking at both rich patrons and the staff who serve them.  The most subversive thing about it is that it doesn't fall firmly on the side of ""rich people bad."" It just kinda shows how their flavor of bad is consequence free."
Blue Spring Ride,"It is a satire about left wing and right wing, taking jabs at both sides"
Blue Spring Ride,"Rich people always get what they want and poor people always get stomped on. 

* The dumb girl went free while the local went to jail
* Jennifer Coolidge promised the masseuse to go into business with her but didn't (she did get a bunch of cash though) and had her hopes stomped on
* The douchey guy killed a guy and was a jerk to his wife but walked free and kept the wife AND got his room upgrade that he wanted"
Blue Spring Ride,This seems to be personified best in the second season with Jennifer Coolidge‚Äôs character literally making a prisoner out of her personal assistant.
Blue Spring Ride,"I mean, ultimately it's just not *that* dark.  It's just a super fancy hotel, where people are paying for over the top service."
Blue Spring Ride,Mike White wrote the show so it‚Äôs literally White-ness
Blue Spring Ride,"Sorry to all the fragile whites out there who downvoted this!

it‚Äôs true though. There‚Äôs a ton of articles out there which discuss whether  its    critique of whiteness was successful or not, but that‚Äôs what it was about."
Blue Spring Ride,Why is this downvoted when even the writer admits this.
Blue Spring Ride,Yeah it's much better now that they're shed the pretension of social commentary (Knives Out did that much better).
Blue Spring Ride,I don't remember him being such an asshole in S1
Blue Spring Ride,Yea but at least hes in the BLM
Blue Spring Ride,A dick with blue balls
Blue Spring Ride,"Is she really the ""straight man?""  I feel like that's her husband.  She's the instigator of discomfort in most of her scenes in the pilot."
Beelzebub,I hope this is gonna be good. The book had its own charm and it's gonna be a challenge to bring this on screen. 
Beelzebub,[removed]
Beelzebub,Gaiman is writer/showrunner and starring David Tennant and Michael Sheen. IDK either but it is in good hands.
Beelzebub,[removed]
Beelzebub,TBH I was a little surprised he is so involved. Back when he wrote his first Doctor Who episode he was asked about his interest in being head writer for the show and he basically said it would be too time consuming. I suppose it was different with Good Omens since it‚Äôs his own IP. Maybe he didn‚Äôt think anyone else could do it properly. 
Beelzebub,He‚Äôs probably extremely involved because he knew that is what Pratchett would‚Äôve wanted. 
Beelzebub,That too probably.
Heartbreak High,"Wtf such a good messed up show. Harper just pisses me off to no end. First ghosts her best friend, let‚Äôs her take the full fall for the sex map, sleeps with her xbest friends crush, and then sleeps with her xbest friends new boyfriend. Girl is so messed up in the head and Amerie just keeps getting the shit on. Still love the show and the diversity, but damn I hate that biznitch Harper lmao."
Heartbreak High,The Drazic and Anita era will always reign supreme.
Heartbreak High,"I loved it and I really hope there will be more seasons. I haven‚Äôt seen Skins so I thought it was like a mix of Sex Education and Euphoria. I thought it was a good representation of Australian teenagers today, or what I know of them anyway."
Heartbreak High,"My only complaint is that I get the feeling that the Showrunners didn't want the audience to fully pick up on the fact that Peter Rivers is Darren's dad. Doesn't help that Scott Major grew a giant beard and looks nothing like his younger self.

I think I would have enjoyed his scenes more if I knew it was him. Like, aww, look how much that racist, homophobic bigot has grown up.

---
Oh and Chaka is Darren's boss. Wish I didn't need Wikipedia to tell me that one."
Heartbreak High,"I'm in need of a high school teen show that's as fun as sex education and heavy as euphoria, is this show as fun and heavy as these two?"
Heartbreak High,It is actually good and the story is legit interesting. On E6... Hoping the arc about the friend gets revealed
Heartbreak High,"Oh, wow! I can't believe they actually did it! Rumors of a sequel have been going on for what feels like decades! And Rivers is back! Gonna try and watch it asap."
Heartbreak High,My 90s heart got so nostalgic for the OG series. On episode 4. Good stuff
Heartbreak High,It‚Äôs a clear representation of the gen Z for sure. The soundtrack is gold.
Heartbreak High,harper is annoying
Heartbreak High,"I must be old, but this show is just too catty."
Heartbreak High,Did they use the same music for the opening credits?
Heartbreak High,"This is my first time hearing of it, but I'll give it a try"
Heartbreak High,"I love this show! I‚Äôm on episode 4 and it‚Äôs so freaking good. I don‚Äôt see it on any top 10 lists or anything, and it‚Äôs kinda disheartening. I don‚Äôt know why more people aren‚Äôt talking about it. It‚Äôs so good."
Heartbreak High,Amerie deserves better this whole show
Heartbreak High,"I've been needing to discuss this for a week now, I thought it was great and really engaging

My only gripe is that >!Darren is insufferable and I cannot stand the way they treat other people!<"
Heartbreak High,"Can I finally get teen drama show with lgbtq on each corner? I mean, fuck. I don't care about lgbtq, am not hater, but this much propoganda is making me start to hate it."
Heartbreak High,The music has nostalgic throwback but it‚Äôs not believable that 1) you wouldn‚Äôt be belting out garbage in the car with your pals and 2) this era would be crying to a thousand miles.
Heartbreak High,Started watching it. Love it! And yes very much like Skins! Great show!
Heartbreak High,"They missed a chance to update the original show that tackled issues face by teenagers by turning it into a pastiche of Sex Education, where they only talk about sex. Shame..."
Heartbreak High,I love her I‚Äôm sorry üò≠
Heartbreak High,"And she never apologized. She just kept saying ""i didn't mean to"", ""it just happened"" etc. Everybody else apologized for their mistakes (well, except spider but that's his character). Yes, horrible things happened to her, but she could have at least acknowledged how her actions hurt people, too."
Heartbreak High,have some compassion ffs.
Heartbreak High,YESSS
Heartbreak High,"Showing my age a bit, but we went and visited one of the sets during filming as part of Year 12 Media Studies"
Heartbreak High,"I just finished Season 3, parts way through Season 4 and I'm already a little turned off by the fact that I'm already down to like 4 original cast members.

Hell, I was already a little turned off by the main character dying off screen between Season 1 and 2. And they wouldn't be the last character to die off screen between seasons."
Heartbreak High,"Yes, this was the best."
Heartbreak High,I recommend Skam. It's a Norwegian TV show based on high school kids and it's super realistic in my eyes.
Heartbreak High,"If you liked euphoria you'll love skins. Similar vibe but less ""artsy"" if that makes sense"
Heartbreak High,Skins is the show that made drugged out gritty teen drama a genre. Definitely watch it.
Heartbreak High,"it was subtly done. i dont think they wanted to go hardcore on the nostalgia but having it there for the fans to pick up on. for young people, they're just other characters. its a little different compared to the reunion tv show that degrassi next gen was."
Heartbreak High,So Rivers obviously didn't stay with Sam. I wonder what happened between them.
Heartbreak High,Yes and honestly i think this show is better than sex education and euphoria
Heartbreak High,"yes yes yes,it‚Äôs so good"
Heartbreak High,"Mine as well.
I got the impression that 75% of the students are gay or bi (I'm bi myself, so I don't judge them).
But I don't think this represents real life, does it?
So I like the OG more."
Heartbreak High,No sadly!
Heartbreak High,omg this ! I‚Äôm looking everywhere for some buzz on it. Not even on TikTok? It‚Äôs so strange.
Heartbreak High,out of all the characters Darren is the one you have issue with?
Heartbreak High,"Darren??? But they're just as ""insufferable"" as any of the characters? They've all done some stupid shit at some point"
Heartbreak High,"Darren is a sweetheart!

James majoos stole every scene they were in. I feel Darren is this shows secret sauce like katerina was in the previous show. A little prickly but has a heart of gold.

I really didn't warm to Sasha. I found her ingenuine and she never really got called out for her ableism and selfishness. I felt she viewed her relationship with quinni as more of a community service than a genuine relationship. 

As for the show itself it did win me over. It's a little bit too polished at times and some of the humour bordered on cartoonish but came together really well at the end.

Would like to see them build on Missy's character next season. I really liked her scenes with Malachi. also focus on some of the teachers and home lives of the students more like the original show."
Heartbreak High,"hmmm, this feels weird underlying phobic as Darren is not even close to the morally worst of the characters, nor are they particularly overburdened with bad qualities in compared to good."
Heartbreak High,I got a problem with him too because It‚Äôs represented as the typical gay that‚Äôs bitching about everybody but the last episodes when we found out his weaknesses makes it empathetic.
Heartbreak High,"Can I finally get a teen drama show without straight people on each corner? I mean, fuck. I don't care about the straights, am not a hater, but this much ""propoganda"" (a not o btw) for straight people is making me start to hate them."
Heartbreak High,"gay people exist, deal with it"
Heartbreak High,"There‚Äôs only one season,let‚Äôs give them a chance to expand in the next season maybe ?"
Heartbreak High,"harper is hella toxic. its ok to be broken by your traumas, its not ok to take others down as a way of coping with your traumas. Harper needs major therapy and honestly did not deserve Ameries forgiveness."
Heartbreak High,"Okay I saw this comment before getting deeper into the show,I‚Äôm on ep 5 now.Can you explain why you like Harper ? I‚Äôm genuinely curious"
Heartbreak High,"My guess is that Rivers realised there was a really fucked up power-dynamic between them; or Sam realised Rivers was being co-dependent and finally called things off.

Darren was born somewhere between 2001-2004 (the show's been in development for a while and I don't remember a birth year being mentioned). Rivers and Sam ran off together in 1995, that's a good 6-9 years for them to spend time together, break up with each other, and then for Rivers to grow up, mature, date, and then impregnate Darren's mother.

Sam and Rivers had a dangerous, toxic relationship whose foundation was built on a mutal love of motorbikes and childhood trauma. Not to mention that it was a student/teacher relationship, where Rivers was either a minor at the time - 17 - or very barely 18. I'll be honest, I cannot imagine a world where that relationship lasted past 1998 and I have doubts that it lasted even that long."
Heartbreak High,"No? The main characters were mostly queer, but that doesn‚Äôt speak for the rest of the characters. It‚Äôs very common for friendship circles to be clusters of queer people."
Heartbreak High,Such a pity
Heartbreak High,">I really didn't warm to Sasha. I found her ingenuine and she never really got called out for her ableism and selfishness. I felt she viewed her relationship with quinni as more of a community service than a genuine relationship.

This is similar to my problem with Darren - they never get called out for being so unaccepting of Cash not being ready for sex"
Heartbreak High,"darren is not just ""a typical gay"" and is far more complex a character than ""just bitching about everyone"", and also you are misgendering them. If you are going to complain about a queer character and also use the wrong pronouns, this screams a bit underlying phobic."
Heartbreak High,Its too fucking much dude.
Heartbreak High,"After watching all episodes, I have to say it was pretty entertaining and I'm looking forward for S2. My initial comment still stands though but with more nuance."
Heartbreak High,"did you even watch the entire season hahaha

edit: meant to comment this back to the person who originally made this comment (who obviously didn‚Äôt finish the season)"
Heartbreak High,"Haha sure-I guess because she‚Äôs tough and went through some shit. What she did to Amerie wasn‚Äôt right, but it felt like real life."
Heartbreak High,I totally agree. It was a very unhealthy relationship.
Heartbreak High,"he is not not ready for sex, he is ace. I think Darren was just projecting their own insecurities onto Cash"
Heartbreak High,oh grow up
Heartbreak High,"ur absolutely not okay if u think that was a justification for her behaviour‚Ä¶
it‚Äôs honestly shocking people think that‚Äôs an excuse"
Heartbreak High,"After finishing the season,I get it 100% she is tough. She didn‚Äôt deserve what she was dealt and I think she was trying her best with what she was given. I honestly wanted hug her at the beginning of ep 8. I can‚Äôt believe she carried such a heavy load."
Heartbreak High,Is straight tv series too much to ask? Lmao
Heartbreak High,"@micewantpants

Are you good bro? So let me just quickly rethink the plot here....

Harper got extremely lucky & survived an attempt of a group of guys trying to rape her, then she comes home and her junkie dad wants to beat her up & she has no immediate other adult in her life to turn to, so she goes to her best friend's house, but her best friend ignores her (Harper sees how Amerie turns the light in her room off) AND YOU'RE UPSET SHE HAD SEX WITH HER BEST FRIEND'S CRUSH?!?!?! 
Get your priorities in order, because they seem fucked up to me! Seriously get some fucking compassion ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
Heartbreak High,when did i say it justified all of her actions lol
Heartbreak High,you truly believe there are more lgbt series than straight series‚Ä¶? oh man‚Ä¶ just watch literally anything
Heartbreak High,then don‚Äôt watch it. Tv is saturated with series full of straight people.
Heartbreak High,Ok how was Amerie supposed to harper was going through all of that when she doesn't tell her?? Amerie isn't psychic
Heartbreak High,"In the last year/-s, yes. They film it like there is only lgbt people in world rn, but that ain't true. They are still minority."
Heartbreak High,"Yes I know, my point is not that Amerie is at fault here. My point is that Harper had 2 horrible things happen to her right after another and I think it's understandable if she now doesn't think about what's the morally right thing to do anymore (when you're almost being raped you have to feel so violated, because rapists don't act morally at all obviously).. But the shitty thing is that her best friend Amerie is now suffering as well, because Harper is acting out & slept with Amerie's bf and crush..."
Heartbreak High,"I just don't get why she punched her and was so mean to her... harper could have at least said something but she just said ""you know what you did"" like how could she know??"
Heartbreak High,"Ur insane, Amerie was black out drunk and probably in the middle of having sex with spider, not to mention Harper ghosted her and expected amerie to know what happened and then punched amerie in the face when she asked what happened. Then hooked up with her crush and then also with her boyfriend, and you still think Harper is in the right.

Yes horrible shit happened to Harper but that doesn‚Äôt give Harper the excuse to be horrible to everybody else around her"
Heartbreak High,I'm excited!  I didn't think it would be renewed because it didn't chart in the US.
Heartbreak High,Now fucking renew Sandman.
Heartbreak High,[deleted]
Heartbreak High,"I've been praying for this one, did not think we would get another season."
Heartbreak High,loooooved the original series back in the 90¬¥s. It was one of those shows you made sure you were home to watch.
Heartbreak High,"Can't believe the most lovable character in this show was the fucking eshay... 

I knew a whole lot of eshays and none were lovable"
Heartbreak High,Yessss this is such a good teen show. Honestly surprised to hear it was charting cuz I certainly saw no promotions about it in the US and I've seen like no one talk about it üò©
Heartbreak High,"I watched a few episodes. It's pretty good but I dropped it only because I've seen too many of these sorts of shows. Never Have I Ever, Sex Education, Euphoria, etc."
Heartbreak High,It did chart globally for 3 weeks in a row though...
Heartbreak High,They did mention The Sandman as a show that performed well at their quarterly report so that bodes well for its future!
Heartbreak High,"i think Sandman is safe and basically already renewed. 

source: trust me dude."
Heartbreak High,The second season is already being written. Don't think they'd do that if they weren't sure there will be a second season.
Heartbreak High,More Degrassi than The OC.
Heartbreak High,It's gone crazy on Tumblr and TikTok over the past month.
Heartbreak High,"To me, it felt like a mix between Sex Education and Skins, and I ate it up. I'm 28."
Heartbreak High,"I had to Google ""eshay"" to understand this comment"
Heartbreak High,"It didn't chart in the US, I never saw it on the top ten list.  I'm thrilled and surprised that it's getting renewed."
Heartbreak High,"> ""Spent three weeks in global top 10 TV shows on Netflix (hitting #6, #5, #8 and amassing over 42.6M hours viewed in the three weeks )""

I could swear i never saw it here in Norway, even on the global list, unless i just totally ignored it.

And i always check the top 10 lists, to see whats new and popular."
Heartbreak High,"Truth is it really hasn‚Äôt. It fell off the streaming charts quickly and failed to leg out the way something like Cobra Kai did, a show that costs a fraction as much to make btw."
Heartbreak High,"‚ÄúWe have some scripts ready‚Äù /= Season 2 is already written. They just fleshed out what season 2 could be and probably wrote some scenes while working on season 1, but they wouldn‚Äôt solid complete anything until they were being paid to, and as of now Netflix hasn‚Äôt ordered any additional scripts."
Heartbreak High,"Creator will probably shop the series around to different studios if Netflix does not pick up season 2.

So i makes sense to write S2 anyway."
Heartbreak High,Very Degrassi
Heartbreak High,Gonna have to google a lot of aussie slang if you watch this show
Heartbreak High,"Are you serious, never in the top ten!?! It did solid numbers in Australia, I wonder if that's what matters most, 'Heartstopper' did very well in the UK and got two new seasons. It also stayed in the top ten here in Iceland until Dahmer came out."
Heartbreak High,">Reached top 10 shows in over 43 countries around the world on Netflix including US, Europe, Africa and Asia"
Heartbreak High,"This could be because the lists it was on was the ""English Speaking"" Top 10 - it may be a different list in certain European countries."
Heartbreak High,Very Sex Education
Heartbreak High,"Believe it or not, you just sold me on it now."
Heartbreak High,"More 'Next Class' than 'Next Generation' though.

I loved that it's basically an R-Rated version of Degrassi Next Class focussing on the queer clique and isn't afraid to go deep into Australian culture and subcultures and say Australian slang words and everyone says 'fuck' and 'cunt' every other word."
