TV Show,Comment
Matador,It was a fun show & I was looking forward to the 2nd season and now this! Why renew it & then cancel it ?
Matador,"This is a bummer, this show was a lot of fun and had a good cast."
Matador,"I know it didn't get the best critical reception but I found El Rey's 'From dusk till dawn: the series' a very fun show so I'm looking foward to this, it seems like it'll be pretty fun as well. I like that El Rey is taking Starz apporach in giving most of their shows a second season. "
Matador,"Hope you enjoy the show. Stick with it, it really heats up after a couple of episodes. "
Matador,"For what little it showed, seems like it could be a cool show. "
Matador,Tell me the football cover is just in the pilot
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"Damn this takes me back. I remember CN would do other music videos with their shows/characters. I remember one with Atom Ant, another with Courage the Cowardly Dog...fun times"
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,Big-O was a fuckin banger
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,This is some solid nostalgia fuel
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,Peter Cullen has that kinda voice that always gives you goosebumps
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,Yeah.. I could use a Megadeus
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,I remember downloading this on Kazaa. This and their other video “Mad Rhetoric”
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,The one downside of VoD is missing out on these vignettes.
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,I miss old TN and then adult swim / late night stuff till 4am…
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"Man, Toonami was the absolute shit."
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,It's tsunami megamix is pretty good with DJ Clark Nova
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"The voiceover is talking about a Terminator-style machine war, but most of the clips are showing mechs with human pilots. Even the bit from Dragonball Z has a human brain."
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"Fuck this is cool, I wish I'd grown up with Toonami"
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKqFBkskx7M
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,My favorite was the [Jabber Jaw](https://youtu.be/Vn1pf0Xi3nU) music video.
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,Wow I forgot all about those. Thanks for the memories!
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"Still is! basically just ""if bruce wayne has a mech"" and also everyone in gotham has amnesia. i still rewatch it about once a year, so much style in that show"
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,Nothing makes you feel old like finding out Toonami turned 25.
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,Optimus Prime talking about machines/computers wiping out humanity as they grow self aware. 10/10
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,Was that a site like Limewire?
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"**YES THIS IS IT!!!!**

Holy shit, thank you. I'm about to look for their old school bumps and just vibe out to nostalgia."
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,I remember a cartoon channel put together a bunch of clips of various cartoons set to Bare Naked Ladies “Falling For The First Time” and it always stuck with me.
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,If you're interested the band that does this is called Pain and they make great ska music
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"[This is a great channel for that](https://www.youtube.com/c/SlimD716V2/videos), all of Toonami's finest remastered in stunning HD"
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"Well aware, but thank you! I'm sure Pain is the root of my love for ska as an adult."
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"This show is a masterclass of raising stakes in a story.  Do not sleep on it, even if it is dated."
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"Man, first Babylon 5 is remastered on HBO Max,and now Mobile Suit Gundam is finally streaming.  Good week for sci-fi."
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"When I was a kid watching it on toonami I thought it was a mecha show about a whining teen pilot.

After giving it a re-watch, be2i love the spin offs 08th MS team and sequel, Zeta Gundam. I learned it was truly what showed me war is fought by kids, 16-19 year olds who should be making love, or riding bikes in the park. It's deeper than you gave it credit for. The last battle, which takes place over 3 episodes has some of the most heart string drama and best space battles I've see.

Amuro isn't whining, he has PTSD and combat fatigue."
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"Recommended watching for seasoned mech fans if they haven't already seen it. 

It's dated, but it's one of the most influential giant robot shows of all time gets something from this one. Kids going to war, getting psychologically messed up and coming out of it with lost friends and more mental issues then what they came with.

Also the robots r kewl."
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,My body is ready for the Bright Slap.
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"If you’ve never seen MSG and start with this, don’t worry if it’s not your cup of tea. The fun thing about it is there’s a Gundam for everyone. So you could try one of the other series. Want one that’s coo coo bananas? G Gundam baby! Small scale drama with a Romeo and Juliet bent? 08th MS Team (my personal favorite). There’s even ones that are beyblade with Gundam in Build Drivers. Possibilities are endless"
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,[deleted]
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"I just checked a week ago and was super disappointed. Checked it this morning and there it is! 

Man. Brings me back to the days of running to the living room, plugging in the code to turn the huge satellite dish, and then going downstairs to watch it with my glass of milk and Oreo pop tarts on my tiny tv."
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"I was really impressed when I watched this. They did an amazing job of actually making the enemy into human beings instead of just fist shaking villains. Plus, they actually had a setting in which they convinced me that using giant robots to fight made sense."
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"I just wish we could get Zeta on streaming now, but I assume due to rights issues, pertaining to the opening, that won't happen."
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"This show is awful, guys. Nobody watch it. Whole series is based on a lie.

The One Year War doesn’t even last one year."
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,A story so good they told it again uh how many series are just a new take on MSG? 7 or so I think
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,Can someone verify that this is what **Gundam origins** is the prequel too.  I confused myself reading up on it.
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,I wish I could bundle this service with other things. The cost is a little high for the amount of anime I would watch but if it were a small add on to like Hulu this would be great.
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,will hello kitty appear in the new time line?
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,I tried to get into this but couldn't :(
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"Great news! I do, however, prefer the the theatrical movies, which do a good job at condensing the series and trimming out the unnecessary fat, not to mention they redid some scenes that looked kind of bad on the show. I'm just sad that we've yet to receive a proper remake of the original. The Origin OVA doesn't cover the whole Origin manga (which is an excellent remake of the original series, authored/illustrated by the original character designer). I'm also sad that we never got a 90s remake in the style of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCRtFptEMF8). Damn it would've looked good!"
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,No MSG added.
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,They're lucky they weren't sued for stealing the lightsaber.
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"If your really into this kind of old anime I would suggest watching Legion of the galactic hero's, it's sort of like the [anime version of babylon 5] (https://i.imgur.com/jiVJML3.jpg). They [remade] (https://i.imgur.com/WaDOMAy.jpg) the first two seasons in 2018."
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"Great!.

Now someone please sort out the details for Space Battleship Yamato (1974).

Can't even find a boxed set for the series that isn't insane due to being out of print."
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,So will this be on HBO Max???
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,Huge Gundam fan! Such a classic!
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"It also has an amazingly funky soundtrack!

Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"In the start pretty bog standart mecha stuff, but after they arrive to earth becomes a great, but a bit corny, war drama."
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"> raising stakes

You might like https://myanimelist.net/anime/19/Monster"
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,Babylon 5 is being remaster wha??
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,MSG is also on Funimation's streaming service BTW if you prefer mostly dub offerings. Just an FYI.
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"Yeah there's an episode where Amuro goes fully catatonic and Bright just has him strapped into the gundam and sent off, figuring that once he was in battle he'd snap out of it when his survival instinct kicked in."
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"Huh, sounds like Evangelion."
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"> 
> It's dated, but it's one of the most influential giant robot shows of all time. gets something from this one. Kids going to war, getting psychologically messed up and coming out of it with lost friends and more mental issues then what they came with.

I'd highly recommend checking out Zambot 3, it's Tomino's(Director / Creator of Gundam) previous work that pushed the boundaries on robot anime. Suffice to say a lot of shit gets fucked up and it's not all goofiness."
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,08th MS Team is also my favorite. It really hit me different from anything else I had ever seen from Anime up to that point. It was also one of my favorite Gundam toys since it had the working backpack haha.
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"I fuckin love G Gundam. It's definitely part nostalgia from it airing on Cartoon Network after school when I was a kid. But that series is what got me into Gundam. Everyone hates on it, but its hands down my favorite from what I've seen."
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,I liked G Gundam. I liked Gundam Wing more.
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"Yeah if I'm recommending something to non-anime fans, MSG is not where I'd usually start. It can be...tedious. It is more for the anime fan who wants to see the classic roots of a franchise that now spans several universes."
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"9/11 happened and killed off the anime that was ""too serious."" Then Toonami got moved to Saturday and Miguzi, which was lighter fare with shows like Teen Titans and Code Lyoko, took over on weekdays."
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"Oh man, is it your first time watching? You're in for a ride! Definitely check out Zeta Gundam when you finish and the rest of the UC and other Gundam and mecha stuff in general. There's some incredible stuff out there that deals with some really heavy themes.

If you have any questions or need reccomendations, the folks over at r/Gundam are super friendly! Welcome, fellow Newtype!"
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"They simply replaced the opening song on the blu-ray, surely they could do that for streaming."
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"I haven't seen Gundam and don't know the story of it beyond that people pilot robots but if a war happened *within* one year then I think ""One Year War"" is an appropriate name for it."
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,Seed was like a shot for shot remake at some points.
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,The Gundam Origins OVA is a prequel to Mobile Suit Gundam... sorta. It’s technically pulled from the Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin manga which was a retelling of Mobile Suit Gundam and is made by one of the original illustrators of the show. It changes a few things from the original series but but you can still watch the Gundam Origins OVAs as prequel content to the original series.
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"This is correct. Gundam has 2 universes to it

1. ""The Universal Century"" which is what the ""main"" story of Gundam is. Its a massive war between the Zeon and the Earth Federation

2. Pretty much everything NOT the Universal Century. These are just one off worlds/dimensions that exist to tell a single story in a season, they have no relation to the Universal Century. These stories are actually more popular in terms of viewership- ""G Gundam"" (my favorite) Iron Blooded Orphans Gundam Seed and Gundam Wing

The UC is about 2 guys, Amuro Ray who is the protagonist and Char Aznable who is the anti-villain of the show. Gundam Origins gives us the backstory of Char Aznable. Gundam Origins is hella tight though, its effectively a Monte Cristo story"
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,Origins won't make sense until you watch the original series.
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"I'll confirm it.  Sure. 

I've seen most of the gundam universe, and honestly don't have any idea what goes where, but I'll confirm it

Shining Finger! buh buh da buh da ba da!"
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"The free version of crunchyroll has pretty much everything (barring certain original stuff), you just have to wait a week for new things and a lot of stuff isn't in HD."
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,">The cost is a little high for the amount of anime I would watch

I watch crunchyroll free of charge without ads. Just use an adblocking browser extension."
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,Isn’t it cheaper than every other streaming service?
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"> The cost is a little high for the amount of anime I would watch

They also have some non-anime stuff like 
 cherry magic that was one of top shows in japan last year https://www.crunchyroll.com/cherry-magic-thirty-years-of-virginity-can-make-you-a-wizard"
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,MSG had already showed up on Funi's streaming service and a lot of their offerings end up on Hulu so who knows.
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,They did just release a hello kitty gundam.
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"The animation is dated and there was a lot of goofiness, because it had a lot of super robot tropes.

I'd try the movie trilogy, but it's not properly dubbed or legally available."
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"Try “War in the Pocket” gundam. Only 6 episodes. 

Most “universal century” gundam series are confusing, with weird names for characters, and a lot of it can be hard to keep track of. 

But not War in the Pocket.
It’s a lovely story. And if it’s still not your cup of tea after episode 1, no worries! Don’t force yourself just because others enjoy it. You probably already have things you enjoy anyway.

(Hopefully that one is on steaming. But you might also just be able to rent it)"
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"That's because despite the love, the old show is actually boring as hell, like an old episode of speed racer.  Try gundam unicorn."
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"Honestly, the simple omission of the G-fighter, G-bull, etc is enough on its own to make the movies vastly superior to the show."
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"Lucas stole the idea for light sabers from pulp science fiction stories from the the nineteen teens and movie serials from the thirties and forties. Hell the word ""Jedi"" is a bastardization of the term used in Japan for samurai films."
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,The soundtrack is also streaming on Spotify!
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"The soundtrack is so kitschy and I absolutely love it. My favourite track has got to be [From Sleep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFoKkeTmYp4&list=PLE234F313FF53A39C&index=3), especially from 1:16 onward.

EDIT: And how can I forget the incredibly funky [Combat Airspace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eszG8ww2GlQ&list=PLx9EEzTlMf5kEWPUK_a-q8OuVmHvf7ts5&index=5)!"
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,[I also love that it](https://youtu.be/_lOeFQvA-uM) [got a cover album by Andrew W. K. of all people.](https://youtu.be/zILVdHewOZ8)
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"To be fair, OG Gundam created most of the tropes that have become the standard for long form war anime series. The price of being a genre defining game changer."
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"Still, I advise everyone to watch the updated theatrical(1-3) or read the modernized series(the origin) instead. 

They are far more organized and accessible."
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,Already is and on HBO Max
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"I checked it out, it's not anything new just a little less blurry."
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"You know what got me? I rewatched it and Bright is the only survivor of the original crew, he was a military cadet in training. He was 19 years old. Not even an Ensign rank. And he was supposed to not only captain the most advanced ship in the fleet, but wrangle a bunch of literal kids. He is basically doing a Battlestar Galactica. I feel for him this time around. I watch the show in abject horror at like 25 as all the people dying except like Ramba Ral were 6 or 9 years younger than me.
Lalah Sunn was a genius bit of writing too if you watch further in the shows."
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"Turns out when you do stories with a lot of depressing themes and death, you probably have depression."
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"""Shut up and get in the Gundam, Amuro.""

Bright Noa is basically Gendo Ikari."
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,It’s like Evangelion if Evangelion was even slightly comprehensible.
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"Victory and Zeta had very dark moments, ZZ for the first half was slapstick and hammy but fans are rewarded once the theme song changes"
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,">Zambot 3

Thanks I'll definitely give it a watch. The reason I specified ""one of the most influential"" instead of the first or the beginning was exactly for shows like zambot and giant robot animes that came before it. 

I think Mobile suit specifically was like a big breaking point or milestone in the entire history of mecha anime. I remember hearing stories that when it's film premiered in cinemas they literally couldn't fit all the people who came to see it in the theatre because tomino apparently had a big announcement. They didn't expect it's popularity to be so wild. There are people who apparently recorded entire episodes of the show onto casette tapes just to listen on their walkmen and casette players. 

The vinyl was released and THAT became a best seller. 

tl;dr it was a huge fucking show."
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"They did that in the Bandai Visual release, so I'm not sure exactly what the deal is."
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"I’m just referencing a meme from r/Gundam.

Someone did the math and it’s two or three days short of one year."
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,Seed was more a remake of Wing IMO and Wing was a super-condensed remake of MSG+Zeta+CCA.
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,Yeah Seed was probably the worst regarding this. Still enjoyed it though
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"To elaborate, the original show was hampered by a combination of factors. The show was required by it's sponsors and producers to have a robot fight in every episode. The producers and sponsors meddled with the show constantly, forcing the creative staff to add designs to the show that only existed to make toys (most notably the G fighter or as Tomino called it, the coffin the series would be buried in) and forced them to make kid friendly episodes that broke with the rest of the narrative of the show. In addition, the show's run was cut from 52 episodes to 43. Also the main animator Yoshikazu Yasuhiko suffered from a severe medical crisis during the production of the show and was hospitalized about halfway through the run until the show's completion.

As a result of these limitations, major parts of the story such as the origins of Char Aznable and Sala Mass were cut for time as well as a planned flashback episode which would have explained much of the backstory to the runup to the one year war. The origin comic sought to remedy these issues as well as give the designs and tone a facelift to match the modern incarnations of the Universal Century. I'd highly recommend reading it. Yoshikazu Yasuhiko is an astonishingly talented artist and storyteller.  Not only are the drawings amazing, but the panel layouts, pacing, transitions and expressions are absolutely top notch. Unfortunately the vast majority of Yaz's comics have not been translated into English so the origin is one of only two comics he drew that you can get that isn't in Japanese."
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,Thanks!
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"G Gundam is absolutely hilarious. A martial arts tournament in giant ass robots, with all the characters and their respective nations being *hella* stereotyped. Funny as fuck. I mean, just look at [Master Asia's introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03Fdj3pVW6w) here."
Mobile Suit Gundam 00,"You’re forgetting the third type of series, build fighters, where kids build and battle figures based on the shows."
Tokyo Trial,[deleted]
Tokyo Trial,"Great write up!


I'm not familiar with most of these, and I watch a shit-ton of TV and movies. I really like the effort, and the writeups are perfect in length.


Again, not knowing these a lot, is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show? (Nothing against non English speakers of course) 


Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.


Totally agree with the couple from White Lotus being great characters, I much preferred season 1 (which seems like a hot take) but those two, specifically the woman, were very interesting characters to me."
Tokyo Trial,"""hidden gems of 2022 for me"" might be better title for this post.

i must admit some of these plots engaged my curiosity. im gonna look for them. rhanks for the list."
Tokyo Trial,"How you pick what to watch? I’m overwhelmed with all these shows in Netflix and I always seem to pick the limited series or those talked about in reddit, especially regarding to the foreign shows or K dramas. There isn’t much write-ups or reviews in English."
Tokyo Trial,I am glad and surprised Prisma is number one. Well deserved
Tokyo Trial,"This is Going to Hurt: I'm a medical student and I thought I'd seen every medical show but this one is on my list now! I've heard that this show shows the reality of a doctor's life without all the glamor of medicine.  
  
This show compared to other medical shows what do you think and what other medical shows have you watched I'm curious!"
Tokyo Trial,"Insanely odd for the 2 anime to show up to be an average romcom (with crazy production value) and a good but lesser known sequel.

(Oh NVM I thought this was a list from some website not yours! Still surprised to see MDUD though!)"

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ❤️"
Tokyo Trial,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
Tokyo Trial,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.
Tokyo Trial,No Atlanta? Both seasons last year were incredible
Tokyo Trial,Pachinko is the most slept on series of 2022
Tokyo Trial,"1. She hulk
2. Ted lasso
3. Ms Marvel
4. Harley Quinn show
5. Lord of the rings
6. Spy x family 
7. Chainsaw man
8. Loki
9. Mob psycho
10. Hot D"
Tokyo Trial,Which ones did you see? 🤔 amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?
Tokyo Trial,"> is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
Tokyo Trial,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
Tokyo Trial,🙂💕
Tokyo Trial,It’s great but it’s depressing.
Tokyo Trial,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
Tokyo Trial,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
Tokyo Trial,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
Tokyo Trial,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7… cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
Tokyo Trial,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
Tokyo Trial,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
Tokyo Trial,Oh my bad. I’m late to the party.
Tokyo Trial,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
Tokyo Trial,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

damn. guess i gotta hurry and check this one out now. lol."
Tokyo Trial,"You should check out Kotaro Lives Alone, such a good show!"
Tokyo Trial,"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven’t managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
Tokyo Trial,I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!
Tokyo Trial,"All of us are dead…that much rating? No, it belong to the worst honestly."
Tokyo Trial,"lmao that garbage korean zombie show is a 9.3 and severance only a 8.8, very questionable ratings"
Tokyo Trial,"*tl;dr? Here's every series on the list ranked from highest rated to lowest*:

Tokyo Trial,"I'll admit I haven'y seen most of these, but I 100% agree with your assessments on the ones I *have* seen. Severance was like a breath of fresh air! Unique, evocative, and humanist. It asks and answers the question: what if we had the ability to manage our pain in a completely nihilistic way? Who would do it and why? The characters, the acting, the symbolisms of the color schemes, the mystery, the horror...Ben Stiller is soooo good behind the camera. And if you like his sensibilities here, check out Escape from Danemora, a biopic abt the woman who helped 2 men escape a high security prison. Also with Patricia Arquette. Ben Stiller directed. This show is one of my top 5 favs this year. 

I usually LOVE shows like From. Unfortunately, it was lacking everything you mentioned. It made a really good premise feel trite and boring :/. 

A show you didn't mention but deserves to be here is Physical on AppleTV. Omg SO GOOD. Rose Byrne (love her!) is a woman with severe eating disorder (tw) who falls into 80s aerobics stardom. It's funny, it's sad, it's entertaining, and if you are someone who has had intrusive thoughts abt your physical appearance and laments what your past decisions have cost you in your life while trying to improve your current situation, this show will speak to you.

Peacemaker is HILARIOUS and surprising. Also in my top 5 this year. Pam and Tommy was good, not great, but I was entertained enough to watch it all. Gave me a whole diff perspective on Pam Anderson and left me feeling angry that no one went to jail over the theft!"
Tokyo Trial,"Don't agree with you on Bang Bang Baby. Thought it was executed magnificently but agree it could have been tighter. It was produced by the same guy who produced My Brilliant Friend and Young Pope. He also produced The King which came out this year. Think you'd love it: https://youtu.be/soami2tlDH4

Pachinko and Severance were great. The Tourist would have been great with a showrunner and writer like Steven Moffat. Could have been the British/ Aussie Fargo. Conversations with Friends was a waste of time. The book is untranslatable to screen but they still went with it. Peacemaker was great and had heart which was super surprising. Can't wait for the next season!"
Tokyo Trial,"I like ""workin moms"" on Netflix.  Good 30 minute comedy."
Tokyo Trial,"**THESE WERE OK:**

* Power Book IV: Force (Starz)

For a Power series I will say this Tommy Egan spinoff does do justice to the franchise's most beloved character. The tone is more consistent, the plot is more street-focused unlike the original and other spinoffs which tends to lose themselves in legal and family drama, and the show sets up a good environment for our main character to strive. His funny dialogue is still on point too of course, so is Joseph Sikora's comedic timing. The major downside here is that essentially 'Force' still very much is a Power series, and there's nothing here that you'll feel like you haven't seen before. It also comes with the same flaw as the rest of them, where it seems the plot just predictably goes around in circles, with almost all the side characters either destined for some kind of betrayal, or death.

rating: 6.7 out of 10

* Life After Life (BBC Two)

A science-fiction period-drama that follows the story of Ursula Todd, a woman in the first half of the 20th century who experiences an endless cycle of birth, death and rebirth. This premise does sound promising on paper, but the way it plays out is also the downside of watching this series. Don't get me wrong, there are times when this is fascinating, specifically the times where we watch our main character be reborn and take a different trajectory in life as an almost whole new person, as she learns from the mistakes she made in previous lives, but for a lot of its short runtime, the series really knocks you over the head with the concept, as we watch her die and be reborn again and again to the point where it becomes redundant. The visuals has its moments for a low-budget production, and there are moments where the series hits emotional marks, but by the end of it, you might be left wondering ""what exactly was the point of this?""

rating: 6.7 out of 10

* Shining Vale (Starz)

Shining Vale actually starts out pretty interesting, as a 30-minute comedy that mixes horror and psychology in quite a unique way, with witty dialogue that surprisingly never misses. But the issue is as you continue watching, there are way too many cliches here, which makes the core plot very predictable and stale. At least that's how I felt watching another show centered around the life of a writer, even if she's seeing ghosts.

rating: 6.8 out of 10

* Barons (ABC)

It's definitely something you watch more for the vibes as oppose to for the storytelling, and Barons really does capture that 70s hippie/surfer life vibe and aesthetic quite well. An Australian drama centered around surfers with a little bit of everything, from rivalries, to romances, to business, and even crime etc. Barons is mostly an easy-going type of series that pulls out the soap opera-esque moment here and there. Does it work? Well that's up to the type of mood you're in, but at times it may feel like not much is happening here until something crazy and unexpected does. And there are many different locations here as well as the story takes us from Australia, to Indonesia, to the U.S.A. (though obviously entirely filmed in Australia) with lovely beach views and surfing scenes... though at times it does feel like this series may be too ambitious for its own good. The acting is definitely a weak point, and it cause certain scenes to miss there mark, lacking that emotional punch great actors could've given them, but overall I'd say this series is a mixed bag. Enjoyable but flawed.

rating: 7.2 out of 10

* Les 7 vies de Léa (Netflix)

With quite a fun concept to work with, involving both time-traveling and body-swapping (something almost like '17 Again' or 'Freaky Friday' but not exactly), Les 7 vies de Léa is a mostly good show... but with some downsides. The good? It's entertaining, mysterious, quite unpredictable, filled with 90s nostalgia, and sets up explorations of teen mental health. The downsides? It doesn't reach the emotional and sentimental heights it obviously aims for, and that's mainly due to the script not taking time out to let the viewers get to know and connect with the suicidal main character (Lea)... that is, her life and who she was before this whole ordeal, and why she feels the way that she does. We get an in-depth look at a few others characters and their woes, but not with her, which makes the decision she makes at the end not have quite the effect that was intended.

rating: 7.0 out of 10

* Surviving Summer (Netflix)

A fun young-adult drama with some amazingly shot surf scenes (way better than the ones in Barons), which left me wondering if they used CGI. The acting is definitely a noticeable weak point, but the cast is young. And the premise, a troubled teen being sent away to an exotic location where she'll learn to be a better person, is something we've seen before, but it doesn't hinder this teen-drama filled with surf competitions from being a good enough watch.

rating: 6.7 out of 10"
Tokyo Trial,Looks like someone still needs to watch *This Is Going to Hurt*!
Tokyo Trial,Severance show
Tokyo Trial,"You wildin' fam. I know that one paragraph didn't elaborate much (*plan on doing a rewatch and writing a full review sometime*), but All of Us Are Dead is fantastic! Definitely my fav of the year so far. 

Only flaws I can think of is those crappy looking moments where there's bad CGI. But visually I think those tracking shots made up for it. 

Why didn't u like it?"
Tokyo Trial,lol why the hate for All -- Dead?
Tokyo Trial,Thanks. I've been meaning to check out Physical (along with some other Apple TV+ originals I missed out on) but haven't gotten the chance to yet. But that show is from last year so it wouldn't be on this list anyways.
Tokyo Trial,"I've never even heard of thaf show before now. But it ain't too late, I'll watch it and probably update the list."
Tokyo Trial,"I don’t care for the CGI or technical issues, nor the not well acting or not very good directing. The story, the story was very bad from beginning to end. Zero originality, the only were the ones who stayed normal being zombies, they didn’t have sense. There are many better anime or manga about zombies and school, especially with better characters and relationships. The part outside also was kind of pointless and really not interesting for me. I was really bored by it. And yes kind of poor realization then. But honestly storyline and development really disappointed me. 
No offense, I mean, you said it was the best for you for this year and it’s fine of course. That was just my opinion."
Tokyo Trial,"because its not good?

horrible writing, bad acting, trope infested, nothing original, not well shot... where the hell do you get a 9.3 for such a mediocre show?"
Tokyo Trial,Yes but they released s2 this year =)
Tokyo Trial,idk man to each his own. don't you think this was better than Highschool of the Dead though?
Tokyo Trial,"I'm literally the opposite of you on this one. Maybe if you thought it was ""*ok, not great*"" i wouldn't be surprised, but ""not good""?? Did you watch the show in dub or somethn? lol. 

Sure it's not the most original thing (I even mentioned *Highschool of the Dead* in the review), and it's definitely a trope-fest, but it still had some very inventive ideas and scenes. And it might not be the most original, but it's unique in the sense that it's multifaceted. 

It's... a teen-drama more than anything, even those it has political side stories to give a fuller scope of the situation. It starts as a teen-drama, and when the Zombie apocalypse happens, it doesn't stop being a teen-drama. Their conflicts, their relationships, their love interests etc., all of this is just forced under new deadly circumstances, so you'd have to actually care about all the silly crushes and the bullying and all that before it does. That's what fuels the story. 

> not well shot

Nah this is just wrong. Did you see those tracking shots!!?? 😩

But anyway, Severance and All Of Us Are Dead is just a 0.5 difference in rating. I absolutely loved both shows. Severance definitely have the best episode out of each too (the finale). I just found a teeny bit more fault with Severance (*mainly regarding production design*), thus it being half a point less."
Tokyo Trial,"No, HotD was a lot of fun, interesting, never boring or annoying, cool action scenes and cool characters as well, very enjoyable and not for the sizes of the girls."
Tokyo Trial,"c'mon man. everything you just said about H.O.T.D. can be said about All -- Dead. 😅 

I like H.O.T.D. but I actually like this one a bit more because it has more emotional depth. H.O.T.D. didn't have scenes like the one where the group were leaving their final messages to their families on a camcorder, not knowing if they were still alive or if they themselves would make it. It didn't have scenes like On-jo and Cheong-san's last conversation, or On-jo watching her father get devoured, or the final scene with all of them on the roof. H.O.T.D. was a bit too focused on giving us action sequences, you couldn't connect to the characters the same way you could here the way I see it. 

And it's not just the sad parts either, I think the youthfulness that stays with the characters even while going through the worst event of their lives is what makes them whole."
Tokyo Trial,"Definitely my favourite anime of the year, even though the ending seems a bit rushed"
Tokyo Trial,"I love the soundtrack, but hate the opening and ending songs."
Tokyo Trial,this isn't your blog
Tokyo Trial,"i kno. but instead of being all negative n shit, check out the show tho."
Tokyo Trial,You are on a sub for television. OP writes a review about a tv show. This is absolutely what the sub is designed for.
Tokyo Trial,"Next time you rewatch, pay more attention to Lucretia.  I get that she's not in the fight scenes, but from Gods of the Arena to Vengence her arc is fucking outstanding.  She's the best villain in the series, imo.

Her arc with Illythia was anything but a waste of time."
Tokyo Trial,"That first season of Spartacus was so special.  I'll never forget it.  There was one scene in particular where the elites have Spartacus kill his own friend for sport.  That scene has stuck with me for a very long time.  Whitfield was a fantastic actor.  I never looked at the later seasons because I saw Whitfield as Spartacus.  Based on some of the comments, it sounds like McIntyre has did well in the role so I may reconsider taking a look at the later seasons."
Tokyo Trial,Yet again the Gods spread cheek and ram COCK IN ASS!
Tokyo Trial,I love Kill them all episode (S1 Finale)
Tokyo Trial,"As a New Zealander, it was so cool to see so many Kiwis in the show, and also seeing half the cast from Shortland Street getting tits and dicks out."
Tokyo Trial,"I'm on my fourth or 5th burn though, wish went on to continue Ceasar and Crassus story at the end bit I'm pretty sure there's a show called Rome that pretty much does that. 

I want the team that made this show to tackle other historical events or do a Mortal Kombat series."
Tokyo Trial,"Seen this twice, such a great show."
Tokyo Trial,Quintus Lentulus Batiatus is one of my top all time favorite TV Characters
Tokyo Trial,"Awesome show. I was so skeptical of someone stepping into Andy's shoes. It was a little awkward for a few min, but Liam McIntyre nailed it once he got a groove."
Tokyo Trial,"Joey, do you like movies about gladiators?"
Tokyo Trial,Spartacus is the GOAT but what is OPs post?  It's too organized; I'm skeptical and confused.
Tokyo Trial,I came for the gladiator fights but stayed for the full frontal male nudity.
Tokyo Trial,YET AGAIN THE GODS SPREAD CHEECKS TO PUT COCK IN FUCKING ARSE!
Tokyo Trial,"Huge fan of the first two series, less of the third and fourth ones.

I think what I like most about these is that the emotions just feel so raw.  The passion.  The hatred.  The naked ambition.  Combined with the visceral visuals the shows packs quite a wallop, and is way, way more effective and entertaining than it has any right to be.

To me the biggest revelation was how effectively vicious John Hannah could be."
Tokyo Trial,Definitely one of my favorite shows. Andy and Liam both do an equally amazing job and the supporting cast is also awesome. It’s a yearly watch for me.
Tokyo Trial,"ASHER, FUCKING VICTOR!!"
Tokyo Trial,And what of good Solonius?
Tokyo Trial,Binge watched Spartacus this year for the first time and I love it.. great show.
Tokyo Trial,I remember being very iffy on the pilot (the violence was super cartoony). So glad I stuck it out - incredible show.
Tokyo Trial,"> Spartacus: War of the Damned is the most beautiful season of the series. From the new costumes, to the well choreographed battle scenes, to the color grading and slight tweaks to its visual style, favoring more slow-motion shots and glare... it is the peak of Spartacus'

Lost me here. Third and fourth season were painful to watch compared to the first two. The battles in particular were just random slow motion bullshit which never lived up to the more visceral gladiator duels from the first two seasons."
Tokyo Trial,"The best

Hoping Starz makes another show like Spartacus"
Tokyo Trial,JUPITER'S COCK! What a fun show. RIP Andy.
Tokyo Trial,"Dayum I only just finished my re-watch a month or so ago, so would have loved to take part in this discussion. But may as well throw my thoughts into there.

*Spartacus: Blood & Sand* on paper seems like it should be a relic from the early 2010s trend of 'rudie nudie' TV like *Vikings, Camelot, Game of Thrones* etc. Having never watched *Vikings* but the latter two, I can say that *Spartacus* has aged infinitely better than them. Especially in terms of female, race and queer representation.

I mean, *GOT*'s most prominent non-white characters were Khal Drogo (leader of a barbaric warrior race who starts out regularly raping a delicate white female and then dies anticlimactically), Missandei (token Black friend to a white female mistress, and has no role in the plot outside of being nice and translating, later getting disposed of to motivate Dany and Grey Worm), Grey Worm himself (not a bad rep but by the end of the series is happily slaughtering innocents) and Talisa Maegyr (also not as bad but killed off when her white book counterpart lived). *Spartacus* had actual characters and not just tokens. And on my re-watch, I really was struck by the characterization of Naevia.

It's extremely rare for the most prominent non-white woman in the cast to be portrayed as this complete innocent, defined by her kindness and empathy towards others. We've all seen the Token Black Friend trope - where the character is super smart, gifted at everything, supportive and rarely there to serve her own story. And while there's nothing 'wrong' with a positive Black character, it has a result that Black girls are often seen as less innocent because they're perceived as being older and smarter than they are (check out a video essay ""The Day Rue Became Black"", highlighting how some *Hunger Games* fans assumed Rue was a white girl because the personification of childhood innocence was rarely never white). 

Naevia meanwhile is that Silk Hiding Steel character - like a Desdemona or Juliet whose rebellion comes out in ways beyond physical aggression. The way Naevia realises she doesn't care what she takes from Lucretia anymore and taunts her with *""Crixus never loved you. He did only as commanded""* and then tells Oenomaus about Barca's death is how that character's strength is defined. And when Lucretia is torturing her, the scene keeps cutting back to Mira making a shocked face; highlighting that seeing *this* person being attacked is one of the worst things she's ever witnessed. And a white woman taking revenge on a brown girl for being more desirable than her? The fact that torturing Naevia is seen as the moment Lucretia really crosses the line is very powerful. And the plot being driven by the need to rescue her - Kerry Washington took a generic damsel in distress role for *Django Unchained* and said it was because films were rarely about the need to save a Black woman's life.

Sadly they completely fucked that character over. The recasting was a problem too, and it didn't need to happen. Lesley Ann Brandt had joined the first season for a seven-episode arc that got expanded when they liked her performance. She was a 'local hire' at that point, meaning she wasn't paid very much. In between *Gods of the Arena* and *Vengeance*, she moved to America now that she had her ticket out of the small New Zealand industry. Once in LA, she discovered she was getting paid more for a single guest spot on *NCIS* than *Spartacus* was offering. As Naevia was now a regular who'd be appearing in multiple seasons, she negotiated for a SAG contract, which would mean more pay. Unfortunately a manager botched the deal, and she fired him shortly after. 

The new actress had her work cut out for her, because Lesley Ann Brandt got how that character was supposed to work. But the writing dropped the ball with Naevia too. Naevia was not a rebel fighter. If she had to get physical, it would only be if she absolutely had to; like maybe becoming an archer at best. She was not bloodthirsty or out for revenge. She's someone who took care of birds she didn't need to in order to honour a poor boy who killed himself believing his lover deserted him (when she knew the truth and couldn't give him that relief). She's someone who went out of her way to help her traumatized friend escape the ludus to stop her from killing herself. And when she's about to be separated from Crixus, she tries to reassure him and get justice for Barca's murder. *Vengeance* decided to go with the whole 'mad trauma survivor' storyline and it just didn't work with the previously established character. It's basically like how they fucked Sansa over in *Game of Thrones*, where her compassion is framed as childish naivety she has to outgrow, and thus feeding Ramsay to his own dogs or trash talking Daenerys is seen as 'empowering'.

Illithyia's character got done dirty too. I'm not sure what was up with *Vengeance* trying to twist things around so that Lucretia becomes the more sympathetic of the two. Lucretia was always worse than Illithyia; she poisoned her father-in-law for revenge. She spent six years raping one of her slaves. She tricked a woman into sleeping with a man she hates solely out of jealousy. She approved of the murders of innocent civilians and children if it served their agenda. And everything she does in the final two episodes of *Blood & Sand* were in service of showing how awful a person she was, climaxing in the comeuppance where Crixus stabs her in the womb to kill her and their child by rape. Now here comes another between seasons problem.

With Andy Whitfield's passing meaning they'd be getting a new Spartacus, and Cynthia Addai-Robinson taking over as Naevia, the show runners were already worried that the transition would be alienating enough with the storylines veering out of the familiar setting of the ludus. So hoping to keep as many familiar faces around as possible to help with the change, and Lucy Lawless loving the character so much and being so fun to work with, they retcon Lucretia's death and keep her in the game. I'm sure the intent was to build on the twisted frenemy thing between her and Illithyia...but the problem is how keeping Lucretia in the story affected her arc.

Illithyia was a villain yes, but a stupid one. She did nastier things yes - trying to get Segovax to kill Spartacus, convincing Numerius to have Varro killed - but the narrative also framed Illithyia as another victim of Quintus and Lucretia. Illithyia's flaw was not that she was malicious, but ignorant and impulsive. She was horrified that she beat Licinia to death and had nightmares over it, and she gets hit by her husband and humiliated repeatedly by Lucretia. The direction of the season put her not necessarily on Spartacus's side but sympathetic to his motives. It's significant that she has the doors locked when the slaves rebel rather than be killed in the massacre herself.

The *Vengeance* season even highlights things like her being forced to crucify an innocent slave by her husband, and she's revealed to be pregnant with Spartacus's baby. She's even stunned when Spartacus spares her life and reveals that Glaber does not love her. Add that to how karma keeps coming down on her, and showing how she is in a prison of her own, and you have an arc that's setting her up to properly turn on the Romans. Maybe not joining the rebellion but being sympathetic to the rebels. Her and Spartacus wouldn't have become friends or lovers, but maybe she'd get a sacrifice where she helps them at her own personal risk or does something selfless in the hopes of saving her child. The twist of her killing Seppia was just bad writing, and the kind of unexpected swerve that GOT would be criticised for overusing. Her death scene was so poorly done I didn't even realise she was supposed to be dead until she didn't appear in the *War of the Damned* premiere.

Despite all my issues with the *Vengeance* season (Mira and Aurelia were killed off far too soon just for shock value as well), I think *Spartacus* should be recognised as an important series. People talk about its violence, nudity and stylism as though it's a guilty pleasure or 'so bad it's good'. But it's one of those shows that managed to have both style and substance. I even did a video detailing how good it actually was in its first season, and why it should be talked about more."
Tokyo Trial,"Nice post(s). Have you watched Twin Peaks? Also, you gave season 1 of Misfits a 7.8!? The last episode and ending, tho. It is one of the most well-rounded seasons of a tv show, IMO. I do agree that S2E2 is probably the best of the series tho."
Tokyo Trial,They didnt have flat tops in ancient Rome!!
Tokyo Trial,What about that episode where Spartacus had a Piper Cub?
Tokyo Trial,Got the Blu-rays primed for a rewatch. Does anyone know if there's a 4k version? I've seen it mentioned there is on some streaming but is that just upscaled?
Tokyo Trial,My #1 favorite show.
Tokyo Trial,My fav tv show ever
Tokyo Trial,The best I ever watched. They need to shoot more seasons.
Tokyo Trial,also my fav show ever with some of the best action and dialogue I've ever seen.
Tokyo Trial,I just watched Gods of the Arena. Should blood and sand be next chronologically? And then vengeance and War of the dammed last?
Tokyo Trial,"This show will forever have a special place in my heart. It helped me desensitize myself to blood and violence. At least I was suicidal at the time.

Honestly, I am getting triggered just thinking about this but I know I’m heaps better than I was before watching it."
Tokyo Trial,"I only watched season 1 as a kid

I didn't want to watch the rest because I got used to the Spartacus actor

Noe that you reminded me of it, I'm thinking of finally watching the whole show"
Tokyo Trial,First season was awesome.  Prequel was ok.  I didn't like the sequel season.  Shame the Spartacus guy died of cancer.  He was the reason the first season was so good.
Tokyo Trial,"The dialogue in this show is ""Deadwood for people with debilitating brain injuries."""
Tokyo Trial,For me it's person of interest watched it like 7 times now.
Tokyo Trial,"You would side with Spartacus?
No, I stand the man himself!

Classic, I love this show"
Tokyo Trial,"Does the death of the main actor affected the quality of the series? I wanted to get back on this years ago but when i learned that Whitefield died and he was replaced by his brother iirc I've loss interest. Maybe my mind just can't accept no one can replace Andy coz s1 is so epic.
If it is epic as fuck as it used to be ill binge watch it rn."
Tokyo Trial,"I feel you man, i was legit sad for atleast a week when Andy Whitfield passed away..."
Tokyo Trial,"I remember watching this show for the first time as a 16 year old, and it was the coolest show ever made in my mind. Still love Spartacus. The news of Andy's passing was truly really sad at the time, and still is.

This is the type of show you just have to take at face value. Either you enjoy it or you don't. The dialogue is still just as stupid but funny. But the show has great tempo, although repetitive as the seasons go by."
Tokyo Trial,"I would not call it the best, but I fucking loved it, and the it's pretty much perfect for the story it told without needing to pretend to be more than that."
Tokyo Trial,Such an attractive main cast
Tokyo Trial,Again the Gods spread cheeks and ram cock in ass...and I rejoice. I shall lay eyes upon this tale once more. Jupiter's cock!
Tokyo Trial,"I really liked the show, but if you've seen one fighting sequence you've mostly see them all. So it got to the point where I would just FF past them."
Colony,"I'm confused, was he attacked for not being anti-colonization enough or too much?"
Colony,"The anti colonial messaging in White Lotus was one of the layers that really elevated the show, imo. Otherwise it was entertaining, but fairly superficial. Tho I can imagine how it would be all too confronting to the average Tourists that treat Hawaii like nothing more than a slightly exotic  luxurious getaway destination."
Colony,"> Mike White — the writer, director and creator of HBO’s Emmy-nominated “The White Lotus” — is acutely aware that some felt his breakout dramedy about the corrosive effects of privilege and wealth perpetuated the very issues he meant to lampoon. While the creator defends his vision for the first season, he’s also hoping that the highly anticipated follow-up will help broaden the anthology series’ worldview.


> Season 2 reroutes the drama from Hawaii to Sicily as a cast of characters both new and familiar find new ways to display the worst of the 1%. But rather than focus on issues of colonialism and socioeconomic cultural gaps as he did the first time around, this new season delves more into relational dynamics and gender roles. By the sound of it, it’s something of a strategic pivot.


> “Some of the criticism of the first season, I was like, ‘I get what you’re saying, but I’m not that,'” White told Vulture in a recent interview. “I’ve written a whole body of work. I stand by that season of ‘The White Lotus,’ but it’s not the full reflection of my interests.”

> White reveals that Season 2 is partly inspired by a 12th century legend in which a young Italian woman is seduced by a Moorish man, but grows so jealous when she discovers he’s already married that she beheads him. The legend’s intersection of envy, love, lust and violence proved to be fertile creative ground, particularly following some of the stinging reactions to Season 1.


> “I didn’t know that I had the gumption to wade into those waters again, knowing I was going to get sniper fire from every direction,” he said. “Maybe the classic sexual politics, the naughty subversive stuff we’re getting into, will take the edge off a little bit from that.”"
Colony,"> Mike White — the writer, director and creator of HBO’s Emmy-nominated “The White Lotus” — is acutely aware that some felt his breakout dramedy about the corrosive effects of privilege and wealth perpetuated the very issues he meant to lampoon.

When it comes to the sentiments of this show, I for one was so fuckin' confused. He brought awareness to these issues... but I swear at some points the writing tries to... *justify* them in... weird way? 😕 

Or maybe he was attempting to be neutral? Idk. I think him staying away from politics for the next season is for the better."
Colony,"okay but it's still little bit weird for me to see the white lotus dominated the emmy limited/anthology categories, like it's not really a limited series and it's also not really an anthology series, it's more like a drama(dy) show for me"
Colony,"I trust him, show was thoroughly enjoyable. Looking forward to season 2."
Colony,">White, who does not use a writers’ room and is in complete control of nearly every facet of the show

It being a single person writing it makes a lot of the inconsistencies in quality and rough edges make sense. If he wanted less criticism he could work with other people to have a less criticizable product."
Colony,"I'm currently watching S1, and after episode 3, I thought ""It's great that it's so female-centered and female-driven"", but then I counted, and: of 10 main characters, 6 are female. so I guess when some demographic in an ensemble cast is slightly bigger than usual or expected, it already REALLY stands out.

but with that in mind: of course, a show that only has Paula and Belinda as POC characters in the main cast will stand out as a very, very white show, too. I pick up the anti-colonialist vibes in the show - but I think for these messages to really register, they'd need more POC characters, more discourse, more scenes that center that etc., yes."
Colony,yes
Colony,"Damn, kinda wish I didn't read that. I know it's the premise of the season but I would have rather gone into that blind. That said, sounds super interesting."
Colony," 

On the surface it looks like he was trying to bothsides it but mike white ultimately seemed more interested in mocking liberal concern for the underprivileged as futile and hypocritical.


The dad character in one of those dinner scenes seems to represent his actual views. Like he'll concede that he has privilege and it was gotten through injustice, but he'll never give up any of it."
Colony,I think it’s an anthology in the same sense that American Horror Story is where each season will tell a whole new set of stories with mostly different characters
Colony,That’s one side of argument. But one could also argue White Lotus is better than most series so maybe his way is working
Colony,"this show is about 1%, ofc the majority of the cast will be white. it's almost like saying why there are not many non-white people in Succession"
Colony,Paula and Belinda being the only POC in the main cast is justified. Paula is only a friend of the rich daughter and she’s implied to not come from as privileged a background as them. The first season is about white privilege and the after-effects of colonialism. The white characters are supposed to represent how they benefit from such a system that still puts down POCs today. Belinda told Tanya that much of her clients are rich white ladies. We have an indigenous Hawaiian talk about the resort being built on his ancestral land and having to work there to support himself.
Colony,"i think what mike white was doing was writing real characters. these people, like the dad, actually exist. sometimes this seems to flummox people these days... they can't understand it when the writing doesn't ""point"" to something or try to change the world around us. it was really well done imo."
Colony,">The dad character in one of those dinner scenes seems to represent his actual views. Like he'll concede that he has privilege and it was gotten through injustice, but he'll never give up any of it.

I think the dad's speech in that scene is the most reasonable perspective that any of the wealthy characters on the show have to offer, but it still comes across to the audience as self-serving and weaselly. And I think that's deliberate.

IMO the two most interesting characters if you were to try to analyze what Mike White's ""point"" is are the dad, who has self-awareness but in a way that provides no actual tangible benefit for anybody, and the daughter's friend, who views herself as morally superior because she has a less privileged background but is ultimately exactly as exploitative as everyone else."
Colony,"there are so many ""upstairs, downstairs"" type shows that feature a very wealthy and posh environment - and have a cast where half the characters are rich and half the characters are part of the staff. I'm not saying that ""The White Lotus"" would have been better if there were 5 prominent hotel employees instead of 2, but if Lani (the pregnant character) hadn't given birth in ep 1, I think she could have provided an important perspective as a main character throughout the rest of the season."
Colony,"yes, I understand and agree. I'm trying to give another example: it is very much a show ""about rich people"", but the majority of the 10 main characters has experienced being non-rich and maybe even feels non-rich right now. so: the wealth is front and center, but I think the majority of the characters is aware of wealth gaps and privilege, and it often shows: almost every scene has a character being clearly uncomfortable about wealth disparity. I don't think ""almost every scene has a character being clearly uncomfortable about colonialism"" to the same degree. (I like the show. this is not: me being annoyed with the show. I'm just saying: to me, colonialism doesn't feel front and centre on this show, and I think the makeup of the cast is the reason.)"
Colony,"That is a trend that's starting to irritate me, you can't just depict a person who isn't what we currently consider a moral paragon without spending time decrying absolutely everything they do and say. It's like everything needs to be written for stupid people on twitter who can't handle not having their own thoughts parroted back at them for five minutes."
Colony,"It kinda showed the complexity of viewpoints on the situation and the barriers that remain for actual change.  Like with the dad, you have someone who acknowledges the truth of his socio-economic situation but is still someone who will defend where he's at and look out for himself and his family.  And frankly that's a much more believable character.  Even discussion of the show pointed out an interesting divide, especially where it came to Paula's actions."
Colony,funny you mentioning this bc i totally thought that Lani was going to play a bigger role in the show
Colony,"I think the show focuses on post-colonialism since watching the local Hawaiians have to serve white guests resonated with me as a Filipino. My country was an American colony, is a popular tropical destination, and has a wide class disparity. Hawaii was also annexed by the US and the natives’ land were stolen from them. Now they have to serve (predominantly white) tourists from the mainland in resorts built on stolen land and elements of their rich culture are reduced to mere dinner entertainment for the guests.

Also, White Lotus Philippines sounds like an awesome idea for a future season. Please do it, HBO!"

Nobel,"Have a feeling many legacy entertainment companies that started streaming services will shut down soon, and then content will be distributed like they were previously."
Nobel,they do have a streaming platform....but its for anime ;)
Nobel,"Sony produces top-notch TV shows but poor movies.

When they

Better Call Saul, The Last of Us, The Crown, Cobra Kai, The Boys, Outlander, Preacher,

and a lot more I omitted"
Nobel,Didn't they own Crackle?
Nobel,MORBIN amounts of money
Nobel,"Sony used to have 3, arguably 4 separate streaming video platforms.  It's really, really weird they went from that to 0 almost immediately, without stopping to think in between ""maybe just not so many"".  Especially since really none of them were the same style most other players are making."
Nobel,I am very glad Sony has no interest in forming a streaming service - there are more than enough already.
Nobel,"At least Sony can admit they have no streaming service.

Their playstation game trailer system backs up that assertion. It’s terrible."
Nobel,Sony did well by choosing not to launch their own streaming service. Now if only they could create quality movies...
Nobel,"It’s smart for the company but can either confuse the customer looking for content or associate the content with the streamer.

Last of Us is an HBO product more than a Sony one for people who haven’t played the game.

Wednesday benefits Netflix more than it does Amazon brand wise.

There’s plus and minuses to all things and most studios do some form of selling to the highest bidder unless it impacts their brand more."
Nobel,"Technically they do have a streaming platform though with Bravia Core. It's only available to people who own a recent Bravia TV though, and it's actually amazing. You can stream movies at ~80 Mbps, which is 4x higher than Netflix/HBO Max/Disney+ and other mainstream streaming platforms. The quality is incredible and it puts all the major streaming services to shame."
Nobel,Someone please give this man the Nobel Peace Prize
Nobel,Sony has a streaming platform though.
Nobel,"Tbh if Disney kills their streaming business, they would be stupid. It's tracking to be profitable in a few years. Their only issue is Hulu."
Nobel,The ideal will always be the music streaming model but that's never going to happen. A couple of the struggling smaller streamers might be gobbled up by the bigger ones but we'll always be stuck with like half a dozen of these.
Nobel,a peculiar game. The only successful move is to refuse to play.
Nobel,And that's bad because them ploughing huge sums into making shows is great for the viewer.
Nobel,"this will happen within 3 years, guaranteed. netflix remains undefeated"
Nobel,"Sony’s movies are a gamble, they make great ones like once upon a Time in Hollywood, Little women, spider verse, goods ones like Jumanji, bullet train, bad ones like Charlie’s Angels, Morbius."
Nobel,"They also own a lot of classic TV content, thanks to them owning Columbia/Screen Gems, Tri-Star, plus nearly all of the shows from Norman Lear's old companies.  Out of all of major studios, they've maximized the rerun value of their shows across the different classic channels, plus the output deal with Starz for years."
Nobel,Spider-Verse is probably their only good movie recently
Nobel,They sold it a few years ago.
Nobel,Let's not forget Crunchyroll.
Nobel,They do have a streaming service though - Crunchyroll.
Nobel,"I feel like Sony realized that they shouldn't run a streaming market, after the whole PSN digital TV/Movie marketplace debaticle from when they tried to compete with Itunes and amazon instant streaming."
Nobel,It's more about Paramount and Peacock and probably Hbo now.
Nobel,"The music streaming model is that every provider has practically every song though, you pick based on something unrelated to music like if you like the Spotify exclusive podcasts or want ad-free YouTube or whatever.

The video services seem to always differentiated on content exclusivity alone."
Nobel,"You need to look back on their movies, spider verse is great, and so is Little women, once upon a Time in Hollywood , baby driver, Jumanji, beautiful day in the neighborhood."
Nobel,You misspelled Morbius.
Nobel,"You're right, for some reason I thought they sold that off to Funimation, rather than fold Funimation into their service (mergers are fun).  But they went from having all this:

1.  Playstation Vue.  Streaming OTA.
2.  Playstation Video.  Ala carte video streaming rental and purchase
3.  Crackle.  Ad-supported OTT.
4.  Crunchyroll.  Niche OTT tied to simulcasting OTA content.

To just Crunchyroll.  They didn't really try to turn *any* of those into an HBOMax/Paramount+/Peacock/etc, which is just baffling; instead they just half-assed 3 separate services.  The closest thing to an attempt at it was probably when they did Powers on Playstation Video, or *maybe* Snatch on Crackle, but they never really did a coordinated multi-show push on any of their services, which is baffling."
Nobel,"They mean a general content streaming service, not for a specific niche like anime."
Nobel,"Sony cut down almost all their online services after being targeted by North Korea for 'The Interview'

https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/10/the-untold-story-of-the-sony-hack"
Nobel,"In Europe, Paramout and Peacock (plus Sky) are already offering a joint service. Content is embarrassingly poor at the moment (I assume they sold the rights to a lot of their more sought-after productions beforehand) but it's likely the way of the future.

Small services will either combine, become add-ons for bigger streamers, or go back to just being production companies."
Nobel,HBO Max is actually the closest to profitability out of all the other major studios services.
Nobel,I really wish HBO was stand alone without the other items like it was previously.
Nobel,"That's because labels basically treat streaming as an advertising platform. Music streaming makes fuck all money for labels and bands, the reason labels eventually agreed to go on streaming services despite it being nowhere near as profitable as selling records is because labels made new bands sign deals saying that they get a cut of everything (including merch and gig tickets), previously labels would just take a cut of record sales and the bands got the rest. Since labels get a cut of everything getting as many people as possible listening is in their interests, so they're happy to put their music on any service that will take them. 

The same can't really be done with TV, there are exceptions but most TV shows don't sell much merch and it won't go on tour, so money needs to be made from the show itself, hence they charge extremely high fees to streaming services which means services need to pick and choose who they pay money to."
Nobel,"I mean, there was that time with Tidal in attempting to have music streaming exclusively there such as Beyonce, Jay Z and more but it didnt really work and eventually those got released on other services."
Nobel,"I meant ""the ideal"" not ""the idea"" so perhaps that led to some confusion, but that's exactly what I think it should be. For the best consumer experience, services should be competing on features and the platform itself, not content."
Nobel,"Just a little bit of correction, they owned Funimation and acquired Crunchyroll from WB. 

Also, they do own a general entertainment and sports streaming service in India and it's called Sony LIV. They carry a lot of programming from their Indian channels. They also have some sports streaming rights. Besides that, they get streaming rights to all the Sony stuff that no one else wants. So shows like Future Man, The Good Doctor, Crossing Swords, Woke and some older Paramount movies as well for some reason. 

Besides that, I agree with your sentiment but I also agree with their POV. Streaming is somewhat an expense business to be in rn."
Nobel,thats way underselling what crunchyroll has done. it has fully cornered the western market for anime.
Nobel,Yeah Zazlav getting that streaming service close to actually making money and Paramount not that far behind either but Disney+ still taking huge loses but if they cut 3billion is content spending that should help lessen the loses
Nobel,"This is not true.  There was accounting juggling, as they sold and removed various contents, and practically produced nothing in the last quarter.  Several experts have already spoken of this.

The loss per share was 4 times worse than predicted. One must be very careful in analyzing Zaz's speeches."
Nobel,AT&T was cooking their books to make the division look better than it actually was.
Nobel,HBO Max is offered as an add-on to a lot of other streaming services like Amazon and Hulu. Im sure they get a lot of subscribers that way.
Nobel,Shows and movies cost so much more than albums to be sold that cheaply tho.
Nobel,"How much has Disney made back on Merchandise sales? A lotta Baby Yoda stuff sold, and I'm assuming the they a cut of the quarter aisle of Bluey toys I saw at Target."
Nobel,It is true though. They only lost $217M on their DTC service. All you did was explain why it's true.
Nobel,"Yeah fair point, and people who make shows/movies are much better compensated. People would have to be willing to pay a significantly higher price point. But consider that the top 5 streaming services can set you back, what, $40-50 these days anyway?"
Nobel,disney stock p/e ratio is 54 with a market cap of 180 billion. netflix p/e is 33 with a market cap of 137 billion. with just a streaming service netflix is a better company than disney
Nobel,We're talking about Cable here... Which not ideal.
Nobel,Netflix is far from a better company.
Nobel,"Cable is way more expensive, requires special equipment and onerous contracts, is riddled with ads, etc. That's not what I'm talking about at all. Something in between cable and the current system where every streamer is also a production studio would be a lot better."
Nobel,Everything's coming up Holmström!
Nobel,Worth pointing out that B.L Feringa won the 2016 prize for Chemistry (along with Stoddart and Sauvage).  Way to go database!
Nobel,">Milhouse had Economics winner Bengt Holmström in a Nobel Prize betting pool with Lisa and Martin Prince.

For those that look at the article and are confused by the picture, look at the name to the *right* of the red circled name."
Nobel,The real story here is the fact that the Simpsons writers were allowed to show Database in an episode as recent as 2010. I thought Groening never wanted that kid on the show again.
Nobel,Simpsons did it again.
Nobel,"Never saw this episode, but I find it strange that Milhouse would be involved with the smart nerds. He's a nerd, but he's not suppose to be particularly intelligent. He's a loser, like his father Kirk.

Can I borrow a feeling?"
Nobel,"It's hardly impressive to come up with a list of likely candidates and have one of them hit. They had 20 names on the list, odds were pretty decent that one of those would hit eventually.

Whats more impressive to me is that they went to the lengths to create a feasible list at all. Especially with a comedy show where the average person wouldn't know these names anyways. They could have easily put names like Donald Trump on there for comedic effect."
Nobel,"Wait, why is the 2009 Economics Nobel prize winner (Oliver Williamson) Martin's pick for the Physics Nobel prize?

They also mispelled Lene Hau's name.

And why is the article not mentioning that Milhouse actually guessed the 2014 Chemistry Nobel Prize (W.E. Moerner) correctly as well?

Or that Database correctly predicted 2016 Chemistry Nobel Prize winner (Ben Feringa)?


Honestly, Nobel Prizes for Chemistry, Physics, Medicine and Economics are not all that difficult to predict for people in the field – or at least it's not difficult to name a person and have a greater than 1 in 5 chance for that person to win a Nobel Prize. For example, calling it right now Jennifer Doudna, George Church, Bruce Ames and Dennis Slamon. I'd be willing to bet a hefty sum that at least one of these 4 will win a Nobel Prize for either Chemistry or Medicine in the next 5 to 10 years."
Nobel,I'm guessing Lisa picked Steve Harris for physics because his 2 finger gallop technique once thought to be impossible?
Nobel,"""Update: An earlier version misstated that Database was a computer not a character."""
Nobel,"They were kindda close to predicting this year's Peace Nobel Prize as well: Two of the nominees shown in the last row of the picture - Ingrid Betancourt and Piedad Cordoba - are both Colombian and are both, for different reasons, very closely related to the Colombian peace process for which Santos won it a few days ago. "

Nobel,Educated guess = predicted 
Nobel,Someone listens to NPR on the way to work.

Next time you're in a room with 60 people in it, I ""predict"" there will be two with the same birthday."
Nobel,"I swear the
Simpsons creator is a time traveler."
Nobel,"2016, a year so strange that Millhouse was finally a meme."
Nobel,Didn't they say Trump would he president?
Nobel,Simpsons has had so many episodes the chances are that they have predicted a lot of stuff
Nobel,"So they picked 4 people, got the wrong answer for 6 years and then got lucky ?"
Nobel,"Wow put up four of the world's leading economists and one wins , amazing "
Nobel,Heard it on NPR this morning. They even played the Simpsons clip 
Nobel,So the Simpsons already did it?
Nobel,Guy at MIT probably has the Simpsons screen shot printed out and references it every time there's the yearly announcement. Just waiting for one of the characters to be right. Which is a very Martin thing to do.

Nobel,I still say Professor Farnsworth got robbed.
Nobel,What episode is it? 
Nobel,But milhouse got Vera Rubin's name wrong
Nobel,"Why is this not included?! 
They had it right twice. Look at the picture, Database predicts that the Dutch B.L Feringa would win this years Nobelprice for the Chemistry and he did. "
Nobel,"Lisa: It's time for the noblest Noble Prize of them all, the Peace Prize!

Homer: I would *kill* for that.."
Nobel,TIL Matt Groening developed micro-scaled psychohistory and applied it to our world through the Simpsons.
Nobel,Does this mean Milhouse is finally a meme?
Nobel,"I see what you're doing here, Milhouse, but you still can't be a meme."
Nobel,"So, once again, ""Simpsons did it"". 

Fair play."
Nobel,He was due.
Nobel,"seriously,  is someone over there some sort of mystic psychic?!  "
Nobel,"The creators of the simpsons implement possible predictions like this in their shows, if it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen, if it does happen, it's all over the news. "
Nobel,"I'm beginning to believe there's a conspiracy surrounding all these Simpson predictions, like there is a group out there fucking with all of us just following and making ways for old Simpson material to come true in the real world. "
Nobel,I'm beginning to think that the tv director has a time machine

Nobel,"Who's to say the comittee didn't simply get the screen grab from that episode, put the 4 names in a hat and draw one ? :)

Self fulfilling prophecy right there."
Meridian,HBO has a western series: Deadwood.
Meridian,"The problem with a Red Dead adaptation is that the plots are just pastiches of like, every big western movie ever. They'd really have to steer into an over-the-topness to avoid just seeming like an endless string of cliches, but that isn't really the game's vibe."
Meridian,"Not sure how Red Dead's story, while awesome (one of my faves) would prove upon all the amazing western movies that already exist.

I think they should create a show based on Bully."
Meridian,Then there would be a red dead show on HBO
Meridian,I’d rather have Blood Meridian
Meridian,That's what Westworld season 1 felt like to me
Meridian,Are people at Rockstar up for an adaptation? I've read that they denied multiple chances at turning GTA into a show or movie. Maybe it's the same for RDR.
Meridian,"I don't really care about where shows come from, I just want shows I enjoy.

If they made this and it's good then sure, more western shows would be cool."
Meridian,i want more stuff like arcane personally. something new. i don't have much interest in only these cinematic games also being shows/movies.
Meridian,Sooo all those dumb yellstone shows?
Meridian,An original story set in the rdr world? Sure. A 1:1 adaptation of the games? Fuck off.
Meridian,It would literally be a western though with mean-humor?  TLOU has supernatural horror edge though.
Meridian,Or maybe just maybe watch some of the old western movies? Most of the stuff from the game is basically references from popular westerns of the past. Try some of the gritty Spaghetti western or if you want some comedy the Trinity trilogy with Bud Spencer and Terence Hill.
Meridian,Doable. They'd just need to change the story a bit. Take out the big western cinematic set pieces and bring in some original ideas. Red Dead is better as a game though.
Meridian,"The film and television industry loves to follow trends. If The Last of Us remains a hit, there will be more video game adaptations. Not sure if a western is the best genre, though."
Meridian,It would have zombies.
Meridian,Red dead 2 has a pretty clunky story that has to twist established lore to fit. Although that probably wouldn't matter in an adaptation.
Meridian,"It could certainly make a good show if it was done well. However the Red Dead Redemption games would be *much* harder to adapt than The Last of Us. The story is much longer and more meandering than TLoU, which is pretty tight as games go, both thematically and narratively."
Meridian,"Red Dead was already made over 50 years ago before.

Essentially Clint Eastwood cowboy movies are the ""go to"". Not to mention Italian western and Japanese westerns.

And if you seen Hell On Wheels... yes that's basically Red Dead."
Meridian,It's called Deadwood
Meridian,We dug coal together
Meridian,"People have often made a similar statement how awesome a Sleeping Dogs movie would have been, but in reality, no, it wouldn't. The game is likewise a pastiche of major HK triad movies and themes, it would be extremely derivative. They're clever and fresh when you're not aware of them, but if you've watched a lot of movies from a given genre of film, not so much."
Meridian,"Yeah, as much as I loved *playing* the games, I don't think they'd make very good TV, as is. Nothing much original in the narrative or characters.

I see people suggest a GTA show too, and for the same reasons, no thanks."
Meridian,"I agree with you but still feel with a great cast, score and action pieces that would be enough to carry the show even if the story is simple and done before.

There are plenty of emotional scenes where the actors can showcase their talent. As well as many cool action set pieces that in an ideal world would be amazing to see live.

Agree it might not be the best adaptation material but I would be first in line to watch it not gonna lie."
Meridian,"It’s not about a red dead show being a badass western, it’s about telling the story, which is absolutely brilliant.

The last of us isn’t just your ordinary zombie movie, it’s a story. Red dead isn’t your ordinary Wild West shootin game, it’s a freakin story about a cowboy who has grown to regret the life he lived."
Meridian,"I guess the only adaptation they've ever done is Max Payne with Mark Wahlberg. And since nobody here really remembers it, makes sense why they haven't done anymore adaptations."
Meridian,"This is it. The Last of Us the game for me was an interactive movie. So the idea of it being televised wasn't something I was super hype about. But I stand corrected with how good the first episode was. 

But do what they did with Arcane. Take the characters from the game and give them stories, flesh them out, make us understand how they came to be in the place they are in the game. Arcane stands as the best video game adaptation of all time, but it's not really a adaptation, it has just taken the world and characters and made it it's own thing. Which is what I wish for every other adaptation to do."
Meridian,"Wrong show, what you're referring to is Justified. Another show starring Timothy Olyphant."
Meridian,[deleted]
Meridian,"I hear you.

But TLOU is basically zombie movies and TWD shows. 

I mean... let's  not kid ourselves."
Meridian,like if they did a bioshock adaptation i wouldn't really want it to be about jack but rather rapture in general.
Meridian,"I know, I just like Timothy Olyphant."
Meridian,Always know if the juice is worth the squeeze.
Meridian,"Not to tell that RDR actually does some unique stuff in the Western genre. Cowboys and outlaws in snowy mountains, tropical Caribbean islands, Southern swamps and big cities or using cars isn't a common sight in Western AFAIK. RDRII's story barely even take place in the actual deserts of the West"
Meridian,"You're not wrong.

I mean, on the most surface level, it's *exactly* that genre. But that would be like saying Game of Thrones is just a show about dragons and swords. Shows and video games surrounding those genres are definitely not new.

What made the game, and hopefully this series, different is the approach, not the setting.

It's a story about relationships and choices, ones where moral black and white doesn't exist. Where your perspective can make you the good or bad guy. Where the choices a person makes doesn't easily define them as such, where you are forced to see things from different perspectives. (esp TLoU2)

Most TV forcefeeds you this on a spoon. These are the bad guys! They do bad things! These are the good guys! Everything they do is right! While TLoU makes it obvious that things are not so cut and dry. I really hope the show captures that aspect of the games."
Meridian,Fuck yeah. Jack is not the only one in Rapture. Focus on the other aspects and characters. Make the actual lore and world the character.
Meridian,"My takeaway from ""The Boys"" has taught me that the best things to adapt are things that are maybe...not so great. Things that can be greatly improved upon in the adaptation.  

For instance the comics ""The Boys"" are...pretty gross. Not just the subject material but the characters and the plot. For instance, victims get mocked at best (sometimes by the ""heroes"") and blamed at worst, disabilities get mocked, Sexual Assault is treated as a joke many times...shock value...muddled messages in the writing...

But the show is amazing and as far as I'm concerned ""fixed"" a lot. That's where we need to focus adaptations. Things that aren't necessarily super popular/mainstream, things where the message or tone or theme can be re-envisioned. 

I wanna see things adapted that I either hate or currently don't know about and thus have no expectations around. They're taking a lot of liberties 're-working' or 're-imagining' a lot of beloved properties and it pisses a lot of people off."
Meridian,I long for an adaptation of Naoki Urasawa's manga Monster. There was whatever was the idea with Guillermo del Toro and HBO that seems to have gone nowhere.
Meridian,"I long for the day we get a high-budget, accurate to the books adaptation of the Dresden Files.

Doubt it'll ever happen though."
Meridian,I would love to see the comic book series Saga get an adaptation but only if they animated it.
Meridian,Harry Potter by the BBC/HBO
Meridian,"Novels:

* Peter F. Hamilton: The Night's Dawn Trilogy & The Commonwealth Saga.


* Alastair Reynolds: The Revelation Space book series.


* Gregory Benford: Galactic Center Saga.


* Vernor Vinge: Across Realtime series & Zones of Thought series.

* Matthew Pearl: The Dante Club


Comics:


The Department of Truth, Incal, Orbiter.

Franco-Belgian comics: Luc Orient, Blake & Mortimer, Bob Morane, Simon du Fleuve, Bruno Brazil, Vincent Larcher, Ric Hochet & Dan Cooper."
Meridian,I recently read the Laundry Files books by Charles Stross and thought they would make an interesting tv show.
Meridian,"I know that The Three Body Problem adaptation is happening at Netflix but I just really, really want it to be great.

I'd also like a great show about politics that charts the protagonist's rise from nothing to power. I always thought that the House of Cards started at the wrong point. The journey from total obscurity to political power would be much better. Along the way the show could explore political machines etc. Basically an adaptation of Robert Caro's The Power Broker or The Years of Lyndon Johnson but, of course, heavily altered so that it would work as a TV show."
Meridian,"World War Z would make a great limited series. Each chapter is basically a stand alone and it could be turned into a show like Love, death and robots."
Meridian,"Transmetropolitan. Could be fantastic, though it'd need some updating because some of its predictions have already come true."
Meridian,"Crossed would be fascinating to see adapted, but I imagine it would be totally watered down."
Meridian,"The Night Angel trilogy by Brent Weeks or  
The Red Rising series by Pierce Brown. 


And a close third would be the Drizzt series by R.A Salvatore"
Meridian,I think the world needs HBO to adapt the first law series.
Meridian,"Gone by Michael Grant. The author has been trying for *years* to get it made into a tv show and unfortunately,  I don't think it's gonna happen.

I think the reason it hasn't happened is because it focuses on kids and the series is a bit fucked up."
Meridian,Mass effect tv show
Meridian,Neuromancer miniseries done by HBO
Meridian,"I really want to see ""The Question"" Tv series. A noir driven anthology show exploring corruption and crime. Is that so hard to ask for?."
Meridian,"Robotech. I've wanted it for 20 years. A live action Robotech done with the full gory violence implied in the cartoons, plus sex. It would be awesome."
Meridian,Seems like Netflix abandoned their animated adaptation of Bone. I'd like to see one of those
Meridian,"Animorphs. Special effects in high budget TV have finally caught up, and ya adaptations aren't nearly as watered down as they used to be. (the less said about the 90s show the better. There's an episode where the yeerks send out an email blast.)"
Meridian,I would say the comic SAGA could definitely be a good show if adapted.
Meridian,"Powder Mage Series (in the works)

Anything by Brandon Sanderson... Mistborn, Stormlight, etc"
Meridian,"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, but no way in hell I'd trust a network to handle Alan Moore, so it's better they stay away from it"
Meridian,"Even though this isn’t really what you asked, I always thought The Martian would have worked better as a tv show. Assuming it got the budget it deserves. Condensing that story into a 2 hour thing just ruins the sense of time that Mark is on Mars. And with how it’s written, you could totally have each episode have some humor, some low moments, and some high moments. 

And I don’t even want this to happen anymore just because the movie already exists, and it’s excellent despite what I said before. But I just wish they had made it a limited series instead."
Meridian,It hurts me that I'll most likely never see a Starman or Sandman Mystery Theater adaptation on HBO.
Meridian,It sounds like Paper Girls is happening which makes me happy
Meridian,[deleted]
Meridian,I'd love to see HBO adapt GRRM's Fever Dream.
Meridian,I want to see a good adaptation of a story in the Dungeons & Dragons universe. Like adapt the Dark Elf trilogy or something like that.
Meridian,The poppy war trilogy
Meridian,"A series of books called Shattered Realms. Also, Santa Olivia, Blood of Eden, Baru Cormorant, there're so many books."
Meridian,"Once (if) the third book in the kingkiller series comes out, that would make an epic tv series. I'd say wait for the book though, just so the creators have a clear picture of the series going in."
Meridian,"I would love to see The Chrysalids turned into a series. Just focused on the first half of the book. That would be great if they made it real dark and focused on the purity religion and hunting down mutants and fighting off mutant mauraders from the south. The source material wouldn't last as long like a comic book series, but good enough for a strong team to get solidly off the ground and running."
Meridian,"Top 10, the Alan Moore comic about cops in a world where everyone has superpowers"
Meridian,Mass Effect. But only made by HBO
Meridian,Equilibrium as a concept needed a TV series. The silly fighting gun-fu would not need to follow.
Meridian,"I might upset a lot of fans here but I really hope I can see a faithful Witcher adaptation in my lifetime. To put this into perspective, s2 was 10% book content."
Meridian,Red Dead Redemption 2 has enough material for 5+ seasons
Meridian,"The Forbidden Game. Solid YA written by the same person who wrote The Vampire Diaries. Extremely 90s. Someone could really make a fun, but terrifying tv show with that source material."
Meridian,Wings of Fire. The Netflix adaptation apparently got cancelled. The book series is amazing.
Meridian,"The *Gor* books just to give the writers a challenge.  But seriously seeing how they've ruined *The Wheel of Time* and the up coming Tolkein series I just want them to keep their mitts off of books, old shows, movies, etc.  If your ""improving"" stories for a modern audience or injecting new story elements because you think you can do better than the original creator then 100% of the time you're ruining the original stories.  Just don't."
Meridian,"The Black Company books with its gritty, vietnam-like take on fantasy novels would be a hit show."
Meridian,"Harry Potter, movies really missed a lot of details from the books."
Meridian,"Themis files as a mini series

An episodic adaptation of the horizon video games. Doesn’t even need to follow the games main story, I just love that world so much!"
Meridian,"An animated series based on the I Hate Fairyland comic series. It's practically made for it to the point where I've been surprised that nobody has optioned it.

Also an animated Animorphs series, maybe with the animation done by Studio Mir."
Meridian,"Larry Niven - Ringworld

I've read that Akiva Goldsman is on board the current plan for this.

I know it's been attempted several times before but I have high hopes that it is going to work this time."
Meridian,Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy
Meridian,The Hyperion series
Meridian,"Joseph Michael Straczynski's Rising Stars. The 4400 kind of ripped it off but JMS's storytelling cannot be beaten.

&#x200B;

The Drenai series of David Gemmel is cinematic AF too"
Meridian,"I would love to see the Spider-man: Spider's Shadow storyline played out in a movie or 6 part miniseries.

Getting to see what Peter would be like if he gave in to his baser urges, and seeing the consequences of it makes for incredibly dramatic storytelling. Would also be the first time we got a darker spidey."
Meridian,"The Ice Cream Man (comics)

and not on Shudder or some shit with a low budget."
Meridian,"A TV adaptation of the Star Wars video game *Knights of the Old Republic* would be great, especially the sequel. People say they want a movie series on those but I think it'd only work as a TV miniseries, given how complex and sprawling the plot is and all the little side stories and lore there are."
Meridian,"A quality adaption of In the Heart of the Sea. It's a fantastic novel, based on the events that inspired Moby Dick. It dives deep into the human psyche. A limited series for HBO would be incredible."
Meridian,"I'd love to see an adaptation of the *Fables* comic with a sizable budget. *Once Upon a Time* notwithstanding, it's a great concept to bring to the screen."
Meridian,"After the success of Heartstopper, I hope Netflix or another service considers adapting Alice Oseman’s other works such as Radio Silence, Loveless, This Winter, Solitaire, Nick and Charlie, etc."
Meridian,"The Clockwork Century series by Cherie Priest, starting with Boneshaker

Underworld, start back at the beginning as a TV series would be incredible

I had hopes when Tobey Maguire was supposed to adapt the Penn Cage novels by Greg Iles.  Wonder why that never made it."
Meridian,"Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy and I say this knowing Hulu is supposed to be making this, but that was announced almost 3 years ago.   No script, no cast, no director, theres no news about this show and im starting to think the project is indeed dead."
Meridian,"There's a french comicbook called Dungeon (Donjon) by Joann Sfar and Lewis Trondheim which I would love to see an animated series of, preferably a 1:1 adaptation or at least not a lot of changes. 

Sadly I don't think this day will ever come though, I've *never* seen this show mentioned anywhere on the internet and I can't even get a hold of all the main books digitally, it seems like this is a very small/unknown comic."
Meridian,"A Red Dead Redemption TV series by HBO would be my dream. A gritty western following the Van Der Linde  gang, rivalry with other gangs, and law trailing them."
Meridian,"Grass by by Sheri S. Tepper .  Its been forever since I read it but always thought it would make a great mini series
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_(novel)"
Meridian,Homeworld needs to be a tv show.
Meridian,"Sandman Slim. I keep seeing things online about a movie being made, but nothing comes out. I think a series would be better. Plus you've already got The Sandman coming out and it'll likely confuse a lot of people."
Meridian,Berserk would make for a great HBO series
Meridian,"Ice Planet Barbarians  

Really, just make it take itself so seriously while also being as absurd as the source material is.  Give us a new romance every two episodes.  Cast a bunch of wrestlers or other giant men as the blue sexy aliens.  Give it a nice makeup budget (hell, give us a blue peen) but a really low budget for sets (obviously fake snow).  It could be amazing, romantic and absurd.

I'd also love to see another historical romance series.  Eloisa James' Wildes of Lindlow Castle (it's Georgian, so absurd crazy fashion) or Lisa Kleypas' Wallflowers or something by Tessa Dare.  And they should go ahead and use colorblind casting because it's not like there are that many dukes and earls anyway. . ."
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,yeah i thought it was incredible. sad it was cancelled.
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,"You should really read the books by Douglas Adams (author of The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy), they’re probably my favorite science fiction comedies ever. There are two of them, Dirk Gently’s Holistic Detective Agency and its follow-up The Long Dark Tea-Time Of The Soul. 

The TV series developed original plots so reading the books won’t even feel like you’re retreading the same material. Unless you’ve watched the 1979 season of Doctor Who since Douglas Adams was head writer and wound up reusing the villain’s backstory and goals from City of Death and the guest characters and setting of Shada (which was only ever partly filmed due to labor disputes) for his 1987 novel."
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,Bart remains one of my favorite characters ever.
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,"Loved first season, but the second one was a miss for me, don’t remember what exactly, only that I felt really uninterested about it"
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,Elijah Wood really hasn't been in anything these last few years... Dirk Gently and Wilfred were some outrageous shows
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,"The first season of Dirk Gently is one of my absolute most favorite series of TV ever. It's delightfully constructed and I love the actors. Too bad it couldn't go on, and I learned later that Max Landis is a fucking rapist and a creep"
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,"You just reminded me I need to watch it.

Thanks for leading me to want to watch it more :)"
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,Frodo has pretty much only done weirdo roles after he left the shire.
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,[removed]
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,Did IT!!!!
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,"The books are AWESOME! Dirk Gently used to be my favorite, but now I think Tea Time is. The only things they really have in common with the show are the name of the main character (even though I'd argue against the idea that Dirk is the main character of Tea Time, except insofar as his NOT doing something kickstarts the plot) and the whole ""what the fuck just happened"" feel. It took me three or four reads of Dirk Gently to figure out what the deal was with the Bach, and probably more than that in Tea Time to catch the bit about the fridge."
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,"The first one was sci-fi. The second one was fantasy. And the show doesn't feel the same as a fantasy. The first season started with a murder scene and worked its way backward. Which was interesting to see how all the pieces fell into place. The second season had almost no stakes knowing it could be all undone by magic the whole time. And if anything didn't make sense, it could be literally waved off with a hand by saying, ""It's magic. I don't have to explain squat."""
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,"> Loved first season, but the second one was a miss for me, don’t remember what exactly, only that I felt really uninterested about it

Same.  Second season wasn't as good because Dirk was depressed the whole time and wasn't solving any mysteries."
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,He's too busy doing behind the scenes work as a producer.
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,I still think Netflix should have produced season 3. The potential was really high and i loved this show.
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,">The first one was sci-fi. The second one was fantasy. 

What's so funny is that in the books, the first one was also sci fi and the second one was also fantasy... but the show is otherwise almost but not quite entirely unlike the books, to paraphrase Douglas Adams."
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,The head writer was outed as a sex pest so there's little chance of that happening: https://www.indiewire.com/2019/06/max-landis-accused-sexual-abuse-eight-women-1202150703/
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,I didn't know that. They could bring other writers but i understand if they didn't want to be associated with anything linked to Landis.
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,"He's got that Frodo money, he can do shit just because it looks fun."
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,"I honestly respect Elijah Wood so much as an actor for this. He takes on strange, obscure roles in sometimes tiny projects and things too strange to be massive commercial hits, obviously for the sheer love of the project. 
With things like Dirk Gently and I Don’t Feel At Home In This World Anymore you can tell he took them on because he felt passionate about it, and he very obviously had fun during filming."
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,And fucking ***Over the Garden Wall***.
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,"Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency is a fantastic show and it really sucks that it got cancelled. I love the deconstructed tropes the best. The running gag in the first season where *everyone* got cool jackets was pretty hilarious. I'm sad it's not coming back, I liked the directions that the character development was going in."
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,Wilfred was amazing. Gonna have to check out the others
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,"I’m a huge Douglas Adams fan, love the Dirk Gently book, and I’m also a big fan of the show. This review was written after only the first few episodes of the first season. I think it gets better as it goes on. Season two is even weirder."
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,"AND! “I don’t want to live on earth anymore” or whatever tf it was called. struck chords with me that one did, even if I can’t recall the name."
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,Let not forget him producing kickass indie genre movies like _Mandy_ and _A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night_.
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency, Lot of people don’t know Elijah Wood is also the voice of Spyro! (popular video game series)
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,"Can't forget that he was also ""the guy"" in spy kids 3d"
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,Wilfred was so good
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,let's not forget he helped produce the phenomenal movie that is [The Greasy Strangler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m1r00Z-6ac)
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,He is in a Netflix movie called I Don’t Feel At Home In This World Anymore that kind of reminds me of those shows a little bit. I really liked it.
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,ITT: Elijah Wood and Daniel Radcliffe are the same person.
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,I miss Wilfred
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,He also [Opened his own game studio](https://youtu.be/6EtmLM8tPhw)
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,I'm glad he secured Lord of the Rings; So now he is able to do whatever he wants with the rest of his career.
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,"Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency is awesome! After watching that, I really want to read books as well."
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,I really wish dirk gently was coming back 😢
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,"Damn, I loved Dirk Gently. Shame the director turned out to be an asshole and got his show cancelled"
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,And Swiss Army Man
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,[deleted]
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,"Super respect for Elijah. He could probably have coasted off his LotR royalties for a long time but he obviously picks projects he cares about. And he's seriously skilled, fuck, that Maniac movie was something else. Dirk Gently was a fantastic show and I'm really bummed they got cancelled. Y'all know Elijah shows up in like season 10 of Red Vs. Blue? That kinda blew my fucking mind. He plays the fiery AI Sigma."
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,WE NEED SEASON 3 OF DIRK GENTLY. It’s such a crazy show but I love it. Season 1 and 2 are on Hulu right now.
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,Ah you just reminded how much I miss Bored to Death
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,"It's all about having fun, instead of it being a job.  You KNOW that Nick cage has the same mentality."
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,hes blossomed since harry potter.
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,"He's done something really interesting in taking on weird roles. I'm sure he could have been a much more mainstream, popular actor, but he seems to be doing what he enjoys, and good for him."
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,"When an actor gets that movie franchise money, they can do whatever they like. See Daniel Radcliffe and Robert Pattinson."
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,And Over the Garden Wall. He's also in Problem Solverz for some reason
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,He’s kind of like Daniel Radcliffe in that he has a shit ton of cash from LOTR and can just do whatever sounds fun.
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,“Choosing” ... you’re optimistic.
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,Our golden Boi! 💯
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,I mean he was Frodo in LOTR... I doubt he needs ths money. Probably just passionately acting where he can.
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,I respect the interesting projects that he's involved with enough that I really don't see him as Frodo from LOTR anymore. It could have been the one strategy that has worked to prevent type casting. At worst he tends to play characters that are overwhelmed by a world and forces that are completely beyond his power and even understanding. Still interesting stuff regardless.
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,"The boy is minted from lotr.  Radcliffe is the same.  They can both afford to take risks on interesting projects.

Power to them."
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,"Not to mention producing weird/awesome movies through his company, Spectrevision like MANDY."
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,Was good in sin city too.
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,He can do that because he has all that sweet LoTR money. Same goes with Daniel Radcliff and Harry Potter
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,"Wilfred is one of my favorite shows. When I found out we both suffer from the same illness, I was instantly pulled in. It’s such an endearing show."
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,"I watched the original Aussie version of Wilfred and the US reboot, with Elijah Wood. He did a fantastic job on the reboot, what an actor!"
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,The show Wilfred will never be forgotten props to Elijah wood
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,He's nothing if not a connoisseur of the strange.
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,"He's been my favorite celebrity for a while and to be honest LotR is the least of the reasons.  I really love his bizarre film / tv choices.  Grand piano was a tour de force of thrills.  Wilfred was hilarious and depressing at the same time.  Maniac was horrifying.

I really started to be a huge fan though during on of his AMAs.  Someone asked about his family fostering dogs and he totally remembered the person who took and raised one of the dogs.  It really sold me on him being just a normal dude who happens to be extremely famous."
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,"wilfred pretty much destroyed me with that ending, but it was something i needed at the time"
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,"I used to have weird dreams about smoking pot out of volcanic rocks with Peter Gabriel, but I hope my subconscious lets me have a few adventures with elijah wood, because he seems like an awesome hang."
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,"Daniel Radcliffe does the same thing. It’s like they made their money by being in massive billion dollar franchises and are just like, “Well I never have to work ever again if I don’t want.” They’re just getting weird with it."
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,Hats off to a bloke for taking paid work that looks fun.
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,"Dirk Gently’s Holistic Detective Agency is legit one of my all-time favorite shows! Elijah Wood and Samuel Barnett were hilarious together and I loved the sci-fi elements! Ugh thanks for reminding me how much I miss this show. 

If you want a feeling for the tone of the show, this is a great scene: https://youtu.be/Hv7DNKXm1gk"
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,"It makes me smile how much people adore him. My 'little kid watching the same movie a million times' movie was **North.** 

I could probably recite the movie during a watching even now."
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,"That's what happens when you become a multi millionaire as a kid, you have options. The part we should be happiest about is that he didn't take the option of overdosing on cocaine"
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,I remember watching The Good Son in the theater. Also known as Home Alone 3.
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,[Am I too late???](https://youtu.be/rRvwKlhYN1A)
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,"Wood, Redcliffe, and Robert Pattinson have all followed similiar career paths. Do a huge franchise, than take on more experimental roles."
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,"He and Daniel Radcliffe are similar in that regard. They got ""fuck you"" money **really** early in their careers, so they've got the freedom to take on risk. Must be quite nice compared to the majority of A-list actors who need to constantly work on massive projects in order to maintain their quality of life."
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,The first season of Wilfred is a masterpiece.
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,Can we have more Dirk Gently's please?
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,I used to think that about Phil Hartman when he decided to do NewsRadio instead of starring in his own show.  Then I read an article about how he had a hard time finding work after SNL because he was so ubiquitous in roles there that it was hard to find standout ones that he could turn into other jobs.  He was referred to as “the glue” at SNL because he brought so many skits together by filling in those minor roles (and doing it extremely well).
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,"""I'm a holistic assassin... I kill whoever I like killing all day and if I killed them, they were my target."""
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,And he like lives a chill ass cool life in Austin and he’s got a sick reputation as a super authentic good guy and he produces really cool stuff (like the movie Mandy) and he just did the coolest thing with his LOTR fame and fortune - he is always supporting underdogs and doing little things to help other people - I love Elijah Wood!!
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,Dirk Gently deserves *way* better than a B-.
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,I miss Dirk Gently so much. Wish it hadn't gotten cancelled.
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,Elijah Wood is hands down one of the greats!
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,Iirc he also helped produce Mandy!
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,"Also look up “apples In stereo” he did a music video with them.

Maybe two. 

The guy is living his best life."
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,"Elijah Wood is always great, yet to see anything I haven’t loved him in."
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,Where is the kitten?
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,"Wilfred blew me away when I first saw it. I found myself constantly laughing throughout the series, but also so emotionally connected to the character of Ryan. The ending to the episode about him dealing with the guilt he had over the death of his childhood dog was so beautifully done and left me in tears. Such an underrated, albeit unusual, show."
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,"Honestly, he is a modern treasure. Daniel Radcliffe has similarly been taking smaller projects this as well."
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,Dirk gently was awesome. I was so bummed that it ended. It was the right kind of crazy.
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,"I think people tend to forget that he played the hyperkinetic serial killer in ""Sin City."" He's never shied away from things like that."
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,"Wilfred is such a mind fuck, particularly if you binge watch it. Really got in my head and played to my sense of paranoia."
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,He’s so irrelevant that he paid to have a three year old article about him upvoted to the top?
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,Don’t forget Swiss Army Man
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,[deleted]
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,This article is 3 years old..?
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,"He was also in that little indie franchise called Lord of the something, I forget"
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,"Watching his weird roles really makes me think that's what he's like in real life. Which is either true or proof that he's a really good actor. Either way I love it.

[Also this](https://youtu.be/gAYL5H46QnQ?t=118)"
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,I miss Wilfred...
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,I think he’s able to take more risks with roles than most actors because he’s got that lord of the rings money to fall back on.
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,"Oo we don't talk about Flipper anymore, do we? But now he's cool 😎"
Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency,Love Elijah wood and dirk gently n Wilfred are fucking master pieces
Safe House,And that's why this was fiction.
Safe House,"I always thought of West Wing as a fantasy alternative reality when I first saw it in GWB’s administration. 

Nowadays, it feels closer to the Elves in Lord of the Rings. So impossibly ideal that it has to only exist in the brain of a liberal intellectual"
Safe House,"I think real patriotism is based on empathy. Something we desperately need more than ever

Safe House,martin sheen is such a fantastic actor and a major social activist
Safe House,Nice idealism of a better time.
Safe House,Honestly this is a great ending to the MS plot that started all the way back in Season 1.
Safe House,"There is almost no positive upside to admitting an error for a politician.  People who support you think you took the high ground and will continue to support.  People against you will use it ammo against future endeavors.  The media will do what gets the most eyeballs which would be turning it into a big story so that it haunts you.  And the undecided people will either not vote, or just listen to the media.

If we want politicians like this then we need to want a society that respects forgiveness and praises honestly.  Ohh and Rupert Murdoch would have to be dead."
Safe House,Listen to the West Wing Thing podcast folks
Safe House,I'm not an Aaron Sorkin fan specifically because of writing like this.
Safe House,The problem with this line is that it insinuates things were ever different.
Safe House,"I love this show, but it makes me depressed because Barlet is such a great president."
Safe House,[deleted]
Safe House,how can anyone like this show with the way they treat women
Safe House,"Is Sorkin the worst screenwriter we have that still gets big roles?

Outside of Social Network which was very clearly Fincher he is just the worst."
Safe House,I want Aaron Sorkin to write real life.
Safe House,"That reminds me of a scene in season 4 of The Wire, toward the end of the season Carcetti finds out that the school system is operating at a $54 million dollar deficit, and he's meeting with all the people in his local government and they all deny that they were responsible for the shortfall, and his chief of staff says ""Okay, we get it, no one's responsible; no one at this table."""
Safe House,"I was watching Vantage Point the other day and was thinking about how hilarious the “The president is in danger, the future of the free world is at risk, we have to do everything we can to save him.” type movies are now.

Picturing the call from the terrorists coming and it’s the pentagon where they’re all around the table listening to their huge demands. With everyone looking around like [this](https://media1.tenor.com/images/a407e907194fe72506e63cdd02ddeb16/tenor.gif?itemid=3294343).

In the background you hear: 

^”And ^my ^crowd ^size ^it ^was ^like ^nothing ^anyone ^has ^ever ^seen ^before...”"
Safe House,"From what DC people say, West Wing is what people wish politics was like, House Of Cards is what they fear it is like, and VEEP is what it’s actually like."
Safe House,"When it was airing, TWW was frequently called ""The Left Wing"" for its portrayal of liberal politicians. 

To be honest the most outlandish fantasy in the show isn't the competency of the main cast, but the fact that the conservative/GOP politicians actually have spines and aren't total moral hypocrites. If Arnold Vinick was a real person today he'd be considered a Democrat."
Safe House,">Sorkin duped 3 generations of liberals into thinking this is how politics worked at some point in history.

I don't think the main trick is one of a romantic view of the past. I think it's a trick of perspective. People kind of fail to notice that when you get down to brass tacks, Bartletts presidency is kind of a watered down version of the Clinton administration.

He has the same struggle with wanting to be bipartisan and wanting to achieve Liberal goals, ultimately failing to make much headway with either.

We see a lot of things where the big climax of an episode is a half-achievement that feels like a whole achievement, and then we kind of gloss over the complete lack of follow-through. For example, there's this whole big thing where Bartlett tries to reform election law by appointing new people to the FEC, and he does manage to make those appointments, but we miss that campaign finance has not reformed at all when Santos is running. We see Toby make a deal to save social security by bringing together a Democrat and a Republican,  who'll make a proposal, but fail to notice the proposal never really seems to go anywhere.

So what are his actual achievements over both terms together? A watered down version of the Brady Bill in the first season, and a watered down version of the Oslo Accords in the last season. And three Supreme Court judges, but one of them is a conservative."
Safe House,And they also never fight for what they believe in. What serious progressive accomplishments did they achieve in the show? It’s a perfect example of what’s wrong with the Democratic Party. There’s an entire podcast dedicated to this that’s awesome- The West Wing Thing
Safe House,"Right after 9/11, we've already invaded Afghanistan and are probably about to prepare for the invasion of Iraq around the time this aired, pretty awful time. Millions of people died, the PATRIOT act was passed a few months earlier."
Safe House,"> If we want politicians like this then we need to want a society that respects forgiveness 

I wish we lived in a world like that. I'll try to make the world more like that. But wow are we nowhere close to it now. Not only is forgiveness unpopular, being punitive is basically a form of entertainment to the masses. Which...that's not really anything new I guess. Public executions used to be a form of entertainment in many historical periods. I hope someday we're more civilized than that."
Safe House,"I’m just a womaaaaaaan, and this Aaron Sorkin’s work"
Safe House,">They did this with Emily Procter character and with Mary-Louise Parker character.

Emily signed on with CSI. I’ve read that the “powers that be” behind the show admit they made a mistake by not locking her into a contract.

Mary-Louise got pregnant in real life. Maybe they didn’t want to write this in to the show or try to hide it. Or maybe she didn’t want to work while pregnant or after the birth of her son (you might recall she was left in a bit of “lurch” with regard to the the father situation). 

Both of these circumstances may have put the writers in a bind with respect to giving the characters proper closure."
Safe House,"You’re definitely right about that. They had some pretty big names come in for one or two episode roles and they’re never seen again. At least Mary, Emily and Rob made appearance in the final episode. While Moira Kelly, Edward James Olmos, Matthew Perry, and Anna Deveare Smith all vanished abruptly or after their arc was finished, never to be seen again."
Safe House,"People come and go in government.  If anything the cast was too stable compared to reality and far too small.  Look at how many Cheifs of Staff and Communications Directors there have been in the last few administrations.

Mary-Louise Parker is present in five of the seven seasons.  Emily Procter is in three seasons including the last season."
Safe House,"How people can’t see the naked sexism (especially from Josh, Jesus) I don’t fucking know"
Safe House,"Maybe bump that one down a notch. 

Veep is what I wish it was like. 

House of Cards is what the current administration wishes it was like. 

West Wing is some kind of fever dream experienced by DC interns taking too much ayahuasca."
Safe House,"Ha! We started watching Veep since it’s on HBO Max and got that same impression. At least, maybe this is how it was during the Obama administration. I get the sense that our current administration is far more back-stabby and toxic."
Safe House,"> If Arnold Vinick was a real person today he'd be considered a Democrat.

Not necessarily. He could be a Republican in the mould of Charlie Baker or Larry Hogan.

He maybe couldn't stand to be in McConnell's Senate, but he could be a Republican governor of California.

He'd be to the right of Biden and even Biden is considered too moderate for the left wing of the Democratic party."
Safe House,That's why the West Wing LARPers in the Obama Admin were so utterly out maneuvered by the GOP at every turn before going on to high paying lobbying jobs after living their fantasy
Safe House,"> What serious progressive accomplishments did they achieve in the show

I like the show, but literally nothing."
Safe House,"I haven't actually watched the show, but I assume this is one of those problems where dumb people try to write smart people. There's a really good ""green text"" [explanation of this concept](https://i.imgur.com/iNOMBVK.png) with Sherlock. I would guess that the characters on West Wing give lots of impassioned speeches that ultimately lead to little progressive accomplishments because the writers of the show are good writers and not good politicians. 

They can write a really good speech but even with a bunch of consultants helping, they're probably not up to the task of writing actual legislation to use in their plotlines and world building, especially stuff that's going to hold up 10 or 20 years later. So looking back it's easy to say, ""Wow this fictional president is really eloquent but somehow wasn't able to solve campaign finance, an issue that has plagued real-world activists for decades."""
Safe House,"it would've been very funny to have been a fly on the wall, watching an ivy league grad make a impassioned, sorkinesque speech that appealed to his republican colleagues' better natures, only to get shot down and called a bunch of slurs. disastrous for the country, but very funny"
Safe House,Dumb writers would imagine their grandiose speeches working.  Sorkin is idealistic but he's not stupid.  The political process usually started and ended in the West Wing and left it ambiguous if bills passed in congress.
Safe House,"Nah it's making an impassioned speech about bipartisanship to his republican peers to help cover up the intentional bombing of the only trauma centre in north eastern Afghanistan because doctors without borders had the mission to treat any unarmed person who came through the door

Edit: Sorry I don't toe the Obama's only scandal was his tan suit line from the Vichy Democrats"
Safe House,"i mean hey, if you want to see the funny side of the obama administration, you've gotta be willing to ignore a few civilian drone strike casualties"
Safe House,Whom amongst hasn't at one time or another ignored pleas to bring war criminals to justice and actively sabotaged investigation attempts by the ICC in their Scandal Free Administration™️
Safe House,">however. There’s a lot of sitting around tables and talking about the troubles of the kingdom

They bring this up as a negative point but I really loved that in the first couple of seasons of GoT."
Safe House,[deleted]
Safe House,"Rolling stones is interesting and one I really see as a positive. I hope theres more focus on politics, intrigue and dialogue. Season 1-3 were the highlight of the original series (and books) for that reason. 

Also the problem that the quotable/witty characters might be a blessing in disguise. The show ended up destroying itself and those characters because they became beholden and flanderised based on those lines/subsequent popularity. Tyrion in particular."
Safe House,"When the negative reviews are ""too much dialogue"" I'm in."
Safe House,Am I the only one struggling to see any inherently negative points in a lot of these negative reviews?
Safe House,"I am cautiously optimistic 

There are a few things that I’m apprehensive about though. Succession filled the void GoT left behind of a political power struggle with many moving pieces that managed to be far more grounded than GoT. House of the Dragon has to live up to both it and GoT in that regard in my opinion 

Another aspect is that I really preferred the production of GoT in its earlier seasons where it managed to do a lot with what was available. Later seasons felt like they went big for the sake of it which I felt made GoT lose some of its charm and HotD seems to be closer to later GoT in terms of production 

I really hope it delivers tbh"
Safe House,I am not surprised that Milly Alcock gets some praise here. Even in just the trailers you can see she has some great charisma and presence. I wonder if her older replacement will be able to keep up with her performance.
Safe House,"The only thing I can conclude from these, is that, most random reviewers just aren't worth listening to. 

&#x200B;

I'm taking the same approach with this and the Lord of the Rings TV show - my expectations are going to be set so god damn low, that it's almost impossible that I could be let down. 

&#x200B;

Narrator voice: ""He was later let down in dramatic fashion"""
Safe House,"I'd say we should go in with managed expectations. As far as I'm aware, the source material is sort of like a history book more than a novel. 

When GoT show overtook the ASOIAF books, there was a significant noticeable drop in writing quality. Characters started acting more petulant and dialogue became mostly juvenile.

I really do hope this show is a return to form though. But most fantasy live action in the last few years has turned out absolutely abysmal."
Safe House,"Critic reviews for TV are much less important than those for movies. Because critics only judge a TV show based on a couple of episodes, their reviews are  always missing the entire picture. Unlike a movie which is experienced fully and therefore you have a much better understanding of the product.

TV shows are a much longer commitment and therefore your true score will only come over time as your brain digests the material to a fuller extent.

GoT had some middling pre-reviews for S1 as well. It was only after the entire season had finished that some critics went back and thought ""Y,know what? That was actually pretty good!""

I always give a whole season for a show to find it's footing.

Edit: The truly damaging review comes from Slate Magazine and it was done by a game reviewer. Awful choice and makes me disregard the review, even if it was positive. Video games are a more action-packed medium and this is a more ponderous story."
Safe House,"Saw it on Wednesday thanks to Tiff in Toronto. I absolutely loved it. Now, it’s a great pilot, but the next two episodes will really show if its got legs. Personally, I think its a very promising first episode, the writing, acting and directing was very strong. Plus, its a fucking great looking show with no comparison (some weaker cgi here and there but great compared to other shows). 

I was so ready to be done with the show and go back to rereading the books, but now i’m excited for Sunday again.

Plus, it feels like GoT, the politics, the intrigue, the danger… and I think the story they picked will work really well for TV."
Safe House,"I’m super excited, not gunna lie."
Safe House,"Saw the first ep on Wednesday. I think it is going to be decent. However, people need to give it a chance with an open mind. I'd probably still watch anything GoT related that came out anyways, but I'm sure there are some people who are really bitter of how the show ended and are reluctant to give this a go. Really excited for Matt Smith as Daemon."
Safe House,"I know it all depends on the execution, but the mixed reviews talk about the focus on the politics of the kingdom and sitting around tables debating as if they werent the most engaging parts of early GoT. That being said, those scenes may be poorly put to screen in House of Dragon, will find out soon enough."
Safe House,"Should I even watch this if I’ve never watched Game of Thrones?. The ending scared me off, but I am interested in this new one."
Safe House,"I see a trend when somewhat middling reviews start to appear for a soon-to-release popular property. Redditors start to pick apart those middling reviews, saying things like, ""The critic has a problem with *that*?! Ridiculous! That particular nitpick is what I *love* about the property!""

But when the dust settles, the critics are rarely wrong. A show that gets middling critic reviews is almost always middling. That doesn't mean it will be *bad*, and that doesn't mean it won't *improve*. 

But, I'm definitely going into this show with lowered expectations. Hopefully it will be halfway decent."
Safe House,"From the reviews here and the comments, it seems like people don't understand that this too is a book? A history book, to be exact. Reviewers and commenters are making statements as if the show runners came up with the story."
Safe House,"[Slant: A Frustrating Jumble of Incident and Spectacle](https://www.slantmagazine.com/tv/house-of-the-dragon-review/)

> House of the Dragon must really believe its own claim that “the truth does not matter, only perception,” for it ultimately is more interested in fan service—offering up more dragons, more gore, more surprise murders, a more expensive historical re-enactment—than it is in developing scenes that ring true for its characters. Game of Thrones veterans like director Miguel Sapochnik and composer Ramin Djawadi can make this new series look and sound like more of the same, but it’s as hollow and brittle as the massive scale model of the kingdom that Viserys takes pride in building. That’s a rotten foundation for an epic fantasy, so maybe the prophecy was correct after all: the only thing that could tear down the House of the Dragon was itself.

[Empire: The writing so far lacks the sparkle of Game Of Thrones' most profound moments.](https://www.empireonline.com/tv/reviews/house-of-the-dragon-season-1/)

>For all its po-faced plotting, this show has plenty going for it. A decade time-jump in episode six, recasting several characters, gives the series a new energy; D’Arcy and Olivia Cooke (as the troubled Queen Alicent Hightower) breathe new dimensions into their aged-up characters, and the sudden switch-up suggests a show unafraid to take risks. This is a prequel that could surprise us yet. But to even skirt the heights of Thrones’ best work, it has an uphill dragon ride ahead.

[Indiewire: HBO’s Devout ‘Game of Thrones’ Prequel Rarely Roars to Life](https://www.indiewire.com/2022/08/house-of-dragon-review-got-prequel-1234752881/)

>Co-showrunners Miguel Sapochnik and Ryan Condal, along with co-creators Condal and George R.R. Martin, make misogyny’s destructive influence the series’ central theme, but it’s more of a convenient shield than a piercing dagger. After all, this is a prequel to “Game of Thrones”; where Westeros ends up has already been set. Learning its past isn’t far removed from its future is both part of the point — feigning interest in how the medieval fantasy’s patriarchal power structures and boastful man-babies mirror modern day’s similar problems — and a safe path for the network’s first spinoff of its highest-grossing franchise. The first six episodes set up an intimate yet epic tale of how misbegotten pride, outdated customs, and an obsession with power burned down a long-thriving kingdom… all while enjoying the ensuing ugliness more than they examine its unnecessary proliferation. Pure spectacle and (often icky) soap opera make for intermittently absorbing TV. Mainly though, the new “House” sticks safely to the “Game” that preceded it, rather than fight for any meaningful change."
Safe House,"Meh - looking at what critics are choosing to praise here, I've slightly downgraded my expectations."
Safe House,"so, tons of childbirth scenes, THE STRUGGLE

&#x200B;

will still watch, though, because I'm bored"
Safe House,">Rolling Stone had a negative take, noting, “Palace intrigue, and questions of succession and legitimacy, were of course a huge part of Game of Thrones, but far from the only part. And they were only sometimes even close to the most fun part of a given stretch of that series.

Sepinwall enjoyed Game of Thrones for far different reasons than I did, it seems."
Safe House,[deleted]
Safe House,"I think people are too laser focused on what they perceive the review is I don't think they are complaining that politics are always boring, but rather that the show lacks in other areas that GoT didn't. There was plenty of political intrigue there but also lots of hillarious moments intersped with it, you could have Varys doing spy master stuff learning about everyone's position on matters and then have him discuss court gossip and marveling at the tales of Podrick's amazing sexual powers. 

Hopefully it isn't like that and the show's tone is more complex and not just FIRE AND BLOOD, non-stop. Even Tywin relaxed from time to time."
Safe House,Any idea if I need to have seen GoT to watch this show?
Safe House,"A big problem this show will have is that it can't be all things to all people like Game of Thrones did. GoT is like a diner that has a little of everything (burgers, chicken tenders, shrimp, quesadillas, etc.) while House of the Dragon is like a seafood restaurant (depending on your preference, one is better than the other). With GoT, there were plenty of people who said they only watched for the political intrigue or dragons or white walkers or Dany or Arya or Jon or the battles or the magic or a particular actor or actress or large scope or large number of characters or to root for certain characters to die, etc. House of th Dragon has some of that stuff but not all it it so it would be nearly impossible for it to be as big of a show as GoT (even if they season 8 had been incredible). They only way it could would be if it could get new people. Also, I hear GoT was the highest watched show for HBO in 2021 despite the bad ending and it being 2 years after it ending so that's a little hope for this show."
Safe House,"> however. There’s a lot of sitting around tables and talking about the troubles of the kingdom  

That is exactly what I'm here for. I can go plenty of places and get high flying wizardry and sword fighting. *The Crown* is fucking awesome, and it has zero dragons, sword fighting, or wizardry. 

I thought it was a great pilot episode, it didn't try to be GoT *exactly*, while still feeling like GoT (to me at least). GoT was a generational phenomenon, and impossible to recreate 1:1. Any attempt to do that would likely fail based on probability alone. 

I like the fact the show might be more concentrated. Sometimes GoT felt way too sprawling, and characters were moving around the map at breakneck speeds, especially towards the end where the scale of westeros really shrank.  

I thought the cgi could be cleaned up some in a few shots, but nothing too egregious. Some really great acting performances also.  

I usually love an underdog, so I think I'm gonna be team princess. I always wondered what Henry VIII would have done if he had just realized that one of the most influential monarchs in English and even world history was sitting right under his nose, so it was really fun for me to see a monarch do exactly that in this episode, even if it was a pretend one. Can't help but wonder if GRRM has the same question."
Safe House,">yet opined that the show is weighed down by focusing on the Targaryens compared to the more expansive scope of the original series:

the show is literally named ""house of dragons"" why was this person expecting stories of baratheons and starks?"
Safe House,"THR review has to be a meme.

Show is called House of the Dragon

Gets mad that it focuses on Targaryen Family"
Safe House,I just wanna see /r/freefolk implode if it's good
Safe House,"I'm going to say something that will bother many: if it wasn't for HBO, the reviewers ratings would be much worse."
Safe House,RollingStone points out the reason I've been so apprehensive about this show -- too much palace intrigue and not enough common folk stories from the wider world to ground the whole thing.
Safe House,[deleted]
Safe House,"Yeah I don’t know if people will ever get over the awful ending and return to the GOT universe. I can guarantee that this show will never even touch the ratings that GOT had back in its prime. Maybe it will start to pick up traction in a few seasons, but I think we all are still a bit scarred and this was too soon if you ask me"
Safe House,"These reviews don’t inspire confidence in me - someone who wanted a reason to be pulled back into the show other than just “it’s more GoT and more dragons.”

I expected more quality from this show tbh."
Safe House,">yet opined that the show is weighed down by focusing on the Targaryens

You're telling me House of the Dragon is focusing on the house whose sigil is dragons and who owns dragons??!

*shocked pikachu face*"
Safe House,"Whatever, call me when it's done. If they don't screw it up, then I'll watch it."
Safe House,"Idk if it's cause the last season or two of GoT turned me off to it so much or what, but the trailers didn't make me want to watch"
Safe House,"93% on RT so far, can’t wait"

Safe House,Looks like it’s worth the watch and a palette cleanser for that last season of GOT
Safe House,Is it even worth watching if i've never seen GoT?

Safe House,"Grace said it’s good so it must be, I’m very excited, cannot wait for it to drop

Plus seems like GOT meets Succession, and as a fan of both I’m sure it’ll be fun"
Safe House,How much of the season have these reviewers seen? Always feel weird to judge something that isn't whole yet.
Safe House,It’s to big to fail….. they will talk about how great it is till we think it is. Hopefully it will be….. see already starting to work!
Safe House,I prolly only watching this for Matt Smith.
Safe House,"No matter what anyone else says, the show is still gonna be ""tainted"" by the slap-in-the-face GOT ending. I'm still pissed."
Safe House,"I'm not super excited about this. I'll watch it though.

Tyrion related and hung out with and plotted with the lower classes. The Stark kids went off in different directions— pampered nobility that were suddenly fish out of water. Jon went to the Wall and mixed with many types of characters. It was the mix of characters that made the aSoIaF books and GoT show good.

  
I'm sure they'll throw in some stories of castle staff and other lower class characters. But so far this looks like it's the adventures of a bunch of millionaires and billionaires (relative to our world) and that could get dry pretty quickly.

  
(I'm also in the weirdo minority who doesn't much like the dragons and dragon riding stuff. I love the dark magic that births them in aSoIaF. But then they grow up to be basically titanic lizards. Nothing really magical about them at all. They even need to eat herds of cattle just to survive—which would make them a huge drain on resources. Liabilities.)"
Safe House,[deleted]
Safe House,"Rolling Stone also panned Led Zeppelin’s first album, among many other highly acclaimed albums so I’ll just take that one with a grain of salt."
Safe House,"I watched every episode of GoT, first because it seemed interesting and then because of its storied beginnings I thought it could somehow redeem itself. What memory offers now is an absolute  grimoire of grisly ideas papered over by the moniker ""fantasy TV"". Women having their babies cut out of their wombs, castration and humiliation, death drowning in molten metal, having to learn to fight through sudden blindness, a talking gallery of decapitated heads, some sort of creeping disease, death by being pulled apart by dogs, being tricked into eating your relative baked into a pie, casual, ritual, near constant rapes. Spoiler -- mostly everybody dies. And then at the end the actors of this monstrosity could barely phone it in and started leaving their coffee cups and water bottles on sets as they were being filmed. 

Doesn't matter what anyone says. \*Never again\*, GoT; over here we finally understood we the audience were being terrorized."
Safe House,No more misogyny….I’m out
Safe House,"Yeah if I got paid to go to the big opening and review I'd say nice shit too, so I could go to the next big opening"
Safe House,All the people saying this franchise was dead after season 8 are delusional. Most of the reviews are positive; this show is going to be a *huge* hit.
Safe House,"Even negatives seems to be my cup of tea honestly.   


In the end, I'm here for the politicking and dragons and it seems that is what we will get."
Safe House,Most of the critics are things specifically said to be about the show (like too many Targaryens lol) and being upset about the things that made GoT great.
Safe House,reviews seem solid enough but i feel like there is a gap for rings of power to slide into that could take over the public consciousness.
Four Seasons in Havana,"*The Sony Pictures Television-produced show will conclude with a four-episode final season. The news follows months of renegotiations with Sony to lower the show’s licensing fee, and the cast had to sign new deals, given the order is for half the episodes that were featured in season one, sources say.*

Not a great way to end but fair play to Sony and the cast for agreeing to come back on lower rates for a small wrap up season. Better a concluded series than a prematurely cancelled one!"
Four Seasons in Havana,Congrats on being the first post when Reddit came back up!
Four Seasons in Havana,damn i love streaming and everything being transient
Four Seasons in Havana,"That's a shame. As a big fan of the movie, I went into this show very pessimistic and really wasn't expecting much, but I was very pleasantly surprised. The story was clever and fresh, while still keeping some aspects of the film. Also, the cast was excellent. Glad they'll at least be able to wrap it up."
Four Seasons in Havana,"Everyone who is confused about why theres such a focus on sexuality, the movie its based on was a huge movie for people in the queer community in the 90s. Its considered a gay classic even if it isnt explicit, and the director herself said its based on events in which many of the women playing in those leagues WERE gay. The baseball player Maybelle Blair who in large part inspired the story came out as gay too. So the show being EXPLICITLY gay this time is seen by those of us in the community as giving us a version of the movie we wished we had, but couldnt see in the 90s because that would have absolutely not have been allowed to be made"
Four Seasons in Havana,At least it’s concluded. I hate TV show blue balls.
Four Seasons in Havana,"Disco Janet, Neutral Janet, Bad Janet, and Baseball Janet on a team together. I want that show."
Four Seasons in Havana,Damn! This was my favorite show but I didn't expect to get anything so even this is something.
Four Seasons in Havana,"Maybe this time they could, you know, actually throw a baseball without the aid of CGI?"
Four Seasons in Havana,Damn I was really hoping for more time to explore Max’s story. I loved her in the first season. I doubt she’ll get much of an arc with only four episodes.
Four Seasons in Havana,"Shit I keep forgetting to watch this.

This is my fault, isn't it?"
Four Seasons in Havana,"Damn, I thought the show was very well done. Glad we get a little more. Amazing acting"
Four Seasons in Havana,See Netflix? This is how you can do things!
Four Seasons in Havana,12 years of historical experience boiled down to a weekend binge.
Four Seasons in Havana,I have scrolled through a seemingly endless sea of “Amazon originals” and have NEVER seen this. I so hate the ui on Amazon. I loved the movie and would have watched this immediately and now I find out it exists by hearing it’s canceled.
Four Seasons in Havana,At least they’re getting to close out the story. The Time-Traveler’s Wife got completely f****d over by HBO Max. I don’t think I’ll ever forgive them for that.
Four Seasons in Havana,"I loved the original film, so I was a bit disappointed I just couldn't click into the series."
Four Seasons in Havana,Binged this show in about a day in August when I had COVID.  Glad it's getting more episodes but I wish it would be more.
Four Seasons in Havana,"Shame. This was one of my favorite shows of 2022, and while four episodes is better than nothing that is still not a lot of time to wrap."
Four Seasons in Havana,I bailed after the first 30 minutes. It felt unfocused.
Four Seasons in Havana,I hadn’t heard of this show until yesterday. Will have to check it out.
Four Seasons in Havana,I didn’t even know this was a thing….
Four Seasons in Havana,Well at least we'll get a wrap up even though it's only 4 episodes.
Four Seasons in Havana,Add it to the pile of failed spin-offs. Idk why spin-offs/sequels/remakes are the latest trend. Most are done so poorly.
Four Seasons in Havana,I had no idea this was a series
Four Seasons in Havana,Wow. I didn’t even know this existed.
Four Seasons in Havana,Does this mean we're going to get Betty-Anne back?
Four Seasons in Havana,I wish all network would do something like that at least for shows that have 3-4 seasons already out
Four Seasons in Havana,Yea like Amazon doesn’t have money? Bastards!
Four Seasons in Havana,The show is a mess but I’m glad it’s getting a ending.
Four Seasons in Havana,"See, this is how you cancel shows. Spend a fraction of the original budget to have it ending properly.

Well done."
Four Seasons in Havana,"TIL ""A League of Their Own"" got a series."
Four Seasons in Havana,i didn’t even know it existed lol. bad pr
Four Seasons in Havana,"Well, it IS horrible."
Four Seasons in Havana,"This is one of those shows that rely on a known IP. I remember for about a week there was talk about it online but I don’t know a single person that has actually watched it. 

Surprised it’s getting a second final season but good news for those that enjoyed it I guess."
Four Seasons in Havana,"They really need to stop doing remakes. People are sick of them. They don’t want to see movies become television, they don’t want to see tv become movies, they don’t want to the movie they loved done again with diffeeent actors because fuck it, and they don’t want to see sequels forty years later. Hollywood isn’t out of ideas, but they don’t want to take chances. Meanwhile, when chances are taken like Severance people eat it up. Yes, taking a chance is scary, and might not work, but if it does it can be a smash."
Four Seasons in Havana,A League of Their Own is one of my favorite movies. So many iconic lines and this series had potential. But there were just no characters I cared about.
Four Seasons in Havana,"It’s boring and dog shit, wanted it to be good for Abby but damn it was bad."
Four Seasons in Havana,"happy for the LGBTQ folks to get a closure for their show, but surely a story about butch lesbians playing baseball without actual baseball being played had to be the nichest niche premise ever"
Four Seasons in Havana,The movie is classic. Why mess with it
Four Seasons in Havana,Wonder why.
Four Seasons in Havana,Damn shame. One of the best series in recent years. It deserves better.
Four Seasons in Havana,"another reboot nobody asked for, that had zero chance if being better than the original film

cmon man"
Four Seasons in Havana,Didn’t even know this was a thing…
Four Seasons in Havana,"The show started out really strong. Then it just made every character gay and that became the story. I stopped watching because it became like every new show. I don't care if characters are gay or straight but it's like TV shows have no idea how to handle gay people. 

""Listen this is your character she's gay and that's the only thing that defines you."" -studio

Then I watch schiits creek and we have gay people who are PEOPLE. Their sexual orientation isn't the most important thing."
Four Seasons in Havana,*Watch out Hitler... that ball’s going to Ber-lin.*
Four Seasons in Havana,WHAT??? NOOOO OMFG 😭
Four Seasons in Havana,"Lol Salke’s pride is too inflated to just gracefully take the L on this dud and spend money on projects that viewers actually watch. 
The only positive return on this was reminding folks the original movie exists, which pushed it up the charts for a week or two."
Four Seasons in Havana,"And Sony has the nerve to say Microsoft's 10 year agreement is not in good faith lmao.

Edit: Sony Ponies proceed to downvote me. Pathetic."
Four Seasons in Havana,This is a fucking show?? Why would they remake a classic movie into a god damn tv show instead of another movie like every other movie that comes out in the last ten years? This entire time I thought it was just a movie remake. Not everything needs to be a show. Movies exist for a fucking reason!
Four Seasons in Havana,Didn’t know this was even streaming.
Four Seasons in Havana,How many episodes are in a full season for a show on Netflix.
Four Seasons in Havana,I think they meant to put quotation marks around “season.”
Four Seasons in Havana,Eh that's fair. My fiancée and I enjoyed the first season but weren't sure where it was really going to go.
Four Seasons in Havana,Four episodes is not a season.
Four Seasons in Havana,omf Janet
Four Seasons in Havana,This show should've been so much better
Four Seasons in Havana,"For the right people, this screenshot is great Broad City reunion"
Four Seasons in Havana,"The CGI baseball pitching/hitting/throwing looks terrible. Once you notice it, oof."
Four Seasons in Havana,Disappointed but still thankful for a goodbye.
Four Seasons in Havana,Wish GLOW got the same deal
Four Seasons in Havana,Well I guess this better than nothing. It will get a conclusion at lease
Four Seasons in Havana,"Just to unnecessarily nitpick, that doesn’t really say anything about anyone taking a cut rate. To me that wording would imply pay at a similar rate per episode, but they agreed to film fewer eps. So they are getting payed less, but only because they’d be doing less work."
Four Seasons in Havana,"Honestly, I think this sort of thing should be standard.  So many shows in Netflix's library just kinda end with a cliff hanger, and then never got finished so it feels silly to get invested in watching shows from their back catalogue.

Hell, for a lot of shows, Netflix could fund one crossover episode that ends like a half dozen series at once, starring the cheapest actors from each series."
Four Seasons in Havana,He kept refreshing until he got through! He knew the people needed this information!
Four Seasons in Havana,Reddit was down?
Four Seasons in Havana,Yeah was great to see Darcy Carden get a main role and always good to see Abbi Jacobson
Four Seasons in Havana,"I was the opposite. Went in with high hopes, but it was mostly boring and didn't have the comedy of the movie. Never finished it."
Four Seasons in Havana,"Not to disagree with anything you've said but to add some more context, A League of Their Own was based off a documentary by Kelly Candaele the son of Helen Callaghan who played in the AAGPBL with her sister Marge Callaghan."
Four Seasons in Havana,"Yeah, the truth is all the lesbian stuff is reclaiming the true of the real life story... it seems like they changed the movie to add a bunch of lesbian content, but really they fix the fact that the movie whitewashed all of that out to make it more appealing to a 90s mainstream audience. 
       
That being said, the part where the manager leaves and they manage the team themselves (for a long time, not just a little at the end)...  That just felt silly and broke my immersion.  I could practically hear the writers insisting that anything that distract attention away from the female characters be removed, whether it made sense or not (and based on reading this https://thecinemaholic.com/casey-dove-porter/ , that sounds like an accurate guess)"
Four Seasons in Havana,I think the issue I had with the show was it had next to nothing to do with baseball. I'm not a huge sports person but they really really dropped the ball with the show having next to nothing to do with baseball or training or them achieving. I also think the characters felt very modern so found the time period unbelievable. So it had this strange modern women playing dress up talking about modern issues through a modern lens and had to compete with shows like mad men and marvelous miss masle that nailed the time period.
Four Seasons in Havana,"They truly were, in a league of their own."
Four Seasons in Havana,It’s nice to see Rosie in a nod to the limitations of what her character was allowed to be in the original film. It’s great that her analog in the show gets to be a more fully realized version
Four Seasons in Havana,Thank you for saying what I was too tired to write.
Four Seasons in Havana,"Makes absolute sense, but for me (I’m straight), I just lost interest when I realised how much focus there was going to be. I loved the film but lost interest in the show. I wasn’t angry with it or anything, just an increasing sense of “Oh, so this wasn’t really made for me, was it?” And it’s fine, sometimes I’m not the intended audience and that’s okay. But I won’t be the only one, and I do think it’ll have hit the audience numbers, and might have continued longer otherwise. Maybe it’s still worth it for the people it was actually made for. Like I said, it wasn’t made for me."
Four Seasons in Havana,I've never heard anyone call this their favorite show before.
Four Seasons in Havana,My wife and i really loved the show. And looked forward to each episode
Four Seasons in Havana,It looks so bad and is really distracting. Not saying the actors need to throw 95 mph heaters but you'd think they could throw a ball and have it look decent.
Four Seasons in Havana,"I completely forgot until reading this comment how horrible it was.    
      
I watched the first episode with some people who weren't very into sports, and they didn't understand why I couldn't stop myself from breaking out laughing half the time they threw the ball."
Four Seasons in Havana,"This is so interesting to read because I didn't notice it at all. But I was there for the lesbians, not the sport so eh"
Four Seasons in Havana,"No no, it’s poorly paced, sadly it was mediocre"
Four Seasons in Havana,You aren’t missing anything
Four Seasons in Havana,"Nah, Netflix took on the Curse of Blockbuster when they slayed it and usurped it's lands and titles.

Kind of ironic, considering who cast the damn thing. Let's hope it's a closed loop."
Four Seasons in Havana,I had no idea it went on for 12 years. The movie made it seem like it was a season or two max. That's crazy.
Four Seasons in Havana,you can always read the book.
Four Seasons in Havana,"It’s actually one of my favorite sports movies, even if there’s a ton of topical, timely humor in it:

(the league may be shutting down and they’re in the locker room brainstorming how to keep it going)

Madonna: ‘What if, at a key point in the game, I went for a fly ball and oops, my bosoms popped out?’

Rosie O’Donnell: ‘Do you think at this point in time anybody that wants to see your bosoms hasn’t already seen them?’

(Madonna had just released an extremely racy coffee table book where her breasts were on full display)

But it’s a solid story, well acted, and cliche in the ways that any good sports movie should be cliche."
Four Seasons in Havana,It's a shame because the trailer was really good. But the actual show was missing the humour of the film.
Four Seasons in Havana,"Agree. I’ve been a fan of the movie since I was a kid. I’m a huge fan of Abbi Jacobsen and I was so proud to have this in her hands. And it was filmed in my city! I even traveled to see the Peaches bus.

Then I watched one or two episodes when it was released, and I haven’t revisited the series.

I’ll get to the rest of it eventually but something definitely felt off to me. Someone here mentioned the lack of scrappiness. That feels accurate."
Four Seasons in Havana,"I was the same. It didn’t have the feel of the movie and it felt forced in so many ways. Rivalries were lame, friendships were weird, and everyone just copped independent attitudes that I just couldn’t relate to."
Four Seasons in Havana,"Your mitt looks like Babe Ruth's ball glove from the dirty '30s, if 20 more dudes spat chewing tobacco in it."
Four Seasons in Havana,Doesn't she have another show too? I felt like I read that somewhere.
Four Seasons in Havana,"It used to be pretty common for sitcoms, at least through the 70s and 80s.

The show would end, often abruptly, and then 2-3 years later a 90 minute ""movie"" would be released on some random Saturday night in the summer.

Some shows (like the Brady Bunch and The Waltons) would up having a ton of them."
Four Seasons in Havana,They are too busy pissing it away on Rings of Power and Citadel.
Four Seasons in Havana,"At least they're actually giving it an ending, unlike the bastards at Netflix who cancelled GLOW."
Four Seasons in Havana,[deleted]
Four Seasons in Havana,It’s in its own kinda category
Four Seasons in Havana,"I don't think I want TV to be without Fargo, Cobra Kai, What We Do in the Shadows, Friday Night Lights, Parenthood, etc.  This show was great too, I'm glad it was made.  They don't need to stop doing remakes any more than they need to stop doing originals even though many originals fail.  Some TV shows work, some don't, of all kinds. It's just how it is."
Four Seasons in Havana,I’ve noticed Apple streaming seems to be the best right now at leaning on interesting premises and star names instead of remakes and spin-offs to get you interested in a show.
Four Seasons in Havana,Severance is one of the best series I have ever seen!  I could not stop watching the last 4 episodes of the season.
Four Seasons in Havana,"Three of Amazon’s most popular TV shows are Rings of Power, Jack Ryan, and Reacher so the movie to TV route can definitely work especially for IP with even deeper roots."
Medici: Masters of Florence,Cracked me up that they had Walder Frey play Robb Stark's father in law. 
Medici: Masters of Florence,"It made me instantly fire up a game of EU4 as Florence, play as Cosimo, and invade Lucca then war with Milan.

I might of taken the wrong lessons from the show."
Medici: Masters of Florence,"It's not Netflix's show, by the way. It aired on Italy's ""Rai"" a while back. Netflix just bought the international distribution rights and slapped on their ""Netflix original"" brand, as per usual."
Medici: Masters of Florence,"I like the costumes, the writing is okay, but my GOD the audio makes me angry. Sometimes the lips were out of sync and they ALWAYS sound like they're talking into a microphone, no matter how far from the camera or position on screen. Usually I can ignore it, but sometimes it's so obvious it hurts. Also inconsistent accents D:"
Medici: Masters of Florence,Watched it and loved it. It was a great show.
Medici: Masters of Florence,Such a nice family in Assassin's Creed 2.
Medici: Masters of Florence,"I've been really enjoying it so far, though I think that you have to have a degree of interest in the historical aspect of it to really get engrossed. The religious aspects of the show are really well done as opposed to something like Game of Thrones where all of the characters are either practically atheist or religious zealots. "
Medici: Masters of Florence,"It's a great show, we're about halfway through the season. I took my girlfriend to Florence a couple of years ago so we're enjoying seeing where they shot the outdoor scenes.
Game of Thrones fans should enjoy seeing a brooding Robb Stark in period wardrobe, and his scene with a fellow GoT actor in an early episode was particularly satisfying."
Medici: Masters of Florence,"Oh my god thank you so much for informing me this exists, renaissance Italy show?? jiiizzz"
Medici: Masters of Florence,"Currently on episode 7, and I love every minute of it. Captivating story with a very great cast. I can watch Robb Stark lead a city all day, after all. Its an even bigger treat if you love Assasins Creed 2 half as much as I do. "
Medici: Masters of Florence,"I am having very hard time not screaming at the Medici family for being so lax. You're a rich and powerful family, yet none of the male leading characters stand up for themselves. Oh you're accusing me of 3 crimes against Florence? Let me sit here and look hurt while I don't say shit. At least the son had a plan of action. Oh my house was broken into, and people are assaulting my family? Guards? Nah.. we'll be fine. The family acts like a cast in a bad horror flick making every bad decision they possibly could think of. Fuck guards, lets go get an army and fight the city we so called love. I am having a hard time swallowing all this. "
Medici: Masters of Florence,"We gave it a try a couple of days ago but weren't at all impressed with the writing or acting in it. It doesn't help we watched a few episodes of The West Wing prior, though, so we might give it another go without that comparison in our minds.

My impression of the show was everyone felt wooden and the writing and plotting of the first episode was incredibly generic. "
Medici: Masters of Florence,"I randomly watched episode 1 today. It's not bad, but definitely a background show for me. I really wasn't impressed with Hoffman either. The accents were a little all over the place."
Medici: Masters of Florence,"I wasn't sure about whether it would 
be cheesy like Tudors but I like it so far "
Medici: Masters of Florence,"I am on episode 6 of the show and I absolutely adore it! It is brilliant!!! Oh my god.
Plus Annabel Scholey is gorgeous. "
Medici: Masters of Florence,Medici masters of plotholes. 
Medici: Masters of Florence,[deleted]
Medici: Masters of Florence,What's it about? It's one of those shows I see that I just skip over. 
Medici: Masters of Florence,Does anyone happen to know the title of the theme song the show opens with?
Medici: Masters of Florence,I loved the series very much! 
Medici: Masters of Florence,I created a subreddit for discussion of the series a few days ago! I'd love to see more discussion there: https://www.reddit.com/r/Medici_Netflix/
Medici: Masters of Florence,Annabel Scholey could play Kate Middleton. She really favors her. 
Medici: Masters of Florence,"I saw DaVinci's demons , and it was an amazing show , all three seasons , I can't understand why they cancelled it. I hoped the Medici on Netflix would be something similar, but I can't even finish the first episode, there is just nothing interesting about the story so far. I will probably try another couple of episodes , but it looks like it will be nothing like that masterpiece - DaVinci's Demons."
Medici: Masters of Florence,"just started it, looks good

recognize alot of actors in it too"
Medici: Masters of Florence,"""Netflix's""

According to Wikipedia, Netflix bought the right to broadcast in a select few countries; It's not one of their originals. Thought I was crazy and it was just a US exclusive for a bit but nope, it's not on their Youtube channel in any form either (because it's definitely not in my face like a bunch of the other Originals it knows that I will love)."
Medici: Masters of Florence,"Walder Frey's character in broadchurch was really interesting. I'm not gonna say more, but it was interesting to watch Broadchurch with that knee-jerk reaction to seeing that character's face."
Medici: Masters of Florence,I took this as an awesome troll at GoT.  I loved it lol.
Medici: Masters of Florence,There is no. way. that was a coincidence. And this time he married for duty instead of love.
Medici: Masters of Florence,"I have now googled EU4 and it is currently downloading to my Steam. I have never played before, but I want to. Many thanks. "
Medici: Masters of Florence,"i think milan invaded lucca historically, not florence. why don't you attack vencie since it's not in the hre and austria hates them?"
Medici: Masters of Florence,Kind of scheming family in DaVinci's Demons.
Medici: Masters of Florence,Medici Masters of Florence was shot everywhere but in Florence. A lot of the locations aren't even in Toscany 
Medici: Masters of Florence,Borgia is so much better. Give that one a go. 
Medici: Masters of Florence,"Yeah I found the dialogue was a bit period-breaking, but the story I found to be quite good."
Medici: Masters of Florence,"I found the first episode a little slow, but the following ones are much better. I agree with the Robb Stark actor though. A little wooden."
Medici: Masters of Florence,"Same here, tried the first episode, and it was just bland and stilted. The cross-cut editing of the opening sequence, with the father's death by poison and the funeral at the same time _and_ super-pumped-up action music, was ludicruous."
Medici: Masters of Florence,Are you talking about Contessina and Piero? Piero looks like he could be a teenager so if she is 35 then it's not that unrealistic. Although the age difference between Cosimo and his parents seems a lot bigger than Piero and his parents so yeah I guess it's a bit inconsistent.
Medici: Masters of Florence,The Medici family were the inventors of modern bookkeeping/banking and were the bankers to the Pope I believe. 
Medici: Masters of Florence,About the Medici family who rose to prominence in the early Italian Renaissance. Managing the family business and maintaining a political stranglehold on Florence becomes the central theme.
Medici: Masters of Florence,"[""Renaissance"" by Paolo Buonvino & Skin](https://www.youtube.com/shared?ci=BkWJspeEKy8) "
Medici: Masters of Florence,1 month later. How are you enjoying the game?
Medici: Masters of Florence,r/paradoxplaza
Medici: Masters of Florence,Cause if you can attack Lucca with out allies it's an easy target in your state and also culture. Venice requires getting more allies. Otoh buddy up to Austria and maybe...
Medici: Masters of Florence,"Kind of scheming in real life, iirc."
Medici: Masters of Florence,That show was just too much after the 2nd season?
Medici: Masters of Florence,I wish I hadn't watched Borgia twice alreadrr
Medici: Masters of Florence,The one with Jeremy Irons?
Medici: Masters of Florence,"Yeah, fuck those guys for not sticking to the 16th century Florentine dialect and Medieval Latin."
Medici: Masters of Florence,"I thought it was pretty good, but the dialogue was off, and the pacing of it was just all over the place. In that since it was a little sloppy."
Medici: Masters of Florence,"
Cosimo's father came up from nothing. He's have probbaly waited until he had a decent amount of capital before marrying. Cosimo would have married much younger since he already had the status and wealth. Plus, his father's political ambitions.  "
Medici: Masters of Florence,"Ah. On a scale of binge to occasionaly, what do you rate it?"
Medici: Masters of Florence,Plus they hung out with Ezio from Assassin's Creed
Medici: Masters of Florence,"There were also, like, three or four Medici popes. So... 4/266... "
Medici: Masters of Florence,well that sounds pretty boring...
Medici: Masters of Florence,"Any mention of Machiavelli? I never heard of this series, I'll put it on my watch list for sure. Thanks for the tip."
Medici: Masters of Florence,[deleted]
Medici: Masters of Florence,"That one was good, but I liked the one with John Doman a bit better. "
Medici: Masters of Florence,I would watch that show.
Medici: Masters of Florence,"Haha, I suppose period-breaking was the wrong term. More like immersion-breaking. Saying things like ""See you later"" that I feel is much more contemporary."
Medici: Masters of Florence,"[deleted]

Medici: Masters of Florence,"Total binger for me. Had finished all 8 eps within a day of me starting it.

Great characters and actors, incredible sets and wardrobe, very good stuff overall..though I find the choice of Dustin Hoffman to be a bit strange and out of place.  I actually think he's doing a good job, but. His look and voice just don't seem to fit in 100% for whatever reason.


Oh, and Robb stark sure does know how put his brooding face on.  "
Medici: Masters of Florence,"I haven't watched it yet, but my gf watched the first four episodes yesterday and loved it so far."
Medici: Masters of Florence,Takes place before Niccolo Machiavelli was born.
Medici: Masters of Florence,"i heard that's going to be in the second season
"
Medici: Masters of Florence,"I did and I enjoyed it, was lame how they couldnt finish"
Medici: Masters of Florence,In a heartbeat.
Medici: Masters of Florence,"I know, I was just busting your balls (as I suspect you divined).

I think stuff like that is just the price we pay post-*Deadwood*. That little exercise in deliberate vernacular anachronism reminded us that it worked so damn well in *I, Claudius*, and people started thinking it was just the way to go.

The problem is that it takes a relatively skillful writer to walk that line, and even the ones that can do it well aren't on the ball all the time..."
Medici: Masters of Florence,"i agree, hoffman was miscast and the worst part of the production. he doesn't fit with the rest of the cast."
Medici: Masters of Florence,"Absolutely agree about Dustin Hoffman. He like, didn't even try an accent, so every time I heard him talk it just completely pulled me out of immersion."
Medici: Masters of Florence,"Loved it! The cast is great, the visuals are good... I enjoyed S2’s storylines more than S1’s. "
Medici: Masters of Florence,When is Netflix getting the latest season 
Medici: Masters of Florence,[deleted]
Medici: Masters of Florence,"Yeah I have just seen season 2 and almost the entire cast is new. It's definitely very fun show to watch if you like history. However, I personally found the storyline and character development quit 1-dimensional"
Medici: Masters of Florence,Wow I thought it was just a one off since the ending of season 1 seemed conclusive. Pleasantly surprised that there's a second season. Thanks for this post!
Medici: Masters of Florence,it’s good but is there supposed to be season two or they canceled it?
Medici: Masters of Florence,Should be sometime 2019 internationally. Out in Italy though. Go figure right. 😂 Bene. 
Medici: Masters of Florence,"Kinda, yeah.

Luckily he's not in it much."
Medici: Masters of Florence,"Season 2 and 3 are 20 years after season 1 and focus on Cosimo's grandson, Lorenzo the Magnificent.  Season 3 is filming now (with Daniel Sharman back as Lorenzo).  Richard Madden was an executive producer for season 2 and Frank Spotnitz said if they get a season 4 the main character will be Catherine De Medici.  "
Medici: Masters of Florence,It's out in Italy. It will be out internationally in early 2019.
Medici: Masters of Florence,I actually found his scenes to be the most powerful ones. If you ask me he did a great job.
Medici: Masters of Florence,nice good one thanks 
Medici: Masters of Florence,My issue wasn't his acting it was more he always took me out of the time period. He was a bit too recognizable and I mainly know him in more modern movies so that was probably the big issue. He was not someone who blended well like a lot of the other cast.
Medici: Masters of Florence,"True I can see your point on that one. I’m glad he wasn’t in it for long just flashbacks and lessons. I think it worked perfectly to at least get the moral of his words across. I was surprised Dustin Hoffman was even in it as well, to be honest. Either way. Great series, I hope season two is just as good (:"
Medici: Masters of Florence,"I liked it. Better than The Borgias and Da Vinci's demons, in the same genre and era. I thought the flashbacks were a bit too present though, I understand why they were needed but it didn't help the pacing of the episodes."
Medici: Masters of Florence,I appreciate the recommendation. I'll watch it now. Thank you!
Medici: Masters of Florence,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/5i52ge/netflixs_medici_masters_of_florence/
Medici: Masters of Florence,"Yeah, saw it. Pretty good, but also had issues with the pacing."
Medici: Masters of Florence,Got this on my watch list. Probably gonna see it early next year. Overall is it worth it? I'm looking for something closer to Rome and not The Tudors in terms of tone and storytelling
Medici: Masters of Florence,"My boyfriend and I haven't been watching it together. We really love it. We have one more episode left in the season. 

I really love all the characters and the plots within plots - it keeps things interesting. I am looking forward to next season. "
Medici: Masters of Florence,"It's like a 6/10 show IMO. Decent watch, but I personally wouldn't put it at the top of my 'to watch' list if I were you.

For me at least, one of the more distracting bits was the inconsistent accents/pronunciation - e.g. Dustin Hoffman doesn't really speak with an accent, but then both of his sons have an English accent, but then his son's son has an Italian accent."
Medici: Masters of Florence,Spoilers: Sean Bean will die (as usual!) 
Medici: Masters of Florence,Oh I was wondering when that was coming back. Neat 
Medici: Masters of Florence,Ooh awesome! I thought it had been cancelled.
Medici: Masters of Florence,Yeah can't wait! Been checking for any kind of news ever since season 1 ended! 
Medici: Masters of Florence,"So I'm watching the first episode right now and wanted to come onto reddit to see if anyone had any thoughts on it

But I completely agree. I'm very underwhelmed overall."
Medici: Masters of Florence,"I haven't watched it, but fun fact, my husband and I were walking by The Duomo in Florence exactly a year ago when they were filming scenes!!!"
Medici: Masters of Florence,"hey, good to see at least one other person who is giving it a chance, I ended up watching the whole series and unfortunately it just doesn't get any better

don't really understand the 8.1 IMDB rating tbh ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯"
Medici: Masters of Florence,"Yeah, thanks for taking that bullet for me - I will now stop after this episode

That's too bad

I like Richard Madden and obviously Hoffman is talented - but this just isn't working."
Medici: Masters of Florence,[deleted]
Medici: Masters of Florence,"Many/most of them are worth watching. But not every viewer will enjoy every bit of content they churn out. For instance, The Get Down and Hip Hop Evolution was something I was super psyched about. Would someone that is not into hip hop enjoy those? Probably not!"
Captive,"One of the greatest villains of all time. That charming smile and demeanor makes him so hard to hate, even though you morally should. Brilliant character and actor!

Need to see more of Tony Dalton!"
Captive,Tell me again.
Captive,"My favorite thing about him is that he’s not afraid to go into the details of an operation if he needs to. Someone tries to BS him saying “oh we can’t do X because of Y.”  

His response is like “Show me, let’s go!” 

It’s refreshing to see a boss cut through the nonsense and know when he needs to deal with the pawns and when he needs to see the rest of the board. 

Obviously his charisma too. Too bad he’s a murderer. Oh well. 

Still deserved much better ending than he received. So many contrivances in his last minutes of screen time. Again, oh well."
Captive,It’s time for another Zorro movie with him at the helm.
Captive,"In addition to Dalton's performance, Lalo is the only antagonist in the Gilligan-verse that is personable and charismatic. Like if you came across him and weren't in the game/he had no reason to kill you you could have a genuine conversation with him. That doesn't apply for the rest of the Salamancas or Gus/his organization. Even when you see Gus talk to civilians he still comes off as an uptight weirdo.

The only other villains I can think of who had any sort of affability to them were the Meth Nazis, and 1) they weren't around long 2) they weren't ""charismatic."""
Captive,"I bet everyone here thought ""tell me again"" in their head as soon as they saw his name. Such a charismatic character."
Captive,"Him interacting with Werner's window was fucking captivating. The two forces of my absolute fear of knowing what he would unquestionably do if cornered, and my need to not put her through more suffering were played against each other so brilliantly. 

Amazing that two smaller characters (in the context of the full series) could have long sequences together and be so tense is a testimony to the command this series had over audiences. God damn I'm sad it's over."
Captive,"I haven't made it to *BCS* yet, but TD was fun in *Hawkeye*."
Captive,His leap onto the overturned car is one of my favorite things.
Captive,"Any villian that is out of the usual cliche tropes will be good. Lalo Salamanca was captivating because of just that.

You don't expect such a villian."
Captive,That actor is captivating in everything. Loved him in the Hawkeye series.
Captive,Because he's charming but incredibly dangerous.
Captive,The 'stache.
Captive,He is excellent
Captive,"Don't get me wrong, his performance is amazing, but some people are way too into this dude. There is this BCS advertisement short that is him ""making"" a taco, I believe as Lalo. He literally just puts premade taco fixings in a tortilla. Doesn't cook the Asada, mix the salsa, nothing... and the comments on the video are all ""OMFG CAN COOK TOO, SO DREAMY"".

People are strange."
Captive,Infernal!!
Captive,"I noticed in season 5 he has eyes that look like a bird of prey. Seriously, watch his eyes and how he looks at people. He looks like a predator stalking prey."
Captive,It was like watching a  rattlesnake
Captive,I think he would be a great gomez addams
Captive,Kinda reminds be of the wires characters in a way..
Captive,https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=OZwbCsONsSE
Captive,His ending was super anticlimactic and felt very out of place. Maybe the one miss the writers had in the last season.
Captive,He basically played him in Hawkeye
Captive,Be nice...
Captive,I here the words he says when he first meets Kim and comments about is impressed Saul landed her. I can't even type them out but I can totally hear his not bad tone.
Captive,"He was sort of wasted there, I thought. They could have done so much more with him."
Captive,"Tbf, ZT was also good in that show."
Captive,Jack could have been such an annoying character with the wrong actor.
Captive,"I haven’t made it to Scarface yet, but Al Pacino was fun in Jack and Jill."
Captive,pretty sure that video was supposed to be a joke
Captive,"Right. Wherever he goes, the people Lalo speaks too can feel they're in the company of a tiger. Lalo's interrogation at Saul & Kim's is a perfect example of this."
Captive,Cara mia!
Captive,"Eh, the ending was fine IMO. It was clear to me that it was going to end with Gus killing him, since that was the only real way to end that arc. I liked that he died while being a badass like always. His only mistake was letting Gus distract him by playing along with his home video."
Captive,"Yeah it was clear they didn't know what to do with him so they just said fuck it. Oh well, can't have everything."
Captive,"I actually felt the same. Obviously he had to die, but it definitely felt like they didn’t know quite how to end it all"
Captive,"Before watching I saw the screenshot of him dying but edited to be in black and white. I thought I'd seen a spoiler for him dying in the Gene timeline and was so sure that he would be doing stuff in the present day. 

While it no doubt would have been terrible and created big plot holes for his absence in BB, I was disappointed that they killed him before we got to the BB or Gene era."
Captive,I wish he has more screentime. Episode 1 and 2 were so good but it felt like every subsequent episode caused them to get progressively more off the rails.
Captive,They still can
Captive,They had another video with Mike making a pimento sandwich. It was just fluff to keep engagement.
Captive,"His over confidence killed him, it was a pity we knew it couldn't end any other way, had BCS come before breaking bad I wouldn't have know at all where it was going. 

Really great villain, love that he died how he lived, with a smile on his face."
Captive,"I mean, he's basically a swordplay-enthusiast who used to be with Kate's mom. If there's as Hawkeye season 2 and they include him and the LARPers, they're really out of ideas imo."
Captive,"From the first moment we meet him, when he's making food for Nacho, I loved him, but he felt like a bit of a goof most of the time. And then came the attack on his estate, and I was like ""Fuck, this is why everyone's afraid of him, isn't it..."""
Captive,"It was probably the one of the only instances in the show where something happens to him not on his terms.

Everything else, he kinda gets to be the driving force in. Even his arrest where he's weighing up whether to shoot them, he's the one making that choice."
Captive,Well on the bright side I’m learning that I can target shows for cancellation by starting them and never finishing them. I’m coming for you Cocomelon
Captive,[removed]
Captive,Breaking Bad probably wouldn't have survived.
Captive,"I think the issue, at least for me, is that there’s not many shows like this out there. Sure theres Dark, which was good. But I personally like this genre and when Netflix comes out with these types of shows I’m excited. Instead they focus on more basic shows that require no thought put into the plot, so that everyone can follow along. When people have to go out of their way to figure something out about the show, then it just isn’t worth it."
Captive,Viewers are getting punished by Netflix for watching the new Netflix shows. Not a great idea. I have literally stopped watching new Netflix originals until I know the series is confirmed to have a conclusion. I’ve been burned too many times.
Captive,Maybe I’m in the minority but I actually liked 1899
Captive,"It’s too bad that this cancellation is getting celebrated as much as mourned.

Netflix allows projects to have inflated budgets but then hold shows to unrealistic standards. 1899 was the most expensive German series ever, an estimated $63 million for the first season. That’s a high budget for a cerebral science fiction/period piece with multiple languages. 

I’m very curious to what the viewership/completion of Dark, whose first seasons budget was $21 million. 

No doubt if 1899 was in the $20-30 million range that we’d be getting 3 seasons."
Captive,"I posted this the other day on a similar thread: 1899 would have succeeded had it been released weekly rather than in one go. 

Like Lost - who’s creators say would fail on Netflix - 1899 needs time for viewers socialise the show, have conversations with colleagues, light up the sub Reddit on theories etc

While full series binge watching has been great for mindless viewing, it doesn’t work for shows that need reflection and contemplation"
Captive,"I watched 1899 and went from initially intrigued to somewhat hooked, to somewhat annoyed, to ""this doesn't make any sense"" and finally appreciative of the ending, but I could see how some people never made it all the way through."
Captive,"They look at three things primarily:
1. Cost of production, this one was high.
2. Viewership, this one was high, they marketed it a lot and paid for big names so not shocking
3. Decline in viewership per episode, where this one stumbled. People who started it mostly didn’t finish it - sure the market probably brought in some mismatched audience, but that decline means that most people who tried it didn’t like it that much. By the end of the season it was looking far less popular which made it difficult to justify cost wise.

Personally the ending viewership was still decent and I suspect the decline is steeper among heavily marketed shows like this, and I think Netflix should pay for more series finales so series in the library retain more value as ‘complete’, but I kind of get it."
Captive,i will never start a netflix show when it is new. i wait till all seasons are there and start then.
Captive,I loved this show. One of the best that has came out recently. I dig shows like this. Very disappointed with the cancelation.
Captive,"I didn't hate it, but it didn't captivate me."
Captive,"> If Netflix does want people to finish their series in less than one month, they would be wise to space up big releases to give the audience time to consume multiple original productions. Unfortunately for 1899, the series didn’t even have a full week before the release of Wednesday. 1899 came out on November 17, while Wednesday followed on November 23. 

I know a few people who said thinks like “I don’t have the mental energy to watch something like 1899 while I’m trying to deal with the holidays.” or just weren’t watching as much in general because of being crazy busy with holidays and end of the year stuff. 

Wednesday was easy to watch while wrapping gifts or folding laundry and doing something else that has to get done. 1899 required *full attention* given that it was a complex show that also included subtitles! 

Netflix definitely set it up to fail if it was measuring against those metrics."
Captive,Reddit is such an echo chamber it’s hilarious. It’s baffling that people can’t comprehend that a show they liked did not do that well lol
Captive,"It might not even be about what gets cancelled, more like what doesn’t get cancelled….. some really terrible shows that continue to get green lit"
Captive,"Viewership metrics mean fucking nothing.

Completion rates are what matters.

You don't renew a show that no one bothered finishing.

Just as it was in the last hundred fucking million threads with this exact same uninformed shit take, just as it will be in the next hundred million."
Captive,"From Wikipedia:

“The budget for the series was at least €60 million ($62.2 million) with €2 million coming from Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg,[7] €10 million coming from the German Motion Picture Fund,[8] and Netflix investing €48 million in the project. 1899 is the most expensive German television series of all time.[9]” 

Can we please try and crowdsource season two? Lol anyone have 62mil?"
Captive,Loved this show gutted it’s finished
Captive,"30% retention rate.

That’s an issue more advertising or more viewers won’t fix"
Captive,Netflix treats their originals like YouTube videos: just push out as many as possible hoping a couple go “viral”. If you’re not the next Stranger Things then you’re fucked
Captive,"We Mean It This Time, This Is The Final Straw For Netflix

--/r/television, again"
Captive,"I started this show and paused after ep 1 with the intention of coming back to it because it was so complicated I wanted to actually have time to pay attention. 

I guess Netflix thinks the show is a failure if a lot of people do that?"
Captive,Apple TV is King. Netflix is worst. Everything else is somewhere in between.
Captive," All the shows I found and were subsequently killed by Netflix in 2022

1899. Warrior nun. Midnight club.  The imperfects. Blockbuster. Space force. Archive 81. Another life. 

I have literally just cancelled my subscription."
Captive,Collider has become such a terrible platform. Sad how shitty its become. Just an awful aggregate machine with 0 soul or personality.
Captive,"Reddit will never learn that they're in a bubble. The show didn't fare well with the majority of the users, it had a 30% completion rate, it was super expensive to make and it just wasn't that popular."
Captive,How many people started it and dropped it when they realised it was a multi language show?
Captive,"I never watched it, but now I’m really considering ending my subscription. My 12 year old subscription. Not because Netflix can’t create quality content… I know they can. But they also fail to understand that I might have watched 1899, but put it off for the very fact that they’re a streaming service. I don’t watch stuff right when it comes out. I watch it when I want too."
Captive,"Is it worth watching the first season, even though there won’t be a second season?"
Captive,1899 seems to be getting a lot more media attention for its cancellation then all the other shows that have been cancelled from streaming platforms in recent years. I wonder why.
Captive,[deleted]
Captive,"I’ve truly never been this upset with a cancellation of a show. I’ve been constantly begging my friends, family and coworkers to check this out and now I feel like a fool.

This is the first show I’ve ever advocated for in this way. Sure I’ve recommended other shows and films but this one is on a different level.

The best show of 2022 in my opinion and that’s tough to say because a lot of great shows came out last year. 

Truly a shame"
Captive,"The writer of this article hit the nail on the head. The decision makers are actively running this company into the ground.

Forget subscription fees and password sharing… if this company can’t even keep its own successful shows funded, what is the point of watching another original? 

Quality is the only thing this company has going for it and clearly that aspect has slipped away"
Captive,"I almost feel like 1899 was used as a sacrificial lamb for more viewers. Up until it was cancelled I did not see or hear anything about it, it was completely off my radar. Now that it's been cancelled there's news articles everywhere. They're getting loads of free advertising all of a sudden."
Captive,"Did you read the article Reed Hastings & Ted Sarandos??  

We, your customers are getting sick of your start/stop crap on quality shows.  Want to know why you lost so much money in 2022, it’s not from password sharing, it’s lack of quality.  Kill your algorithm or at the very least fix it !  Most people, who work, can’t “binge” a show like a 15 year old without a summer job !"
Captive,"I was on episode 4. I'm not continuing. I have no confidence that the mysteries will have a satisfying pay off in the first season. Saving myself the disappointment. I still miss Raised by Wolves, that one hurt. 

How fast are we supposed to consume these shows? It's kinda crazy how fast they deem a show a failure. Let it find its audience. Word of mouth is a real thing."
Captive,"Too many excellent Netflix shows, particularly genre shows, have been canceled after one season. With the cancelation of 1899 they’ve guaranteed I’ll never risk watching a new show on Netflix. I’d say I canceled them, but the truth is they’ve canceled my willingness to support them. That’s $19.99/month to split between other streamers. 🖕"
Captive,Give these shows a chance dammit. Just had a few people recommend 1899 to me and now I see no point watching something unfinished with only one season.
Captive,Who’s all posting these; y’all really liked 1899? I couldn’t get into it myself
Captive,The show was only okay. The writers thought they were a little smarter than they were.
Captive,"So basically what I should be reading between the lines and loosely at is that there may be a chance of someone else somewhere down the line would and could be interested in picking it up?

Seems there is a demand for it, and everyone involved (save Netflix) is on board to continue so maybe I’m just being hopeful; but it would be nice."
Captive,Damn I wanted to finish this series.
Captive,"The taste clusters just weren’t there, apparently"
Captive,"Seriously WTF Netflix, this show is incredible"
Captive,"I've stopped watching ANY original Netflix series. Because they almost always cancel series early or mid-way, I'm not even wasting a second of my time on anything Netflix produces for series.  This cancellation validated my choice."
Captive,"New New Year resolution:

Do not watch Netflix series! It will be cancelled"
Captive,The only metric I see from Netflix is that only the shows that create trends on Tiktok since day 1 are renewed.
Captive,"I wonder if another network/streamer can pick up future seasons.

Anyway I suspect based on the ending that this show had a big chance of turning into something very unlike the first season (mystery, period piece) and so there might be some apprehension."
Captive,"I mean, how else will they fund “Too Hot to Circle your Cake Brother”?"
Captive,"Speaking as an adult with a full time job and responsibilities, I have a limited amount of discretionary time. Sometimes I intend to watch something but don't have the time immediately. Ya know, something like a heavier workload at work or the holidays pops up and I don't watch a show I think i'd like for a while. Then it gets cancelled before I even gets a chance to see it and now I just don't bother. It's pointless."
Captive,"Fuck this is annoying. I really enjoyed 1899. Great slow burn. Very confusing, just how it should be. Stupid Netflix"
Captive,"It’s like they misread the signal of people watching background noise TV working from home during the pandemic and decided to abandon quality tv. Seeing Warrior Nun getting canceled reminded me that Netflix is no longer investing my subscription into the well-written, diverse stories that prompted me to join 10 years ago so I canceled"
Captive,Netflix ducking sucks. What a n incredibly stupid decision. I hope prime or Apple picks it up
Captive,"“I am upset by a cancellation of a show I liked”

Brigade of Redditors: “actually here is why you are wrong and praise be to Netflix”"
Captive,"There was no surprise, that show was boring."
Captive,"Fuck you Netflix, I was really enjoying this.

As usual, they're pandering to the brain-dead simpletons and continuing the basic, predictable nonsense. God forbid you should have to use your noggin' once in a while."
White Rabbit Project,Dying suddenly at 49 is so fucking awful for his friends and family. Also scary as fuck.
White Rabbit Project,49 is a fucking terrible time to go.
White Rabbit Project,[deleted]
White Rabbit Project,"He gave us Geoff the Robot for Craig Ferguson. That alone makes him a legend.

This is really sad."
White Rabbit Project,"Of all the celebrity deaths ive heard of in the last while this one is so unexpected it's hitting me the hardest.  Mythbusters was a daily thing for me at certain points in my life and he was always such a positive likeable bright spot on the show, and funny.  My heart goes out to those close to him."
White Rabbit Project,I dont like today.
White Rabbit Project,[deleted]
White Rabbit Project,this one really hits me hard. grew up with mythbusters.. loved that group. grant seemed like such a genuinely good person. gone way too young. rest in power
White Rabbit Project,"Oh, that is terrible. I always loved Grant on Mythbusters. Such a smart guy."
White Rabbit Project,God no! This guy was there through my teens and was such a fixture for me. I cannot process this right now.
White Rabbit Project,Yo what the fuck.
White Rabbit Project,He had recently worked on the team that developed the flying animatronics premiering at Disney's avengers world. This is terrible he was still helping his field. I'm so sad for his family.
White Rabbit Project,"I reject your reality and substitute my own. 

He retired to an island lair with unlimited tech."
White Rabbit Project,"no no no oh my god.

Such a smart thoughtful person.

He will be missed. Rest in peace"
White Rabbit Project,I literally gasped at this. This is terrible.
White Rabbit Project,"Really sad news another person gone too soon from this world.

Edit: Allegedly from an aneurysm?"
White Rabbit Project,"No, dude was still young. As an Asian American, he and George Takei were basically the two role models I had growing up. I gotta thank him for helping me love learning."
White Rabbit Project,This is fucking heartbreaking.
White Rabbit Project,This is absolutely devastating. I'm sure I was one of many who grew up watching Grant on Mythbusters. 49 is too young to go. Fuck.
White Rabbit Project,Nooooooooo as an Asian american he was one of the few people in television I could identify with and idolize :( He was so awesome
White Rabbit Project,A sobering reminder that you never know when your time is up.
White Rabbit Project,"Whoa what! Kelly dying was sad enough and sudden I didn't even realize she had cancer for two years. But Grant dying at only 49 of a sudden brain aneurysm too. What is going on? Don't even tell me who the next one is gonna be because it's probably going to also be a huge shock and someone young.

RIP Grant. You seemed like a cool guy and I enjoyed watching you on Mythbusters. Feel sad for his family and friends.

Edited to add Naya from Glee also died and was confirmed found dead just today or yesterday at 33."
White Rabbit Project,"He didn't look 49, I'd have guess mid 30's."
White Rabbit Project,Noooo!  Grant was an inspiration to all makers of the world.  He was too young D:
White Rabbit Project,"Fuck aneurysms. You can do everything exactly right in your life and an aneurysm can come around and end it just like that.  

I had an aneurysm rupture in March, luckily it was in my spleen and not my head, but I definitely thought it was over. I had about 5 seconds from the time I felt the pain to the time I lost consciousness. Scariest thing ever."
White Rabbit Project,Died by brain aneurysm. That's one of the scariest ways to go.
White Rabbit Project,Aw fuck me. I met him about 5 years ago at a robotics competition. Only celebrity I ever met. Took a pic and got an autograph. Very cool dude  this fucking sucks
White Rabbit Project,"This is the first celebrity death in a while that's really made me upset. 
I grew up watching MythBusters and I really looked up to Grant. He was so intelligent and entertaining. 

The world is a lot bleaker without Grant Imahara."
White Rabbit Project,"Myth: Grant Imahara was a great man, beloved by all who knew of him.


Myth confirmed. Goddamnit 2020, why must you do this?"
White Rabbit Project,"I idolize Grant Imahara. I was attending an event and it just so happened that Grant was at the same event. I sat around for 30 minutes pondering to myself on whether or not I should go up to him and introduce myself. My girlfriend at the time finally convinced me to go up to him. I finally got the courage and had a few things planned to tell him.

1. As an asian american in the science/engineering field, he was a huge role model to me.
2. I absolutely adored his segments in particular on mythbusters. (I mean he made bad ass robots!)

There is a lull and he is just waiting around so I go up to him and say hi I'm Sean! Can i get a picture? He replied ""Of course! I'm Grant."" And I just say ""I know""... I was so embarrassed I didn't know what else to say so i left awkwardly and ashamed. He was so cool about it and at least I got an awesome picture from it. RIP

White Rabbit Project,2020 really needs to fuck off at this point.
White Rabbit Project,"When I saw Mythbusters trending on Twitter this is not what I expected. Well I’m fucking gutted, goodnight everyone"
White Rabbit Project,">Imahara died suddenly following a brain aneurysm

Oh no..... this is so sad and can happen at any time to almost anyone. Life isn't fair. FUCK"
White Rabbit Project,"Man, Mythbusters was a huge contributing factor for me in my interest for science during my childhood. RIP Grant."
White Rabbit Project,"He also made Geoff Peterson, the greatest late-night talk show sidekick robot ever. Terribly sad news."
White Rabbit Project,Today truly gets more tragic by the minute. First Naya now Grant. Both had such importance to me during my most developmental years. RIP Grant. Your enthusiasm for science and for learning was an inspiration to everyone.
White Rabbit Project,What the fuck. I just saw on Facebook. I saw him in person at the filming of Battlebots he was signing a bunch of stuff and taking pictures with kids and even older nerds like me. He seemed so genuinely happy just to be a part of it and to be doing what he loved. This is a shock.
White Rabbit Project,horrible news. what the fuck?
White Rabbit Project,"I actually have a dumb story about him. Around seven years ago (or so), I was at Dragoncon with my wife (now). We met up with some friends and Grant was part of that group. I did my intros like I always did - shook his hand and he told me he was Grant.

We kind of talked as a group for a bit then they had to run to host a panel. Grant was a very nice guy to talk to, very down to earth. As soon as he left, my wife looked at me and said 'did you not realize who he was?' She said this because she knew I was an avid Mythbusters fan and watched the show all the time. 'No...?' I replied.

'Thats Grant Imahara...!' I looked at her for a second and muttered out ""who the hell is that?""

Took me about a full minute to realize how stupid I was to not recognize him, even after he said his name. Nonetheless, he was cool and was a sharp individual our world lost.

Edit: Just looked through old photos. It was 2014 - the same year we dressed as part of a wizard punk cosplay group."
White Rabbit Project,Damn he replied to me in one of his AMAs a few years back. I look up to Grant and him dying to brain aneurysm the same way my grandma did hits hard for me. Fuck brain aneurysms.
White Rabbit Project,"Damn.

RIP."
White Rabbit Project,That's it. I reject 2020's reality and substitute my own.
White Rabbit Project,"My third greatest fear...


Damn, that really sucks. Such a random thing that can happen to anyone at any time"
White Rabbit Project,Fuck fuck fuck. Mythbusters is the show that ignited me to pursue my education and Grant was a huge reason why
White Rabbit Project,This year fucking sucks.
White Rabbit Project,Honestly this is one of the celeb deaths since Robin Williams that hits me the most. Mythbusters was my life as a kid up until college. Fucking hell its so random and unexpected.
White Rabbit Project,Rest In Peace Mr.Grant Imahara.
White Rabbit Project,Is there a study out there that explains why brain aneurysms seem to be so common amongst the Japanese?  I can think of at least 4 or 5 young Japanese celebrities that died the same way.
White Rabbit Project,Don't think I've been this upset by a celebrity passing away since robin williams. I loved watching him on myth busters.
White Rabbit Project,I had one in 2018 when I was 38. I’m lucky to be alive. I thought a stray bullet hit me in the heaD. I put my hand on my head to see if there was blood from the bullet. I had 3 titanium coils put in the stop the hemorrhage. It was the worst pain I ever experienced. I have no impairment at all. I am so lucky. I truly feel for his family. It’s one of those things where you are completely fine and in 30 seconds on the floor close to death
White Rabbit Project,"I am...irrationally upset about this.

I worked with him a few times when I attended SJSU and Stanford, and was a Mythbusters and BattleBots fan long before...he read and reviewed my paper for free. He was just so fucking kind and wanted to inspire passion in STEM. Life’s not fair, but this feels like an extra-cruel swipe.

And as someone who had a hemorrhagic stroke at 27 — just...*no*."
White Rabbit Project, I can't believe he passed at a young age of 49.  This one hurts. I loved him on Mythbusters and his sense of passion elsewhere. RIP
White Rabbit Project,It says he died of a brain aneurysm. That's so scary. Rest in peace a massive part of so many peoples childhoods.
White Rabbit Project,Grant Imahara was one of my favorite mythbusters. I also saw him at a few of the robotic competitions over the years. As i recall he always did decently well.
White Rabbit Project,I obviously didn’t know him personally but he seemed like a really cheerful and smart dude. I loved watching him on the show. What a terrible thing to happen.
White Rabbit Project,"This is maybe the first ""celebrity death"" I've ever had a visceral reaction to: A brief moment of literal panic. Just the worst combination of an unexpected thing happening to a really cool, genuine person. Awful."
White Rabbit Project,"I knew Grant socially for about a year. Absolutely one of the nicest people I’ve ever met. Can’t get my head around the fact that he’s dead, tbh."
White Rabbit Project,This sucks. I grew up watching MythBusters. Used to watch it everyday after elementary through high school
White Rabbit Project,"As an Asian kid, seeing someone that looked like me do cool science stuff on TV was awesome. Grant was one of the people that really inspired me to go to engineering school. He will be missed."
White Rabbit Project,"This one really hurt. He was one of the only people on TV I truly thought was the coolest as a teen. I was able to meet him in 2014, he had a huge talk on stage at a Con. I being starstruck and introverted, shyly took a picture with him awkwardly and didn't even make eye contact while I shook his hand. Still he was so warm and welcoming, I barely mumbled a hello, but I had so much to say. In the photo his smile was so bright. I felt like I fumbled meeting a hero, and I hated the photo because I had a huge breakout on my face, so I hid it.

I promised that if I ever got to meet him again, I'd redeem my awkward ass. I'll cherish this photo forever. I wish all his friends and family the best, he will be missed by many..."
White Rabbit Project,"Holy fuck. Grant Imahara made me the person I am today. I'm a VFX artist and amateur programmer, and Grant's interest in tech is the reason for that. No celebrity death this year hit like this. Thank you Grant for 49 years of you, may you rest in peace."
White Rabbit Project,"Fucking hell, he wasn't even 50..."
White Rabbit Project,Jesus. This is unbelievably sad.
White Rabbit Project,"Absolutely heartbreaking. His work at ILM was crucial, especially to the Prequels. [Here](https://makezine.com/2014/06/03/imahara/) is a nice article where he talks about the Robots he built"
White Rabbit Project,Brain aneurysm. Fuck. Can't even fight that shit. That's horrible.
White Rabbit Project,This is so shocking. How heartbreaking! I had such a crush on him when I was younger from Mythbusters.
White Rabbit Project,"No 😢

omg the man was awesome and all his robot stuff.. ugh

RIP Grant ❤️"
White Rabbit Project,"What the fuck, man

49 is still too young. My dad turns 49 tomorrow. :("
White Rabbit Project,"This is so upsetting. He was hilarious and to me was the leader of the 3 other mythbusters.

We lost a great one today."
White Rabbit Project,"This one hits me the hardest. An Asian American starwars fan and host of myth buster. Doesn’t get any more awesome then that. This is so unfair. Rip, felt sad for his fiancé . She was still posting about social unjust on ig 6 hours ago."
White Rabbit Project,"Jamie and Adam were great entertainment, but Grant was the Mythbuster you wanted to be.

Hugely inspirational person that will be sorely missed in the competitive robotics world."
White Rabbit Project,What?!??? I always thought that guy was like a god of the geeks. Always looked up to him in terms of all the cool shit he did.
White Rabbit Project,"The sudden finality of dying from a brain aneurysm has always terrified me.

RIP Grant"
White Rabbit Project,Im 25 and Im still too young to see people I watched on TV die
White Rabbit Project,"Fuck you 2020, you massive cunt of a year."
White Rabbit Project,"Jesus fuck. I was just watching him a few hours ago during dinner. The ""will a bird landing on the hood of a car teetering on a cliff cause it to fall down"" myth. Just sucks."
White Rabbit Project,Met him when he came to Phoenix for Star Trek Continues. My kids were like 6 and 8 at the time and LOVED Mythbusters.  They both were super shy but he talked to them and gave them high fives and such.  Dude was an absolute pure loving person
White Rabbit Project,"As an Asian American, it meant so much to be able to turn on the TV and see someone who looked like me not only on a popular show, but treated as an equal. This one hurts like hell."
White Rabbit Project,god fucking damnit 2020 stop trying to bring back 536
White Rabbit Project,HOLY FUCKING SHIT
White Rabbit Project,What?! No!!!
White Rabbit Project,No! I absolutely loved him on Mythbusters. I'm in shock. So sorry for his family and friends.
White Rabbit Project,Man. What a role model for so many people. Genuinely shocked me to read this.
White Rabbit Project,"I’m at a loss. I don’t know what he was like outside the tv shows he co-hosted, but he always, always seemed like an absolute ball to be around."
White Rabbit Project,"I met Grant and the gang when I was a barista half a lifetime ago. I was making orders at like, 5:30am, when I looked up and started doing my small talk with Grant. He looked familiar and I kept asking him if I knew him from places in town, until he finally asked me if I’d ever heard of a show called “Mythbusters”. At that point I immediately recognized him, then looked past him and saw Kari and Tory too. He was super cool and humble about it. I guess they were filming a segment on fainting goats that live near me.

This is so sad."
White Rabbit Project,I'd like to reject this reality and substitute my own. That goes for the entirety of 2020.
White Rabbit Project,There aren't many celebrity tragedies that I feel directly touch or impact me but this hurts. Grant you will be missed.
White Rabbit Project,I'm crying so hard right now.  Lost Grant Thompson around this time last year and Grant Imahara this year.  Both were huge influences on science and teaching for me.
White Rabbit Project,"49 is still way too young. I’ve always watched Grant on Mythbusters while growing up :(

Aneurysms is such a scary topic. RIP Grant."
White Rabbit Project,"RIP to a hero.  

I have to say that Mythbusters certainly pushed me into engineering, and Grant was one of the coolest. What a sad day."
White Rabbit Project,"God dammit man, why?! Like a lot of people already mentioned, he was part of my childhood daily life. 
My sincere condolences to his family"
White Rabbit Project,Yo. Screw this year fr.
White Rabbit Project,"That's awful, Mythbusters inspired myself and probably many others to take up STEM."
White Rabbit Project,"God fucking dammit.... If 2020 could manifest itself in physical form, there would be a very long line of people waiting to punch it.

If there's anything positive to take away from this news, it's that his legacy lives on. There are millions who've been inspired by his work - for all we know the astronaut of tomorrow grew up watching Mythbusters (actually, I'd bet a lot of money on that)."
White Rabbit Project,2020 might go down as the worst non-world war year in modern history.
White Rabbit Project,"I’m pretty sure Godzilla and the Hollow Earth are real, and Grant’s erased identity is now part of the research team tasked with the goal of unleashing the Titans to stop COVID-19.

So hard to process.  For him, struggle is over.  Peace be with you, Grant.  Peace be with you."
White Rabbit Project,Damn. He was my favorite of the group. He seemed the most genuinely enthusiastic about the scientific /engineering side of it all.
White Rabbit Project,Anybody else out there just become a weepy mess after all this tragedy? I’m usually a hard ass but Idk how much more loss we can take.
White Rabbit Project,"it's a combination of all the stress and tension from this year but this actually made me bawl. Just, what the fuck."
White Rabbit Project,"Wow what away to find out. Went to grade school with him, we both had the same idea for the science fair and he destroyed me. But even as a child I could only just tip my hat to him. RIP."
The Cuba Libre Story,The looming threat of a WGA strike was also a motivation for getting scripts in early I'll bet.
The Cuba Libre Story,If only they had that foresight with the sequel trilogy. Can you imagine writing a script knowing that it had to relate to other projects? Crazy.
The Cuba Libre Story,I do not want to watch 4 other trash shows just to understand the one I kind of like
The Cuba Libre Story,"Question is does it ""fit perfectly"" without watching ahsoka and ""more star wars series""?"
The Cuba Libre Story,"Long time ago in a tiny galaxy far, far away..."
The Cuba Libre Story,"FFS why. The MCU model is absolutely exhausting, I don't want keeping up with characters and shows I like to be a full time fucking job."
The Cuba Libre Story,"Considering how heavily Favreau relies on improv, and how sparse I found any of the dialogue in Mando season 2 or Book of Boba Fett, I'm gonna take ""already written"" with a grain of salt"
The Cuba Libre Story,Is anyone pretending it is a particularly elaborate show to write. The show just repeats itself ...
The Cuba Libre Story,Please stop Marvel-izing Star Wars.
The Cuba Libre Story,Meaning it's going to be further bogged down by having to connect to the Skywalker storyline. I'm one of the few who did not enjoy the Luke revelation at the end of S2: Does every single piece of Star Wars have to be bound to the OG Story?
The Cuba Libre Story,">  So That Its Story Fits Perfectly With ‘Ahsoka’ and More ‘Star Wars’ Series

BWHAHA and by fits in, they mean works in an add for that other Disney shit thing."
The Cuba Libre Story,"I'm kinda annoyed because I only want to watch Mando. Didn't see Boba and now people say that is important for season 3, now they say I need to watch even mlre shows. Might drop it completely"
The Cuba Libre Story,"I guess that means we won't get back to the simple (in the best of meanings) and fun space western version of ""lone wolf and cub"" that was the first season."
The Cuba Libre Story,But will it entertain?
The Cuba Libre Story,"Unless the ""More"" is Andor, I don't care, I'm not watching other lazily produced shows just so I can understand what is going on in another.  I'd rather just read about the plot connections on a wiki or skip it entirely."
The Cuba Libre Story,I love this sub because of all the miserable people who watch these things and then claim to hate it or call it pedantic but then they keep watching it.
The Cuba Libre Story,Aha yes more product placement written into the show instead of you know telling a fucking story.
The Cuba Libre Story,The whole universe is an inconsistent mess at this point. Making this little piece fit makes little difference.
The Cuba Libre Story,So Ashoka will be another Book of Boba Fett and become Mandalorian season 4.5?
The Cuba Libre Story,"Instead of 1 great show,they'll milk this into 5 ok shows."
The Cuba Libre Story,imagine caring about this baby shit after Andor
The Cuba Libre Story,Just stop.
The Cuba Libre Story,Oh great more shows that connect together for no reason just because they're in the same franchise
The Cuba Libre Story,Star Warzzzzzzzzzz…
The Cuba Libre Story,"""Stop! Stop! He's already dead!"""
The Cuba Libre Story,Please just no more putting other shows randomly within others like they did with BoBF
The Cuba Libre Story,Already stopped watching Mandalorian when the Bobba Fett filler shit started. Why does everything need to be connected. its a story about a GALAXY far far away. give me more of the galaxy and less of the same ol shit
The Cuba Libre Story,"Am I the only one who is not a fan of having to watch other series so that the series that I am watching makes sense?

My wife and I used to watch The Flash and every season they'd do a crossover episode with the various other shows on that network. It was awful to have to watch those other shows to know what was up so we just started skipping the crossovers altogether. 

I like the Mandalorian but not interested in the other shows so I hope that while it will fit with other shows, I won't have to watch those others just to have an episode make sense."
The Cuba Libre Story,How about writing it so it fits with original series episodes 4-6?
The Cuba Libre Story,But Andor is still the only one worth watching…
The Cuba Libre Story,"No more Ahsoka, please..."
The Cuba Libre Story,"Fuck the haters, I’m excited. Mando is going to mandalore. There’s going to be a big conflict around the mandalore title since Bo wants it too. Ahsoka is going with Sabine to find Ezra and Thrawn. Thrawn is likely going to be the big villain, which should be awesome. Or will Ezra have turned him? Or will he have turned Ezra? Will the next mandalore reunite the Mando clans against Thrawn? Will Bo become mandalore and fail again, this time siding with Thrawn? Who knows, but I want to find out."
The Cuba Libre Story,This is such a miserable sub.
The Cuba Libre Story,This sucks
The Cuba Libre Story,So will we have to watch Ahsoka to understand season 4?
The Cuba Libre Story,"I have no hopes for Ahsoka. Dangling Thrawn in front of the old fans is not enough, and Ahsoka as a person is the most boring, straight-lacedm personality-free White-Hat Cowboy heroine in all of Star Wars. No sense of humor, no undercurrents. Leia had oceans more personality because she actually gets angry and is a good strategist."
The Cuba Libre Story,"That sounds like a lot of fucking Star Wars, maybe too much"
The Cuba Libre Story,They’re setting up Ezra to take over Grogus Jedi training.
The Cuba Libre Story,Too much stars wars content.  Burned me out
The Cuba Libre Story,I don’t know why they’re doing this. I liked the mandalorian but I’m never gonna watch season 3 because I can’t finish the Boba Fett show. Would likely be the same with Ashoka tbh.
The Cuba Libre Story,"Weird, it’s not like SW fans are anal about lore or anything…"
The Cuba Libre Story,"I feel like I’m the only person happy with everything so far, BOBF was the worst show, but I still enjoyed it, and I love how the shows come together. I also completely don’t understand how people think there are too many shows"
The Cuba Libre Story,The hype is utterly dead for this and anything else Star Wars related
The Cuba Libre Story,Why can’t Disney ever just a Star Wars series be it’s own separate thing. They always have to ruin it by mixing it with others or by bringing back the sky walkers. Really annoying tbh.
The Cuba Libre Story,I thought they were supposed to just make that shit up as they go along. Somehow Grogu returned….
The Cuba Libre Story,I don't want to watch anymore Starwars or Marvel and its sad as they used to be some of my fav universes.
The Cuba Libre Story,Too bad none of them even come close to being as good as Andor
The Cuba Libre Story,This should definitely be the way.
The Cuba Libre Story,Let's a go!
The Cuba Libre Story,Quality over quantity people Liam Neeson was right about the franchise being watered down
The Cuba Libre Story,Only a Sith Deals in Absolutes
The Cuba Libre Story,"It would be nice to see on the news

“The Mandalorian Season 5 is already written so that it’s story fits perfectly with the season Premier of ‘Luke Skywalker’ series” !"
The Cuba Libre Story,Ugh
The Cuba Libre Story,"Kind of wish they did a trilogy of movies or hell, even a single movie. Star Wars has always thrived with the spectacle of a theater experience. Avatar and others have seemed to fill in that gap in the theater and now Star Wars shows are designated to a Disney+ MCU knock off without the character development that you'd think a long form format would contain. Mandalorian is alright, but all the others have been subpar at best."
The Cuba Libre Story,"Here is hoping for time travel / dimensional shenanigans to reset the world ..lol.

Yes i know it wont happen they are going to another galaxy to build a new world/ story they control outside of all existing history ...."
The Cuba Libre Story,So they have a…plan.
The Cuba Libre Story,Something I had zero concerns about
The Cuba Libre Story,…so why didn’t you do this for the sequel trilogy?
The Cuba Libre Story,"Will probably go Mando 3 -> Ahsoka -> Boba Fett 2 -> Mando 4

A potential Obi Wan 2 would be mostly stand alone at this point. 

I for one am excited to watch all these."
The Cuba Libre Story,It would seemed they have learned something from the sequel trilogy
The Cuba Libre Story,This is the way.
The Cuba Libre Story,"This is the way. Not like the travesty the sequels were. Like them or hate them, no one can argue that they were well planned in advance."
The Cuba Libre Story,Just so long as I don't have to watch another show to get Din's story. I hate this tangled web of crisscrossing shows because some are good and some are garbage. They should stay separate.
The Cuba Libre Story,This is going to turn into a Star Wars Averngers two movie ending.
The Cuba Libre Story,But the fact that it didn’t fit perfectly with other shows is part of what made it great 😞
The Cuba Libre Story,Star Wars fatigue.
The Cuba Libre Story,What episodes of Boba Fett do I have to watch to understand Mando season 3?
The Cuba Libre Story,Star Wars should always have a fucking plan I’m not applauding them for starting to do what they’re suppose to do in the first place
The Cuba Libre Story,[Endless trash!](https://youtu.be/Ut5sk0RUlS4)
The Cuba Libre Story,Boooooo!
The Cuba Libre Story,Ok but I'd rather not watch those.
The Cuba Libre Story,I hope Andor S2 doesn't fit shit.
The Cuba Libre Story,This… is concerning.
The Cuba Libre Story,Just like how “Kenobi” fits perfectly by having Obi Wan hang around 10 year old Leia and then that’s never mentioned again in the movies? Gtfo here. Nothing is connected antmore
The Cuba Libre Story,I know people hate it but I love that The Book of Boba Fett and other 1-2 season short stories are baked into the storyline. It makes the system seem very dynamic with lots of these little things going on at the same time.
The Cuba Libre Story,They’re taking more care planning the Mandalorian/Star Wars TV verse than they did the damn sequel trilogy.
The Cuba Libre Story,Ron burgundy: “ I don’t believe you.”
The Cuba Libre Story,"Still processing GOT trauma, this head line soothes a tv loving soul."
The Cuba Libre Story,Oh my god who fucking cares. Can we please be done with valuing our entertainment by how well designed it is to suck us into a brand
The Cuba Libre Story,*sigh*
The Cuba Libre Story,"I have lost all hope entirely for disney and star wars.

Literally the only thing i enjoy besides the mandalorian is bad batch"
The Cuba Libre Story,"Please don't make Ahsoka be The Mandalorian season 3.5  

I like Mando and Ahsoka and it was cool they met a few times, but they don't have to have interlinked stories. Ahsoka's meant to be in the unknown regions with sabine finding Ezra and Thrawn, Mando's got his own stuff. The universe is huge.   

Have the Jedi academy be a kind of hub, characters from all shows might pop in or out but don't do serious plot progression like Grogu and Mando reuniting, or getting a new ship, in a different show and expect everyone to have watch the book of boba fett"
The Cuba Libre Story,"what is the problem? of course they should be connected, that's the whole reason why they are having so many shows in the same timeline. Would be weird if they would never met again."
The Cuba Libre Story,Is it going to be more or less boring ?
The Cuba Libre Story,Trying to connect all the properties just ends in a mess. Learn from marvel Phase one and quit while you're ahead.
The Cuba Libre Story,Another show where I have to watch a dozen hours of a different show to understand what's happening. Yay!
The Cuba Libre Story,retcon retcon retcon
The Cuba Libre Story,"The proliferation of all of these TV shows is how you deplete the hardcore fans. They can’t keep up, and because of it they lose interest. Their communities fall apart."
The Cuba Libre Story,"Oh good, I was losing sleep."
The Cuba Libre Story,"I do not care how any of this “connects”. That isn’t entertaining, it’s just a shallow way of placating viewers who care more about “consistency” than good storytelling. They are infantilizing their audience. 

The Mandalorian has never been an amazing show (it’s repetitive and stake-less), but the first season was a harmless distraction. Now it’s become the lynch pin for a bunch of other lazily made Star Wars “content”. This is all made more baffling if you’ve seen Andor which operates at a level of quality extremely far beyond the scope of the other shows.

Disney is so terrified of making any big moves with this thing that the stories now operate in this suffocating pressure chamber of bad “lore” it feels it has to adhere to and reinforce. It’s like sewing a seam but just keeps sticking the needle in and out of the same couple of centimetres of fabric and trying to see how many stitches it can fit in there."
The Cuba Libre Story,"I’m glad I don’t let Reddit dictate what I should like or not like. This comment section is hilarious, I swear none of you actually like anything, you just use things to shit on other things. This show was gods gift to star wars, wasn’t it? Or was it just because you liked it more than the last jedi? Is Andor garbage too? Because you guys are saying that it’s better than mandalorian."
The Cuba Libre Story,"man, the strike in 07 wreaked havoc on so many great shows."
The Cuba Libre Story,There's a strike about to happen?
The Cuba Libre Story,Considering that Jon Favreau just pretty much writes all the scripts by himself idk how much that would’ve even effected the Mandalorian lol.
The Cuba Libre Story,"I was 10 at that time, would you mind doing an ELI5 for me on what that strike was about?"
The Cuba Libre Story,"The honest truth is: I want everything to be part of a plan in a movie trilogy; and I want every show to be its own separate thing in a TV universe, with *maybe* the occasional character crossover but never critical to either show's plot

They're completely backwards on everything"
The Cuba Libre Story,Even an outline would have been helpful in that instance
The Cuba Libre Story,"It certainly would have helped. But the original trilogy was written without a definite plan as well, and it worked for the most part.

I think two bigger issues were:

1. Relying heavily on mysteries without having any answer to them. Who are Rey's parents? What happened to Luke? Who is Snoke? Who are the Knights of Ren? I believe the only mystery in the original trilogy that was thrown out without a plan was Yoda's ""there is another"" line.

2. No interest in following the story that came before it. Abrams just threw away everything from the original trilogy on an unexplained reset where we're somehow back to Empire vs. Rebels, the Empire is still being lead by an evil Sith lord, and the original characters are all split up. Johnson threw out what Abrams was building up to do his own thing, and then Abrams threw out what Johnson was building up to do something else.

The only one who actually seemed interested on following up on the story told by the previous films was Trevorrow. Whether or not people liked his script, it was the only one that seemed interested in turning the sequel trilogy into a coherent story."
The Cuba Libre Story,"You mean they should have spent a weekend writing an outline for a trilogy instead of just spending billions on the idea of a trilogy? 

Whaaaaat?!"
The Cuba Libre Story,That’s how the OT was written.
Fauda,"A lot of Americans watch it, Conan O’Brien even did a skit with Lior when he was in Israel. He was interrogating Lior because he wanted to know Gal Gadot’s address. And Stephen King liked it and called it “All killer, no filler.” because of the good action."
Fauda,Ok so I just finished the last episode and holy shit that last scene and the whole episode in general. I'm stressed the fuck out. I wasn't really feeling last season but this season I'm fucking back on board. What a beautifully fucked up finale.
Fauda,"Watched it. In my opinion it's the strongest season this show's had to date. Certainly not without its flaws, but overall very compelling and very entertaining."
Fauda,"\*\* Mild spoiler \*\*

It has the same tone of the three previous seasons, i.e very action-heavy and quite dark (the darkest of the seasons thus far). I love this show even though some of the decisions made by the characters are laughable (especially Gabi's decision at the beginning which sets S4's plot in action) and entirely made to drive the plot forward.

 I really like that you hear Arabic and Hebrew in more or less equal amounts, and was surprised that in season 4 some of the main Israeli characters spoke Arabic with each other at some points.  Sagi's and Nurit's wedding featured songs in Arabic which was kind of weird to me!

The actors really sell the drama though whether its battle-related or relationship-based. For some of the people writing that they find the show a little too action-heavy, give ""Le Bureau des Legendes"" a try. It is a very high quality (in my opinion) French production that can be described as the strategy-heavy (vs. action-packed) version of Fauda.  It also features a bit of middle eastern flavour as well."
Fauda,I gotta catch up on season 3! Loved the first two seasons
Fauda,"> IDF agent who had an **Arab mother** so he can pass as a Palestinian

I'm pretty sure that wasn't said or implied in the show. Doron and the rest of his unit are mista'aravim, people who are trained to assimilate in the Arab population."
Fauda,Nice seeing it mentioned here. Its a hit here in Israel of course but I dropped it after 2-3 episodes. Its absolutely one of the best and well-made production to come out of Israel but for me it was too unrealistic. And while the show is praised for showing a complex view of the situation here I found it to be quite shallow and too focused on action(which is cool and all but also a bit problematic for me personally).
Fauda,"This was probably my least favorite season. 

There were a ton of immersion breaking issues for me, especially when they were in Lebanon. In fact, while it’s nice to see Lebanon in a popular series, and Ayub saying the Iranians took Lebanon from the Paris of the Middle East to a dump, the rest of the depiction was so off. 

Hezbollah wouldn’t run checkpoints everywhere and their power/influence are much reduced outside of the Bekaa Valley. Druze and Christians shown as Collaborators, etc. 

The cars, particularly those for the various groups, were too new and shiny. 

I also felt like a lot of the dialogue and story writing fell off. Too many forced remembrances to bring people up to speed or to make new characters feel like they had deeper relationships (even when there was zero chemistry). 

I’ve never been a big fan of the fight scenes, and this season’s were the worst. The constant use of “the reload sound” that anyone who has played a video game has heard for the last 30 years was annoying. The infinite magazines except when they needed to make a scene more intense, and most of the tactics were just awful. Not just “awful because they were inaccurate” but “awful because they made no sense”.  

The explosions felt much more 80s/90s action film than previous seasons. 

Still Seasons 2 and 3 were my favorites for different reasons. This one felt like it had some teething issues due to a bigger budget/corporate sponsorships and was trying to appeal to a more international audience."
Fauda,Maybe the subject matter isn't very appealing to American audience.
Fauda, even more attractive.
Fauda,I haven't seen it but is this the final season? Or not yet determined?
Fauda,This is honestly one of the few shows I regret not starting before cancelling my Netflix
Fauda,Love this series.
Fauda,"I liked the whole season, but thought the finale kinda brought it down. Made everyone act real stupidly to get them into the final position the episode wanted. Not to mention >!the reinforcements not being able to get to the site for pretty lazy reasoning and command not sending any other air support besides a single transport helicopter to extract them. Just felt to me like the writing fell apart at the end for the sake of the shock finale!<"
Fauda,Yea I agree I was more stressed out than I have ever been. The last scene was so ridiculous but I was completely emotional. I guess that's what's good about it. The logic isn't always there but the emotions always feel so true.
Fauda,nah season 2 was imo
Fauda,"I love hearing so much Arabic! It's a language that expresses emotion better than most languages. English, Hebrew, German etc sound kind of rough all the time and don't express tenderness and vulnerability as well."
Fauda,I thought I remembered his father and him talking about that at some point. I could totally be misrembering.
Fauda,I also agree it is problematic but as just an action series it's pretty amazing. It's unfortunate as one of the few shows covering the issue it kind of needs to do more than is even possible.
Fauda,You can criticize America for alot of things but you can't say we don't love violent content with Arab bad guys. That's absurd.
Fauda,It ended on a cliffhanger. It's successful overseas there's even an Indian remake. I think its most likely getting another season.
Fauda,It is already filming season 5
Fauda,"Totally agree. \[non-specific spoiler-ish comments ahead\]  
Was loving the season, but as the end approached, and most of all the finale, though wrenching, it all felt just too manipulative: characters (if not the whole Israeli military command) repeatedly acting unprofessional, uncharacteristically stupid, and just *way* too fallible.  
Israeli's military & security forces may indeed be human, but not for nothing do they have their awesome reputation. Felt like every single operation they mounted in this season was a far bigger screw-up than the one it was trying to fix. Doron repeatedly letting his newfound sensitive side get the better of his hard-nosed judgment as an agent was hard to take."
Fauda,Fair I don't need that much logic. I didnt notice a lot of what you saw as bad writing. I thought the helicopter couldn't land because of the gunfire? Don't see how additional helicopters would have resolved that?
Fauda,"Arabic is interesting to listen to, it has much sharper and more intense sounds than Hebrew as far as I can tell. French and Greek are good at expressing tenderness too!"
Fauda,"Anyone who's heard some of the better Israeli pop music over the years—or even certain Jewish religious songs—could tell you that's a culturally ignorant take. Hebrew can sound quite emotional, romantic, vulnerable or softly passionate.

The guys & girls in Fauda are hardened Israeli agents, most of their dialogue is macho bantering or shouting to each other during hyper-intense operations. No, that's not gonna sound like someone cooing *Je taime* in French."
Fauda,"I don’t remember either. His dad was an Iraqi Jew from Baghdad, though"
Fauda,[deleted]
Fauda,"Yeah, it couldn't land because of gunfire. But there's no reason they couldn't have had actual air support there to help out as well. Even a drone would be more useful than an unarmed extraction chopper"
Fauda,Agreed. Id add Spanish to the list.
Fauda,Or maybe it was a cover story he was using and I thought it was true. I kind of turn my brain off when I watch it and just enjoy the action.
Fauda,"What? Practically every character from the Israeli side is a complete piece of shit who make the absolute worse decisions. 

If this is supposed to be Israeli propaganda, they're very fucking bad at it."
Fauda,Yea I don't know shit about any of that stuff so I don't need that much logic to enjoy it.
Fauda,More or less all the Romance languages!
Fauda,No it’s not a cover story. Doron is half Iraqi Jewish. And the Arabic song at the wedding is because this group is mainly Mizrahi so they come from Jewish families that are originally from the Arab world. And they would have had Arabic as their main language before moving to Israel
Fauda,"to play devil's advocate, the show is obviously portraying the Israeli as reluctant good guys who are forced to be like that because Arab terrorism, not sure how it can be more obvious. Even the good Palestinian special forces guy who was friends with Ayoub got killed by, guess who, Arab terrorists"
Fauda,"I agree it's basically ""copaganda"" and have struggled at times with watching it but it's just so damn entertaining."
Fauda,"4th series is weakest in terms of realism, still a league over other shows tho"
Fauda,This is a awesome show
Fauda,"**Creating 'Fauda'**

> **Raz and Issacharoff, Jerusalemites whose families both originally came from Arab countries, have been friends since they were 16 and were both in the elite unite, called the Duvdevan, which is featured in the series.**


> They had joined the reserves of the unit, working in the West Bank, when they came up with the idea of Fauda. By then Issacharoff was already a top journalist and Raz a jobbing actor. “Avi asked me if I had a dream and I told him I wanted to write something about the people we were then with, about the mental price they were all paying, the price everybody surrounding them was paying,” says Raz. “We both wanted to talk about the Palestinian side too because knowing who they are is just as important.”

> **Finding someone willing to make the show was a struggle. Israelis live with the conflict; when they watch the television they prefer light entertainment. Raz and Issacharoff got a lot of no’s.**


> “We managed to find someone to help us pitch to the production company Yes,” recalls Issacharoff. “There was one guy and three women in the room. He was enthusiastic, the women seemed less so. They said, ‘This show won’t be watched by women.’ But they still took it on, it became the success it became, and when they did research into the viewers, they found more women were watching the show than men.


> **“We don’t know the exact reasons for the success but I think a big part of it is the authenticity. We took stories from real life, from our lives, and we put them in the story.** Every episode of Fauda, every character, you will find something that is real. And sometimes we almost predict things; in our third season we wrote about our team being exposed while they were working in the Gaza Strip. As we were writing it, there was a real team of undercover soldiers that were exposed – so we were having this strange dialogue with reality.


**Future of 'Fauda'**

> Because the show has become such an international success – with India making the first local version – Raz and Issacharoff have a very international outlook. Their company, Faraway Road Productions, is planning to team up with creatives from across Arab nations to create more work that crosses borders...

> There are also plans for a show set in London and, of course, more Fauda. **“We are talking very seriously about making a Fauda movie and we are very open to more seasons,” says Raz.** “This has all been a brilliant adventure and we are not sure when it will end.”"
Fauda,"season 4 so far has been even better than the previous ones, I'm at episode 7 and cannot count the times I held my breath

Sagi needs to chill tho"
Fauda,One of my favorites
Fauda,I was wondering if I should start that series.
Fauda,Great article & I look forward to what they have coming!
Fauda,"Still loved it, but they really only used The Predator when it was convenient to the plot"
Fauda,"Season one was great. Season 2 was ok. S3 didn't even bother.
Can I just watch s4 without s3?in case I want to give them another try"
Fauda,"Yes, Go ahead. You can definitely start watching S4 without S3, (S4 follows a complete independent storyline). 
PS. I have finished watching all the seasons, in my opinion S3 is the best. S1 & S2 are also great. S4 wasn't as good as first 3 seasons, but hey... It's still way better than most of the other current TV shows coming out on Netflix. You don't wanna miss it."
Fauda,Hell yes! Such a good show
Fauda,Hate these types of shows. It's like other countries were like we need our own 24
Fauda,Stoked!!!! One of my favorites!
Fauda,"I hate how little attention Fauda gets on reddit , such an entertaining TV show"
Fauda,Is this based in lebanon?
Fauda,Date?
Fauda,"I have never heard of this show.  Can someone drop a quick synopsis?  It looks Israelie?  What is so good about it?

Thanks for posting, I love seeing stuff from around the world, where can I see the show?"
Fauda,damn i gotta finish season 3!
Fauda,Ohhhh boy. Cannot wait. One of my favorites.
Fauda,So true..... what a great show.
Fauda,It's such a good show! I don't know why it hasn't caught on with a wider audience
Fauda,So underrated and so good. Maybe now that more people are giving subtitles a chance it will get bigger.
Fauda,"Israel, the west Bank, and gaza"
Fauda,"No official release date yet, only that it will be [released mid-2022](https://www.tvinsider.com/1027171/fauda-season-4-teaser-netflix-lior-raz/):



> Produced by Yes Studios, the acclaimed series is set to return for a 10-episode fourth season, **first launching on Israel’s Yes TV in mid-2022 before landing on Netflix worldwide**"
Fauda,Short answer: it’s awesome!
Fauda,"It’s an Israeli action show about a special army unit that is tracking down terrorists. The first three seasons are on Netflix.


It’s an action show with some good set pieces, but the story is a bit repetitive in its second season with little characters development."
Fauda,"Besides the response you got, it's one of those shows that will keep you at the edge of your seat. Season 2 is the strongest to me but all are equally as good in terms of narrative.  
It's a great show that shows both sides of the never-ending conflict."
Fauda,"Must be only a few scenes then, saw a bunch of lebanese flags on roadblocks"
Fauda,"Unlike the first 3 seasons, season 4 will take place outside Israel, that includes Lebanon and Europe."
Fauda,My bad. Yeah I heard hezbollah was the opposition in the new season so that makes sense that there are scenes in Lebanon
Fauda,"I mean i have no idea what im talking about, never seen this show. Will probably give it a go though, nice to see a few foreign production backed shows for once."
Fauda,"Netflix has been doing well with foreign shows. Fauda, squid games, money heist, lupin, all very solid."
Fauda,"Great exciting true stories hot or sharp, moving characters"
Fauda,"Surprised to see this. Its funny how they keep bringing back Doron though. 

He is like the most disobedient operative ever yet some commander will come to him offer him a spot on a team with one woman and say his orders are law just for him to do whatever lol."
Fauda,"3rd season was the first one I watched. Some pretty huge embellishments in the gun fights, lots of macho nonsense, but the main plot line was surprisingly good."
Fauda,Can’t wait. Such a good show.
Fauda,Can't wait!
Fauda,I've seen Season 3. I highly recommend watching it.
Fauda,FINALLY! fauda is one of my favorite tv shows so i'm hype af.
Fauda,"Terrible, most propaganda filled show I’ve ever seen in my life"
Fauda,"Username checkout,
you do need help"
Fauda,"Because I don’t like a terrible show filled with propaganda? You’re still allowed to like it, I don’t control you"
Fauda,I’m interested but the 24 diss was unnecessary. Hasn’t Jack Bauer suffered enough?
Fauda,"Great series ;)

The season 3's finale was kinda underwhelming though. I'm mostly talking about the boxer's ""master plan"" ;)"
Fauda,Great show!!!
Fauda,"It was great TV at the time, it just hasn't aged well IMO."
Fauda,"I feel like they were setting him up for more, like walid"

Hip-Hop Evolution,"I have enjoyed every single episode of this series.

This latest season made me change my opinion about a few artists."
Hip-Hop Evolution,"The Super Producers episode really blew me away i never knew how important Pharrell, timbaland were out there in Virginia, you know of these guys as the producing legends they are but don't know their stories sometimes."
Hip-Hop Evolution,"Great doc series.  I don't even like rap, and I loved it."
Hip-Hop Evolution,"Shad is a pretty great rapper too, check out his music if you haven’t already."
Hip-Hop Evolution,"I started watching from Season 1 just last week. All the 1970s stuff.  All the stuff about ""Here Comes The Judge""? That was mad interesting. And Grandmaster Flash is a really fascinating personality. 

I can see myself burning through it. Sends you down a Wikipedia wormhole about 5 times an episode."
Hip-Hop Evolution,Is there any info about  season 5?
Hip-Hop Evolution,"Who, and in what way?"
Hip-Hop Evolution,The Old Prince is an underground classic
Hip-Hop Evolution,"Yeah it's great, I burn through each season of this in a couple of days from release. 

A quality work in charting the development of a genre across different decades and cities. While individual aspects have been well covered before I'm not sure if something so expansive yet in depth has been attempted before? 

He does a good job displaying balance but I get the impression Shad has a personal preference for the East Coast Classics."
Hip-Hop Evolution,new seasons have been dropping every 6 months or so. season 4 just came out last week so i would expect june or so.
Hip-Hop Evolution,Both producers did an AMA in r/hiphopheads a couple of days ago. They actually filmed a lot of material that didn't make the cut but they still don't know if a season 5 is coming soon.
Hip-Hop Evolution,"They're mini seasons but I feel like they're stretching already, and went a little too quickly through some sections.  Will be interesting where they go next or if they circle back around again."
Hip-Hop Evolution,My bet is Kanye West and Lil' Wayne. Many people write them off because they don't know how important they actually are to the industry.
Hip-Hop Evolution,Feel like there should be one last season that touches on 2000's (beyond 04') and 2010's.
Hip-Hop Evolution,[deleted]
Hip-Hop Evolution,"Many/most of them are worth watching. But not every viewer will enjoy every bit of content they churn out. For instance, The Get Down and Hip Hop Evolution was something I was super psyched about. Would someone that is not into hip hop enjoy those? Probably not!"
Hip-Hop Evolution,"Most shows labelled 'Netflix Originals' aren't really originally produced by Netflix. Netflix only holds the US/International distribution rights to the project and thus labels it a 'Netflix Original'.

Shows like *Daredevil*, *House of Cards*, *Luke Cage*, etc. are created by Netflix and are true Netflix Originals. 

Most others they just paid to be the sole distributor and are branded Original. This includes Stand up specials, Documentaries, reality shows, foreign speaking shows.

From the ones you listed:

* *White Rabbit Project* was produced by Beyond Television Productions and Netflix is the dristibutor and Network
* *Crazyhead* was produced by Urban Myth Films. Distributed by StudioCanal. With it originally airing on UK's E4 network then on Netflix
* *The Crown* was produced by Sony Pictures Television. Distributed and airing only on Netflix.
* *Spectral* was produced by Legendary Pictures. Distributed and airing only on Netflix.
* *Pacific Heat* was produed by Working Dog Productions, which was then sold to Netflix.
* *Tales by Light* was produced by Untitled Film Works. Distributed by Distribution 360. Originally airing on National Geographic.
* *Paranoid* was produced by Red Production Company. Distributed by StudioCanal. Originally airing on UK's ITV then Netflix."
Hip-Hop Evolution,"The thing to note is that for some people, Netflix is the only thing they use to watch TV. Like any old TV channel, they can't just have a couple of shows and that's about it. They've got to have a wide variety of content, otherwise they'll alienate a large percentage of their audience. 

I wouldn't say they have too much, so much as they have a large variety of programs on. "
Hip-Hop Evolution,"You do realize that stuff like 3% and Club de Cuervos is not necessarily meant for you?

Netflix is a global company, they are not making stuff just for americans."
Hip-Hop Evolution,"Club de Cuervos is a funny show (only watched season 1 so far), but it's about owning a soccer club, probably won't have the same pull for people who don't care about soccer just like a show about American football probably won't be of interest to someone in South America.  I'd still give it a try since it's not really about Soccer but about a stupid man inheriting ownership of a professional sports team."
Hip-Hop Evolution,"Everyone here is talking about a show they liked but another that they didn't like, and the vast majority of the titles mentioned are different in every post. So yeah, they're producing a lot and it's not all meant for a single viewer, but overall they're making quality content. Each show has some audience. None will likely have 100% viewership, but they're targeting their viewers well and making sure they're all served in some way by at least 1 thing they produce."
Hip-Hop Evolution,"You're asking Reddit. The answer is no, and they're all worth watching, of course."
Hip-Hop Evolution,I actually find it really interesting how low key their advertising for shows is. ie Stranger Things. I heard nothing about this until someone posted on here that it was a really cool show and then it just exploded. 
Hip-Hop Evolution,"They're definitely not putting out too much, that is the perspective of someone who thinks Netflix expects you to watch everything they put out. TV watching these days is very niche, there are so many shows out there and most of them live on niche followings. Netflix is catering to this by putting out a ton of different things. You aren't meant to like all of them, you're meant to have a wide array of choices giving you a good chance to find something that's in your wheelhouse."
Hip-Hop Evolution,Chewing Gun is really funny. It's a mix of the inbetweeners and girls.
Hip-Hop Evolution,"I haven't watched the majority of their original shows but so far I've enjoyed Bojack Horseman, House of Cards, F Is For Family, Stranger Things and Bloodline. I tried Marco Polo and 3% and never got into them. But they definitely do have original shows worth watching"
Hip-Hop Evolution,"Sometimes it's overwhelming. I really cant keep up with all the shows even though they could be binged in a week.

I am finishing up the Marvel series while starting The OA and need to put Narcos S2 aside for a bit. Haven't even watched one episode of Black Mirror, so that's next. Then there's A Series of Unfortunate Events in Jan that is a must watch for me!

Is it overdoing it? No... because there's a genre for everyone. I tried The Crown and HoC... a bit too slow. You can pick and choose which series to follow and luckily the originals should be on the permanent inventory so I'll pick it up whenever. 

Speaking of HBO, it definitely has been taken to the back burner. I've tried 3x to start The Wire. I know it's good... it's legendary in the sub, but I get amped for new content from Netflix all the time."
Hip-Hop Evolution,I really like the Medici: Masters of Florence. It's very interesting if you like shows like the Borgias and Game of Thrones
Hip-Hop Evolution,"I mean when you churn out 60 shows in a year, theres bound to be several duds. They are still above average compared to most networks. The difference is that Netflix isnt really canceling their bad shows (besides Marco Polo) like othee networks, so theres some selection bias."
Hip-Hop Evolution,"I wish Netflix would make a distinction between ""Netflix originals"" (shows they bought the rights to from other networks) and ACTUAL Netflix originals (House of Cards, Orange is the new Black, etc) on the app."
Hip-Hop Evolution,"Yeah, I feel like they're going a little nuts. Most of them are actually quite good too, but the sheer quantity of them makes me mentally perceive them as being possibly lower in quality, and also possibly being an indicator that they're neglecting their non-original content. Even if neither of those things is actually true, that's the perception it creates (to me)."
Hip-Hop Evolution,"Yeah, I wish Netflix would learn the difference between Netflix Original and Netflix Presents.  The latter is more appropriate when the content originally aired somewhere else, even in another region."
Hip-Hop Evolution,[deleted]
Hip-Hop Evolution,"I admit it's overwhelming, but started Glitch last night and really loved it."
Hip-Hop Evolution,"I don't think OP's point was that there are too many shows, and that sheer ammount was just egregious. I think it was more about being able to successfully advertise/hype/give room to a show? 

OP if you're still lurking, please clarify, because I tend to agree with the latter. "
Hip-Hop Evolution,"I think a key part of innovation is trying out lots of different things and accepting that many of them will fail, so from that perspective I don't see the quantity itself as an issue.

For me, Netflix has had quite a few hits in the last year or two. Most of the ones in this batch are somewhat outside my domain of interest, though, and I've only seen Spectral so far. It was entertaining with a cool premise, I would say not bad but not great either; a somewhat generic sci-fi military shooter with the tropes you'd expect. I watched it mainly because I'm a fan of Stalker and Orpheus."
Hip-Hop Evolution,Club de Cuervos is great. 
Hip-Hop Evolution,Grace and Frankie
Hip-Hop Evolution,3% is awesome
Hip-Hop Evolution,Some of these shows are purchased and just labeled exclusives here in the US.  These shows might run on tv in another territory. 
Hip-Hop Evolution,"I'm a bit disappointed. To me the appeal of Netflix was the long tail. Now they're just turning into an HBO clone.

Every month I see an announcement of something leaving Netflix that I didn't even know was there due to their shitty channel organization/promotion. I'd have enjoyed the hell out of watching old Columbo movies. Instead it kept trying to get me to watch OitNB and rewatch(What the hell?) Stranger Things."
Hip-Hop Evolution,"The bad part for me is there are so few of them I'm interested in.   Sorry, stand-up comedy and history documentaries do nothing for me *shrugs*
"
Hip-Hop Evolution,"If they'd put some fucking money into them I wouldn't mind but they're very clearly cutting as many corners as possible with their budgets.


""So who what superheroes should we make our shows about?""


""Hmmmmmmm, lets do Punchy man, Punchy Woman, Punchy Black Man, Punchy Asian-Themed Man and Gun Man to start out with."""
Hip-Hop Evolution,I didn't like Jessica Jones as much as Luke Cage or Daredevil.  I am suspecting that deep down I am either gay or the kind of sexist who chooses Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton.  I am hoping that I am gay.
Hip-Hop Evolution,I think this is the best explanation of why there is such a high quantity of Netflix originals. Their user base is massive and diverse. They're currently doing the best job of putting out quality shows for every demographic. 
Hip-Hop Evolution,"> A show like Hater's Back Off has never been pushed to me

awww, it's great. I feel like any lover of internet culture would like it."
Hip-Hop Evolution,i don't really like hip hop and I thought it was a lot of fun.
Hip-Hop Evolution,"Can confirm. I tried watching The Get Down. I can recognize that it's a very high quality show. Acting, writing, cinematography, music, everything fit right. It just wasn't my thing.

It's like almost everyone complaining about The OA at the moment. Granted, I've just finished episode 5, but I'm still enjoying it."
Hip-Hop Evolution,that's because you're a television addict! get help!
Hip-Hop Evolution,Medici was produced by Bright Light Productions and aired on Rai 1 in Italy
Hip-Hop Evolution,"Likewise, in the UK we get THE EXPANSE even though it's a Syfy show. It's still slapped with a 'Netflix Original' title. "
Hip-Hop Evolution,"> Shows like Daredevil, House of Cards, Luke Cage, etc. are created by Netflix and are true Netflix Originals. 

None of those examples were created by Netflix either; the Marvel shows are produced by ABC Studios, House of Cards is produced by Media Rights Capital. So far there are only a few shows (such as The Ranch) that Netflix has actually produced and they're quire recent, though Netflix is looking to increase in-house production going forward."
Hip-Hop Evolution,"Is there a list of *true* Netflix originals? And where does something like Arrested Developmenr fall, which was created by another network but is not actually produce and created by Netflix?"
Hip-Hop Evolution,You are really mischaracterizing this.  Some shows netflix brands as originals they just bought the rights to but that isn't the case for all the shows you listed.   Having a separate production company doesn't mean the show isn't an original.  It is a pretty standard setup that also exists in regular television.  No one is going to say Breaking Bad wasn't an AMC original or that Seinfeld wasn't an NBC original.   Doesn't make sense to start doing it for Netflix shows. 
Hip-Hop Evolution,"Really glad you pointed this out. I've often thought this was the case. As a result, the productions that ARE actually original (Daredevil, HOuse of Cards, etc) are usually predictably better than many of the sub-par shows they are branding Netflix, but have actually ""rescued"" from oblivion. Yea - way too much ""original"" content."
Hip-Hop Evolution,Thought 3% is more familiar in the sense that it's mystery type fun show so it will attract more viewers. Club de Cuervos doesn't look like something Americans would watch.
Hip-Hop Evolution,"My cousin told me to watch it a year ago but I brushed it off initially. They're visiting from Mexico and we were watching it one day and I binged the first season in a week. I don't watch Spanish TV and I'm not really into soccer ( I will watch it occasionally, but don't follow it) but I was surprised how much I was invested into the show. I'm fluent in Spanish so I understand it all, but I wonder how well the humour would translate into English with subtitles. 

I recommended it to my brother, but it's hard to recommend it to friends that don't speak Spanish because I'm not sure if they'd like it. 

It's a great show and the 2nd Season just came out but I hope it gets renewed for another season, because I would love to see more of these characters. 

"
Hip-Hop Evolution,"> I actually find it really interesting how low key their advertising for shows is. ie Stranger Things. 

there was nothing low key about that, they advertised it all the time on regular tv channels, even billboards up in my city. I think i even saw a trailer/ad for it in the cinema around the time it came out.

they pushed hard on the advertising for that show and it was money well spent."
Hip-Hop Evolution,They pretty much just drop the trailer and move on. They sometimes pay for commercials too.
Hip-Hop Evolution,Nice to see Walder Frey finally got Robb to marry his daughter 
Hip-Hop Evolution,Ahhh fuuuck I would certainly like to see more rob
Hip-Hop Evolution,"For me the hard part is figuring out which shows are worth watching. There's a couple shows that I can't find any reviews on at all. For example, I've heard some people love The OA and other people who hate it. And since my time is really limited I don't like investing in a show unless I know it's going to be good. "
Hip-Hop Evolution,Why?
Hip-Hop Evolution,"Yeah, it's like that thing in cognitive psychology where the more choices you have, the less satisfied you'll be with the one you pick. Sure, this one show might be nice, but I'm always going to be wondering if I should be watching one of the other 29 shows. It doesn't help that Netflix doesn't keep a convenient list anywhere - every time I click the home page I'm bombarded with 7 new original shows and it's actually pretty hard to keep track.

HBO only has a handful of really outstanding shows (Deadwood, Rome, Sopranos, Carnivale, The Wire) so I don't feel too bad picking one to binge watch. "
Hip-Hop Evolution,This as well. It was really strange to see Glitter Force (Saban's attempt to dub Pretty Cure) advertised as a Netflix Original.
Hip-Hop Evolution,"> Stranger Things (it's not that great though

this show has gotten so much hype. I just finished watching it and it's not perfect but I think it does the 80s so damn well it gets a lot of hype. but seriously I love how no one made a big deal about barbara going missing and not being found."
Hip-Hop Evolution,"Black Mirror is a continuation as well, Netflix is only directly responsible for the third season."
Hip-Hop Evolution,what is it about?
Hip-Hop Evolution,"Exactly. More content is nice, but if I don't want to jump into a show unless I know it's good, *especially* since I've been burned so many times by getting really invested in a Netflix show only to find out it was mediocre (Narcos, Luke Cage, etc etc). 

It also drives me up a wall that it's impossible to find a list of their shows they released. I spent like a week trying to find a show because it popped up on my home screen once but never again and it was impossible to find. "
Hip-Hop Evolution,"This is a weird line of thinking. Maybe your TV preferences have nothing to do with your politics?

Jessica Jones sucked btw and I voted for Clinton."
Hip-Hop Evolution,"> I am suspecting that deep down I am either gay or the kind of sexist who chooses Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton. I am hoping that I am gay.

this has to be the weirdest form of reasoning ever "
Hip-Hop Evolution,"I wonder when everyone will start complaining about being forced to pay for all the shows they don't watch, like they do with cable."
Hip-Hop Evolution,[deleted]
Hip-Hop Evolution,Episode 8 will make you hate everything retroactively.
Hip-Hop Evolution,The oa is shit though 
Hip-Hop Evolution,I still don't get why they didn't just release it on the damned Syfy channel in the UK rather than making us wait over a year only to give it to a competitor... so confused.
Hip-Hop Evolution,"MTV's Scream is a ""Netflix Original"" in Canada."
Hip-Hop Evolution,"All those shows were original content commissioned by Netflix.  Even *The Ranch* was commissioned by Netflix, with production done by Ranch Hand Productions."
Hip-Hop Evolution,Yeah but that's common. We always identify shows by their network not their production studio. Often ABC studios shows will appear on Fox or vice versa.  Of the top of my head I can think of Scrubs (ABC Studios) airing non NBC and Brooklyn (NBC) airing on Fox.  The examples can go on. 
Hip-Hop Evolution,"[Here's the list of Netflix Original Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_original_programs_distributed_by_Netflix#Original_programming)

Arrested Development resides in another category of Netflix Originals, where Netflix commissions additional seasons of past shows. Also includes Trailer Park Boys, Full House, and Gilmore Girls. "
Hip-Hop Evolution,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_original_programs_distributed_by_Netflix

Everything except the ""acquisitions"" section. "
Hip-Hop Evolution,I only speak English and it's still pretty funny. One if my favorite Netflix shows for sure. 
Hip-Hop Evolution,"I found the OA to be dreadfully slow and just a bit 'off' for my liking. 

The Expanse on the other hand I really enjoyed. "
Hip-Hop Evolution,"from what I heard it was slow to start but got really good, and then a lot of people strongly dislike the ending."
Hip-Hop Evolution,Word on the list nonsense. Netflix has always had major functionality issues. If youre gonna pump out 226 shows a year atleast give me the ability to sort through them.
Hip-Hop Evolution,"> It doesn't help that Netflix doesn't keep a convenient list anywhere - every time I click the home page I'm bombarded with 7 new original shows and it's actually pretty hard to keep track.

They are really lacking on educating their users on when new shows are coming out.  I feel like there will just randomly be some new show out, and I just wait for internet buzz to tell me what to watch.

Even if it was something as simple as new series release on the first Friday of every month. Then you could get hyped about something."
Hip-Hop Evolution,Yeah it's decent. It was over hyped with so many people watching it because of the hype some people are bound to be disappointed.
Hip-Hop Evolution,[deleted]
Hip-Hop Evolution,"Small town cop gets a call that there is a disturbance in a graveyard. There is a boy witness to what happens there, but he is hiding so does not report it. Cop shows up and finds 4 confused people covered in dirt with various accents. Rescues them and brings them to a small local Dr. Office where there is a fifth person found earlier. When the cop sees the fifth person the show gets really interesting."
Hip-Hop Evolution,"I mean, it's possible the shows you've stumbled upon just weren't your thing. I thought Narcos was great and so did a lot of people, for instance. Actually that's why they release so many wildly different shows, they're trying to get *everyone* hooked to something. You and I aren't supposed to like everything, we're supposed to love a couple and like a few others, just enough to stay subscribed.

From my point of view the only valid criticism you're making is how difficult it is to find stuff worth watching. Although that is a deliberate choice of theirs, I do agree they could design the whole thing better so you more easily find stuff you could be interested in.

[As for a list of all their originals, Wikipedia is your best shot honestly.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_original_programs_distributed_by_Netflix) They divide by genre, list future shows, differentiate between actual original content and acquired shows from other producers, and most importantly, their list is constantly updated."
Hip-Hop Evolution,Narcos was mediocre?  You are spot on about trying to find a show you were interested in and never put on your watch list. Very confusing trying to find shows to watch. 
Hip-Hop Evolution,"Considering Netflix costs $9.99 or so a month, anyone who is complaining doesn't have much ground to stand on. Netflix could cost $20 a month and it would still be worth it over cable and wouldn't feel like you were subsidizing shows you aren't watching."
Hip-Hop Evolution,it grows on ya
Hip-Hop Evolution,"I hate episode 8 as an ending, but could see myself coming to appreciate it if there is a second season. "
Hip-Hop Evolution,They probably did some market research and determined it wouldn't do well there.
Hip-Hop Evolution,"> All those shows were original content commissioned by Netflix.

As were some of the shows you listed as not being 'true' Netflix Originals, so I'm not sure what distinction you're trying to make. "
Hip-Hop Evolution,"This wasn't about what network we identify a show with, it's about which company actually owns and produces the show."
Hip-Hop Evolution,Crazy Head aired on tv already.  That is like saying Lost or The Almighty Johnsons is a netflix original.
Hip-Hop Evolution,This has the crown listed on it which Netflix just has American rights to I believe.

Refresh Man,"Great write up!


I'm not familiar with most of these, and I watch a shit-ton of TV and movies. I really like the effort, and the writeups are perfect in length.


Again, not knowing these a lot, is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show? (Nothing against non English speakers of course) 


Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.


Totally agree with the couple from White Lotus being great characters, I much preferred season 1 (which seems like a hot take) but those two, specifically the woman, were very interesting characters to me."

Refresh Man,"This is Going to Hurt: I'm a medical student and I thought I'd seen every medical show but this one is on my list now! I've heard that this show shows the reality of a doctor's life without all the glamor of medicine.

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well.

Refresh Man,Which ones did you see? 🤔 amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?
Refresh Man,"> is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
Refresh Man,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
Refresh Man,🙂💕
Refresh Man,It’s great but it’s depressing.
Refresh Man,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
Refresh Man,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
Refresh Man,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
Refresh Man,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7… cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
Refresh Man,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
Refresh Man,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
Refresh Man,Oh my bad. I’m late to the party.
Refresh Man,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
Refresh Man,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

damn. guess i gotta hurry and check this one out now. lol."
Refresh Man,"You should check out Kotaro Lives Alone, such a good show!"
Refresh Man,"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven’t managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
Refresh Man,I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!

Refresh Man,"I am on the last episode of **The Resort**. I have enjoyed this show, and I am excited to see where it ends up. It’s about a couple who go on a trip to a resort in Mexico, and then get involved in a mystery to find out what happened to some characters in the past who disappeared. It has a bit of weirdness to it and unexplained things. It is a comedy at the heart of it, but also touches on some serious topics throughout. Recommend it if you are looking for an interesting show."
Refresh Man,"Finished the first season of the Leftovers, a little slow moving but the emotional beats really hit."
Refresh Man,"**3%** on Netflix.

It's a Brazilian 4-season TV show (in Portuguese) set in a dystopian future where everyone lives in abject poverty, except for a select 3% who are chosen at age 20 to join a Utopian society on a nearby island paradise.

I'm through two seasons and the world building is top notch, characters are believable and captivating, and the twists are worth waiting for."
Refresh Man,"Been watching my favourite weird shows again.



**Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency**. So good. I highly recommend it if you've never seen it. I wish more Douglas Adams books were on tv.

**Pushing Daisies**. Beautiful show, everything about it is pleasing. I would pay for more episodes if I could. 

**Legion**. I don't think any show nails weird shit like this, had a nightmare or two from this. Almost done with it. 

**Wilfred US**. Maybe I just like Elijah Wood but I have watched this show countless times and it's great every time. It sucks at answering your questions though. 

**Doom Patrol** A bit dramatic and pretentious at times but probably the most unique show super power type show I've ever seen. I enjoy it much more than Umbrella Academy 

**Wellington Paranormal**. Amazing little show from New Zealand in the same universe as What We Do In The Shadows. 


Finally finished **Westworld** too. There's a type of fear and disgust that only this show can give me. I really hope the AIs don't wake up in my lifetime."
Refresh Man,"**bad sisters** whoever recommended this, good spot!

its absolutely excellent, especially as i know people like this."
Refresh Man,Bad Sisters is great so far!
Refresh Man,"*Sandman* still not renewed for a second season... I'm starting to get worried. C'mon Netflix, dont fuck this up please."
Refresh Man,"Just finished ‘The Bear’ on FX. And I have to say, it’s possibly the best cooking related drama I’ve watched on screen. It has Solid characters, excellent direction and an enigmatic plot that just keeps you hooked. I blitzed through it in like 2 days."
Refresh Man,"Started watching The Great, finally. 
Absolutely love it. It’s so many things in one show. 

Huzzah!

*smash*"
Refresh Man,"the patient on hulu with steve carrell and domhnall gleeson. they definitely throw you right into it, which i honestly appreciated. i just hate how they only released two episodes, definitely feels like a show i should be bingeing. 

also, wow i did not recognize domhnall gleeson at first! he truly is an underrated actor. the irish seem to be masters of pulling off american accents too hahah. excited to see how this one plays out."
Refresh Man,"Just finished The Shield for the first time. Oh man, what a ride. Still reflecting on the last episode."
Refresh Man,"Just finished **Halt and Catch Fire**. Absolutely phenomenal! I need more drama driven period dramas!

Any recs?"
Refresh Man,"**Rings of Power** was absolutely sick I don't care what anyone says.

I'm a lifelong Tolkien nerd and while a few liberties are taken with the events it feels very true to the spirit of what he wrote. Lots of Silmarillion easter eggs throughout too."
Refresh Man,[deleted]
Refresh Man,"Dopesick
A fascinating journey on addiction as well as the story on OxyContin. Great watch.

The Rings of Power
Sometimes you just don’t know how much you miss Tolkiens world till you visit it again. It’s gonna be watched by a lot of generations. Dwarf kiddos are awesome 👏"
Refresh Man,"'Rings of Power' was excellent, much better than 'The Hobbit' so they're on the right track. I'm very much a casual fan of Tolkien's work, I've read the trilogy once but nothing else, and it was perfect for me. I guess more hardcore fans are less excited but I hope people give it a chance and that Amazon doesn't cut its losses just yet if it doesn't blow up immediately. I don't like the fact that its only 8 episodes, I need these shows to starts producing 16 episodes a year instead of 8-10."
Refresh Man,"*Bad Sisters* led me to ***Motherland***, another Sharon Horgan show, and fuck if I don't love this little UK comedy. I haven't laughed out loud like this at a TV show in a long time. Anyone watch this? I can't believe I'm just now discovering it. It's on AMC+ in the US btw. I think I have a crush on Diane Morgan."
Refresh Man,Started watching Banshee. Im at season 3 now and i find it incredible! Really good action and fighting with an interesting story.
Refresh Man,"Primal is so fucking good. It gets mentioned here and there, but not nearly as much as it should imo."
Refresh Man,I’m actually looking for recommendations. I absolutely loved Haunting of Hill House and Midnight Mass. It’s the psychological realism of both that speak to me. I was wondering if anyone can recommend me something similar to those two.
Refresh Man,"**Rings of Power** was pretty good. It definitely exceeded my expectations. The music and set pieces are amazing. The plot is engaging as well, hopefully it will continue to do so.

**House of the Dragon** is amazing. I think all the actors have done spectacularly so far and it reminds me of early GOT.

**She Hulk** is decent. It’s pretty standard for Marvel but I like it.

**See** on AppleTV+ is good too.

I also watched **Severance**, which is an amazing show if no one has seen it I suggest you do so."
Refresh Man,"Currently loving The Rehearsal (I love Nathan for You so that makes sense) - on the last ep.

Does anyone have any recommendations for spooky season? I've watched Yellowjackets and that was ok, I stopped watching TWD a while back. My favorite show to watch every autumn is Over the Garden Wall.

edit: Thanks for all the recs! Keep em coming if you got any more! I've seen Haunting of Hill House and I think everything by Mike Flanagan, and liked it. I've seen American Horror Story up to season 9 also - don't know if S10 is worth watching."
Refresh Man,"The Patient, from the creators of The Americans starring Steve Carell and Domnhall Gleeson is a really good watch. Its a psychologial thrillers and the show hooks you right away. The episodes are only 20-minutes and flies by"
Refresh Man,"Just caught up on ""The Capture"" on BBC, it is great fun."
Refresh Man,The Other Two. A very fun little thing with lots of jokes about the entertainment industry. Hope it survives the Max culling
Refresh Man,"Man. I’m watching a lot of things, but The Rings of Power is just stunning. >!Númenor!!!!<"
Refresh Man,"Currently watching

**For All Mankind S3**- about half way through the season. So far so good. The space scenes are really enjoyable and up there with the expanse. 

**Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power** - watched the first episode. As someone who has only seen the Peter Jackson movies as the basis of understanding of LOTR, I enjoyed it. Cinematography is out of this world. People complaining about lack of story 2 episodes in need to have some patience. 

**The Thick of It S3** - Malcolm Tucker is one of the best characters I’ve seen. So happy to pick up this show since I’ve been missing Veep."
Refresh Man,"Been watching **See** on Apple TV this last week and I can't believe how much I misjudged the show when I first read about it years ago.
Yes, their abilities are sometimes a little ridiculous but it's a fresh setting with some truly unique fighting choreography and camera/sound work. Also has (mostly) non-annoying teenage actors which you don't see often."
Refresh Man,"LOTR & GOT 2.0

Went into both with really low expectations, was positively surprised and very well entertained. I like the mix of seriousness with a bit of ""light heartedness"" in the Lotr series, reminds one of the trilogy without going overboard with the latter like in the Hobbit. \>!That Ork ""introduction"" was fucking awesome! This whole scene was great, like a little well executed horror movie!<

Edit: I see, the spoiler system in that sub is still utter garbage. At least it doesn't seem to work with boost, but not really a spoiler anyways, Orks and Lotr shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone really."
Refresh Man,**Obi-Wan Kenobi** - It was ok. Didn't reach *The Mandalorian*'s quality and didn't sunk like *The Book of Boba Fett*. I was hoping Ewan McGregor's performance will have a more epic feel but it was fine. Maybe after watching tons of shows and getting older it's harder for me to feel very impressed.
Refresh Man,"week to week is getting packed for me: She Hulk, LOTR, House of the Dragon, now Rick and Morty coming up and Atlanta soon. 

waiting to binge: Cyberpunk Edgerunners, WWDITS, Reservation Dogs, Primal."
Refresh Man,"Just finished **Halt and Catch Fire** season 1. 

It’s a solid show, hasn’t been mind blowing or anything but very solid and good watch. Will continue season 2 tomorrow."
Refresh Man,"Dark Winds.  If you're a fan of Tony Hillerman, the American Southwest, etc, it's a must watch."
Refresh Man,"Really enjoyed Paper Girls, as a big fan of the comic series I thought they did a great job adapting the characters. Hoping for a Season 2 announcement!"
Refresh Man,"Good time to be a Fantasy fan, currently watching weekly **House of the Dragon** which is pretty good and **The Rings of Power** which was more or less better than I thought it would be but i'm reserving judgement for now.

Also finished T**he Americans**, season 6 made this series into one of my top 10 shows. A magnificent series from start to finish."
Refresh Man,"**Sprung**

From Greg Garcia who did *My name is Earl*. 

It’s a very entertaining sitcom about 3 prisoners who get released early due to Covid and move in together.

It airs on Amazon’s free streaming service [Freevee](https://www.amazon.com/adlp/freevee-about)"
Refresh Man,"Started and finished **Kleo**. German show about an East German spy getting revenge on people around 1990 when the Berlin Wall had fallen and East Germany was about to collapse. The revenge and deaths were good. The three main characters, Kleo, the police officer Sven and the drug addict Thilo were all great. The other characters were also good and there was a nice variety to them. The aesthetic of the time and the music chosen, a mix of normal 80s music and various communist songs was also good (and if you watch with English subtitles it gives you the name of the songs, which is nice). The show gets the mix of drama, action and comedy right.  Criticism - Minor thing but the descriptions of each episode on Netflix are more spoilery than normal. The end was fine but not great compared to the rest of the show, the journey was better than the destination. The first episode is far darker tonally than the rest of the show and is probably one of the weaker episodes. I mean there is still a lot of murder but it feels a bit more lighthearted. Final arbitrary number rating 7.75/10

Also started and finished **Dead Set** . Zombie (runners) show based around the British Big Brother TV show in 2008. By Charlie Brooker who did Black Mirror. The characters were good and there was a good mix. The boss/producer is very good at being an arsehole who you want to be eaten by zombies. Plenty of gore and the action is decent. Five episodes, the first episode is normal length for TV but the rest are under half an hour which is nice. So it is short and can be gotten through quickly. Final arbitrary number rating 7.5/10

Started **1983**. Polish alt-history mystery story where the Soviet Union never fell. 1st episode is fine and I will probably keep watching but I suspect it will be one of the weaker shows I watch this year. But it is only 8 episodes and so far the mystery, although it seems to be predictable (based off the first episode I'm guessing the alt-history terrorist attacks were done by the Communist government to encourage unity or something like that, but that is the blatant obvious guess), is interesting enough for me to keep going."
Refresh Man,"Just finished The Sandman. It's got to be the deepest into fantasy genre I've ever gone, and I'm hooked. I felt episode 1 was good, but also that if I didn't watch episode 2 right away, I might not ever do it. After that, each episode drew me in more and more until one night I had to binge the last 5 episodes."
Refresh Man,"I started and finished *The Expanse* in two weeks (I think). I don't think that's especially quick, but I do feel empty inside now. I have plenty of anime to watch (current season current, current season behind, previous seasons behind, and just watch behinds). I'm debating if my next series should be *His Dark Materials* or *The Outlaws* or *For All Mankind* or *The Witcher*. 


I could finish *The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina* but I'm not really that vested in it even though I only have four episodes left to watch. I could also finish *The Flight Attendant*. I really enjoyed season 1 when I watched it a few months ago but the first episode of season 2 does not do it for me. 


I like that so much content exist, but it essentially results in me wanting to watch nothing."
Refresh Man,"Episodes 3 and 4 of **the capture** season 2 released yesterday

This show is shaping up to be a lot like Mr Robot in terms of quality, cinematography, and technology

It's got to be the best show airing rn"
Refresh Man,"currently watching game of thrones for the first time

almost finished s1 and highly recommend it

daily reminder to watch mr robot btw"
Refresh Man,"
**House of the Dragon** - No question about it. I am ready to be hurt again.  Loved the first two episodes. 

**Rings of Power** - Hmm. First two episodes were…ok? I don’t know. Definitely didn’t hook me in any way. Hardly remember anything about it. Beautiful at times but something is missing for sure. 

**Extraordinary Attorney Woo** - Extremely charming and touching Korean courtroom drama on Netflix. Not usually into courtroom shows but this is pretty great.  Park Eun-bin who plays the autistic Woo Young-woo is incredible and so quirky.  I can’t even count the times I just start smiling while watching.  Half way through the 16 episode season and it’s brilliant. 

**Welcome to Wrexham** - Great watch. Love to see the behind the scenes stuff of such a historical club and the involvement of Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney. 

Also **Delhi Crime S2**,  **See S3**, and  **Surface**"
Refresh Man,"Finished **Game Of Thrones S4**, elite tier season imo 10/10.

It took me so long to get into this show, back when it was airing I really did not like it but watching it now has me completely hooked on it."
Refresh Man,This Fool being set in the same verse as Corporate is hilarious.
Refresh Man,"Just started and finished peaky blinders in about three weeks was absolutely hooked, phenomenal acting, amazing sets, and I loved the time period. All in all the show was amazing and kept me captivated every episode until the very end. Need something new now looking for recommendations."
Refresh Man,"First two episodes of Pantheon.

An animated Matrix-like show about VR and the Singularity based on short stories by Ken Liu.

It's *really* good so far. Lots of suspense and sci fi mysteries, and some really eerie corporate villains.

If the rest of the season keeps up the pace, it's going to fight Invincible and Solar Opposite as favorite new animated TV show."
Refresh Man,"Storm Of The Century.

Watched it years ago when it was on tv. Really enjoyed watching it again as it was added to Hulu.

If you like Stephen King it’s a must watch"
Refresh Man,"Harley Quinn S3 has been incredible! The show hasn't missed a beat. Harvey Guilliment from What we do in the shadows as Nightwing was so good, and I think his episode might be one of the best episode of Harley Quinn.

Really enjoying HOTD, it's really well done.

Rings of Power is good so far, hasn't grown on me yet.

What we do in the shadows S4 was better than the wildly inconsistent S3 but nowhere near the quality of S1 and 2."

Refresh Man,"4 episodes into **The Sandman**, I'm slowly but very surely warming up to it. Each one is better than the last. >!John Dee!< went from a character I didn't care about to probably the most intriguing character on the show with just a single episode. 

It's just really fun to watch a high-budget fantasy show with a clearly established world, and the original creator's touch all over it. You feel the passion."

Refresh Man,I finished The Killing (US) on Disney+ and I really really loved it. Any recommendations for something similar?
Refresh Man,Just finished better call saul S5... This show is so good not very far from breaking bad. Just one season left i will miss this show.
Refresh Man,"I iust binged Hilda, loved it and only a few episodes and a movie left. Help me pick my next animated series to watch.

Centaurworld  
The Cuphead Show  
Green Eggs and Ham S2 (loved S1, but I heard S2 is a step down, though I wouldn't mind so long as it's still somewhat entertaining, and beautiful to look at)  
Kid Cosmic S3 (loved S1, S2 is kind of alright, is S3 a good wrap up to the series?)  
...
Any other recommendations?

I have only been exploring Netflix, but I also have Disney+ sub if you have any recommendations there. Thanks."
Refresh Man,"I'm rewatching **The Kominsky Method**. Really lovely writing and acting and everything. Something I noticed this time around is that after the credits there's a ""Pearl of wisdom"" from the writer/creator Chuck Lorre. Funny and touching show, watch it if you haven't.

**The House of the Dragon**, episode 3. >!I appreciated the touches of humor (the poor bastard being squashed by the dragon and a couple more). I think that in GoT much of the humor came from the wit of Tyrion, and of course there's no Tyrion here. As far as the Crabeater guy goes, I had a bit of ptsd going back to Snoke from Star Wars, and how much of a let down that guy was. He showed considerable promise as an opponent and he didn't deserve a death on camera.!<

>!Btw, did anybody else notice how filthy the tapestries of the palace are? For example the one behind Rhaenyra late in the episode, when she's back in the palace. It could get its own Pornhub category.!<

>!I think I'm going to miss Milly Alcock when they change the actress for an older Rhaenyra. I guess that's life (in Westeros)!<"
Refresh Man,"Finished **The Resort**, pretty content with how they ended the season. Hopefully there's going to be a second season but I'm content with what they had.  

Went through **Tekken: Bloodline** since I liked the screwed up Mishima storyline. Very loosely adapted and I'm annoyed by the shading done on the characters. 

Gave **Pantheon** a shot since I love me some tech stuff. Interesting concept and they have some pretty banging tunes."
Refresh Man,"Finally watched Russian Doll season 1, it's so good but it left me with 2 questions; why the fuck did they make a season 2? And should I watch season 2?"
Refresh Man,"Welcome to Wrexham is a brilliant documentary. I was skeptical but man it’s done so well and the story moves ahead fast. Can’t wait to see how it ends, though I would easily google it. But I want to see the rest of the episodes and the journey."
Refresh Man,"**Kevin Can F\*\*k Himself (AMC):** I binged season 1 a couple weeks ago. I like this show but have reached the point where I dread the sitcom scenes and am just waiting for them to be over.  Really hope this second and final season is good and gets a satisfying ending. It's a good mid-tier show that's worth giving a chance if you're intrigued by the premise, but nothing amazing. 

**Bad Sisters (Apple TV):** I am loving this so far and can't wait for the next episodes! The actors are all great."
Refresh Man,"I'm watching **The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power**. So far, it's a little above expectations! The visuals are stunning, the writing's OK, it's just moving slowly IMO."
Refresh Man,"**House of the Dragon episode 2-** Absoutely loved it, oh that bridge scene was so good, can't wait for episode 3

**The patient-** Episodes were a bit short i thought but the premise is fascinating, and Steve Carell is great 

**The Capture-** great show, dealing with deep fake technology and how it can be used to manipulate 

**She Hulk Attorney at law-** What a hilarious episode, loved those court scenes as well

**Resident alien-** Another fantastic episode with a great twist i didn't see it coming 

**Five days at memorial-** 6th episode was great, only 2 episodes left now, such a sad event

**Stargirl-** Only CW show i am watching mainly because it is so different than others, first episode of season 3 was quite good 

**Rings of power-** I was a bit apprehensive about this show due to all the hate it was getting, and i really enjoyed it.. granted, episode 1 was quite slow but there were interesting moments, episode 2 though was amazing and it moved the plot forward, there are enough mysteries as well and the visuals are so good"
Refresh Man,Is **the Last Kingdom** any good? Thinking about starting it
Refresh Man,"So I finally watched the Loki series over 3 days! Surprised how much I enjoyed it and I am glad I finally gave it a chance.  

Watched the first episode of  Orange is the new Black :)"
Refresh Man,"bit late to the party but **The Sandman**

wow.  i am absolutely loving it.  zero familiarity with the source material so this one has been a surprise.

I think of all the fantasy tv thats come out in recent memory, this might be my favorite.  Funny because generally I am much more of a LOTR, orcs and trolls kind of guy.  I am a huge Tolkien and Wheel of Time fan, and while I am enjoying Rings more than I thought I would and didn't hate WoT as much as most, its this Sandman show that has really captivated me.

Its just so fucking fun to watch.  Its wildly creative in its filmmaking (the Lucifer vs Dream scene ""i am a universe"" is one of the best showdown scenes in any medium I can think of), fantastic acting with Dream being an utterly compelling protagonist, visually gorgeous, very effective use of adult material without being over the top... its just great.  It nails that elusive balance between taking itself seriously and being a bit campy.  I cannot wait for more.  I love how each episode feels very different, I love how weird things get (the whole diner bit was so out there in a good way), I love everything about it.  Great soundtrack too, was stoked to hear Bob Moses - Desire as the end credits song in one ep"
Refresh Man,"The Rehearsal was great. 

If you like Nathan For You or How to With John Wilson, you'll like this, and maybe his next show...."

Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory,"When I was a kid watching it on toonami I thought it was a mecha show about a whining teen pilot.

I learned it was truly what showed me war is fought by kids, 16-19 year olds who should be making love, or riding bikes in the park. It's deeper than you gave it credit for. The last battle, which takes place over 3 episodes has some of the most heart string drama and best space battles I've see.

Amuro isn't whining, he has PTSD and combat fatigue."

Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory,Seed was like a shot for shot remake at some points.
Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory,The Gundam Origins OVA is a prequel to Mobile Suit Gundam... sorta. It’s technically pulled from the Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin manga which was a retelling of Mobile Suit Gundam and is made by one of the original illustrators of the show. It changes a few things from the original series but but you can still watch the Gundam Origins OVAs as prequel content to the original series.
Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory,"This is correct. Gundam has 2 universes to it

1. ""The Universal Century"" which is what the ""main"" story of Gundam is. Its a massive war between the Zeon and the Earth Federation

2. Pretty much everything NOT the Universal Century. These are just one off worlds/dimensions that exist to tell a single story in a season, they have no relation to the Universal Century. These stories are actually more popular in terms of viewership- ""G Gundam"" (my favorite) Iron Blooded Orphans Gundam Seed and Gundam Wing

The UC is about 2 guys, Amuro Ray who is the protagonist and Char Aznable who is the anti-villain of the show. Gundam Origins gives us the backstory of Char Aznable. Gundam Origins is hella tight though, its effectively a Monte Cristo story"
Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory,Origins won't make sense until you watch the original series.
Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory,"I'll confirm it.  Sure. 

I've seen most of the gundam universe, and honestly don't have any idea what goes where, but I'll confirm it

Shining Finger! buh buh da buh da ba da!"
Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory,"The free version of crunchyroll has pretty much everything (barring certain original stuff), you just have to wait a week for new things and a lot of stuff isn't in HD."

Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory,Isn’t it cheaper than every other streaming service?
Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory,"> The cost is a little high for the amount of anime I would watch

Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory,MSG had already showed up on Funi's streaming service and a lot of their offerings end up on Hulu so who knows.
Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory,They did just release a hello kitty gundam.
Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory,"The animation is dated and there was a lot of goofiness, because it had a lot of super robot tropes.

I'd try the movie trilogy, but it's not properly dubbed or legally available."
Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory,"Try “War in the Pocket” gundam. Only 6 episodes. 

Most “universal century” gundam series are confusing, with weird names for characters, and a lot of it can be hard to keep track of. 

But not War in the Pocket.
It’s a lovely story. And if it’s still not your cup of tea after episode 1, no worries! Don’t force yourself just because others enjoy it. You probably already have things you enjoy anyway.

(Hopefully that one is on steaming. But you might also just be able to rent it)"
Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory,"That's because despite the love, the old show is actually boring as hell, like an old episode of speed racer.  Try gundam unicorn."
Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory,"Honestly, the simple omission of the G-fighter, G-bull, etc is enough on its own to make the movies vastly superior to the show."
Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory,"Lucas stole the idea for light sabers from pulp science fiction stories from the the nineteen teens and movie serials from the thirties and forties. Hell the word ""Jedi"" is a bastardization of the term used in Japan for samurai films."
Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory,The soundtrack is also streaming on Spotify!
Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory,"The soundtrack is so kitschy and I absolutely love it. My favourite track has got to be [From Sleep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFoKkeTmYp4&list=PLE234F313FF53A39C&index=3), especially from 1:16 onward.

EDIT: And how can I forget the incredibly funky [Combat Airspace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eszG8ww2GlQ&list=PLx9EEzTlMf5kEWPUK_a-q8OuVmHvf7ts5&index=5)!"
Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory,[I also love that it](https://youtu.be/_lOeFQvA-uM) [got a cover album by Andrew W. K. of all people.](https://youtu.be/zILVdHewOZ8)
Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory,"To be fair, OG Gundam created most of the tropes that have become the standard for long form war anime series. The price of being a genre defining game changer."
Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory,"Still, I advise everyone to watch the updated theatrical(1-3) or read the modernized series(the origin) instead. 

They are far more organized and accessible."
Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory,Already is and on HBO Max
Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory,"I checked it out, it's not anything new just a little less blurry."
Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory,"You know what got me? I rewatched it and Bright is the only survivor of the original crew, he was a military cadet in training. He was 19 years old. Not even an Ensign rank. And he was supposed to not only captain the most advanced ship in the fleet, but wrangle a bunch of literal kids. He is basically doing a Battlestar Galactica. I feel for him this time around. I watch the show in abject horror at like 25 as all the people dying except like Ramba Ral were 6 or 9 years younger than me.
Lalah Sunn was a genius bit of writing too if you watch further in the shows."
Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory,"Turns out when you do stories with a lot of depressing themes and death, you probably have depression."
Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory,"""Shut up and get in the Gundam, Amuro.""

Bright Noa is basically Gendo Ikari."
Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory,It’s like Evangelion if Evangelion was even slightly comprehensible.
Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory,"Victory and Zeta had very dark moments, ZZ for the first half was slapstick and hammy but fans are rewarded once the theme song changes"
Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory,">Zambot 3

Thanks I'll definitely give it a watch. The reason I specified ""one of the most influential"" instead of the first or the beginning was exactly for shows like zambot and giant robot animes that came before it. 

I think Mobile suit specifically was like a big breaking point or milestone in the entire history of mecha anime. I remember hearing stories that when it's film premiered in cinemas they literally couldn't fit all the people who came to see it in the theatre because tomino apparently had a big announcement. They didn't expect it's popularity to be so wild. There are people who apparently recorded entire episodes of the show onto casette tapes just to listen on their walkmen and casette players. 

The vinyl was released and THAT became a best seller. 

tl;dr it was a huge fucking show."
Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory,"They did that in the Bandai Visual release, so I'm not sure exactly what the deal is."
Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory,"I’m just referencing a meme from r/Gundam.

Someone did the math and it’s two or three days short of one year."
Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory,Seed was more a remake of Wing IMO and Wing was a super-condensed remake of MSG+Zeta+CCA.
Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory,Yeah Seed was probably the worst regarding this. Still enjoyed it though
Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory,"To elaborate, the original show was hampered by a combination of factors. The show was required by it's sponsors and producers to have a robot fight in every episode. The producers and sponsors meddled with the show constantly, forcing the creative staff to add designs to the show that only existed to make toys (most notably the G fighter or as Tomino called it, the coffin the series would be buried in) and forced them to make kid friendly episodes that broke with the rest of the narrative of the show. In addition, the show's run was cut from 52 episodes to 43. Also the main animator Yoshikazu Yasuhiko suffered from a severe medical crisis during the production of the show and was hospitalized about halfway through the run until the show's completion.

As a result of these limitations, major parts of the story such as the origins of Char Aznable and Sala Mass were cut for time as well as a planned flashback episode which would have explained much of the backstory to the runup to the one year war. The origin comic sought to remedy these issues as well as give the designs and tone a facelift to match the modern incarnations of the Universal Century. I'd highly recommend reading it. Yoshikazu Yasuhiko is an astonishingly talented artist and storyteller.  Not only are the drawings amazing, but the panel layouts, pacing, transitions and expressions are absolutely top notch. Unfortunately the vast majority of Yaz's comics have not been translated into English so the origin is one of only two comics he drew that you can get that isn't in Japanese."
Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory,Thanks!
Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory,"G Gundam is absolutely hilarious. A martial arts tournament in giant ass robots, with all the characters and their respective nations being *hella* stereotyped. Funny as fuck. I mean, just look at [Master Asia's introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03Fdj3pVW6w) here."

Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team,I liked G Gundam. I liked Gundam Wing more.
Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team,"Yeah if I'm recommending something to non-anime fans, MSG is not where I'd usually start. It can be...tedious. It is more for the anime fan who wants to see the classic roots of a franchise that now spans several universes."
Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team,"9/11 happened and killed off the anime that was ""too serious."" Then Toonami got moved to Saturday and Miguzi, which was lighter fare with shows like Teen Titans and Code Lyoko, took over on weekdays."
Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team,"Oh man, is it your first time watching? You're in for a ride! Definitely check out Zeta Gundam when you finish and the rest of the UC and other Gundam and mecha stuff in general. There's some incredible stuff out there that deals with some really heavy themes.

If you have any questions or need reccomendations, the folks over at r/Gundam are super friendly! Welcome, fellow Newtype!"
Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team,"They simply replaced the opening song on the blu-ray, surely they could do that for streaming."
Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team,"I haven't seen Gundam and don't know the story of it beyond that people pilot robots but if a war happened *within* one year then I think ""One Year War"" is an appropriate name for it."
Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team,Seed was like a shot for shot remake at some points.
Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team,The Gundam Origins OVA is a prequel to Mobile Suit Gundam... sorta. It’s technically pulled from the Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin manga which was a retelling of Mobile Suit Gundam and is made by one of the original illustrators of the show. It changes a few things from the original series but but you can still watch the Gundam Origins OVAs as prequel content to the original series.
Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team,"This is correct. Gundam has 2 universes to it

1. ""The Universal Century"" which is what the ""main"" story of Gundam is. Its a massive war between the Zeon and the Earth Federation

2. Pretty much everything NOT the Universal Century. These are just one off worlds/dimensions that exist to tell a single story in a season, they have no relation to the Universal Century. These stories are actually more popular in terms of viewership- ""G Gundam"" (my favorite) Iron Blooded Orphans Gundam Seed and Gundam Wing

The UC is about 2 guys, Amuro Ray who is the protagonist and Char Aznable who is the anti-villain of the show. Gundam Origins gives us the backstory of Char Aznable. Gundam Origins is hella tight though, its effectively a Monte Cristo story"
Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team,Origins won't make sense until you watch the original series.
Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team,"I'll confirm it.  Sure. 

I've seen most of the gundam universe, and honestly don't have any idea what goes where, but I'll confirm it

Shining Finger! buh buh da buh da ba da!"
Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team,"The free version of crunchyroll has pretty much everything (barring certain original stuff), you just have to wait a week for new things and a lot of stuff isn't in HD."
Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team,">The cost is a little high for the amount of anime I would watch

I watch crunchyroll free of charge without ads. Just use an adblocking browser extension."
Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team,Isn’t it cheaper than every other streaming service?
Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team,"> The cost is a little high for the amount of anime I would watch

They also have some non-anime stuff like 
 cherry magic that was one of top shows in japan last year https://www.crunchyroll.com/cherry-magic-thirty-years-of-virginity-can-make-you-a-wizard"
Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team,MSG had already showed up on Funi's streaming service and a lot of their offerings end up on Hulu so who knows.
Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team,They did just release a hello kitty gundam.
Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team,"The animation is dated and there was a lot of goofiness, because it had a lot of super robot tropes.

I'd try the movie trilogy, but it's not properly dubbed or legally available."
Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team,"Try “War in the Pocket” gundam. Only 6 episodes. 

Most “universal century” gundam series are confusing, with weird names for characters, and a lot of it can be hard to keep track of. 

But not War in the Pocket.
It’s a lovely story. And if it’s still not your cup of tea after episode 1, no worries! Don’t force yourself just because others enjoy it. You probably already have things you enjoy anyway.

(Hopefully that one is on steaming. But you might also just be able to rent it)"
Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team,"That's because despite the love, the old show is actually boring as hell, like an old episode of speed racer.  Try gundam unicorn."
Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team,"Honestly, the simple omission of the G-fighter, G-bull, etc is enough on its own to make the movies vastly superior to the show."
Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team,"Lucas stole the idea for light sabers from pulp science fiction stories from the the nineteen teens and movie serials from the thirties and forties. Hell the word ""Jedi"" is a bastardization of the term used in Japan for samurai films."
Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team,The soundtrack is also streaming on Spotify!
Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team,"The soundtrack is so kitschy and I absolutely love it. My favourite track has got to be [From Sleep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFoKkeTmYp4&list=PLE234F313FF53A39C&index=3), especially from 1:16 onward.

EDIT: And how can I forget the incredibly funky [Combat Airspace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eszG8ww2GlQ&list=PLx9EEzTlMf5kEWPUK_a-q8OuVmHvf7ts5&index=5)!"
Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team,[I also love that it](https://youtu.be/_lOeFQvA-uM) [got a cover album by Andrew W. K. of all people.](https://youtu.be/zILVdHewOZ8)
Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team,"To be fair, OG Gundam created most of the tropes that have become the standard for long form war anime series. The price of being a genre defining game changer."
Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team,"Still, I advise everyone to watch the updated theatrical(1-3) or read the modernized series(the origin) instead. 

They are far more organized and accessible."
Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team,Already is and on HBO Max
Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team,"I checked it out, it's not anything new just a little less blurry."
Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team,"You know what got me? I rewatched it and Bright is the only survivor of the original crew, he was a military cadet in training. He was 19 years old. Not even an Ensign rank. And he was supposed to not only captain the most advanced ship in the fleet, but wrangle a bunch of literal kids. He is basically doing a Battlestar Galactica. I feel for him this time around. I watch the show in abject horror at like 25 as all the people dying except like Ramba Ral were 6 or 9 years younger than me.
Lalah Sunn was a genius bit of writing too if you watch further in the shows."
Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team,"Turns out when you do stories with a lot of depressing themes and death, you probably have depression."

Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team,It’s like Evangelion if Evangelion was even slightly comprehensible.
Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team,"Victory and Zeta had very dark moments, ZZ for the first half was slapstick and hammy but fans are rewarded once the theme song changes"
Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team,">Zambot 3

Thanks I'll definitely give it a watch. The reason I specified ""one of the most influential"" instead of the first or the beginning was exactly for shows like zambot and giant robot animes that came before it. 

I think Mobile suit specifically was like a big breaking point or milestone in the entire history of mecha anime. I remember hearing stories that when it's film premiered in cinemas they literally couldn't fit all the people who came to see it in the theatre because tomino apparently had a big announcement. They didn't expect it's popularity to be so wild. There are people who apparently recorded entire episodes of the show onto casette tapes just to listen on their walkmen and casette players. 

The vinyl was released and THAT became a best seller. 

tl;dr it was a huge fucking show."
Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team,"They did that in the Bandai Visual release, so I'm not sure exactly what the deal is."
Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team,"I’m just referencing a meme from r/Gundam.

Someone did the math and it’s two or three days short of one year."
Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team,Seed was more a remake of Wing IMO and Wing was a super-condensed remake of MSG+Zeta+CCA.
Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team,Yeah Seed was probably the worst regarding this. Still enjoyed it though
Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team,"To elaborate, the original show was hampered by a combination of factors. The show was required by it's sponsors and producers to have a robot fight in every episode. The producers and sponsors meddled with the show constantly, forcing the creative staff to add designs to the show that only existed to make toys (most notably the G fighter or as Tomino called it, the coffin the series would be buried in) and forced them to make kid friendly episodes that broke with the rest of the narrative of the show. In addition, the show's run was cut from 52 episodes to 43. Also the main animator Yoshikazu Yasuhiko suffered from a severe medical crisis during the production of the show and was hospitalized about halfway through the run until the show's completion.

As a result of these limitations, major parts of the story such as the origins of Char Aznable and Sala Mass were cut for time as well as a planned flashback episode which would have explained much of the backstory to the runup to the one year war. The origin comic sought to remedy these issues as well as give the designs and tone a facelift to match the modern incarnations of the Universal Century. I'd highly recommend reading it. Yoshikazu Yasuhiko is an astonishingly talented artist and storyteller.  Not only are the drawings amazing, but the panel layouts, pacing, transitions and expressions are absolutely top notch. Unfortunately the vast majority of Yaz's comics have not been translated into English so the origin is one of only two comics he drew that you can get that isn't in Japanese."
Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team,Thanks!
Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team,"G Gundam is absolutely hilarious. A martial arts tournament in giant ass robots, with all the characters and their respective nations being *hella* stereotyped. Funny as fuck. I mean, just look at [Master Asia's introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03Fdj3pVW6w) here."
Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team,"You’re forgetting the third type of series, build fighters, where kids build and battle figures based on the shows."
West Coast Customs,Any idea if any of the DVD's or streaming sites have both versions of the episode?  I am curious to see the slight differences that must happen.
West Coast Customs,"That's why they originally invented videotape. In radio, it was common to do the show twice for the two coasts, but for TV it was too expensive. So, they did the show live on the east coast, and during that showing they would take a movie camera (as in film) and point it at a TV set and take a movie of the live picture. Then, they would rush it to processing and 3 hours later show the film.

Since you couldn't do it twice, and failure could not be tolerated, they would take TWO films, send them via different routes to two different processing plants.  It was hyper-expensive, but still cheaper than performing it twice.

So, when Ampex first demonstrated the video tape machine in 1956 (which was the size of a commercial stove and refrigerator standing together, and required a full-time engineer to tend it) CBS waved a blank check at them and ordered two on the spot"
West Coast Customs,ER did it even before The West Wing
West Coast Customs,"The way the entire debate devolves into talking points unrelated tangents like how to ""fix"" Africa just adds to the realism."
West Coast Customs,Which one is on Netflix ?
West Coast Customs,"I think 30 rock did the same thing, though that was obviously a lighter comedy script and had a cast with a lot of people who were already veterans/frequent hosts of SNL. "
West Coast Customs,"Wow, I had no idea that episode was live when I binged the series on Netflix. The cast did a great job."
West Coast Customs,"I knew it aired live on the East Coast, but I didn't realize they did a second live version for the West Coast. Very cool!"
West Coast Customs,"""YOU'RE THE LIAR!""

I love that guy."
West Coast Customs,">It must take a lot of skill to go from scripted drama to live broadcast AND do it twice! 

I mean, that's called theater."
West Coast Customs,"Seasons six and seven of The West Wing are extremely underrated. In fact, I put them above seasons three and four (when Sorkin was still involved). "
West Coast Customs,I find this episode to be terrible. The amount of hubris it takes to air that kind of experiment is not minuscule.
West Coast Customs,Isn't everything filmed live?
West Coast Customs,[removed]
West Coast Customs,"From  [WestWingWiki](http://westwing.wikia.com/wiki/The_Debate)

> The West Coast version is on the DVDs and the East Coast version is currently unavailable anywhere. "
West Coast Customs,Yeah? Well 30 Rock did it after!
West Coast Customs,ER was a fucking terrific show.
West Coast Customs,Oh yeahhhh
West Coast Customs,Probably the West Coast version. 
West Coast Customs,"They did, and it was brilliant!  They kept cutting away to flashbacks with different actors playing the main characters."
West Coast Customs,*The Bill* did it twice.
West Coast Customs,"True, but most live theater is done in front of a few thousand people at the most, not broadcast to millions. "
West Coast Customs,"I'm inclined to agree. They did what I thought they should have done with Bartlet's run for reelection, and made it a contest between two characters of similar weight played by household names, either of whom you could have pictured taking over the show.  It made the series feel less predictable."
West Coast Customs,You have to be autistic to notice differences now?
West Coast Customs,"Wonder why the West Coast was picked, maybe it went more smoothly, or maybe a change was made in the script between the two shows."
West Coast Customs,I've never done it!
West Coast Customs,"30 rock did it twice as well, and they did a west coast and east coast version of each one, so they sort of did it 4 times."
West Coast Customs,"To that extreme, yes. "
West Coast Customs,both versions are on in the DVD box set. 
West Coast Customs,"Jimmy Smits' performance on the West Coast version was better, hence that's the one used for reruns and on DVD. "
West Coast Customs,you just haven't met the right girl yet
West Coast Customs,"You seem to be very misinformed/ naive if you think that, then."
West Coast Customs,"good to know, thanks!"
West Coast Customs,Yes I have.
West Coast Customs,Hi. I work with autistic kids. He is. 
West Coast Customs,"You are doing loving and wonderful work.



Thank you."
West Coast Customs,"It never really occurred to me that it didn't (live in east coast). I just figured that because it was Saturday night, there wasn't anything else on. They're definitely going to get a huge boost moving it to prime-time."
West Coast Customs,That's a whole lot more pressure for a show that just dropped an F bomb last month.
West Coast Customs,Spiceys ramping it up nation wide! 
West Coast Customs,Back when the XFL was around the west coast would get SNL in primetime not live but sometimes it would be really close
West Coast Customs,"weird, maybe this is just a Canada thing, but on the West Coast we always had access to both the eastern and western feeds of shows. It was nice having prime-time air at 5pm, with the ability to catch repeats of the shows you missed at 8:00pm."
West Coast Customs,"Yeah, for the western half of the U.S., ""Saturday Night Live"" has never been live.

Just another recorded live show, like any talk show or sitcom with an audience."
West Coast Customs,"Not a huge SNL fan but I never realized it was actually live for anyone (I've always lived on the West Coast). 

I thought it was like talk shows that film in the morning and then air it at night, keeping most messups in but removing FCC violations. "
West Coast Customs,When 30 Rock and Undateable did live episodes they taped two versions for each coast.
West Coast Customs,"As a western Washingtonian, I didn't actually know that SNL started at 11:30 until the late 90s. KING had a local sketch comedy show called Almost Live! that played in that slot followed by SNL at midnight. Most of it was focused on Washington stuff, poking fun at different Seattle suburbs and such, but both [Bill Nye](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4e6h4zLC5U8) and [Joel McHale](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zAawE9uGuwk) got their start on that show. So did the writer of Nebraska, [Bob Nelson](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_u_UMjEcrMk)"
West Coast Customs,East coast bias.
West Coast Customs,That was my first thought as well. Having it on late means they don't run afoul of FCC obscenity laws. Now this means a lot more care needs to be put into what's being broadcast isn't breaking any rules.
West Coast Customs,it probably has more to do with lorne hating creativity and improv than it does not accidentally dropping an F bomb
West Coast Customs,Lol. They don't even put it on a delay when it airs live. Every once in a while someone will drop an f-bomb. That last being Kristen Stewart earlier this year.
West Coast Customs,Oh yeah the east coast feed sometimes has swear words that the stars accidentally say. By the time it gets here they've bleeped it.
West Coast Customs,So did The West Wing. They use the West Coast versions on the dvds because they're usually better (second try and whatnot).
West Coast Customs,Wait really? I knew they did a live show from Netflix  but I didn't realized they did it twice. That's awesome. 
West Coast Customs,Is Undateable any good?
West Coast Customs,"Weird, I always thought Almost Live always followed SNL."
West Coast Customs,It's only a few episodes 
West Coast Customs,I wish they would have both versions on DVD.  Insane fans would have much fun comparing.
West Coast Customs,Most shows do that Drew Carrey would even do 3 different live shows in 1 night
West Coast Customs,Which episodes were live?
West Coast Customs,Which episode of the West wing were live? I love that show but never noticed 
West Coast Customs,"http://www.vulture.com/2010/10/the_17_differences_between_30.html

West Coast Customs,It got canceled. The taped episodes were generic multi-cam sitcom stuff but the live shows were really loose and fun.
West Coast Customs,"I was disappointed by the DVD release of 30 Rock's first live episode - it appears that the ""Live Show"" that appears as the official version of the episode on the disc is a weird Frankenstein'd mash up of basically the best of the east and west coast versions. Meanwhile, the entirety of the west coast version is a special feature on the disc, so I guess the intact original east coast broadcast is lost forever unless both are on Netflix (wouldn't know, 30 Rock isn't on Netflix in Canada)."
West Coast Customs,"The West Wing had a live debate episode (sixth or seventh season), I think 30 Rock might have done two live episodes, and I think Undateable went all live for a season (never seen it)."
West Coast Customs,"I thinks it's on Hulu, maybe I'll check out the live stuff. I assume there isn't a real story or anything based on what it is."
West Coast Customs,On Netflix they have the East Coast versions in the US
West Coast Customs,[deleted]
West Coast Customs,"Not really. It's just the cast fucking around on live tv for 22 minutes, which works because there are some talented comedians on there."
West Coast Customs,"Yeah, I didn't know how much that violated the sub's ""no piracy talk"" rule."
West Coast Customs,Only 14% of Americans live in the pacific time zone.
West Coast Customs,"Because maxing profits, the only most important thing in our time."
West Coast Customs,ABC did one in New Orleans for Central Time for the first time. The Hollywood Billboard party is pre-recorded. I agree West Coast should have their own local countdown special or something. 
West Coast Customs,I'm over here wondering the same thing. Pretty lame to be done with NYE at 9pm.
West Coast Customs,[West Coast tried](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lzWmDIY9Zk&index=205&list=PL7XlqX4npddfrdpMCxBnNZXg2GFll7t5y)... West Coast failed
West Coast Customs,"Honestly, given how pared down the East Coast offerings were this year, I wouldn't be surprised if a west coast program wouldn't be sustainable. :/"
West Coast Customs,[deleted]
West Coast Customs,"Caveat that it's not one of the broadcast networks, but at least CNN stays live through the Central Time Zone NYE. I'd really love them to stay live until NYE on the west coast - would cost a lot less than the broadcast networks' musical shows, since all they really need is  1 or 2 hosts with a lot of drinks and someone to point a camera at them, and they're 95% of the way to having a broadcast!! "
West Coast Customs,Conan or Jimmy Kimmel could easily host one.
West Coast Customs,"Seattle has an annual fireworks display at the Space Needle that is quite nice. It could easily be broadcast on network television instead of local ones, but Seattle's not a big enough market."
West Coast Customs,"If it's network TV that would mean that it would be shown on all coasts, LIVE. So if the Times Square ball drop is at 12am ET/9pm PT, and we wait for 12am PT, then that is 3am ET. I highly doubt they would be able to sustain a network special from 8pm ET to past 3am ET, all ""live"" instead of being prerecorded. Plus, who on the East Coast is watching (where the majority of viewers tend to be)? It's probably not worth the time.

Also, I watched ABC's version of Rockin' NYE, and they tried a central time zone LIVE countdown. It was fine... but it just kinda felt like an afterthought to me..."
West Coast Customs,"A lot of these New Years Eve performances aren’t even live in a lot of places they cut to. I would appreciate at least a west coast specific pre-tape and countdown. I remember in 2000, there was a live NYE countdown in Los Angeles where the mayor and Jay Leno hit a switch to light up the Hollywood sign. That would be a cool thing to do every year. Better than watching a rerun of NY and pretending it’s for you."
West Coast Customs,They did in the year 2000 they did one for every time zone in the world
West Coast Customs,"Yeah... in general, if you're on the west coast, you get screwed on a bulk of the ""live"" programming.

"
West Coast Customs,"What I don't understand is who watches that shit?  If I am out and about, I am not going to be watching a TV. If I am not out and about I will be asleep. "
West Coast Customs,"Because if you don't live in EST you don't matter. 

Pretty simple really. "
West Coast Customs,"FUCK!!! I was wondering the same! I lived in NYC for 15 years and just moved to PDX, and fucking cried when I saw the re-run of Times Square, goddamnit! 

I cried because I just got divorced, having moved to mend our marriage and being left in the lurch. "
West Coast Customs,Because the west coast sucks ass
West Coast Customs,Had this changed at all?
West Coast Customs,"Meanwhile, almost 50% of Americans live in the Eastern time zone. "
West Coast Customs,I know this is the answer but still sucks. 
West Coast Customs,"Actually I was just watching a Spanish channel and they were streaming for Vegas.  The fireworks out there looked lit AF.  All the hotels seemed to have their own show going.

Contemplating spending a NYE out there. Did I forget to mention Calvin Harris? Because Calvin Harris is in Vegas also. "
West Coast Customs,I miss when Conan would do the Central time Zone count down. The first year skit where he sent a guy to the wrong time zone was fantastic.  
West Coast Customs,"They had some prerecorded bullshit with Pitbull from Miami, pretty lame. They have started a ball drop in DTLA the last three years but they don't show that"
West Coast Customs,"Not exactly ""Network"" but funny and entertaining in a spectacular fail way!"
West Coast Customs,"Used to love MTV New Years back in the day, now they just show Ridiculousness reruns. "
West Coast Customs,Fergie hosted the West Coast last night too.

West Coast Customs,Families
West Coast Customs,"> having moved to mend our marriage and being left in the lurch.

Wynonna Earp,"I'm not sure how large the overlap between FNL and Wynonna Earp fandom is, but I loved the ""Clear Eyes, Full Bra, Can't Lose,"" line."
Wynonna Earp,Mrs. McMurray
Wynonna Earp,"I just want to say that it is a crying shame that this show doesn't get more attention. I understand that the first six episodes are rough and like other people, I initially dismissed it as a Supernatural clone with women. That usually means that the show sucks.

But it's so much better than Supernatural. It has messed up people who make and made mistakes, but the people in WE learn from them. It has well-written female characters and LGBT characters. It has two brilliantly written male characters; we see a man out of time grow without being rendered useless.

Where Supernatural repeatedly makes the monsters just humans with black eyes, long nails etc, this show uses monsters. It has one of my favourite scary episodes with one of my favourite monsters.

Yes, it starts off rough. But Ms. McMurray from Letterkenny starts off as a boozed up, lairy PTSD-ridden survivor. The show goes through how she heals. Sci-fi really fucks around with shows but this show deserves an audience."
Wynonna Earp,Can't wait. Now someone get me a Cocksuckin' G&T!
Wynonna Earp,">Wynonna Earp | Official Season 4 Trailer (UNCENSORED) | Premieres Sunday July 26 At 10/9c | SYFY

Is it too early to start lobbying for S5?"
Wynonna Earp,"I swear I thought the fourth season got wrecked filming-wise because of COVID, which kinda sucked after how hard it was to get season 4 going."
Wynonna Earp,Is it as bad as that Van Hellsing TV show? Or Shadowhunters for that matter.
Wynonna Earp,"Aw, but I like the Supernatural comparison. Because it does feel like the sister companion to the series. But not in a rip off sort of way. But more in a blue collar siblings watching for each other sort of way. If people like the Sam and Dean dynamic of Supernatural and want more of that, they need to watch Wynonna Earp."
Wynonna Earp,"I watched season 1 and a few eps of season 2, then kinda fell off. Despite my dislike for zombie stuff I found it enjoyable and wanted to like it, but it just never clicked for me. I think the main part was that I couldn't get a hang of the characters. They switched between sort of serious/realistic drama and more light-hearted/comedic tones too often, sometimes several times during the same scene. 

I don't mind a mix, stuff like Doctor Who and Stargate often pull that off, but with this show I really struggled to get why the characters acted the way they did. Which led me to not care as much what happened to them.

Nice to see that it's still going on though, I was certain it had been cancelled. Maybe I'll try picking it up again at some point."
Wynonna Earp,">Where Supernatural repeatedly makes the monsters just humans with black eyes, long nails etc, this show uses monsters.

Yeah *Supernatural* always had issues with budget but it's more than just a monster-hunting show, it shines from other things too like the portrayal of family, fraternal bonds and the amazing use of meta and classic rock tracks."
Wynonna Earp,Hello fellow Earpers! I hope you join us over at r/wynonnaearp!
Wynonna Earp,Noooope I'm already lobbying
Wynonna Earp,Hello fellow Earpers! I hope you join us over at r/wynonnaearp
Wynonna Earp,For me it hits a similar vibe to Lucifer - it's fun trash with snappy lines.  Very happy to see it continued.
Wynonna Earp,"No, it's better than Van Helsing."
Wynonna Earp,It's similar but better than both imo.
Wynonna Earp,"I’ve always described it as the female version of Supernatural. Instead of Sam and Dean, it’s two sisters."

Wynonna Earp,"Wow, for some reason I never made that connection lol"
Wynonna Earp,"I wish Chris meloni was doing happy still instead.

That show was great"
Wynonna Earp,They should have just made organized crime it’s own thing instead of trying to shoehorn it into Law and Order. It’s so much different from any other Law and Order show and SVU is a shell of its former self
Wynonna Earp,Bring Happy! back!
Wynonna Earp,"David Giuntoli and you don't mention *his* show, Grimm!"
Wynonna Earp,One of the most weird and unique TV-series I've seen in a while. I absolutely loved it.
Wynonna Earp,"My thoughts too. Though I don't see where the writers could take the show after season 2, so I'm glad its over. now it can't be ruined."
Wynonna Earp,I wish he was doing anything else instead. He's so funny and totally wasted on L&O. Can't really blame him for not turning down 10's of millions of dollars though.
Wynonna Earp,"Making it an L&O series pretty much guarantees that it has an audience for at least the first few episodes. Plus, we needed those Benson and Stabler moments back."
Wynonna Earp,"I’m all for it because it bring in an audience on its own and I want it to be successful because I like Meloni, was nice to see benson and stabler together again as well imo."
Wynonna Earp,"It really isn't shoehorning anything, except trying to take advantage of the character's likability while trying to reboot his story.

Organized Crime appears to be devoid of most of Law & Order's formula.  There really no district attorney and courtroom scenes (so far). It appears to be one entire story arc.

The bad guy isn't a mystery. We already know from episode one who the bad guy(s) are. We actually get scenes from the perspectives of the bad guys, as they talk and scheme and commit other crimes.

And the crossover event was to setup how this is personal for Elliot Stabler.

Its not anything new for the genre, but it doesn't appear to be constrained by the norms of the L&O franchise."
Wynonna Earp,"The first episode of Organized Crime is the first L&O I've enjoyed in probably 10 years. I love the departure from the formula. It's Law & Order in name only, really. I don't think it's hampered by having the L&O name at all."
Wynonna Earp,And Grimm!
Wynonna Earp,Sure was. Make sure to check out Futureman if you haven't. Similar dark humor but no imaginary friends
Wynonna Earp,Season 3 was clearly going to be about the evolution from imaginary friends to concepts/deities
Wynonna Earp,"He was on another show on SyFy inbetween those two as well, SyFy sure loves that guy."
Wynonna Earp,"I haven’t seen any of his SyFy shows, but this dude was the worst part of Schitts Creek and the whole show got better when they wrote him off.

Not sure how much of that was his fault vs the writing."
Wynonna Earp,"No one remembers the name of the show Vagrant Queen...

Well, I mean except the 3 people who watched it."
Wynonna Earp,I've loved him since he played Massimo on Lost Girl. On SyFy.
Wynonna Earp,"Sadly in my head it just comes up as ""not good killjoys""."
Wynonna Earp,Hubby and I were 2 of 'em. It wasn't bad.
Wynonna Earp,I enjoyed it!
Wynonna Earp,"I auditioned for the part he got, I watched the first episode a few weeks ago just to see what it was like, usually if something's good I'm a little jealous. 

I was not jealous of that show."
Wynonna Earp,Loved that show.
Wynonna Earp,It wasn’t bad. It was terrible.
Wynonna Earp,[deleted]
Wynonna Earp,It was good dumb fun.
Wynonna Earp,"True! But the show was pretty bad to be honest. 5/10 on IMDb. The costumes were great, it's just everything else was bad."
Wynonna Earp,Poor old SyFy channel. The are pretty much out of the scripted content game. All they have now is Resident Alien.
Wynonna Earp,"I had no idea that the show has been on for four seasons.  I've heard so little about it.

Is it any good, now that it's wrapping up is it worth starting?"
Wynonna Earp,"Not really that surprising, the storylines kind of seemed to be wrapping up and it was such a hard time getting season 4 funded to begin with because it may have aired on Syfy but it wasn't produced by Syfy which is why the Blu-ray releases were by IDW and not Universal. I just hope it ends with closure and not on a cliffhanger or something.

The Magicians last year, Wynonna Earp this year... literally all they have left worth mentioning right now is Resident Alien."
Wynonna Earp,"Well, at least this means we'll get more Mrs. McMurray on Letterkenny!!!"
Wynonna Earp,I hope the series doesn't end on a cliffhanger.
Wynonna Earp,"I really hope Netflix will pick it up for atleast 2 more seasons, very fun show to binge :)"
Wynonna Earp,Didn't we kinda anticipate this. Getting season 4 going was a hurdle. Same nonsense that got Stargate cancelled.
Wynonna Earp,I'm still mad SyFy canceled Warehouse 13..... and Eureka.... both shows got barely any notice and were forced to quickly wrap up.
Wynonna Earp,"I'm surprised it wasn't ended earlier.  It's insane. The incoherent kind, not the good kind"
Wynonna Earp,"> scripted content game.

Which is shame as they have done some nice shows in the past like Warehouse 13 , stargate atlantis ,Eureka"
Wynonna Earp,"They shouldn't have cancelled Happy, it was a very weird but very fun show"
Wynonna Earp,They have a new scripted show (The Surrealtor) coming out sometime this year with the same guy.
Wynonna Earp,Is Magicians cancelled?
Wynonna Earp,The article mentions another three shows they have coming up.
Wynonna Earp,"I think it’s probably part of the greater trend of basic cable networks reducing the number of live action scripted shows they air. Just in the past few years we’ve seen a lot networks get out of the scripted business including Pop, History, E!, Bravo, WGN. MTV and VH1. Even the networks that still have them are scaling back on them including FX and USA. Once Better Call Saul is over, AMC will be pretty much The Walking Dead channel."
Wynonna Earp,"It's definitely not top tier TV, the writing isn't always that good, the budget is limited, but if you enjoy supernatural stuff and don't mind camp, you might enjoy it."
Wynonna Earp,"It isn't exactly good, but it is kind of fun. Take a look and see if the concept interests you. (I haven't watched the most recent season yet)"
Wynonna Earp,"It's supernatural.  If everyone had bouts of spontaneous amnesia.

It's canadian, so it's a lot looser with standards and practices"
Wynonna Earp,"I really like it. It's definitely a fun show with an interesting premise and characters. I usually describe it as the love child of Buffy and Supernatural. If those kind of shows are your thing then definitely check it out. I'm pretty bummed about the cancelation. I think after this, The Magicians, The Expanse and Deadly Class, I might be done with SyFy."
Wynonna Earp,There is absolutely no chance they were arrogant enough to presume another season.  They barely got this one as it was.
Wynonna Earp,"No chance of that. Netflix previously bought the rights to the first two seasons and obviously didn't want any further ones, which affected funding and delayed season four."
Wynonna Earp,"Yeah, it wasnt all that long ago they had a bunch of shows i liked. Magicians, Dark Matter, Killjoys, Earp, Z Nation, 12 monkeys. All of those wrapped up (or are about to) in the last few years, with nothing of substance to replace it."
Wynonna Earp,I'm still bitter about Dark Matter.
Wynonna Earp,And some animated show about the devil with Tudyk
Wynonna Earp,"Yep. Ended 2 years ago

&#x200B;

edit: my bad last year"
Wynonna Earp,I’m afraid so. The last season was the final one.
Wynonna Earp,"Having only four TV shows on the roster is a long fall from SyFy’s heyday. One of the new TV shows (Chucky) will also be airing on USA Network. I’ll be surprised if the other two go past the first season. I’m rooting for the new shows to succeed. 

It is a pity to see NBCU gut the channel in the way they have as SyFy used to be a solid content provider. I’ll be sad when they finally switch off the lights."
Wynonna Earp,"I think we are definitely seeing cable fade and retract. Especially as a source of scripted original content. The few networks still making and effort such as HBO, Showtime, FX, Starz, and even AMC have been actively pushing their streaming offerings in the hopes of staying relevant. 

It is sad to see the likes of USA, SyFy, TNT, TBS, and Freeform scale back on scripted and even sadder to see the likes of Pop, History, Bravo, MTV, Cinemax, Paramount, and Audience Network pull out of the scripted game or turn off the lights altogether! 

The AMC situation is a unique case as I think they are still trying with scripted but just like Starz they cannot get people to try their new programming. The have tried a bunch of stuff outside of the Breaking Bad and Walking Dead franchises but just cannot get anyone to watch them. That is true for Starz as well. They have Power and Outlander holding the network together."
Wynonna Earp,Sadge :(
Wynonna Earp,Netflix does have all seasons in Europe. They even had the new episodes the day after it airs in the USA.
Wynonna Earp,"They came back strong in 2015 with Dark Matter, 12 monkeys, Killjoys (it was fun!) The fucking Expanse, The Magicians 

All of them to be cancelled either in 2019 or 2020."
Wynonna Earp,I'm mad about Deadly Class.
Wynonna Earp,Dammit now I'm mad again
Wynonna Earp,Did it finish on a good ending or was it shit canned?
Wynonna Earp,Will Chucky be staying on USA after this year? USA is going to need space for all the sports stuff headed there from the NBCSN shutdown.
Wynonna Earp,">Having only four TV shows on the roster is a long fall from SyFy’s heyday

Eh, not really."
Wynonna Earp,I am annoyed that Dark Matter didn't get to have a final season. At least Killjoys did and I like the ending they did for The Magicians.
Wynonna Earp,Did they get a new CEO or something?
Wynonna Earp,I’ve yet to try the final season myself but I did read they knew in advance so wrote an ending. I guess that is a good thing!
Wynonna Earp,They got an ending befitting Magicians
Wynonna Earp,They knew the show was ending so they were able to wrap things up. I think once a certain Actor decided to leave the show that they were going to end soon anyway.
Wynonna Earp,"> was it shit canned?

Most likely. Let's say there were adventures left on the table"
Wynonna Earp,i thought it was pretty great.
Wynonna Earp,It will be interesting to see if the closure of NBCSN changes their plans. USA Network has been gutted in the same way SyFy channel has been so even with Chucky it only has 3-4 scripted shows on the the roster. I suspect they will still find a space for that paltry amount of TV shows even with the influx of sports. With less space they will probably cut the filler sports since USA and Peacock do not need them to fill out a dedicated 24 hours a day channel.
Wynonna Earp,They used to have two or three times this amount of programming. Now all they have is four freshmen shows.
Wynonna Earp,"I think Dark Matter wasn't owned by SyFy something like what happened to the Expanse, Killjoys was."
Wynonna Earp,I think I only got to the start of the season where magic gets turned off
Wynonna Earp,When did they simultaneously have 6-12 scripted programs running
Wynonna Earp,They regularly had that volume from around 2004-2015. It was the height of the cable boom.
Wynonna Earp,Name 6 scripted shows they were running concurrently
Wynonna Earp,"Stargate, Eureka, Warehouse 13, Sanctuary, Haven, Caprica were all on the air at the same time and a bunch of other shows came and went over the course of those TV shows existence. 

Perhaps 12 was an over the top estimate but it is fair to say that SyFy (during its peak years) used to regularly have two or three times the volume of programming than it has planned for 2021. It is also well worth noting that those TV shows I mentioned used to get season episode orders that were nearly double the number that are typical nowadays."
Wynonna Earp,TIL Season 4 started broadcasting in July!!!! Man this great. I like the show. I’ll take the 6 episodes!
Wynonna Earp,"So far season 3 is unwatchably bad. I liked the first 2 seasons, but god damn is 3 a slog. They handled the exiting of an actor with all the grace of a fish that jumped into a boat."
Bromance,I will watch anything this guy is in. Might actually be my \#1 favourite actor.
Bromance,"Me too. Love that guy! ""A Taxi Driver"" was one of my favorite movies i've seen in recent years and really shows this guys acting skills and charisma on screen. 

I'm very much looking forward to that show."

Bromance,"It's not underrated its that it (the re release) came out almost 20 years ago.

BSG has always had a following"
Bromance,"I mean I love this show but it was hardly underrated, when it was airing it was one of cable's biggest shows, consistently got great reviews and was the flagship of its network. It was for SciFi Channel what Mad Men was for AMC."
Bromance,"Battlestar Galactica, one of the most highly praised scifi shows of the past decade, is the most underrated show ever?"
Bromance,I don't think you know what underrated means
Bromance,Im expecting a 'Twin Peaks is underrated' thread soon.
Bromance,"It's got 8.7 on IMDB, and people always talk about it favourably. 

I love the show in so many ways, but to say it never has a wasted episode is crazy. It fell apart in the later seasons, and coherent storytelling went to shit. 

Despite that it's still an incredible show, that I rewatch every few years."
Bromance,downvoting because its not underrated and actually has a large following.
Bromance,So say we all
Bromance,"Everything before New Caprica was GOATED tier and everything post New Caprica was just subpar. I know the screen writers guild was on strike at the time, but man they could have done so much better narratively post New Caprica. I agree with your sentiment of it being underrated, said universe is woefully underutilized like most scifi in popular media."
Bromance,"It was great through around the middle of the third season. At that point, the lack of planning caught up with them and the show started falling apart."
Bromance,"Fact: bears eat beets. Bears, beets, Battlestar Galactica."
Bromance,Underrated? It was rated the best TV show of the year by Time magazine.
Bromance,"Mods, please start banning posts that call shows ""underrated"" with a score of over 7.5 on IMDB. Someone needs to put a stop to these idiots."
Bromance,"And Led Zeppelin is the most underrated band of all time!!! 
/s"
Bromance,"Yeah I don't think RDMs BSG is underrated, it just suffered from a poorly executed handwavy ending."
Bromance,So say we all
Bromance,Underrated is underrated because underrated. Underrated.
Bromance,It is my favorite show still to this day. Six Feet Under is my second.
Bromance,It’s ending was shit.
Bromance,"Definitely don’t feel it’s underrated. I watched it for the first time about 10 years ago. Thought the first couple seasons were great, then it got a bit too loose for me. 

I feel The Expanse nailed it as a spiritual successor (but that’s not what you asked ;) )"
Bromance,"OP needs to double check what underrated means, cause this show is loved by many."
Bromance,"I don't think it's underrated for a couple reasons

1) **it won a Peabody**

2) **It's consistently in the top 5 sci-fi shows of all time (if not the top 3)**

3) **It's consistently in the top 20 tv shows of all time**

Now: People tend to suggest that it's not underrated because it ""didn't end well"" but I don't know how much that has to actually do with the ""over/under-rated"" designation as it keeps getting used. This criticism is more of an online thing, and it's pretty closely tied to the fact LOST ended right around the same time, and for better or for worse, those two are basically linked whenever anyone anywhere starts talking about why it's a ""necessity"" to ""have a plan"" despite the fact that's never been how great television (or long-form storytelling in general) has ever been made. 

>!true story: YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PLAN is a fan theory created and disseminated post-LOST as a way to cope with the disappointment of people's theorycrafting being proved wrong. It has no basis in any sort of fact and never did. It never occurred to people that maybe spending all your time theorycrafting instead of just watching the show for what it actually is not the best way to watch a show. So they came up with YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PLAN FIRST and have been using it ever since.!<

I don't think Season 4 deviates too strongly from where season 1 and 2 pointed, and rewatches (without week-to-week speculating leading people down a bunch of different ""Geek Culture"" approved paths) tend to bear this out. And it's usually the rewatches that tend to get it put on the above top 5 and top 20 lists I mentioned so..

It's not over or underrated. It's just rated. And rated highly, and deservedly so."
Bromance,"The random dart throwing that determined who was a Cylon makes me lululu to this day. I don't know that I'd call it underrated...it's pretty popular Sci fi. I'd say it's rated.

I really enjoyed it! The end was a bit rough, but I thoroughly enjoyed it."
Bromance,"It was a great show, but the fourth season was a massive downer, and they mangled the end pretty bad. Another season would have been good."
Bromance,"[No, it isn't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_Battlestar_Galactica)."
Bromance,Raise your hand if you watched BSG for the first time because of that skit on Portlandia.
Bromance,"One of the best shows ever. Unfortunately, the writers strike almost strangled it to death and it was barely able to limp to a conclusion."
Bromance,It gave us compelling villains like Belial and Lucifer.
Bromance,So say we all
Bromance,Not even a Sci Fi fan but god damn I loved Battlestar
Bromance,I love Battlestar Galactica!!!
Bromance,"When it was being broadcast, it most certainly not overrated. It was all anyone could talk about."
Bromance,Hot take: one of the best endings of all mainstream Sci Fi / fantasy / thriller shows ever.
Bromance,The ending was idiotic. Loses major points for not sticking the landing.
Bromance,The ending is miserable and kills it for me. Otherwise it'd be one of my all time faves.
Bromance,"I am oddly in the middle of a rewatch.  I can't remember most of the details because I last watched it 12  years ago or so.  It's been worth doing.

I'm watching on Peacock."
Bromance,"I thought this was an amazing show, easily in my top 5 all time, and I started watching it another time around…you know what petty thing stopped my enjoyment?  The Cylon theme that would play EVERY time a Cylon showed up on screen.  I figure that couldn’t last much through a couple seasons as they start to have a lot more screen time, but man every time six shows up it’s like “tik tik tik TIK tik tik”  and I just couldn’t handle it again."
Bromance,Where can I watch bsg?
Bromance,"I agree that it's great, but it was huge in the mid 2000s."
Bromance,I just did a rewatch in the last month or so and god damn I love it
Bromance,So say we all.
Bromance,I would argue Babylon 5 is the most underrated
Bromance,"I think it started falling apart when the 5 figured out they were somehow cylons. That was just... idk, it was just weird. And then it went downhill from there. 

But it did give us the ""ITS IN THE FRAKKING SHIP!"" moment."
Bromance,"It's a great show, but the ending was obviously written by people with no idea how to close the story."
Bromance,Let me guess you love Beets and Bears too.  Get out of here Dwight!!
Bromance,You sound like someone who never saw the ending.
Bromance,"Mr. Robot is the most underrated show to me. Everything about the show is a masterclass in television making. The acting, the cinematography, the musical score, the twists, etc. It's also the only show I've watched where the rewatch of it is better than the first watch, because of the numerous easter eggs hidden in plain sight that didn't make sense at first but made total sense once the story was complete."
Bromance,It's not underrated. It was appreciated at the time. It was only good up until the first half of season 3. After that it got progressively worse with its storytelling and eventually shit the bed.
Bromance,"Are we talking about the original BSG or the newer BSG? Op didn't specify.

[OG BSG trailer.](https://youtu.be/5a5bEIf0UaU)"
Bromance,Have you seen the final episode yet? Went from my top 5 of all time to not even making the list!
Bromance,"No, it's not underrated. It had praise heaped on it both when it came out and afterwards. 

I think the first two, maybe two and a half seasons were one of the best shows out there. Absolutely the best science fiction of the 2000s. Unfortunately things started going sideways after the escape from New Caprica and by season 4 it was just imploding. 

That last season really just knocked it out of contention for me honestly. Gotta nail the ending to be in the running for best show ever I'm afraid, and BSG most definitely did not. Wish it had."
Bromance,So much better than The Expense
Bromance,It's good but r/TheExpanse was better.  1 and 2.
Bromance,Season 1 and 2 are excellent...then it declines significantly. The ending is horrible.
Bromance,It was entertaining for 1.5 seasons. Then it gradually crawled up Ron Moore's butt.
Bromance,Eh.  It has a decent start but gets absolutely terrible.  It also hasn’t aged well and is full of tropes and cliches from that era.
Bromance,"The first few seasons are brilliant, then it turned to complete shit. It’s not underrated. It’s rightly left in the gutter."
Bromance,"Preach it.  Pisses me off that it's so easy to find Star Trek or Star Wars stuff but rarely run across anything BSG.  I am due for a rewatch soon. So say we all! 

ETA: and who can forget Fat Apollo!"
Bromance,"I never finished the series, even though I only had like 3 or 4 episodes to go. I don’t remember why… this was like ten years ago."
Bromance,"It was good whilst the story was driven by the constant need for the entire fleet to jump every 30 min (or whatever it was) it lost a lot after that ran out.

The prequel series Caprica had a lot of good ideas in the pilot, (emergent AI, polytheism vs monotheism, terrorism mimicking people's fears of the time), but has to tone it down for later episodes and lost its edge."
Bromance,So say we all!
Bromance,[deleted]
Bromance,Ok Dwight Schrute 😏
Bromance,Now go watch the original
Bromance,"Definitely not underrated, but it's also been a while since it came out, so it's not really mentioned as often. But it still is mentioned frequently enough, and heck, you can even still watch the occassional new ""First Time Watch"" style of videos on youtube! For a sci-fi franchise that isn't remotely as big as Star Wars or Star Trek it's pretty good. 

Justifiably so, of course, because it's really good, warts and all."
Bromance,"Starts off very strong and falls off pretty hard in the past couple seasons. Overall worth a watch, definitely ahead of its time"
Bromance,"No, no it isn't. It basically gets worse every episode until it's awful."
Bromance,The good one or the new one?
Bromance,"Great show. Worst ending of any series I've ever seen, however."
Bromance,"Not sure if you were around when the remake aired, OP, but it was absolutely huge and hardly underrated. 

You should check out the sketch from Portlandia with EJO too."
Bromance,so Portlandia made this for no reason? [https://youtu.be/yYjLrJRuMnY](https://youtu.be/yYjLrJRuMnY) I don't think so
Bromance,Started out amazingly with so much promise. Hit its high water mark with New Caprica and the Pegasus. Slowly became less and less interesting and whimpered to a conclusion.
Bromance,Just rate it higher.
Bromance,The first half of it is amazing.  Top tier television.  Too bad it couldn't stick the landing.
Bromance,Loved it at first. Then it gradually got worse and worse until it reached its bad ending.
Bromance,"I didn't think that much of the bromance between Adama and Col. Tigh and it only ran three years if they counted Galactica 1980.  

I loved the concept of Galactic 1980 but they killed the budget and that could have been the best SF show ever done on TV.  Having to upgrade Earth's tech starting in 1980 to resist a full Cylon attack would have been awesome.  Basically we would get Earth cranking out Battlestars and Vipers after setting up alliances."
Bromance,OP experiencing that reddit backlash 🤣
Bromance,"I loved BSG when it was airing. Like buy the toys, the books, contact people working on it LOVED it. Even met Ron Moore at a Trek con and got him to sign my Blu Ray Box. But after not watching it for a good long while and catching a random late Season 4 episode I was kinda struck at how....over the top it can be. The camera work felt absurdly too wobbly, and the drama was at 11 at all times and frankly I wasn't sure what was going on but it looked a bit silly from this standpoint. I've never had this reaction to a show I loved so much before on content I've seen and enjoyed before, but It really did strike me the wrong way."
Bromance,"Bears, Beets, Battlestar Galactica."
Bromance,Wouldn’t call it underrated—it was pretty dang popular.
Bromance,"First man, see
Actually underrated"
Bromance,Youre fucking clown OP. Both OG and the remake are praised. Go kiss a fish loser.
Bromance,Farming.
Bromance,I stopped watching after Cally... I was so close to the end too. Ugh.
Bromance,"Underrated?

It's so fuckin good the cast was invited to sit in on a session of the UN.

They were the 1st sci-fi show to win a Peabody award (writing excellence) 

It also is recognized as the example that the Nielsen rating system is completely outdated and ineffective"
Bromance,"Forgotten isn't quite the same as underrated, I feel similarly about Babylon 5 but it had its heyday too."
Bromance,Hi Dwight
Bromance,"I asked chatgpt to write me a script of Guilliman talking to Malcador about his favorite TV show, and he agreed that Gallactica was the best. Malcador said he would check it out."
Bromance,"I believe it'd be held in the highest regard of TV series', up there with The Sopranos, The Wire, Breaking Bad etc, if it wasn't for the terrible final season where poochie had to fly back to his home planet"
Bromance,"Underrated sci-fi: Warehouse 13. Well written and acted. Mixed humor with some action and intrigue. Change my mind. 
Wish we got the WH12 spin off."
Bromance,I disliked a lot about the show.  Wrong leads for the lady in red and her traitor scientist guy.  I felt like they had to know someone to get the roles.
Bromance,"It’s not underrated or overlooked. 

It’s a sci-fi show so it’s going to have challenges appealing to people who don’t like sci-fi."
Bromance,"Man, do you know how hard it is to find a streamer that’ll even allow us to buy it, let alone rent it? I’ve wanted to watch this for years.

I agree with others: it’s not underrated. It’s just a bit of a cult classic due to lower initial viewers but it became a bit sleeper hit for folks who are into mystery box shows."
Bromance,"I like The Bear more, and find it beating BG just so slightly"
Bromance,"Battlestar 2004 - I agree

Battlestar 1978,1980 - no"
Bromance,Disagree about it having a clear beginning given how many google searches there are for how start it.
Bromance,"BSG redefined television Sci Fi. And, honestly any dramatic show to follow. It's not underated by critics or the sci Fi world in the least. It is the Blade Runner of television, though I'd say perhaps more approachable. 

The only real arguments against it usually involve the finale and that's fine. Moore and Co. created a passionate following that was invested in the outcome. So love or hate the ending, this was some of the finest television ever produced regardless of genre."
World Trigger,"I wonder how many people watched it through streaming (i.e. ""watch game of thrones online free s4e01""). A lot of people I know don't even know how to torrent, but watch all of their TV this way."
World Trigger,"I pirated the show, can i get a piece of paper saying i was part of this record?

Nah for reals though, I have bought the blu-ray for the past three season as soon as it was available, regardless of cost. I only pirate this show as there's no available option in Australia except for supporting a media mogul who i quite frankly cant"
World Trigger,"Relevant article from The Onion [Record 20 Million Tune In To 'Game Of Thrones' Premiere On Single HBO Go Account] (http://www.theonion.com/articles/record-20-million-tune-in-to-game-of-thrones-premi,31878/)"
World Trigger,"From everything I have read and seen about this record breaking piracy, the production company and everyone involved are happy with it."
World Trigger,[deleted]
World Trigger,"To watch this show legitimately in Australia, you have to go through a paid subscription channel (Foxtel) and buy other channel packages through it just to watch GoT. All in all it costs like $75 a month. I would not be surprised if a lot of those torrentors are from Australia. Cost a ridiculous amount."
World Trigger,"I don't think this has ever been so topical.

The cable companies have no one to blame but their own incompetence."
World Trigger,"If HBO-Go was available as an independent online subscription service at a reasonable price, then I would gladly pay them all the money.. But it isn't, so meh I'll just head over to my friend's place and binge-watch on his big-screen at the end of each season."

World Trigger,It's because HBO GO crashed the night of the premiere 
World Trigger,I tried to watch it on HBO Go. Shit didn't work so I watched it on coke and popcorn instead.
World Trigger,What happened to all of those assholes who said they weren't going to watch the show after the red wedding.. Guess they had nothing to do with this record being broken.
World Trigger,There will never be anything as ironic to me as people stealing HBO Go and then bitching about the quality of the stream.
World Trigger,"Where I live (Toronto, Canada) the only way to get Game of Thrones legitimately is to subscribe to HBO. Subbing to HBO is a $20 add-on that is only available in the most expensive package. Here is a link:

https://www.rogers.com/web/Rogers.portal?_nfpb=true&_windowLabel=PTV_PROG_PACKAGE_PTV_pkgs&PTV_PROG_PACKAGE_PTV_pkgs_actionOverride=%2Fportlets%2Fconsumer%2Fptv%2FbrowseFlow%2FgetPackages&PTV_PROG_PACKAGE_PTV_pkgspackageProductId=DSMV&_pageLabel=PTV_PROG_PACKAGE&cm_sp=Cable-_-VIP_TMN-_-learnmore

The total cost is about $130/mo including tax. It's INSANE!

I'm not generally a pirate. I bought seasons 1 and 2 on BlueRay and will buy 3 when I have a chance. But I have no other options other than to pirate the show unless I want to watch it 9 months from now when it comes out on BlueRay.

If HBO gave me a chance to pay $2 or $3 or even $5 per episode to watch it in 1080p, I'd pay it happily. What I won't do is spend $2k/year subscribing to cable. "
World Trigger,"I'm surprised movie theatres haven't worked out some sort of deal with HBO to screen GoT on Sundays. 

Went old school, and actually watched it on cable. GoT and True Detective were the reasons I actually stayed with my HBO subscription."
World Trigger,"HBO should definitely run a one time kickstarter for pirates to donate as a thank you, I'm sure they'd rack in a good 10 million or more. That's enough money to fund one sick episode."
World Trigger,I expect a lot of people outside of the US didn't want to have to wait just to have episodes spoiled by the internet.
World Trigger,I live in Iceland and my family already pays for the network that airs Game of Thrones. However it airs it on mondays and I don't want to wait so I just pirate it.
World Trigger,"BY 6pm PDT, HBOGo was imploding.  By 7:10pm PDT, I already had a downloaded copy, set aside ""just in case.""  By 8:45pm PDT HBOGo was working again and actually let me begin watching the episode before 9.  "
World Trigger,imagine how much money they passed up by requiring a cable subscription for HBOgo?
World Trigger,"If you love this show and are making excuses to pirate it,   go ahead but then after the season also purchase the blu Ray to support the show. It will be available worldwide and anyone can buy it. It's a hugely expensive show to produce, and a lot of scenes from the books like battles are cut due to the cost. Expensive production was partly why the HBO show Rome was cancelled.  
   
If you're clamoring for an option to pay per episode, they would likely charge $5/episode. If you only wish HBO or HBO Go was available for a standalone subscription, it would likely cost $25+ a month. Would you still purchase it?   

Otherwise, don't make excuses and just admit you are pirating because you don't want to pay for it.   
  
Also, if you're going to watch it off HBO Go and don't pay for HBO, at least wait a day after airing so that actual customers can stream it live.  You're abusing the system and are going to ruin a great thing. Otherwise HBO will start restricting HBO Go."
World Trigger,I'm not going to lie. My wife and I can't afford cable ATM so we torrent all the shows we want to watch. Sorry.
World Trigger,"I know that I will only be the 850th person to say this... but HBO, if you're reading this, **make episodes available for download as they air for $4 each, as a high-quality MP4, and many of us will stop torrenting them.**

We don't want to be a part of your club, we don't want to pay for online streaming access, we don't want to pay for a limited use license.  We want the file, for our use and reuse.  You have the files, and could sell them to us."
World Trigger,"Now it's up to reddit to tell everyone how HAPPY HBO is about this, and how it's actually a boon to the film industry."
World Trigger,"My friends and I attempted to watch it through HBOGo, which *shockingly* had terrible video quality and lagged. So then we pirated it. Maybe if HBO could fix their streaming service this wouldn't happen as much."
World Trigger,All HBO has to do is let us buy their service without cable and half of this will disappear overnight.
World Trigger,Im from europe so yeah. Is there even a way to purchase the show somehow?
World Trigger,I don't know why they just don't simple upload the episode to you tube and make tons of money off ads there. That would stop people most people from torrenting it and the company would be making more money.
World Trigger,"I've downloaded season 1-3 when they were airing but actually ordered HBO nordic (living in sweden) for about 12$ a month yesterday. Atleast the money (hopefully) is going to the right people, because I love that show."
World Trigger,"I watched it on HBO go, then downloaded a copy for later. It was a damn good episode yo "
World Trigger,"For most of us outside of the US, it's either:

a) Pirate the show

or

b) Avoid the internet until the show becomes available in your country to avoid spoilers."
World Trigger,"wait, piracy is real? People actually download things on the electric picture-phone thingy? in other news the financial system is run by criminals that don't pay for crimes either."
World Trigger,"well, guess what happens a few years after the show is over, so many people will utter the words ""OMG you haven't seen Game of THRONES?""

That guy will probably buy the dvd set since he obviously don't know how to torrent it."
World Trigger,"Watched it on Sky Atlantic, but that Thronecast afterwards was a bit boring imo."
World Trigger,I streamed it off HBO-Go. The quality was shit
World Trigger,"I acually just subscribed to hbo to for got. I wonder how many new subscribers hbo had for the premier. Obviously everyone can't afford hbo but I don't mind paying to watch it as it airs, with no adverts."
World Trigger,"I tried.  I really did, but HBOgo REFUSED to work.  So, I pitted HBOgo loading screen against uTorrent in a race.

uTorrent won."
World Trigger,I only pirated it because everyone in the god damn world was watching HBO GO... I had no choice 
World Trigger,"Preventing anyone from illegally downloading it doesn't automatically mean they'll pay for an HBO subscription or some other streaming service.  Not necessarily the subject of this article, but is often brought up over this bittorrent/illegal download issues."
World Trigger,"Wow, those poor actors must not get paid anything at all now.  I bet they'll cancel the series before episode 2 comes out.  I don't see what choice they have with all that piracy going on.

/s"
World Trigger,"HBO forced this on themselves. I would GLADLY pay per episode if it were available on amazon. But instead my only option is to pay 200+ bucks to my local monopoly cable provider for the ""package"" and hbo, then get hbo go, then hope the stream doesn't suck ass. When you refuse to give people reasonable legal ways to do something they find illegal ones. I got to watch the show in 720p for free and only had to wait 10 minutes for the download. You have to be faster and more convenient than this to stop pirating."
World Trigger,"I had to pirate the show because HBO GO, which I pay for, is still not letting me watch it, 48 hours later. That subscription is not going to last much longer."
World Trigger,"My cable remains cut until they offer ala carte packages, until then it's Netflix, a digital antenna for sports, and piracy for the rest. "
World Trigger,...further solidifying my opinion that HBO should ditch its deals with cable providers and start its own streaming subscription service. 
World Trigger,I was part of history.  Someday I can tell my grandkids about this day
World Trigger,"Oh, S4 is starting, sweet.

Since I don't have TV service, and can't stand the 'official' garbage sites that stream it, yes, I'll be downloading it. Then when the BR set comes out, I'll buy it to go with the other three. (Speaking of which, S3 is *finally* available on Amazon...)

Besides, the digital copy that comes with the BRs is a fucking joke. More DRM holes than Swiss cheese. Electronic Arts would be proud."
World Trigger,why not just use one click hosters like uploaded.to?
World Trigger,"I mean, I torrented it and made no attempt to get it legally, but I also just ordered 50 dollars worth of official Game of Thrones beer."
World Trigger,Some people probably downloaded a torrent while they were waiting for HBO GO to load. Some people. 
World Trigger,"I just want to know if this is going in the Guinness Book of World Records and if so, are the guys at HBO going to hang the certificate on their wall."
World Trigger,And to think I subscribed to HBO the day before GoT premier aired. Money well spent.
World Trigger,if they offered non hbo subscribes the episode for 1.99$ on itunes... I'd probably still download it.
World Trigger,"The way I see it is that there is always going to be people pirating digital media, but I think the vast majority do it because of some combination of a service, distribution, or pricing problem.

If the entertainment industry really wants to cut down the amount of pirating of their product they need to look at redesigning how they get their media into the hands of their consumers.   Piracy is their competition.  They need to deliver a product that is better quality, easier to get, less hassle to find, and is available in all regions at the same time.

Do that, and I guarantee you would see pirating numbers plummet."
World Trigger,"Without piracy, I would miss out on a lot of great content that isn't available. I.e. I couldn't pay money to watch it if I wanted to.... because Netflix sucks, TV sucks, and Hollywood sucks. They gotta get it together.

If I could watch what I wanted, on demand, like right NOW, on ANY device... I would be happy to pay a small fee, or deal with all the commercials. No problem.

Hollywood is it's own worst enemies, especially the lawyers."
World Trigger,[deleted]
World Trigger,"Glad to be participating in a record. Seriously though, I would gladly throw my money at HBO go if they offered a streaming service in my country."
World Trigger,I suppose people will just have to keep slapping HBO in the face until they get the message. 
World Trigger,The way Reddit justifies torrenting blows my mind. 
World Trigger,Good anyone remember how HBO started out should be a legitimate reason why to pirate.
World Trigger,What's extra stupid is that it was a Free HBO weekend...
World Trigger,"I wonder if HBO would find themselves making money if they just offer a channel package similar to what the WWE did? I keep HBO around (I have DirectTV) for Game of Thrones....that's it. That is the only reason, and I know it costs me more than 10 bucks a month for it."
World Trigger,"watched it on Sky Atlantic and was rewarded with 4 or 5 ad breaks, disgusting
"
World Trigger,"This was the first time I Torrented something. I was sick of waiting nearly a year to buy something on DVD. 

Combating piracy is a two-way street. It's the job of the consumer to explore every avenue to get something through legitimate means and it's the job of the supplier to make it as easy to access something as possible. HBO and their partners have failed in this regard."
World Trigger,"I pirate because I don't wanna pay for stuff I can get for free, and easier than the legitimate way at that. As far as GoT goes, I'm not gonna wait for ages until it airs in my country with shitty voice dubbing in my language. Pirating is fucking awesome, whether one's reason are ""justified"" or not. It's the greatest way to get to consume what I like, period."
World Trigger,I live in the middle east so you get the picture :P
World Trigger,"All it takes is one agreement with Netflix, HBO...they already have your days numbered."
World Trigger,"Well. If HBO was any smarter, they'd just put their show online for streaming and put their own ads in for revenue."
World Trigger,"This doesn't surprise me at all. I decided against pirating the episode this week and I am annoyed at my decision. I watched it on Sky Atlantic as I have the channel. But the fucking Adverts completely take away the immersion from the show. It's an advert every 10 minutes and makes watching the show awful.

So next week I'll go back to doing what I normally do and then just buy the box set when it's available. I pay for the channel it's on and I buy the box sets. Downloading the episode so I don't have to have ads isn't hurting anyone in my opinion."
World Trigger,"Piracy is nature's way of saying ""hey big corporations, you're doing it wrong"" 

I have no problem pirating anything but if there was a fair (cheap) alternative that was as quick and easy, I'd do that instead. "
World Trigger,"Status: Uploading
Uploaded: 322 GB
Ratio: 99,4

I think this is a personal record."
World Trigger,"Pirated as well. Because hbo is expensive, and cable tv (or satellite) is even more expensive. I'd pay a buck per show or something, but expecting me to pay over 150 bucks a month (at my company) is pretty insane when I don't even watch more than 4 shows. "
World Trigger,"If they just streamed the episodes online, they would cut that in half."
World Trigger,"I would love to watch Game of Thrones on HBO Go (which is the only place where I can legally watch it), but for the steep price of €10 I simply can't justify it when I'm not interested in anything else they have to offer.

If they offered access to ONLY Game of Thrones for €2-4/month or something, I would seriously consider it in the months the episodes are airing."
World Trigger,"Wow, look at all that money HBO could have made if they weren't in bed with the cable cartels. "
World Trigger,"I was rewatching Game of Thrones with a friend in the past couple weeks, and we actually found that the quality of streaming sites was BETTER than the quality on HBO GO a lot of times.
What the fuck, HBO? "
World Trigger,"Where I'm from, the only way to watch this within a year of it's release is to pirate it. To see it within a few months, you have to pay for it and be with a certain provider. Honestly if HBO would give me the option of paying a subscription fee in order to see all their series in premiere and on time, I'd probably do it. Right now, I'd rather pirate it. If I couldn't do that, I would probably just not be able to watch it untill it was free of charge on a commercial station.

It's like how I handle games. I usually pirate them if I'm unable to get them right away or if I'm not sure if I like it. If I like it and if I'm able to get it, I will most likely buy it anyway after pirating. If I wasn't able to do pirate these things, I would probably buy a lot less games and/or series simply because I wasn't able to test them out or enjoy them when they were fresh."
World Trigger,"Australia, where they bundle game of thrones into a $120 cable package. 6 hours delayed."
World Trigger,"I pay for Sky, I just can't be bothered to wait 18 hours to watch it."
World Trigger,"The only reason I have ever pirated a TV Show is because the UK has the worst broadcasters and all they do is play ads every 8-9 minutes, They constantly take mid season breaks for no reason, Even when they are 2 seasons behind the USA (Person of interest for example, The UK took like a 3-4 month break when its 3 seasons behind :|)

Seriously, They want us to stop pirating? Get a fucking proper schedule and stop posting fucking spoilers on your social media pages. You know fine well other people in other countries don't get to watch it live as soon as its shown."
World Trigger,">Game of Thrones Premiere Triggers Piracy Craze...



Correlation does not equal causation.



C'mon guys, you know this. Get your shit together. "
World Trigger,".... Most of the million from Australia, because fuck Foxtel up its stupid ass."
World Trigger,[deleted]
World Trigger,"This number would have still been huge, but much less if HBO GO didnt crash like a bandicoot for all us legal subscribers."
World Trigger,I sub to HBO but I absolutely hate cable tv 
World Trigger,Pay $120 a month cause of cable provider monopoly in my area or download it for free? hmmmmmmmm I make up for HBO lost when I buy their Season Box set. Rather give that money directly to HBO then have to give it to the cable provider.
World Trigger,"This show is the only reason i have HBO, lol. I'd pirate it if I didn't, i'm sure. "
World Trigger,In the UK if you don't have a SKY subscription it's the only way to get the show because it is exclusive to their Sky Atlantic channel.
World Trigger,The issue I have with the people complaining about hbo go going diwn was why didnt they just watch on cable? You pay for it already why dont you just watch it on tv? 
World Trigger,"The thing is that they knew this would happen and they didn't bother doing anything about it. Season three was the most pirated ever and they were talking about this in interviews last year. The smart response would have been to arrange a worldwide pay-per-view system. HBO Go is only availabe in the US - where most people have cable access to it anyway. The mass of pirating is from outside the US when people are desperate to see it when it comes out but can't get it without paying an expensive monthly subscription to a chanel they don't want just so they can see GoT for one hour a week. People aren't going to do that. But the majority of GoT fans woud be happy to pay £2 or £3 per episode if it was high quality, fast connection, no ads, and on demand. HBO could make a good few million dollars easy, with only the cost of severs. Yet they don't. 

This isn't the nineties, people aren't willing to wait six months for the DVDs trying to avoid spoilers on the internet, and conversations with their friends. And they aren't goign to be pressured into subsribing to a channel on the basis of a single faviorite show any more. The best, and *only*, service is provided by pirates, which is why they are used so heavily. I'm in the UK and I searched for half an hour to find a legal way of watching it last night before giving up and going to the dark side."
World Trigger,I was hoping the top comment would be a link the the Torrent. I'm terribly disappointed (i still can't find the torrent)
World Trigger,"My only question is, why would HBO want to end this at 7 or 8 seasons? If the quality is there and the story lines are there, don't put a cap on the number of seasons.

Myself and plenty of HBO payers would be extremely happy. Further, I'm sure HBO could convert some non-payers into the payers category. "
World Trigger,"Hey HBO is still making A LOT of money off of Game of Thrones, maybe they could look at it as a ironic compliment. "
World Trigger,"I pirated the episode, but I also bought all three previous seasons and plan on buying the fourth when it is released. "
World Trigger,"I watched it with HBO channel at a friend's house, then pirated it the next day to re-watch it in the peace and quiet of my own home."
World Trigger,"I must be one of the only dopes...I signed up for HBO. I like the convenience of my DVR and cable and I pay a premium for it.  I'm fine with that. I don't have to worry about seeding, leaching, VPN, down/up speeds, malware, whatever. Plus I'll watch Veep, Silicon Valley, and all the episodes of True Detective I missed when I didn't have HBO.  Once GoT is over I'll cancel it. It's worth the $17.99/month to me. I don't buy Blu-rays.

All those that don't have that option, now that's a different tune. HBO needs to make it as easily available as they can. There's obviously money to be made not just through the old-school subscription/cable route.

"
World Trigger,"In my region, HBO just simply isn't reasonably accessable. I was actually planning on adding HBO onto my regular TV service but when I called them they said it comes in a package with a bunch of other channels and costs $40 per month! When its that expensive it almost seems like HBO is trying to set torrent records. "
World Trigger,"I pirated the first episode so I could start to catch up.

So I have that going for me which is nice."
SCHOOL-LIVE!,"Despite the fact that I don't ever see Will Smith coming back to weekly television, I think that's a really creative idea and could definitely be really funny."
SCHOOL-LIVE!,I rather just have a one time reunion of the original cast than a new series. Don't get me wrong your idea isn't horrible but I rather just see a one time thing.
SCHOOL-LIVE!,"Seems super contrived, and you'd never get Will Smith to star - maybe there is a different sequence of events to make a similar setup happen."
SCHOOL-LIVE!,"Malcolm in the Middle is the correct show to do a sequel of. As its audience enters child rearing years so can the show's main character. None of the cast is really doing anything permanent so they should get right on this.

SCHOOL-LIVE!,its been a while since i listened to the podcast but think they had previously said they want to start shooting end of january. Think it was in the last episode with Danny DeVito
SCHOOL-LIVE!,"I think this season is gonna be special.  The podcast has rejuvenated their excitement in the show. You can hear it in their voices.  On the Danny episode he started talking about all the wacky shit hes done on the show and they literally say ""Wait until you hear what we have you doing this year"".  Glenn even said they didn't start the writing process this time like they have always done by rewatching old bloopers.  
  
They also have broke two stories on the Podcast.  One was so good Charlie made them stop recording so they could write it down."
SCHOOL-LIVE!,"It's been underway for weeks, they talked about it on the podcast well before Xmas.

I get that it’s 16 seasons in but the last few seasons have felt like offshoots of Mythic Quest in terms of storyline structure and tone."
SCHOOL-LIVE!,"I haven’t watched the show regularly at any point during its run, so forgive my ignorance, but have they run into the problem where as a series like this progresses the characters and hijinks they find themselves gradually get so over the top and ridiculous that the later seasons seem wildly different then the early seasons?

Because I feel like early on the gang got themselves into situations that weren’t exactly relatable but were rather grounded and their stupidity had a level of believability."

Had a dream the other night about an episode. Dennis needed to fake his death for legal reasons and leaves it up to the Gang to figure out because he's ""Busy with important arrangements"" and they needed to find a good death for him because ""I refuse to go out like a bitch."" When it comes down to it the Gang decides after much argument and research that his best death would be Botulism poisoning. Dennis comes back dressed as Prince, including a very dark tan, because he can't have someone upstage him at his own funeral, also it's a disguise. He argues that Botulism is a ""Poor people's death, I'm not going out like a bitch!"" and the gang says ""No, it's classy! No one dies of Botulism anymore! We gotta bring back the classics!"" ""I might as well die of god damn Legionnaires Disease! Or Polio!"" ""Nah, I lost access to my nun connect. Can't pull off Legionnaire's anymore"" says Frank.

That's about where it ended but it was pretty funny to me."
SCHOOL-LIVE!,This was already known like last month…

SCHOOL-LIVE!,He’s got a football club to pay for now

SCHOOL-LIVE!,Just watch the podcast for show related news
SCHOOL-LIVE!,"After a really good first couple of seasons, we dropped off this show around season 4 because we just didn't find it very funny but rather just really shouty and over the top. Infantile, is the word I'm looking for. What season does it apparently get good again?"
SCHOOL-LIVE!,Yeah. They talked about it on the podcast weeks ago….
SCHOOL-LIVE!,"Charlie’s back there getting those pages so filled, so filled for you"
SCHOOL-LIVE!,"I really hope they return to a, say, season 2 sensibility. I don’t if that’s even possible, but maybe rewatching the old episodes for the podcast jarred something loose."

SCHOOL-LIVE!,Yep
SCHOOL-LIVE!,Just got back into the pod myself - they’ve mentioned that they have broke stories and are getting ready to film
SCHOOL-LIVE!,Ya the Christmas special episode was essentially Charlie and Rob arguing and they mention they always get in fights when they start writing.

SCHOOL-LIVE!,The show has been going on for so long that it’s fascinating they had a “mid-life crisis” and have regained their passion. Season 12 and definitely 13 (when Glenn sort of left) felt like they were flailing about.  But the latest season with the Ireland arc showed they are up for experimenting as well as knowing the show needs the whole gang to thrive.

Charlotte,"I wasn't surprised by how good she was, she rocked the covid episode. Whenever Charlotte Nicdao and Rob Mcelhenney have dramatic scenes together, I think they both bring it. I was blown away by both of them and I also rewound that scene.

I agree, this season isn't as strong as last season but I'm really looking forward to the next few episodes."
Charlotte,When does this season end?  I'd rather binge it than wait week to week
Charlotte,"So good. This season was a little harder to get into, but if this is where they were headed…I could see how it might have been a little hard to steer the ship here."
Charlotte,"This show was great season 1, ok season 2. Covid episode was good for what it was. Season 3 feels very contrived, so much show one of the best characters jumped to season 2 of White Lotus. I feel like week Drama was forced, she is a good actress but super lame season. If this was season 1 they would never had a season 2"
Charlotte,"2 more episodes, Jan 6"
Charlotte,Her hair in the thumbnail is absolutely stunning
Charlotte,I never thought I'd see the day that I would witness Sexy King George III
Charlotte,Damn they already have chemistry in this clip
Charlotte,She definitely nails the attitude that Queen Charlotte has. Great casting. Love her hair!
Charlotte,Great casting for young Queen Charlotte.
Charlotte,Can’t wait for this!
Charlotte,Did Season 2 already start filming?
Charlotte,i will never forget her crazy eye scene in fringe.
Charlotte,"Oops, they got this wrong, I think."
Charlotte,"She was great as Charlotte on Lost, too."
Charlotte,Man I love the hell out of that episode. The singing got me too - her voice was creepy as hell
Charlotte,Still waiting for a Downton Abbey prequel that follows the young life of Maggie Smith’s character.
Charlotte,"Ehh, this series is going to get boring and repetitive pretty quickly. I don't think digging their feet into the most stupid element of the 'worldbuilding' is also a wise move, but whatever - people are desperate for any romance."
Charlotte,Do we really need this? And not just because I find her to be the most unpleasant character on the show.
Charlotte,I would watch the hell out of this. All the way up to Cora marrying Robert. Why is this not a show now???
Charlotte,ive only seen season 1 and id watch that
Charlotte,">but whatever - people are desperate for any romance.


Most fans would much rather have another romance series adapted- god knows show runners and filmmakers have ignored the vast (and immensely lucrative) genre until only recently. 

Netflix is being stupid and making a whole spin off based on a complete caricature of a character that they created themselves (who wasn’t in the books), and who doesn’t serve any meaningful purpose except for satire. They just don’t get it. It’s not their fictional queen that made this show successful. It’s that people have been positively craving adaptations of this adult romance genre for ages, and Bridgerton was one of the first shows to tap into that potential. 

Netflix is trying to milk it as much as possible. They would rather make a dumb show based on a character they invented than buy rights to another series.

It’s not going to work out the same way. They struck gold with Bridgerton because the romance genre is a $1.08 billion industry, whose market is larger than the mystery/sci-fi/fantasy genres combined. 

Their caricature of a queen is not their claim to fame."
Charlotte,You could say the same thing about Downton Abbey
Charlotte,Because it would be horrible
Charlotte,Replying late but you are spot on. Pretty much any of the top tier regency writers could give these stupid companies hit after hit provided the material is well adapted and cast appropriately. I view Bridgerton as a weird but serviceable stepping stone to hopefully MUCH better and less garish romance material that respects the time period it is set in. I think unfortunately the genre is just too expensive to film regularly.
Charlotte,how is making a show about a side character who seems to be kind of disliked the same as an ensemble show that basically stayed the same through its course?
Charlotte,Yup! I agree. Thanks for reading my comment and sharing your thoughts about it too.
Charlotte,She goin die
Charlotte,I think they mean 'Future Children's Show Presenter' Charlotte Ritchie
Charlotte,I love how the article doesn't include a picture of the new actors they're talking about. Very cool and convenient!
Charlotte,"What the fuck?! I've not bothered with season 3 yet as I'm worried about the show outstaying its welcome, but I may have to pick it back up based on this. Love Ritchie. She was part of a great improv radio sitcom called Capital, about the civil service department set up after a referendum where the British public vote to bring back capital punishment."
Charlotte,She gonna be a Ghost
Charlotte,"It'll be interesting to see how this goes. The whole ""the King changed everything by marrying a black woman"" line really took me out of the show on my initial watch. I was 100% into the concept of late 1700's English society with all races being of equal social standing. But the line about how the King set that in-place by marrying a black woman didn't work for me. Interestingly, something like that happening in the year 1000 or something like that where the King's power was approaching absolute would have made sense. But a post-magna carta English King didn't have the ability to simply change society with a hand-wave like that. Additionally, you can't create landed gentry in POC without taking those lands and titles from someone else. So whom were those that were disenfranchised? 

It's one of those things that becomes a tapestry loose thread - by simply not having that line, you have a world where POC are considered equal. But when you have a line like that, it means that at one point, they *weren't* equal. It'll be interesting to see if this series addresses that."
Charlotte,The people who made that Kardashian filter should do the same for this show lol
Charlotte,"Eh… it’s not the most historically sound argument to set the alternative history of the world. 

But I don’t think that’s really the point. 

I think that line is thrown in just to give *some* kind of explanation for the expansive POC peerage and Queen. Basically as an “accept it an move on” because the historical background set up of Bridgerton has pretty much no bearing at all on the romance storylines of the books the plots lines are based on. 

It’s also worth noting that in the Romance genre, it’s pretty much a “thing” that there are an endless amount of dukes, earls, and viscounts, and they’re all young, attractive, and unmarried. So it wouldn’t be an unreasonable assumption that in this world the King created a few titles from his own lands as well. 

Though I do agree that now they are branching out into a spin-off with brand new material, that this historical context that was created will have to be addressed."
Charlotte,Someone paid for a slow mo camera and by god they’re gonna get their money’s worth out of it.
Charlotte,Quite impressed how Galadriel got her horse to level up in the middle of the chase.
Charlotte,[deleted]
Charlotte,"Yo how are you not gonna check on the sword-key MacGuffin that is central to the villains plan until hours later just like unwrap it a tiny bit so you can confirm ""yep that sure is a MacGuffin"" so you can not get BTFO'd by an obvious misdirection."
Charlotte,They were so busy celebrating they didn't stop to see if they had the real thing.
Charlotte,"I think my main problem with this episode, and the series in general, is that the stakes are so poor. 

Because putting aside the big picture for a moment, the most pressing and immediate conflict in the show so far has been the fate of the Southlanders. Except the “Southlands”, as far as the show is concerned, is one tiny village and a couple dozen villagers, only a handful of whom are given speaking roles.

I just couldn’t help but thinking how hilariously anti-climatic it was to have spent three episodes with the Numenoreans, with all the debate and politicking and recruitment and training, only to culminate in their armies heroic rescue of twenty people trapped in a tavern.

The ending at least raised them a fair bit."
Charlotte,"Adar shooting up to being a new favorite, even more so that he's an original /non-book character, is something I never expected. Delving into the orcs' history is good stuff, gimme more.

And showing a dark side of Galadriel is low-key brilliant I think, tying into her fear in LOTR:Fellowship about how afraid she was of gaining the power of the One Ring.

Even that little drop by Adar about Sauron aiming to 'heal the land' is super interesting to me, I'm hopeful that RoP shows us a different kind of Sauron."
Charlotte,And that is why you always check the wrapped package.
Charlotte,"The good:

-Making much more out of Galadriel  
-Isildur and Elendil have good interactions  
-I like that they are true to Sauron's book motivations and the contrast between him and Morgoth  
-Good lore tie in with Adar; again builds on written materials  
-The wife of Elendil and matriarch of the Gondor royal family I don't believe has any written backstory, so I like that they are using this chance to add to the lore with some original creative license.  
-Gotta love Mount Doom. Looks awesome.

The bad:

-I find the action sequencs lack coherence. The combat isn't well thought out stylistically or spatially (contrast that to Peter Jackson's Helm's Deep)  
-kinda weird personal reactions to the battle here? You're that happy?  
-Halbrand king thing was rushed to say the least  
-no one checks the decoy for that long? C'mon.   
-Why is Miriel there? In general I think they've actually been too conservative in the size of the cast. Not enough Numenoreans have speaking roles, so they kinda shoehorned her in here in a way that isn't particularly appropriate.  
-I'm a little underwhelmed musically... I'm not sure why they are not going with the interweaving leitmotif structure from the films. It works. Is that somehow not meant for TV? Idk, I think visually the look and feel by and large is very good, it's that audio feel that is lacking for me."
Charlotte,"Fucking finally!

Very nice to see the true payoff with Adar's plan, so many people have asked why all the bother with tunneling when they could just ravage the land by night and hide out by day. Well it turns out creating motherfucking Mt Doom is why! Consider the Southlands well and truly rezoned for Dark Lord industrialism.

I was wondering why they took orcs as prisoner instead of just killing them. But considering most of the population still don't believe they exist anymore, I guess the plan was to parade them to Lindon and Numenor to let people know once and for all that darkness has risen. But like we saw with Bronwyn several episodes ago, a head is more than enough for that.

Something that bothers me, is the elves ran that watchtower for centuries, and until Arondir yesterday, never discovered or dismantled the dark designs all over it. Or maintained or altered the mechanisms of the dam. Obviously they could never know it would set off a volcano, but it seems rather un-elven to take over dark shit and not remodel.

How many people are left in the Southlands now? Halbrand is now king of a wasteland (perhaps by design, whether he knows it or not). I'm not sure how the Numenor plot will progress, we need Sauron to already have the rings and corrupt and bring about the downfall of Numenor for Elendil to found Gondor and Arnor. We are definitely having that plot based on the premonitions, but it's very awkward having so many of the necessary characters and events in play while others haven't begun yet."
Charlotte,"I’m actually really liking the stuff between Isildur & Elendil. 

Also what an awesome ending."
Charlotte,"How many horses can fit on 3 ships? 

Why is the queen regent even with them?

If the sword is that important then why would Arondir hide it in the tavern and how would he or Galadriel not realize it was switched out?

Maybe I'm nitpicking, maybe not."
Charlotte,"I like this episode, but some moments are so weird. Virtually anything involving bronwyn is so stilted and off. Her death fake out scene was really bad in particular.

I’ve never been the survivor of a gruesome battle, but it was really off putting how the good guys kept breaking out in cheers after their victories.

This is by far the best Galadriel has been.

Edit: something about the Halbrand crowning scene was seriously cringe inducing to me. I could hardly watch it. I like halbrand tbh, but that really brought the episode down for me."
Charlotte,"That was an amazing episode... quite surprised to check in and see a lot of negativity.

The show has clearly been building up the world in this era and while we are progressing through the season that was an epic conclusion and cliffhanger for the next episode. Think this has just become my favourite show on at the moment"
Charlotte,"Theo when he unwrapped it, i was like fuuuuuuu…."
Charlotte,There's parts of this show that I really love but it's so frustratingly sandwiched between a bunch of cliche nonsense.
Charlotte,is elf immune to fire or hot stuff???? we know from the trailer galadriel skin is fine and still smooth as ever after that eruption..
Charlotte,"This episode had potential, it was basically Helms Deep on a smaller scale.

But...

they moved way too fast on this one.

How does Galadriel and army reach Bronwyn and co so quickly? They were still at sea when the townsfolk were fortifying their town, the orcs came soon after?

Galadriel tells Adar she'll let him live then immediately gets angry and prepares to slid his throat.

Halbrand being crowned king of the Southlands is so random. Then the place gets blown to smitherines.

Also they celebrated way too quick here. Compared to the battle of the Palennor Fields, no one celebrated there, their friends died, it was all misery and sadness after the battle. Here, the townsfolk watched their friends get gutted but still were able to sink a few cold ones.



Here comes the downvotes. Come at me!"
Charlotte,"The set up has been rather disjointed, thats my issue with the show, I just didn't buy the motivations of the numenoreans going to the Southlands. I dont care that its not strictly lore accurate. I do think it will come together at the end of the season in some way though. I honestly think this show would be better as a binge watch.

That aside the visuals are awesome, the eruption was one of the best ive ever seen, TV or movie."
Charlotte,"I really hated Arondir’s solo fight against the big orc. Like the orc just lets him back into him and then it has multiple, multiple chances to kill him but instead just tosses him around. Another classic cliche where side characters get one-shotted by enemies but main characters are just thrown around. 

If they wanted the first battle to go the way they did where it’s a bit of a trick by the orcs, it would have been cooler and more effective to show him fighting side by side with the humans in the town square. 

Obviously he’s not going to die to this one orc and being saved last second like that is a cliche they’ve already used in this show, so the tension wasn’t there. I was just annoyed by how long it was."
Charlotte,"Really enjoyed the dialogue between Galadriel and Adar, felt straight out of Tolkien and very in-line with her family history."
Charlotte,"Screw the haters, that was an awesome episode."
Charlotte,"Finally realized what my problem is with the show at the end of last episode: the show basically treats every episode as if its the first episode. It makes this grand spectacle of showing off the settings and goes back and forth between multiple storylines never spending time enough of any one of them and ultimately ends with a grand cliffhanger. 

It reminds me of that popular gif on reddit with the truck speeding towards the pole but it just keeps cutting to different angles and never actually shows contact."
Charlotte,"well at least something happened but god damn the sword work in this show needs work, the action in general is a tad weak, where are your 2nd unit directors who are also stunt veterans? You spend $50M an episode for action of this quality?"
Charlotte,"Apparently a sonic boom from a volcanic eruption almost knocks trees and people over but can't knock over drinks and plates on a table. Also wow, these discussion threads are tiny now."
Charlotte,"where are all the people saying that this isnt supposed to be an army, but only a scouting trip?

I wonder how500 soldiers and 500 horses are supposed to fit inside.. or how manyhorses did theybring? seemed likewas supposed to be 1 for 1 man"
Charlotte,Mt doom bby
Charlotte,"This show will be studied for years. 

The most expensive show of all-time. Infinite resources. Yet no effort put into the script and amateur showrunners have left it all but dead only six episodes in."
Charlotte,Still don't feel anything.
Charlotte,"One of the best episodes yet. Love how all the little set ups are paying off. Arondir's scenes with Theo are great, I appreciate that they aren't tropey with Theo hiding everything for drama's sake. Also cannot emphasize how fucking lit it is to see Galadriel as the fiery Noldo she is. She's incredibly Feanorian. 

The course of the battle turned out more interesting and compelling than I was prepping for (I don't mind the small cliche of villagers using every day items at their disposal to fight the enemy). Also, this battle is basically showing why the English should have had a cavalry at the Battle of Hastings. 

The dual-use of the tunnels, to keep the Orcs out of the sunlight while they work, while also funneling the riverwater into the mountain's chamber was a great payoff. 

Adar continues to be incredibly intriguing. Glad they went the route they did rather than making him an established character."
Charlotte,Pretty incredible TV. Felt like the best directed episode so far. The deepening of the shades of grey works beautifully.
Charlotte,"It could have been a great battle if I cared about any of the characters, which I don't, sadly. 

Not the biggest fan of Arondir doing some mix of karate with capoeira and Galadriel bending over the horse. So corny.

It's such a cheap thing to do the ""Oh the mom die"" and she wakes up a couple of seconds after, it's such a cheap trick and so outdated in narrative. 

Halbrand is more obvious than ever that he is Sauron. Like c'mon..."
Charlotte,"Best episode so far

Inject Adar directly into my veins"
Charlotte,Amazing Episode. The show has been slow going at times but this felt epic from start to finish. Extremely high quality set pieces and action.
Charlotte,"Random thoughts from the second half of the episode :

\- Oh, Waldreg's not dead, that's a surprise... so... I assume the Numenoreans will save the day but Adar will escape with the sword... feels like a fair compromis for the story, let's see how things will go from there...

\- Also... quite curious to see a Galadriel/Arondir convo, if done right, it can be a nice moment.

\- Oh and are we to understand Arondir would have let Bronwyn die to keep Adar from getting the sword? I wonder if this will be explored more later in their relationship.

\- Are we about to learn that Halbrand is Theo's father soon? It has seemed obvious to me for quite some time but hey, maybe I'm wrong.

\- Nice little touch on Ontamo finding out he's not a battle-guy. Some people are not and should put their efforts where they would be better needed.

\- So Adar is captured... I'm still banking on him escaping with the sword but it's nice of the show to allow us a convo with him and Galadriel.

\- I'll say... it is quite interesting of the show to go the road Adar is going here. Defending the orcs rights to live and have a home as indirect creations of Eru. And I enjoy the idea of ""humanizing"" the orcs. The issue is that they've always been depicted as bloodthirsty brutes. Is there really a way to attempt such an arc with Tolkien's orcs? I dunno... in other universes it could work but here, there have never been any nuance to their entire race, which is something I regret but it is how Tolkien always envisionned them.

\- Yaay, Galadriel is a genocidal-enthusiast! But again... back to those issues... despite all his strenghts, Tolkien's work is still quite binary on many matters. I wish there was a way to show a more subtle view of the orcs and the evils of Middle-Earth but it's not in the core the story to do that...

\- They're really pushing for that Galadriel/Halbrand thing arent they? Well... I dont see how any good can come from it for the story... except maybe Halbrand truly falling in love with her while she just had a brief fling, which could lead to more interesting/complicated dynamics down the line but hey... maybe giving too much credit to the writers here.

\- Back on your feet quite quickly Bronwyn... but that was a nice convo with Miriel. Glad to see her efforts aknowledged...

\- Buuuut... holy shit the cheese of that Halbrand's return scene... honestly, it would have made much more sense for him to give her the pouch and crown her here and there. Halbrand hasnt earned shit.

\- And my theory about him being Theo's dad was completely wrong then. I'm glad of it, would have needlessly muddied things.

\- Theo shouldnt feel any guilt, he saved his mom, anyone would have done the same. If any, it's Arondir who should... again, I wonder if this will be explored later but I doubt it.

\- What a stupid decision first of Galadriel to give the sword back to Arondir (why the fuck wouldnt she keep it?), then of Arondir to give it back to Theo... and that in all of that, no one even checked if it was still in there... holy shit the levels of stupidity in there.

\- Aaaand, as predicted, Mount Doom awakens... nice music there in the credits, Bear, by the way.

\- Morfydd Clark is beautiful.

\- Well, overall, despite the usual expected flaws, I quite enjoyed the episode. And too lazy to write more at the moment."
Charlotte,"I've seen better writing from World of Warcraft

How did no one check the bundle?"
Charlotte,Holy shit this episode was spectacular
Charlotte,"This was the best episode so far, but the bar for that has been set quite low.  I'll note some (not all) points that still give it that low quality feel: 

* Why would someone like Adar walk in front of the army? That is just idiotic.
* Why can Bronwyn and Theo fight Orcs so well? They are just village commoners. 
* More a point in regard to the previous episodes, but why can Bronwyn assume leadership of the village? She is young, usually there are village elders who are in charge. But clearly everyone in the village is retarded so she is the only one that must lead.
* Why is there a sword as a key that can erupt mount doom? Who build that? Zero explanation or background given at all for this major plot point, let's hope they do in future episodes. (regarding the quality so far, probably not but lets hope to be positively surprised).
* That battle between arondir and the big orc with the last moment save is a tiresome cliche."
Charlotte,"Great episode, mount doom is going boom, I cannot wait to see the next one."
Charlotte,The first scene was a bit cringy but I thought the rest of this episode was great. Why is there so much negatively about it on this sub?
Charlotte,"Say what you want about the show, Joseph Mawle gives an excellent performance as Adar.  I think his character is effectively a Dr. Moriarty to Galadriel’s Sherlock; it’s easy to write such characters as “crazy” or “unhinged”, but Adar seems to be the only character that has anything like a long-term plan and is quite methodical in seeing it through."
Charlotte,"Overall it's a fantastic episode.  The effects, the battles, most the acting, it's all great.  The story is a bit on the weak side but this is something they can improve on in coming seasons.  The fact that the effects and look is right bodes well I think; that's the hardest part to get right.  The Numenoroians riding on horseback took me straight back too the Rohirrim.  This episode is the first time since the LOTR films since something looked and sounded like it was straight out of LOTR."
Charlotte,"Hate train on this show is ridiculous.  I'll admit I've been guilty of being very negative on shows. I still get depressed when I think about GoT Seasons 7 and 8 and haven't enjoyed anything Star Wars related since Rogue One (need to check out Andor still, looks intriguing).  But for me, RoP is a good, almost a great show.  It has its flaws, but the good far outweighs the bad. I know its not helpful to do a HoD comparison, but I actually find myself more excited about RoP then I do about HoD."
Charlotte,[deleted]
Charlotte,"Ouch, I’ve seen more discussion and hype about bloody She-Hulk of all things."
Charlotte,"I think the biggest problem with this show so far is Galadriel's actress. Her delivery and her expressions are bland and one note? She's  not a very convincing warrior. It's a shame since I really liked her in Saint Maud but she's been disappointing so far. I'm still enjoying this show however, it's a nice contrast to HotD."
Charlotte,That fucking ruled
Charlotte,"The ending of this episode was amazing and had me on the edge of my seat. But the first half was really boring imo. I felt nothing during the various battle scenes and especially when the Numenoreans knights arrived to save the day. That should've felt like a more epic, more glorious moment but it felt anti-climactic to me."
Charlotte,Surprisingly great episode.
Charlotte,"Finally! Actually a satisfying episode.

A lot of good stuff happens. Plot threads intersecting, mysteries being revealed, and also no Harfoots to inject irrelevancy and kill pacing. Galadriel embracing being unlikeable here is actually a plus for me rather than the previous ""is-she-isn't-she"". Numenor teleporting into the village from the boats was a bit of a stretch but oh well - at least we did see that Numenorians are badass humans.

Really feels like a bunch of other episodes could have been seriously condensed so we could get here, as if they really were just wasting time before the finale episodes.

Nitpick: The show seems like it's being very heavy-handed that Halbrand is Sauron. I'll be supremely surprised if that doesn't turn out to be the case."
Charlotte,"Good action episode, really ramped up the gore huh. It's been only 1 episode but I miss Elrond, Durin and Harfoots already 🙁. I do hope Galadriel learns some humility soon, got a chuckle out of how this scene went down:  
Galadriel: I will commit genocide on all your darkness-loving orcs, then finally kill you.  
Adar: Ever looked at a mirror lately?  
Galadriel: Nvm I'll kill you first you orc-loving scum."
Charlotte,Okay this episode straight *fucks*.
Charlotte,One does not simply walk into Mordor
Charlotte,"Fuck these showrunners for that sword reveal.

Also I can't believe the characters are in awe of THIS Galadriel; she manages to be cringy everytime.

Edit: No reason to care or root for a bunch of dumbasses who forgot to check inside of the rag. And no, this show is still not good.

Edit 2: To the ones who are downvoting: the showrunners think you are stupid enough to roll with their creative decisions, so think twice before defending those two hacks."
Charlotte,"I can’t believe this thread still managed to complain about that absolute belter of an episode.

If you’re enjoying the show and would actually like to talk about some of the good aspects of the show try r/ringsofpower or r/lotr_on_prime"
Charlotte,best episode yet imo
Charlotte,"I don't see how you can hate on this episode. It was a great watch, even with some poor CGI at times."
Charlotte,"The entire story of LOTR from this point forward could have been prevented if they had just shoved a sword into the keyhole and broken it off cleanly 

Hell, just some mud would have made it hard for him"
Charlotte,Damn good episode. Finally got me to care about whats going on. Hope they can keep it up.
Charlotte,"is timeline ever make sense??
in one night and 1 day in southland, numenur arrive from sea then come all the way to southland???"
Charlotte,"my thoughts on this one:

at least stuff finally started happening, though we are still moving super duper slow.

fight choreography with Arondir was a massive step up than what they had Galadriel work with last episode, but there was still too many uber obvious cliches being used. like why did they have the 1min 30 sec struggle with Arondir and the big orc when everyone who is conscious and watching the scene already knows he will get stabbed in the back before killing the elf?? also all the ""wait! stop!"" right before somebody who we know they wont kill is gonna be ""killed"", they did it like 3+ times in like 25 min lol. they also really need to chill with the slo mo every episode, its usually unnecessary. they want to highlight specific emotional moments, but they have used it so much now that it doesnt really have any meaning. like Boromir or Haldir dying in the slo mo means a lot more when they dont just use it willy nilly every other scene.

i actually kinda wish that Bronwyn died. not only would it have been much more unpredictable, her death may have served as a catalyst for Arondir or Theo to grow and change and possibly become interesting. also Bronwyn is essentially a non character. she is barely developed at all, besides being Theo's mom and in love with Arondir. and her and Arondir's relationship has nothing to stand on so we dont even really know why they feel so strongly for each other (other than they were written that way).

not really a fan of having this battle be a junior version of Helm's Deep, with the Rohirrim riding in at the last minute to turn the tables. we have seen that exactly happen before and i would appreciate if they do more different stuff. i also that it was dumb that Isildur's dad was on his horse just standing around idly and allowed it to be tackled to the ground by a group of orcs. lol wtf was that? also there is a severe lack of tension in a lot these action scenes when we know which characters have to be alive by the end of the show

LMAO at Galadriel teaching Isildur about humility. it seems like the some of the writers were essentially trolling people, or they really are unaware of her character

on the one hand this episode suffered from a lack of Durin, but on the other it brings to light how disconnected the Harfoot storyline is. they probably could have held off on the Harfoots until season 2 and spent more time actually developing the characters we have in the main focus. besides the uninspired writing/dialogue, my biggest gripe with this show is most of the characters are bland and devoid of personality. Galadriel, Arondir, Halbrand all have like 1 emotion and always just act the same. Durin is like a fully fleshed out and realized character, with a wide range of emotions on display. Elrond is more similar to him too, more so than the other characters i previously mentioned.

i wonder if they split the writing team into groups and the most talented people randomly got assigned to the Durin storyline? its weird how noticeable the difference in characterization is between the various storylines. it goes to show that even if nothing action packed is happening, having good characters to watch that you actually enjoy/find interesting still goes a long way to making the show seem good.

i also feel like its getting more clear that Halbrand is going to be Sauron as the big reveal at the finale, which i dont think is a super good idea. but it looks like thats the way the wind is blowing after the last two episodes..."
Charlotte,"Finally, a good episode. The writing in this show is medicore af but action heavy episodes like this can do a lot of carrying. If the writers manage to find their footing this show still has a chance."
Charlotte,"Finally a good episode, about halfway into episode 6 this show finally had me fully emotionally invested. When you make a fun and exciting show, stupid plot holes don’t really matter either. Sucks there’s only 2 episodes left but if they keep this up i will be happy. 

Also, Halbrand *has* to be sauron right?"
Charlotte,"The volcano is a wtf.... Did the show writers not know about pompei? Also the key cause that is well out there with logic.

Other than that and some how the king getting ahead of Adar and Galadriel it was a decent episode."
Berserk,"Kentaro Miura passed away at the age of 54 due to an acute aortic dissection.

His work “Berserk” spanned 40 volumes and multiple Anime series and was loved throughout the manga & anime community.

Rest In Peace"
Berserk,"Wow, this is a big loss to the manga industry. He never got to finish the story. What a tragic end for his family and fans."
Berserk,"Oh no! God damn, his creation was amazing, such high quality storytelling and artwork. Fuck...."
Berserk,"Arguably the greatest manga artist ever, gone way too soon. He was only 54 years old man. That’s so young to die like that. Having followed his work for years it feels so much more personal than just a celebrity dying. The fact that he never got to finish his magnum opus, which he had been writing for **34 YEARS** is also just so tragic, even moreso for him than for any of us fans. RIP Miura, you were the greatest"
Berserk,"I never read or watched Berserk. I planned on it some day, but I just never got around to it. Yet I still feel this loss. His work was extremely influential in many of the things I do watch/read.  

Just terrible."
Berserk,"I grew up reading Berserk and when I found out that Miura passed away, it honestly felt like losing a lifelong companion. RIP to one of the greatest storytellers."
Berserk,[removed]
Berserk,Think I'm going to have read this series then even with a lack of ending. I've only heard good things about it although it's supposed to contain some fucked up content that no one can be prepared for
Berserk,Call the godhand. Bring him back.
Berserk,I never would have expected him to pass before Yoshihiro Togashi. Super sad. It's worse for me because he was younger than my mom and she isn't in the best health. Makes me wonder how much longer she'll be around
Berserk,"For anyone unfamiliar with the series, these are the kind of panels that Miura drew in Berserk (no spoilers):

This announcement is the manga community's GoT season 8 – except that they had been watching since 1988 and the series never dipped in quality at any point. Knowing that this incredible piece of art will never be concluded is just heartbreaking."
Berserk,"This hits hard. Berserk is my favorite manga ever. The story of Guts losing everything and yet continuing on and rebuilding a life and learning to trust and love again was tremendously inspirational for my own struggles with depression and hopelessness. I literally have a picture of Guts hanging on my wall to remind me. Thank you, Miura, and may you rest in peace."
Berserk,do they have a japanese Sanderson that can come finish Berserk?
Berserk,"Greatest manga ever written

Some shit in Berserk made Game of Thrones look like child’s play"
Berserk,54 is such a young age in our present era.
Berserk,"Japanese creator deaths always come like a punch to the gut since they are so private and we don't even have a hint of their struggles until it is over... The comparable American death would be Chadwick Boseman.

Miura died weeks ago, crazy that it took so long for us to know, just such a huge cultural difference.  

I remember years ago, many were worried about Togashi (hunter x hunter) as his with slowed, his art suffered, and rumors started about that he was terminally ill.  Turned it he was addicted to some game.  Miura had a slowdown as well, also attributed to an addiction to an idol game.  It makes me wonder if that was the real reason for the slowdown, and it also makes me worry about Togashi.

All of it makes me consider the crazy and unhealthy work schedules of manga-ka."
Berserk,[Guts' Theme from Berserk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZa0Yh6e7dw)
Berserk,And now we all pray that Oda can finish his story before something like this happens.
Berserk,"54, such a young age to pass away. 

It's difficult to overstate the influence of the manga and original anime. To this day, even if you've never read or seen anything to do with *Berserk*, you've heard of it because it's just that ingrained into the culture.

So many memorable moments and characters, all presented with a wicked style that didn't shy away from some heavy stuff that really sticks with you.

RIP Kentaro Miura, you and your work will surely be remembered."
Berserk,Berserk helped me pull myself out of that lame ass abyss of depression and taught me how to struggle and put my grasses on. R.i.p miura 🥺
Berserk,"The Netflix showing of the Golden Age arc is what got me into Berserk. I was pretty into volumes 1 and 2. I was curious to see how 3 would go, and the last like 30 minutes of it was just something I was not prepared for. I literally sat, open mouth, just watching in horror as everything unfolded. It was one of the few times I can recall feeling such strong emotion, especially for something on tv. 

When I think of Berserk, I still think of that feeling of discomfort and shock. It's what ties my brain to Berserk and Kentaro Miura.

And I mean that in the best possible way."
Berserk,We had a vigil of sorts for him in FFXIV last night. Everyone was gathering in one server as the dark knight class and lined up around the entire city. He will be missed
Berserk,I love that that his works popularized the sharp animalistic full-body armors that are seen in series such as Dark Souls and what-not. Just something incredibly badass about that blend of demonic nature and human warfare I find fucking metal.
Berserk,Berserk will go down with Dororo and Devilman for their influence in dark fantasy. He was inspired by them and I think his manga has reached a similar level of importance.
Berserk,[deleted]
Berserk,"I sort of felt this way when I found out Satoshi Kun died. Really unfortunate to lose potential material. At the end of the day though, unfortunate more to his family. But his legacy is still bad ass."
Berserk,Had my friend over last night for the first time since COVID started last year and happened to showed him the first episode of the 90s anime before finding out. Reading the news last night I almost broke down explaining the the implications of losing such an artist and storyteller. RIP.
Berserk,"Did not expect to see this on r/television, but I'm glad Miura's work has reached so many people. 

Rest in peace Miura"
Berserk,"R.I.P Berserk is a masterpiece of storytelling and artwork.

Now someone tell Oda to take a few weeks off. I don't want read any headlines about him dying before he finishes one piece. Give the man a vacation!"
Berserk,Huge loss. RIP
Berserk,NOOOOOOOOOO
Berserk,Well that fuckin sucks on the highest level!  RIP  This is really a major fuckin loss.  Amongst the worst in history.  The guy was 54 and that story was nowhere near over.
Berserk,"After discovering and falling in love with Dark Souls, I learned the creator of the Souls series was inspired by Berserk. RIP"
Berserk,"He was a cut above the rest, Berserk was legendary. This news just breaks my heart...Rest in peace."
Berserk,"May he rest in peace. I’ve been sexually abused before, so this loss is particularly hard for me since Berserk helped me cope and heal. I don’t know where I’d be without it. It’s taught me so much and I really just cannot believe that he’s gone. May he rest in peace and may his family and friends find solace 🙏🏽❤️"
Berserk,My heart is broken
Berserk,"Jesus Christ, I have been following this manga since it got released in the 80s and Casca FINALLY GOT BACK TO NORMAL! 

argghhhhh it kills me that he wont get to finish the berserk story line, what  a sad day...."
Berserk,That manga was so fucking dense. It sucks he didn’t finish it. As an aspiring writer that is a top fear.
Berserk,"I admittedly am not a fan of manga or things similar, but I do mourn his death. From everything I’ve read today about him, he seemed like one of a kind. He was obviously very respected, and lived up to his potential. I hope his loved ones and all his fans find peace. RIP Kentaro."
Berserk,"In FF14 today there was a memorial line of like 500 people going through the entire city posing in front of bonfires with large 2-handed swords and dark knight armor in honor of Kentaro Miura and everything he created and helped influence.

[Here is a small part of the memorial](https://i.imgur.com/enSyhoi.png)"
Berserk,Beserk was the first thing I ever saw as a kid I can actively remember giving me nightmares. Brutal stuff. RIP
Berserk,"Top 5 best manga ever created, hands down...To truly show how bright something is, you need to put next to something truly dark. Berserk did this perfectly. The story was so vast despite only having a handful of characters it was probably a decade away from reaching its conclusion. Vinland Saga, HxH, Vegabond, One Piece... I hope all the authors take his death as a warning and start taking better care of themselves."
Berserk,I lost all words.  What am I going to do now?
Berserk,"Someone said that this is like Tolkien dying for fantasy fans, but I'd say that a better comparison would be G.R.R. Martin dying now, leaving GoT unfinished. 

I mean, Tolkien at least managed to finish The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, and the work he left unfinished is related but not essential to the main story.

Martin dying would leave a beloved work without a conclusion after years and years and YEARS of fans following it, hoping that he left an outline that another author may complete in his stead. 

Another parallel: even if all three authors in my example left notes on how the story would go so that someone could complete the work, look at Miura's art and tell me that it'd be easy for anyone to just pick up and continue Berserk while living up to his artistry. That'd be HARD.

RIP, Miura-sensei."
Berserk,"Its true what they said





He died before the book ended"
Berserk,"I remember starting the series in middle school and slowly waiting for the updates. The wait was always long, but the patience was worth it for me. I’m sad about his passing and this series will never be the same if at all. But I’ll be patient if there comes something. This series was older than I have been alive"
Berserk,"Can't afford to officially own and re-read the manga at the moment, but was about to get season 1 of the 2016 series for $16.99. uncensored too! Man, the distribution for this show was weird.

Might do another Strength-GreatSword run in Dark Souls III soon too."
Berserk,"I got into the manga just this year and read the whole thing in the span of a week or so. It was fantastic and hooked me in completely ... I couldn’t imagine how the fans who’d followed it for decades could be satisfied waiting months (years?) for a new chapter. When I got to the end I realized that I would have to join them to see what happens next between GUTS and Casca ... (spoiler warning) it broke my heart that she finally recovered yet could not face GUTS but I hoped she would get better in the upcoming chapters.

The news of Miura’s passing is shocking and sad. The world has lost a great artist - and I am very sad that we may not ever find out how GUTS’ story ends .."
Berserk,Unreal. 2 decades almost following him and Berserk. Terrible news. RIP. This guys impacted countless lives.
Berserk,No.
Berserk,"Goddamn it I just got into the series a few years ago and was hopeful that it would be finished within his lifetime. His story and artwork was phenomenal there are few artist who would have had the will power to write the same story for 3 decades. What a madlad 
R.I.P struggler"
Berserk,"I read through the series once. It was haunting and captivating, but it also got super phallic at parts.."
Berserk,"You're kidding!

This man influenced characters such as Ichigo from Bleach, Cloud, just any character who had a huge Sword to point out the obvious!

Where there was Jojo reference, he was a whole genre!  Rest in Peace.  Man this hurts as I love the series!"
Berserk,Man that really sucks.  His Manga I have been following since my teens.  I really hope he left a game plan for it to end.....this was always a fear of fans.
Berserk,Everything will be wong.
Berserk,I had no clue he was only 54. Nuts that he created such a massive serial when he was in his early 20's.
Berserk,"Wow, I have not been this shocked by a famous person passing away since the dead of MJ, I usually don't let the dead of people I don't know personally affect me but this one is different. Berserk is absolutely my favorite manga and has come to define part of my life. Rest in peace Miura I will miss you and your work."
Berserk,"Damn, I had such high hopes for the conclusion. I wish his family well. His struggle has come to an end."
Berserk,Crushed
Berserk,Wow how awful. Rest in peace
Berserk,Literally as I read the headline the guts theme cane up in my playlist.  Do sad
Berserk,Fuck
Berserk,"This is such sad news.

I was on FF14 last night in the main town and saw a line of Dark Knights hold their massive long sword and it was our way of paying tribute to Kentaro Miura. It was a sight to behold."
Berserk,Goddamn RIP I just hope Togashi or Oda doesn't bite the dust as well.
Berserk,Did Guts got off the boat before the mangaka passed away?
Berserk,Let's be honest. The CGI in the 2nd season killed him.
Berserk,Who is gonna finish his work!!!!! I must know how Berserk will end!
Berserk,"Alexa, play Guts Theme"
Berserk,"Does this have any connection to the arcade game Berserk? Spent a lot of quarters on that one. A 2D simplified version of Doom, which came much later."
Berserk,"I might sound like a dick, but it feels pointless now that I invested so much time and money into Berserk manga. At least I didn't watch anime adaptations because I knew there was no ending in sight."
Berserk,"Fuck you Miura I knew you were never gonna finish it! RIP but anyone who is a serious Berserk fan you gotta sympathize with how I feel this guy used to put out 3-4 chapters a year!!! My favourite story will now never have an ending, it is what it is I guess, sucks tho Griffith needs to die."
Berserk,"SON OF A BITCH

Edit: fyi im not calling Miura a s.o.b., im just really upset"
Berserk,"""Author of manga where swordsman embarks on eternal boat trip, dies."""
Berserk,"Guess I'm never finishing Berserk, well played Miura."
Berserk,[deleted]
Berserk,I can't believe he actually died before GRRM
Berserk,"Hahaha, I fucking KNEW he was never going to finish it. 

It's really sad that he died, but leaving it unfinished is so not a surprise."
Berserk,Amazing manga... Did he ever finished the manga?
Berserk,I will miss this man...
Berserk,"2021 just keeps on ‘giving’

Rest In Peace"
Berserk,"Rest in peace. I knew he had health issues, but I didn't expect them to take him this early. 

But recognizing that this is a tragedy, still, god dammit. Hopefully he had a road map to the rest of the series laid out. I really want to see the end of the story. And I was loving Gigantomachia and was hoping for more there as well. This is why I have let go of ASoIAF. Same thing is going to happen with GRRM."
Berserk,Wow......RIP.
Berserk,Rip
Berserk,"When i heard this news, the only thing that played in my head was Guts Theme..."
Berserk,Damn shame he passed when he was close to finishing the story.
Berserk,RIP
Berserk,:((
Berserk,"A lot of these Anime legends are quite a bit younger than I expected, and dying fairly young."
Berserk,My love for him is ticking clock
Berserk,It's a huge loss
Berserk,[My love for you... is like a **Truck**. **BESERKERRRRR**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MdfrMO9aaE) *Slightly* nsfw? :(
Berserk,That artwork of young Gutts there on the message is heartbreaking. In this context it's like he's saying his final goodbyes to us.
Berserk,Wow
Berserk,"So young, so sad. RIP"
Berserk,"This one hurts. Maybe it's the time I discovered this (bootleg VHS tapes in the 90s), but this series is just amazing and I was really hoping Miura would get the chance to finish it himself. Hopefully he's provided instructions to complete it, but this is just a profound loss."
Berserk,Rest In Peace. One of the only anime’s I genuinely and thoroughly enjoyed.
Berserk,Greatest anime of all time. Everything else is just kids stuff compared to Berserk. What a shame.
Berserk,I’ve been teary eyed ever since. May he Rest In Peace
Berserk,😭
Berserk,Is it possible that he had Marfan Syndrome? Because Jonathan Larson died the same way.
Kurokos Basketball,Cartoons about sports? No thanks.
Kurokos Basketball,"I'm about halfway through season two of Haikyuu right now and I'm really enjoying it. I love how despite the necessary bending of time for the sake of story and character, they do as much as possible to ground the show in real tactics and explains itself and volleyball to the audience. Because of the writing the show could probably succeed with a much less realistic portrayal of sport but the fact that they put the effort in makes it that much better for me."
Kurokos Basketball,No *Prince of Tennis* here?
Kurokos Basketball,"Soccer also has:

- ""Area no Kishi"" (The Knight in the Area) 
- ""Keppeki Danshi! Aoyama-kun"" (Clean Freak! Aoyama-kun)

I don't know if they are on any streaming service or not since I don't use any."
Kurokos Basketball,">Eyeshield 21

I really liked this show.  It was fun, exciting, funny. It showed an understanding of what makes American football a good sport.  Good depiction of why team sports in general bond diverse people together, even opponents.  Great depiction of how even if you have amazing talent you will need an insane amount of work to get anywhere."
Kurokos Basketball,"I'll add a few more that you missed out:

# Football/soccer

**Aoki Densetsu Shoot!** *\[No official stream\]*

58 episodes and 1 short movie. No English dub.

>This anime is based on the manga, ""Shoot!"", which was published between 1990 and 2003. It won the 1994 Kodansha Manga Award for Shounen. The anime adaptation was broadcast from 1993 to 1994 and thus, does not cover the entirety of the manga. It tells the story of Tanaka Toshihiko (""Toshi"") and his 2 friends, Hiramatsu Kazuhiro and Shiraishi Kenji, who played football together during middle school and were known as the Kakenishi Middle School's Golden Trio, and now they have graduated to high school. In high school though, it's only Toshi who continues to play football. His 2 friends have dropped out of football due to their personal circumstances. They are still in the same high school, Kakegawa High School. The reason that Toshi joined Kakegawa High School is because of his football idol, Kubo Yoshiharu, who plays there. The portrayal of football in this anime is a bit more down to Earth compared with Captain Tsubasa, the preeminent football anime then. It is a contemporary of the basketball anime, Slam  Dunk.

**Hungry Heart: Wild Striker** *\[No official stream\]*

52 episodes. No English dub.

>This anime came out in 2002 at roughly the same time as the manga. It is the creation of Takahashi Youichi (the creator of Captain Tsubasa). Created to tap into the interest in football to tie-in with the 2002 World Cup jointly hosted by Japan and South Korea. The story is about Kanou Kyosuke, a teenage high school student, whose older brother, Kanou Seisuke, is a top Japanese professional football player that plays for A.C. Milan (they were giants in European football then). His older brother taught him how to play and love football but he finds himself being regularly compared to his older brother by others. This pressure of expectation made him lose his passion in the game. This anime covers his path back to find that passion again.

**Whistle!** *\[No official stream\]*

39 episodes. No English dub.

>Based on the manga of the same name. The English-translated manga is published by Viz Media. There are 24 volumes in total. The manga/anime is about a middle school boy named Kazamatsuri Sho who dreams of becoming a professional football player. However, he is short and not that good at it but he does have a passion for it and works hard to improve himself. He makes it into Musashi no Mori Junior High School which hosts a top class football team but he is way down the order. He transfers to Sakura Josui Junior High School to have a better chance to make it into the football team there. The school is not known for football but does have a football team there. When the Sakura Josui football team hears that he transferred in from Musashi no Mori, there were high expectations of him but he could not deliver those expectations. The anime covers his determination to improve himself and to defy the odds for a short player. It's a show that espouses positive values.

# Baseball

**Mix** *\[Funimation\]*

24 episodes. English dub available.

>This is the anime adaptation of Adachi Mitsuru's manga of the same name. The manga is still under serialisation with a monthly release of chapters. This manga is set in the same world as Adachi's classic manga, ""Touch"", but 25-26 years after. It is not necessary to have watched the older series. For those who have, it's like slipping into a pair of comfy home slippers. The story revolves around the 2 Tachibana brothers, Souichirou and Touma,  and their younger sister, Otomi. The 2 bothers are step-brothers to each other but it so happens that they were born on the same date and at approx. the same time (to different mothers, of course). The older brother, Souichirou, and the younger sister are from the maternal side, while the 2nd brother, Touma, is from the fraternal side. They are good at baseball with Souichirou being an excellent catcher and Touma being an excellent pitcher. They make a formidable battery. This is their story from late middle school to early high school. For those familiar with Adachi's works, this is very typical Adachi with his quirks in full display.

**H2** *\[No official stream\]*

41 episodes. No English dub.

>Another anime adaptation of a Adachi Mitsuru manga. This is an earlier manga than ""Mix"" but a later one than ""Touch"". The manga ran from 1992 to 1999. The anime adaptation ran from 1995 to 1996. This series revolves around the competition between Kunimi Hiro, a pitcher, and Tachibana Hideo, 3rd base and 4th batter. In middle school, together with their catcher and friend, Noda Atsushi, their middle school team won the national championships consecutively. However, both Kunimi Hiro and Noda Atsushi were diagnosed with career-ending sports injuries before high school. Thus, the both of them enrolled in Senkawa High School, a high school with no baseball team so that they would not be reminded of not being able to play baseball anymore, whereas Tachibana Hideo enrolled in Meiwa Daiichi High School, a high school with a powerhouse baseball team. Early in their high school life, it turns out Kunimi's and Noda's injuries were wrongly diagnosed and that they are in good health to continue playing baseball. They now decide to form a baseball team in Senkawa to continue their baseball career. The title, ""H2"", relates to the initials of their first name, Hiro and Hideo. It also relates to the initials of the first name of the 2 girls, Amamiya Hikari and Koga Haruka, who are a core part of this series. Amamiya Hikari is the neighbourhood childhood friend of Hiro that Hiro matchmakes with Hideo during primary school years while Haruka is the girl who has a passion for baseball in Senkawa."

The Heroic Legend of Arslan,I feel like the author needs to either watch or address shows like *Invincible* or *Pantheon*.
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,I really love Vox Machina.  So glad we already know it will have a third season!
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,Anime Watchers: What gap??
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"Absolutely love this show, it’s just so much fun with great characters and voice acting and amazing fight scenes"
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,Undone was the shit
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,Really feel the same way about it. The earnestness is what sets it apart for me. It wears its heart entirely on its sleeve from moving emotional moments of growth to the kind of raunchy jokes and swearing people rattle off with their real friends. It feels far more real.
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"It's fun. Too much toilet Humor at times but it's a nice destraction from the usual doom and gloom stuff.

The characters are assholes sometimes but not *all* of them and not *all* the time.

The world is colourful and bright."
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"Just finished the first season. Its ok... Nothing really spectacular storywise and the animations are a bit weak.

It might be because I've just finished shows like Invincible, Castlevania, and Arcane. But this pales in comparison. As someone not familiar with Critical Role, there's nothing I've gathered from the first season to make me care about the characters or the world."
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"It’s ok, but got tired of them trying too hard to be “adult” with the jokes, sex references and swear words. Like calm TF down and let your story breathe, folks."
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"It's become one of my favourite series of many many years.

Love the animation style, the characters, the silly jokes. I love videogames and medieval fantasy and we don't get many shows like it.

I had no idea what critical role even was before to be honest."
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"It kind of feels like ""Western anime"", to me. In that it's a lot of fun, but it *does* feel like it sticks to themes of ""the power of friendship"" a bit *too* much. Like... sometimes, it feels like they sort of achieve things through sheer power of *emotions*, rather than tactics.

I also feel like, as fun as the action *looks*, it sometimes feels a bit like visual-noise. I'm kind of a novice when it comes to tabletop RPG's, and my father (who I've been watching it with) had never played one (though he's a big fan of MMORPG's), and it doesn't feel like there's any sort of consistency on how powerful these characters are or what they can do? I don't need hard ""power-levels"" or anything, but it's just hard understanding where these characters are in relation to the world around them. They seem effectively demigods sometimes, and then relatively ""normal"" other times.

Overall though, it's been fun.

My only two criticism are A) they lean *super* hard into ""this character is on the verge of death! wait, not really, they're totally fine"". Like... it felt like almost every episode. A part of me actually *wants* a character to die -- not because I don't like any of them, but because it's a cheap writing tactic to get people invested, and they've done it so much that it feels like there are no stakes. Either stop doing the ""fake-out"", or actually kill somebody.

The other criticism, for me, mainly concerns Vax (I think? the male twin). I get Critical Role is all about being super inclusive, that's something baked-into the world they've made. For a lot of folks, and probably the creators themselves, that's part of the appeal. But it creates for kind of a confusing world when seemingly everyone is attracted to everyone else, and in the case of him specifically, I feel like it's created a situation where I don't understand what the relationship dynamics are supposed to be. It feels... inconsistent. The characters can all be Bi, that's fine, but just help us understand what their relationships are, to each other and to other recurring characters."
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"Yeah honestly it rubs me the wrong way that invincible came out first but vox got a s2 first.

Also I would probably put this lower than shows like invincible, Castlevania, Primal, and arcane. STILL really fantastic, but idk that's just me."
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"Easily one of the best animated shows I’ve seen. Considering that the original goal was one 22-minute special episode for longtime fans, the actual outcome is phenomenal. It’s amazing to see this love project become so successful. All of my love to the Critical Role Fam."
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,Huge gap??
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"It's thoroughly okay, in all aspects. Fun time-filler but I wouldn't call it exemplary in any regard."
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,world??? lol. japan put 20 anime a season. Gtfo.
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,Vox Machina is just flat out a really good show.  I'm not a D&D guy at all and just randomly popped the show on one day and have been hooked.  Can't wait for season 3!
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"Great show, definitely recommend it"
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"It is… okay. Lotta fan service that cuts into the show. I wouldn’t call it bad, but I really can’t suggest it to anyone who isn’t a fan of the stream."
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,This show is so amazing
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,I had no idea that it was based on a D&D campaign. The table to screen compilations are 🔥🔥🔥
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,I completely agree with the author! I love animated sci-fi and fantasy but typically these stories star teens. Matter of fact my husband has started teasing me about watching high schoolers save the world. It is not my fault that most things that fall into this category follows teenage protagonists. Things like Vox Machina and Lower Decks are a breath of fresh air for me! I get my animated sci-fi/fantasy with adult protagonists that I can identify with more and not so much of the goofy ridiculousness as you would find in things like Family Guy and Rick and Morty. I hope more stories like these start coming out cause I am here for it!
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,What gap ?
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,So many better shows than vox.
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"I dont know if I've just only seen shitty scenes from it, but the dialog is increadibly cringe in that show."
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"Just finished season 2. Would highly recommend.

It's got great voice acting, great art and superb story.

Can't wait for season 3."
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,Second season is even better than the first one.
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"Such a fun show, I hope it has a nice long run great really funny and a great fantasy show"

The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"It’s genuinely just a fun show. Saw S1 when I had no real idea what Critical Role was, and was only vaguely aware of what DnD itself was or how it worked, but still enjoyed it a lot. 

Didn’t care much for the humor early on, especially in the first couple episodes- it actually reminded me a lot of the first couple episodes of Harley Quinn in how it just front loaded as much profanity, gore and sex jokes as possible. But it balances out over S1 and Season 2’s humor is, while still raunchy at times, far better balanced the same way Harley evened out. 

It’s definitely not a straight up grimly beautiful drama like Arcane. But its heavy enough to have substance while never being outright dour. It reminds me a lot of older scifi/fantasy adventure shows like Stargate, Farscape or Xena in how it has its heavier moments but there never stops being an underlying feeling of fun to it all, like it never takes itself too seriously. The kind of thing you put on and just have a good time with. 


I’d easily put it on par with later Castlevania seasons. Not as good as that shows first Dracula arc, but better than the subsequent ones. Vox Machina also seems to improve with every new batch of episodes as well. 

Id say its worth checking out for anyone who enjoys fantasy, and particularly found family stories, but isnt strictly looking for a pure drama."
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,Just finished season 2 last night. It's a good show.
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"I enjoy the show to an extent but I feel like it is fueled by tropes and stereotypes. When an epsidoe begins, you almost immediately will know how it will end. I also hate how death is nothing in this show. And the modern spin coating everything is tiresome. I mean jesus... Grog is now just ""god of war"" but weaker and dumber. 

Amazon is afraid to get really creative. They play it too safe even in their great tv shows like The Boys or The Expanse."
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"As far as original shows go, it's certainly up there as a fantastic addition to streaming shows. Definitely one I didn't expect to enjoy as much after so many other stinkers."
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,In the American view of the animation world.... Jesus.
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"I’m really enjoying Vox Machina, but it’s not “filling a huge gap” when there are tons of Japanese anime shows right now that honestly blow US cartoons out of the water.

Modern Western cartoon is honestly bare bone when it comes to finding good shows that isn’t shitty adult comedy/ Rick and Morty clones. They just never want to branch out to different genres and keep doing the same stuff over and over again. It’s either comedy or fantasy action, that’s it."
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,Best show of the year so far
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"This show is actually very mediocre.

if ""ehh"" was an animated TV show, this would be it"
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"To it’s credit I did finish the 1st season, but I just felt like it was so corny. Like I want American FMA, HxH, Monster, Berserk… not this."
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"Pantheon 

Primal

Invincible

Castlevania 

*gestures vaguely at anime*"
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,Arcane is amazing.
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,Bruh how can this be adult animation with no comedic gore or gross humor
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,I completely agree with the author! I love animated sci-fi and fantasy but typically these stories star teens.

The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"Vox is fun. That means a lot. Doesn't take itself seriously. Action, comedy, adventure, absurd musical numbers, and fisting jokes. Perfect TV"
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,What’s the show about?
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"I really hope culture changes enough in the next years so that people don't write embarrassing shit like this anymore. ""Saving a fantastical world with the power of friendship isn’t just for kids."" *Yes, it is.*"
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,Primal was fucking great too
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,Don't forget Castlevania. I'm excited about that sequel series they revealed.
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"Those are coming-of-age stories with teenage protagonists, which is precisely what the author of the article *isnt* referring to in the title. 

VM is ""special"" because it has a cast of adult characters with adult humor going around fantasy land and saving everyone. Most shows with a similar premise tend to feature, like I mentioned, teenage casts and coming-of-age stories. Castlevania is the big exception, but it ofc has a very different tone to VM."
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,PANTHEON!! Totally got screwed by it’s platform. If it was on a bigger/more accessible service that shit would have blown up.
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,Then on top of those two you also have Dota: Dragon's Blood and Dragon Age: Absolution over at Netflix. I guess Arcane is more YA than adult aimed but it is definitely serialised fantasy in animation.
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,[deleted]
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"They didn’t pay for an article, fuck em."
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,And Pantheon got cancelled despite being awesome.
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,RIP Pantheon.
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,Arcane?
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"The author is an idiot, but this comment is hilarious because it's the most upvoted and yet dumbs down the conversation so much. Now we have to take a step back and explain to this smug poster what ""coming of age"" means"
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,Don’t forget King of the Hill
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"I feel like you should read the article, the author has seen those shows:

> The Legend of Vox Machina is not the first of these shows, but it is the one that made me realize just how wide the gap between Steven Universe and Rick and Morty is."
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"to be fair she said ""fantasy animation by adults for adults"" while invincible is a superhero show and pantheon is science fiction."
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,Also that they're working on Mighty Nein as well.
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"Critical Role gets a lot of love, and rightly so, but the space for actual play D&D style games has really blossomed ( partly because of CR).

My personal favorite is dimension 20 -- relatively high production values and a cast with a comedy background.

So if people want more of that sort of story telling and are willing to take a chance on medium, check out a few actual play shows and see if one tickles your fancy"
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,They really have started to create harry potter levels of empire.
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"To be fair the article does touch on that, even though a lot of anime is more willing to be mature a huge chunk of the mainstream ones are ultmately still coming of age stories about children, and a lot of these are still definitely aimed at children, we're just able to enjoy it too. One example I think about is how both Naruto and Ben 10 gradually aged up the cast, and once the cast got old enough instead of making a show about the adult cast they just reset to being about kids. 

Which isnt to say there's nothing like that in anime, I havent started new Trigun but old Trigun was definitely in that niche of action based fantasy/sci fi story about friendship. There is a lot if you search for it though I suspect the average anime fan just watches the most popular shows to come out each year like cartoon fans do. I also feel like a lot of mature anime about adults ends up not being action at all, Oddtaxi was amazing but I dont know if I'd say its comparable to The Owl House."
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"It seems like no one in this thread has actually read the article. The article is specifically talking about how VM is unique by being a high fantasy adventure comprised entirely of adult characters with no coming-of-age plotlines.

There are bound to be *some* animes that do fit that bill, but most anime fans will agree that the vast majority (especially the most popular) don't. Some fantasy seinen have mostly adult protagonists and themes, but almost always also have extremely dark tones and settings that Vox Machina avoids. They also rarely get any attention in the west, which is dominated by shounen."
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"The gap of non-ecchi anime.

I know some people can accept sexualized anime, but most of it is trash and feels very pedo. Girls who look childish but are “hundred year old demons” or whatever is fucking gross.

Even Your Name, brilliant until the end, all of a sudden up skirt shot at the end “but it was a boy in a girls body.” Fucking pervs."
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,Shows that don’t have characters that need to go on internal monologues about how they need to be stronger and have more willpower for a decent 20% of the show’s total runtime in the voice registry of a 7 year old boy
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,Cartoons
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"Agree, the fight scenes are epic, especially the ones in the S2 premiere and the last three eps.  I really liked the character arcs for Vax, Grog, and Scanlan this season, too.  They are all great voice actors, especially the guy who plays Scanlan.  His musical numbers are always so much fun.  He is a terrific singer!"
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"A shame the entire underdark got skipped, i liked the dwarf city and the party ""friend"" they picked up. Guess they didn't want more stuff with the dragonborn sorcerer"
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"For sure, but rotoscope is kind of on the edge…"
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"The moment that really really sold me on the show was in episode 3 when >!Percy had a panic attack after seeing the Briarwoods and the whole crew came together, no jokes, no banter, and asked what they can do to help him. 
I was a little worried the show was gonna be a bunch of troppy assholes arguing the whole show, and had already written off Grog and Percy as 1-note, but that moment made me fall in love with the whole team. Percy and Vex are fucking adorable together!<"
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"I just wish they'd do a bit more show don't tell.

The last few episodes were at some points kind of ridiculous when it comes to flashbacks during pivotal character moments. You'd have long flashbacks to scenes that happened only one or two episodes ago."
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"Yeah, they did it their way. There aren’t corpo shills telling them, “no, we can’t have Scanlan sing about anal beads or masturbation.” They gleefully and accurately translate the spirit of that game into the cartoon. =)"
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"See I’ve never watched/listened to Critical Role either, but I loved the first season! I wasn’t expecting it to be groundbreaking or anything, just wanted to have a fun experience and that’s exactly what it delivered."
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"Did you really just compare the animation to invincible?? Where they literally had some of the hero’s moving through still shots? Don’t get me wrong, I liked the show, but vox machinas animation was MUCH better than invincible; which was clearly rushed."
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"Speaking as a fan of CR, the first season of Legends of Vox Machina mildly sucked, especially compared to other adult animated shows, like Invincible and Arcane.

The second season is much better.  Sadly, I don't think very many people are going to get through the first season with any impetus to watch on."
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"okay there's not much that can compare to Arcane, that's an unfair expectation"
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"I finished the second season. The show feels like it was written for CR fans, and no one else. The show starts with an already established group with characters in the middle of their own characters arcs. The second season is better, only for the fact the characters are a little more established. Otherwise,  you're correct, you have no reason to care about any of the characters"
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,This is true the animation isnt great
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"It's essentially just a show based on scripted RP. No matter how vehemently the fan base screams that it's all organic you can definitely tell they've been workshopping their material with each other and coming with up bits to do together. It's scripted, workshopped, rewritten, and practiced. Both CR and the show by extension get a lot of leeway with various aspects of their performance because it's all supposed to be made up on the spot and you can tell it's just not. That's not a deal breaker for a lot people but it is for others. 

It's very average and pretty derivative (ie they have a character whose entire concept is ""Sokka but he gets laid"")."
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,I feel like season one was kinda meh but season two is considerably better because it actually has character development for everyone.
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,I must have been sick or something the week I watched Arcane.  Do not understand the hype at all.
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"I am pretty sure the source material had even more, just more improvised"
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,Most scenes with that unfunny gnome make me want to drop the series.
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"Surprisingly the music is really fucking good too, Adds lots of point sin my book"
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"I tried getting into the show recently myself and I pretty much agree with that. Though I thought their horny for everyone thing was just them making fun of the decades old trope of every d&d campaign always having at least one guy that tries to sleep with everyone and everything and use charm for everything  (which in my gaming in middle and high school was certainly on point). 

But yeah the show overall reminded me of Saturday morning cartoons from the 90s. Not the good ones, but the stuff like Captain planet. I would definitely say we need more animation like that today. It's definitely not anime and its not adult animation, it's more like the older cartoons and that's pretty cool tbh.

Also I haven't read the article fwiw."
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,">My only two criticism are A) they lean *super* hard into ""this character is on the verge of death! wait, not really, they're totally fine"". Like... it felt like almost every episode. A part of me actually *wants* a character to die -- not because I don't like any of them, but because it's a cheap writing tactic to get people invested, and they've done it so much that it feels like there are no stakes. Either stop doing the ""fake-out"", or actually kill somebody.

A lot of this is down to the source material being a D&D game. Because... yeah, nearly every big fight, at least one character was on the verge of death. If that wasn't the case, the game wouldn't have been fun to play. Additionally, >!they *did* kill a character this season - but of course, she was resurrected, because that's something that can happen in D&D.!<

They could definitely work on being more creative with the stakes, but when you have a character in the party that can literally magically heal just about any wound/injury, the stakes do have to be pretty high for there to be any tension."
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"eh, Legend of Vox Machina season 1 was funded by kickstarter, and Amazon came in 2019 to boost the season 1 funding and give the second season. Invincible released in 2021 - while LoVM release was delayed to 2022 - but LoVM could go straight into production for season 2 with no downtime once the writers etc were done with their portions for season 1."
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"Personal opinion, animated superhero shows aren't something new, we have tons of them.

Not interested in invincible because it's too violent for my taste.

But a medieval fantasy animated show? We have way less of those. The ones I remember now are DOTA, the Witcher animated movie, castlevania and dragon age absolution. And I loved all of those.

Also I love toilet humor, what can I say. I might be 40, but my friends and I still joke with that. So it's nice and refreshing when most adult cartoons in that style are a bit overly doom and gloom."
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"Let’s be real Amazon has the money to produce both at once, it was probably more a matter of choice considering how well received Invincible was and scheduling conflicts. I know Seth Rogan is a minor VA in it, and I think he also participates in writing and directing. I think it’s the same thing for The Boys. When Amazon has a banger of a show they typically know to keep it going and how to do so successfully despite some of the shitty adaptations. 

I mean didn’t The Expanse get picked up and flooded with cash because it’s a book Bezos enjoys? They do have big IPs they’ve made flop, so they aren’t even close to infallible, but they seem to do well with the content they manage to get roots in the ground for."
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"yikes, you must be never see damn thing else then. poor soul"
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"I know it doesnt bother some anime fans but sexualizing little girls is a big turnoff for most people not desensitized to it through years of anime watching. Its why anime like Attack on Titan and Demon Slayer break through to mainstream pop culture once in awhile; but the larger volume of series with names like ""my little sister is sexually frustrating me"" get ignored"
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,"Yeah  
he's crying ""oh, we finally have a adult animated show""  
Wait, do you think stuff like Black Lagoon are for children ???  
Fuck, i am 45, and i still have a hard time watching the twins arc"
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,I mean anime is almost as bad as cartoons are in terms of the good:trash ratio.
The Heroic Legend of Arslan,I know who critical role are but I've never seen anything from them. I loved the show.
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,I wish they would go back to more traditional artwork.  The fluidity of the animation in this trailer is just awful.
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,Why do all the characters look like faces drawn on balloons?
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,"Imagine it's 2022 and people using SFM and Blender for hobby animating create more fluid animations than a professional studio. 

Or like.. imagine looking at the original GitS and thinking ""this beautiful animation needs to be all CGI."
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,how anyone can tolerate this kind of animation is beyond me
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,"I know people hated on the first season but after five minutes I was used to the artstyle.

I'm just happy to have some more GitS."
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,At least the plot is not shit
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,I am honestly surprised it got renewed for a second season given how terrible the first season was
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,this looks worse than fuckin Reboot did 30 years ago
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,Really did not like the animation for season 1.
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,"I was pleasantly surprised by the first season. Found the art style jarring at first, but got used to it eventually. By the end I really felt like I was back in the world of gits sac."
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,"Was the first season of this the one with the self insert character backflipping naked down a hallway for what seemed like 10 minutes?

That was unintentionally hilarious"
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,Arcane basically ruined animation for me. I just can't get used to anything else because that one was so beautiful.
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,I mean this animation wouldn't even be acceptable for 2007 PS3 cut scene animations.
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,2045 because it's 2045 frames of animation across the entire series.
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,"What the *hell* did I just watch? Star Wars: Clone Wars managed to be great CG, this is years later and...yegods."
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,The original stand alone complex show from early 2000s was masterpiece great show with really good animation
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,Why do something when you're just going to half ass it
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,"This got a second season!???? Well to be fair, I barely have it a chance because I thought it looked awful."
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,How did I not know there was a Season 1? GITS is my favourite anime of all time but not a fan of CGI over animated.
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,This looks exceptionally ugly.
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,Right. The 27 yo original absolutely blows this away.  It shouldn't be that way.
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,"I thought these comments were being hyperbolic just because it wasn’t the same as the original, because fans of shows can be overly critical of new things. And then I watched it. Holy cow it’s awful. Reminds me of the last Berserk remake a little. Claaaang. It’s embarrassing anyone would willingly put their names in the credits for this."
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,Moe ruined anime.
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,Its the expression that looks awful. The overall animation looks okay.
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,"It's not so much the medium or type of animation as the animation quality and budget. They could have done this in 2D and it would have still looked terrible, because the issue is it's not being driven the same way as the movies or SAC"
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,It really is kind of strange. Anime once became big in the West for its kinetic and detailed hand drawn animation and now Netflix puts out these cheapo shows that look like shit and it still finds an audience. I guess that's why it's gotta be established brands to find any viewership. I love Oshii and his GitS version but I have zero interest in seeing this.
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,Profits.  And simply not caring about the integrity of the animation quality or the overall production.  Which is kind of contrary to maximizing profits.  Dang.  You're right.  It makes no sense.
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,"I kinda like this one, it's nice for evening chill"
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,This was actually planned for two from the start.
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,Especially after how easily netflix cancels good shows. Although they could still find a way to make it worse like they did to Altered Carbon
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,"if you get past the art style it's great, and I'm pretty sure that's all the original voice cast still....."
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,"The Stand Alone Complex hand drawn style with light CGI was phenomenal. What an awesome, forward thinking anime to have received in the early-mid aughts"
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,"Also dialogue writing skills, but yes."
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,Wow that was a resentful review
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,"I have no completed yet the series, but is not so bad. I dont gonna read the review because Im sure there some spoilers..."
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,"This will be a collaboration between studios Production I.G and SOLA DIGITAL ARTS, Kenji Kamiyama (Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex) & Shinji Araki (Appleseed) confirmed to be working on this."
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,"More Stand Alone Complex?  Yes, please."
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,I really hope that this is essentially a “3rd gig.”
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,So this is going to be a sequel to solid state society? I hope they will dub it with the OG cast.
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,Yoko Kanno to write the ost please!
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,"Wait, is that Kuvshinov Ilya's artwork I see?"
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,They got the original director of stand alone complex to direct blade runner Black lotus and another ghost in the Shell series? Netflix is on a motherfucking roll
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,"On the CG quality metric, there's Land of the Lustrous and then there's Berserk 2016.... let's hope it's at least far enough away from the latter."
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,Will Scarlett Johansson play every character?
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,Yes!!! Ghost in the shell is my favorite!

Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,"Please just be in 2D, not that loathsome CGI that Netflix uses for so much of their stuff."
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,You guys miss me? 
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,So excited for this project. Ghost in the Shell continues to be my favorite everything.
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,"So, it's going to be set \~15 years after SAC?..."
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,God dammit yes. I stopped watching anime years ago but GiTS SAC was always my favorite and just fantastic TV.
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex," SAC and 2nd Gig were some of the best stuff ever made.  IMHO better than the seminal movie, in part because there was more time for a paced story but in all the world was so much richer. 

""Innocence"" and ""Solid State Society"" were good, well I remember they were ok but not top-notch.

Then ""Ghost in the Shell: New Movie"" came out.  The writing and animation were not up to par, I stopped watching in 15 min.  Now this was not the live action movie (which wasn't great).  They actually only CALLED it ""New Movie"" and nothing else, which was of course superseded by an actually newer movie.

 "
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,">New Ghost in the Shell series

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

>Coming to Netflix

ಥʖ̯ಥ"
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,"I hope they capture the tone of the original SAC. The Arise series was pretty good, but it missed the soul of SAC. Hopefully that's what Kamiyama will bring back to the franchise."
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,Please don't fuck it up. 
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,That's a release year? Oh... Gods. I've become old.
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,Please be decent.
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,"i'm not gonna lie, i didn't like the reboot/sequel/w.e the fuck that was that happened. it makes me skeptical of this one. "
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,I've been hurt before. 
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,This is good news.
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,"...coming to Netflix in 2020

...cancelled by Netflix in 2021"
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,"Hey, while y'all at it, can ya stick SAC and 2nd gig back on the roster? "
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,If it is 75% as good as the two seasons of SAC we already had I will be happy. 
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,I'd honestly rather a radio drama than 3DCGI. Hopefully it looks more like FighterZ and less like Vexhille
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,Anyone have a source for the art piece?
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,"Love the idea, just not sure if Netflix is doing this a justice with their, one-of-a-kind animation"
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,Assuming this is voiced by Emma Stone or...Hermione or something 
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,Someone please tell me how to get into Ghost in The Shell? What do I have to watch or read?

""I can't wait for this new show based on something I already enjoyed!"""
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,"As a huge GitS fan, this is what I've been waiting for for 12 years."
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,Adult Swim announces a Blade Runner animated series and Netflix answers back with a new season of Stand Alone Complex. This has certainly been exciting news all around.
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,"Sounds great, can't wait for it to be cancelled 2 seasons in! "
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,#HA!     They said sack 
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,"The original anime is the only one I like. Literally, it is a piece of art that stands apart from the genre."
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,Dem she lookin fine boi 
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,Another Stand Alone Complex? Sign me the fuck up! I’m stoked!
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,Plz don't suck...
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,"I am beyond hyped for a new season of stand alone complex, my favoritest show of all time. This is exactly what i wanted when i heard Kamiyama was making 2 seasons of GitS (12 episodes each).

If you aren't familiar with GitS: Stand Alone Complex, I'd highly recommend it, but i also acknowledge that it is not for everybody. Tbh it is confusing as fuckkk. However, the tactical action and gunplay is unmatched in animation and cinema. To summarize the premise: the show follows an investigative police department that is also a unit of (mostly) ex-military cyborgs that is also a team of hackers. There's 8 of them. The exact overarching plot is nearly impossible to fully understand the first time you watch the show, but that's ok because you will be blown away by the awesomeness of the music, action, characters, visuals, etc. The last ~6 episodes of both seasons are packed with nonstop amazingness.

For an easier introduction than SAC that many recommend you start with, watch the 1995 Oshii Ghost in the Shell movie. I think it's 90minutes. This is not connected to Stand Alone Complex but it has the same characters, they're both based on the same manga series. It has one sequel which i would hold off on until later.

Ignore GitS Arise imo, because it's the worst of all the GitS continuities. Not saying it's bad, but it absolutely does not compare with Stand Alone Complex."
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,Theyre gonna fuck it up
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,if it doesn't star scarlet Johansson then i'm not watching /s
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,News is barely out and people are already making up ways of how it can go wrong. Geez. Have faith in Kenji. 
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,"long as they don't turn it into leftwing garbage I""m ok with it. "
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,"I've been a long time fan of GitS, but there's been so many productions around it at this point that it feels pretty disjointed."
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,I really hope product placement from our current year again.
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,Anything to do with the guys that did stand alone complex Im in 
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,Christmas 
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,"It would be great if they keep the interesting philosophy in it - or better yet expanded on it. That's the original reason I loved GITS, and its what the resent stuff could do better. "
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,"Never really gotten a spinoff, for gits have we? Has it always just either been continuations or reboots?"
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,"Live action or animated?

Edit: **ANIMATED, HELL YEAH!**"
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,"Alas, something to look forward to. "
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,"When you don't have Netflix, so you'll wait online."
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,"New SAC?! 

Not even mad about Dare Devil after this news.

Seriously. I can't really stand anime. A few shows here and there. All old stuff like Cowboy Beboop. But I have rewatched SAC 1 and 2 three times. It's just Amazon. "
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,"Oh, I might have to renew my Netflix for this"
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,I could never really get into this anime
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,Fuckin A!  I just now finished 2nd Gig
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,"Ghost in the Shell, innocence and SAC 1 and 2 were cool but it’s been downhill since then. I’ll keep my hopes up but I’m not expecting much. Also if that’s the art style I won’t even watch it lol. "
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,right...but will it suck?
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,"Hell yeah, I just rewatched the first two seasons for like the 5th time 

I'm optimistic if kamiyama is still involved "
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex,"Wow, has any series constantly got so much reinvention?

Rhetorical question, will there ever be enough GitS?"
Please like Me,"Please Like Me was great. I kept up with it casually when it first started, but it really got better and better. Season 3 was probably the peak for me since season 4 was more intensely sad overall. But it was a great show which I wish had gotten to end with the writers’ full knowledge and planning.

If you like Please Like Me and its holiday episode, I’d suggest The Outs. It’s definitely shaggier since it was a web series but the heart and characters really shine through. The Channukah special hits that bittersweet melancholy vibe perfectly, and functioned as a good series finale though they did another season eventually. Same creators also made another web series, Whatever This Is, and I’m still foolishly holding out hope for a second season!"
Please like Me,Love this show!!
Please like Me,"I love this show so much, I watched it when it originally aired in Australia and have rewatched it a bunch of times since. It just seems to capture so well how it feels to be an aimless twenty something trying to grow up but not really wanting to. I love all the characters and the show tackles issues like family, mental health and sexuality in such a true to life way. It hits that balance between funny and sad in a way that makes it feel really relevant whenever I'm going through some stuff."
Please like Me,what do u think of the show?
Please like Me,"It’s a really lovely series. I was a little unsure after the plot-heavy first episode if it would land on a steady tone, but it’s found its rhythm now."
Please like Me,"Omg thanks for letting me know this is already airing. I LOVE Please Like Me, so i really hope this is great as well."
Please like Me,"Love josh thomas, so keen to watch this. It is so rare for a light to be shone on autistic girls."
Please like Me,"I’m super excited for this show, because of positive autistic representation, portrayed by an autistic actress! It’s good!!  Hopefully Kayla Cromer is having an active say in her character’s portrayal and all of that."
Please like Me,Old fashion character driven drama without some gimmick? I'm in!

Please like Me,"I know rating aren't everything, but wow it has a [100% on RT and 95% from the audience.](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/please_like_me/)

Will be checking out, sounds like it's right up my alley. Thanks OP"
Please like Me,This show is seriously incredible. 
Please like Me,Great show! Really heartfelt and fun.
Please like Me,The show perfectly captures the confusion and anxiousness of life in your twenties. In one of the first episodes of season one he struggles to change his clothes behind his bedroom door. Away from the eyes of his overnight guest. Something so simple had me laughing my ass off. Such a relatable show. 
Please like Me,"So, it's no longer on the Pivot cable channel? Which is where I've been watching it..."
Please like Me,I don't think it has a single bad episode. It probably is my favorite show and I really hope there's a season 5
Please like Me,"I just stumbled on this show too, somehow popped up on my recommendations (thank you Netflix). I have been trying to pace myself, but it's been a week and I'm almost done Season 3. 

Took me a while to understand why I like the show, but it's honest. Not honest as in it's realistic, some of the situations were admittedly a bit hard to believe, but the way the characters react is honest. How people deal with being unable to explain mental illness, understanding their sexuality, all these are very relevant issues today. What makes the show lovable though is that bit of quirkiness Josh adds, to laugh and be sarcastic and trust that everything is going to be okay. "
Please like Me,"It was recommended to me by a friend 3 days ago, and I just finished the second season last night. Tonally, and obviously accent-wise, it reminds me a bit of Summer Heights High. It walks that fine line between hard laughs and pathos beautifully."
Please like Me,"Hulu??  

That'll be the day..."
Please like Me,I just saw that the 4th season is now on Hulu which I will be starting tonight/this weekend.  I heard wonderful things and that it was the best season yet. 
Please like Me,Report back your thoughts please. :) Love to hear if I brought you some joy. :) 
Please like Me,High RT television scores are almost meaningless.
Please like Me,"That was the scene (I think it was episode 1 or 2) that really just sold me on the ""realness"" of the show.  Because we have all been there with a date we've brought home and perhaps a bit shy about trying to get ready for bed and that door kept opening and his date was so very patient it was a phenomenal scene. And then of course the subsequent ""I taste blood."" moment. LOL"
Please like Me,"Nope. Pivot is no more.  The channel ceased operations on October 31, 2016.   But Hulu has all the previous seasons and the new one (Season 4) that just premiered in Australia late last year. "
Please like Me,I just finished Season 4 and I can say it's quite possibly the best one. I didn't want to Binge...but I couldn't help myself.  Amazing!
Please like Me,Besides the accents it's nothing like summer Heights high. 
Please like Me,"Thats great!!  Season 2 was fantastic,  It has one of the most amazing episodes with just Josh and his Mum Scroggin'.  

I don't really remember a show that had me laughing as hard and also as emotionally invested in the characters so quick. It's also gut wrenching honest with the characters.  

Anyways, glad you found the show and enjoyed it also!!"
Please like Me,"It is the best season, again pay attention to your heart while you'll watch it."
Please like Me,"Yes, I said that ratings aren't everything and I don't live or die by them. But it's stupid to say they are meaningless. Especially the audience score."
Please like Me,"That's a shame. I would have liked to continue watching it. I already have too many monthly fees, not gonna add another one."
Please like Me,Can't wait! i hope I can find it online. My favourite so far has been Season 2. Really love how they added Arnold and Hannah so I hope they stay on for Season 4.
Please like Me,Josh's rant about AIDS in that episode is the hardest I've laughed all year.
Please like Me,*takes anxiety medicine* Will do.  
Please like Me,Finished season 4.  I am WRECKED.  WOW!  Yup. Best season.  I sure hope Hulu and ABC partner to pick this up for more episodes I really want to follow Josh and Tom on their next chapter. 
Please like Me,Awww rats.  :(  Well hopefully you will be able to watch it on a different format sometime soon on a service you already have.  Cheers!
Please like Me,No Spoilers from me but they are terrific characters indeed. 
Please like Me,"We need a 5th season! Josh and Tom single again after theirs last experiences, we need to know how they fight/live and move on to a happy-ish ending."
Please like Me,"We just finished the fourth season last night after binge watching the rest over the last 2 weeks. I can honestly say that second last episode destroyed me! It was so hard to watch but felt so true to his moms story. 
This show has been so great to watch, just the right mix of humour and cringe but with pretty dark, serious storylines. Can't wait to watch more!!!"
Please like Me,Exactly!!!!!  ughhhh its killing me. I even DM'd Hulu on twitter begging. LOL
Please like Me,So lol let me know if they'll answer haha
Please like Me,I love this show so much.
Please like Me,I need to set aside some time to watch this series. I’ve heard good things.
Please like Me, Bummed that it ended.
Please like Me,"And you won't even need to set aside too much time! It's only 8 half-hour episodes per season on average (4 seasons total).

(For anyone wondering, it's [on Hulu](https://www.hulu.com/series/please-like-me-172a0482-c365-4225-935e-255d45314c52) in the U.S.)"
Please like Me,"This show has fast turned into a classic Australian show. If you want to check out some other great shows from here, might I suggest the following;
[**Utopia** (also known as Dreamland outside Australia for reasons beyond me).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia_(Australian_TV_series)) Show about a government organisation/department created to oversea the building of major infrastructure projects for the country, except projects tend to suffer from issues like project creep, other departments (often marketing people) trying to sex things up, or ministers wanting to use whatever project to better their image than finish the damn thing at all. Same team also made [**The Hollowmen**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollowmen) about a government department who are focused on doing things to make the PM look as good as possible. Watch if you are a fan of shows like Parks & Rec by way of The West Wing with more swearing (Or The Thick of It if from the UK but want less swearing with those types of shows).

If you are a fan of those shows, some of the cast worked together to produce their own show called [**Rosehaven**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosehaven). Story about a boy who left for the mainland returns home to help run his family Real Estate Agency in a small rural town in Tasmania when his mother gets sick. Expect many jokes about what it is like to live in Rural Australia, more so from a Tasmanian point of view. Watch it if you like shows like Green Acres, etc.

[**Upper Middle Bogan**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Middle_Bogan) (might not be on the Netflix versions outside Australia). Woman is medical professional who comes from an upper middle class background. Woman discovers that she was adopted, and actually comes from loving family who are working poor (*bogans*). Shenanigans ensures. Watch if you like Arrested Development. The show, not so much the band...

[**Rake**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rake_(Australian_TV_series)). Sydney barrister is the best guy you go to if you have committed any crimes, the go to man for lost causes. Also a walking time bomb of self destructive behaviours and actions. A good mix of drama with humour thrown in for good measure. Watch this if you are a fan of shows like Suits or any of the beloved David E. Kelley legal shows.

[**Cleverman**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleverman) It is the near future and two estranged brothers from the Gumbaynggirr tribe are forced together when one of them is passed the mantle of the Cleverman, someone who is pretty much a superhero type figure drawn out from the Dreamtime. They have to work out what this means in a world that wants to either shut them down or control them, or both. Watch this if you are a fan of, well, honestly countless shows like this. Only 6 episodes so far.

[**Jack Irish**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Irish) These are kinda more tv movies, but some cheating is allowed here since they have made a tv series. Former lawyer turned PI/debt collector/other odd jobs fights to put his life back together. Has a knack at finding those people who don't wish to be found (or are not meant to be), if he can be arsed to do that in the first place. Watch this if you want to see what Australian talent like Guy Pearce gets up to down here.

[**Glitch**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch_(TV_series)) Kinda like Les Revenants/The Returned (if you want to take note of the American remake). Show is about a town where the dead suddenly return to life (they look normal, no ""classic"" zombie thing here) and try to get on with their lives as they understand what is happening to them. Show was made by the ABC, but will be co-produced with Netflix for the second season.

There are others, but those are a taste."
Please like Me,"Please Like Me is fucking amazing. I cried my heart out at the second to last episode in the newest (final?) season because they manage to... I guess, keep the whimsical tone but still go to a very horrible place that is so upsetting because it is so incredibly human. 

Not sure if that episode/season is on Netflix yet, though..."
Please like Me,"I love this show so much.  I started watching when Lena Durham recommended it in her twitter.  
Love Josh and all the gang.  His parents. His friends.  His boyfriends.  Really heartfull show. "
Please like Me,I'm a 53 year old straight guy with a wife and kids and all I can say is that this show is adorable.
Please like Me,"I've been watching it over the past week with my best friend after her work. Her suggestion, actually, and it was well bumping my regular schedule. 

It was super awkward, at first, but it really grows on you. Alan is my favourite so far. "
Please like Me,"The first season is by far the best, but I love every episode. Such a good show. "
Please like Me,"I started watching it a couple of weeks ago. Yup, lots of great laughs and surprises. I still don't understand how it can be Australian, though, because I haven't seen any venomous creatures killing everybody."
Please like Me,"Confused, can't find this on Netflix?"
Please like Me,"It's probably called dream land because there is already a TV series called Utopia. 

As for Hollow men. Fantastic series. "
Please like Me,Just noticed that Alan is the dad lol. He and Mae are my favorite too.
Please like Me,The first 3 seasons are on Hulu in the US instead of Netflix. 
Please like Me,"It must be unavailable in some regions. Since it's an Australian show, I'm not sure where else it might be available. :/"
Please like Me,"Of course it's thr one streaming service I don't use. Bleh. Well, thanks."
Please like Me,"ABC iview has all four seasons and they don't block VPNs, fyi... "
Please like Me,This show is super underrated. Shame this season is only 6 episodes. Buuuut I'm still gonna go binge it anyway. Thanks OP.
Please like Me,"If this were on Netflix and branded a ""Netflix Original"" or on HBO it would be heralded as one of the great series of the last decade. It's too bad it doesn't get the attention it deserves. This season was a bit up and down, but two episodes in particular are some of the best TV of year, bar none. "
Please like Me,"best series i binged all year, hands down. "
Please like Me,This season ended up being the most emotionally gripping thing I watched all year.
Please like Me,Guess I'm going to have to get Hulu now.
Please like Me,Thank you for reminding me about this show.  I started it a few years ago and lost track of it! 
Please like Me,It's on the Dutch version of Netflix. Which is how I found out about it. It's definitely one of the best shows I've ever seen and I recommended it to all my friends.
Please like Me,"Well, I think it gets attention in Australia, it has won quite a few awards over there. I am so glad someone suggested it to me, it's so great.  "
Please like Me,"It's great but it's pretty sad. Beautiful show, the end had me in tears. Gonna start my first rewatch soon."
Please like Me,"I'm watching it right now! It's a beautiful show, maybe a bit sad at times. I'm really enjoying it."
Please like Me,I have. And its really good. I am on S2 now. They recently added S4 too.
Please like Me,It's definitely my favourite show of all time. Perfect balance of comedy and drama and incredibly consistent over the entire series.
Please like Me,Not on American Netflix; just checked.
Please like Me,"I think it is on hulu in America?

"
Please like Me,It is (just checked).
Please like Me,Thanks for the info about this being on Hulu.
Please like Me,You're welcome.
Please like Me,"This is so great! Please Like Me was an absolutely incredible, funny, and many times heartbreaking series.  Josh Thomas is extremely talented, so it's great that he's getting to write/act again. Definitely will be looking forward to this. I just hope Freeform doesn't hold him back or put limits on him, because his comedy and writing can be very dark."
Please like Me,"I really really loved Please Like Me.  
I don't know about a show on Freeform, though. Isn't that an American family channel?   "
Please like Me,Not anymore. They're growing up a bit and rebranding. They want high school to mid-20s now. 
Please like Me,"Starting Please Like Me soon!

Similar shows: You're The Worst, Catastrophe, and Casual."
Please like Me,"I've been recommending please like me to everyone, and it seems to only get better "
Please like Me,"Please Like Me feels more real and emotional, but I do love both shows."
Please like Me,"my favourite aspect about master of none is the social commentary on race. 

imo no show has done a better job of joking about the dynamics of race in north america, from the perspective of a minority, as good as master of none.

"
Please like Me,[deleted]
Please like Me,"I haven't seen Please Like Me, but I enjoyed Master of None for the most part. It certainly owes a great deal to Louie, though. It's not nearly as daring or experimental (perhaps give it time, though), but I was picking up on a definite ""Louie-esque""-vibe in tone throughout. I'm not quite sure exactly how to put that comparison into words though.

That said, and as others have mentioned in this thread, the show also felt very sanitized and safe, missing that underlying raw cynicism that makes Louie CK's work so relatable and real to me.

One of my favorite moments of the season is in the second episode, I believe, where the show grinds to a halt for several minutes just to give a lengthy, drawn-out summation of the lives of Dev and a friend's fathers. Just a series of flashbacks, not played for laughs, showing how two old men arrived at the current moment in time. I thought that was really well-done, and immediately left me with a desire to give my own parents a call."
Please like Me,I think Please Like Me maybe took more risks and has a more interesting supporting cast. Both great shows though.
Please like Me,"I started both shows at the same time, and I find them pretty similar thematically, though Please Like Me skews a bit younger. I came into Master of None, really expecting to like it, and it's fine, but I think Please Like Me ruined it for me by being just so much better."
Please like Me,"Master of None has some spots good writing, I'm not a fan of Ansari usually, but I couldn't really like it because of its horrible acting and because the jokes are so transparent/safe/telegraphed/etc. It's the bubblegum pop of comedy, kind of fun but so empty and lifeless. "
Please like Me,Yeah what I get from this thread is that more people need to see/hear about this show! :)
Please like Me,Agreed I've been really impressed with Josh Thomas who I typically find mostly annoying. 
Please like Me,"I really loved Master of None, not only did it tackle race it also hit pretty hard on how we treat elderly. My favorite episode had to be the one when Dev took his GF's grandmother out. 

Long story but my mom got sick late last year and we had to put her in a home for about 6 months of therapy so she could learn to walk again, (she had/has a very rare muscle disorder). Almost everything from the episode is true, many of the old had trackers on them and some were watched like hawks. I would visit my mother everyday and many of the older people were treated as mentally ill. The problem was if you spent some time with them you learned a lot are just in because of unsafe houses and poor movement. Many do feel trapped and just people visiting really lift spirits."
Please like Me,"The commentary on race was ongoing throughout the whole season, but the episode that confronted this head-on was my favorite of the bunch. During the montage of Indian stereotypes in the media that opened the episode, I was initially under the impression that the Popchips ad with Ashton Kutcher was a parody made specifically for the show. Learning that that was a real ad blew my mind."
Please like Me,"I think the widespread appeal is BECAUSE Dev is a character so many people relate to. He's a mostly good person. He makes mistakes. Nothing too crazy happens in his life, but he still has issues and concerns just like any normal human. It's kinda beautiful. "
Please like Me,"Why does the main character have to do things that make us dislike him?  You're comparing Aziz to a whole different type of comedian.  

Aziz's comedy is pretty observational based on being a first generation Indian American who grew up in the south, likes food a lot, relies heavily on social media, loves certain areas of pop culture, and who recently did a ton of research/wrote a book on modern dating.  Guess what.  That's pretty much what the show focused on.

The one thing bad about the show was the acting/writing whenever Dev and Brian (the characters based on Aziz and Alan Yang) tried to explain their moral lessons that they had learned.  You can tell when Aziz is being himself, like during the ghost discussion in Nashville, and when he's reciting something that was written for him in the writer's room, like when he's talking to Brian about their parents.

Say what you want about the show being a ""glorified beta-male fantasy"", but *Parents*, *Indians on TV*, *Old People*, and *Mornings* were some of the best episodes of television this year and are great social commentary even if Dev is a boring character."
Please like Me,"I think it's OK for Aziz's first season to portray himself perfectly - he's still very raw and his acting and polish requires a lot of work. I don't think Aziz as an actor could sell a more nuanced character anyway. 

You're completely right in that it's incredibly safe and portrays Dev in a nice way, but at the same time he's discussing issues in a very new and interesting way. His show is not about the character, it's about the issues and so you don't need asshole characters to do so, nor does a show have to have unflattering main characters to be nuanced and interesting."
Please like Me,"oh boo fuckin hoo one show out of 100 didn't portray their main character as an anti hero like every other show on the air these days. how *dare* they do something different.

gonna skip replying to the rest of your pretentious rambling. good god, i hope you don't have a career where you influence other people"
Please like Me,I'd actually say Please Like Me is even more like Louie style wise. 
Please like Me,"Yeah Please Like Me seems more like ""my generation"" than Master of None. There issomething about Master of None that can be a bit ""slow""(?) at times, idk I think the pacing is off some episodes but still good. I agree that Please Like Me is the better show but its not getting any traction in the states. "
Please like Me,"Bwahaha, great social commentary? It's an aggressively mediocre show that's adopted the Girls aesthetic to give off the impression of depth and nuance but really, it has little to offer except boilerplate insight like maybe you should appreciate your parents more, and how, sometimes, being a woman sucks. Its worldview is so tame and agreeable that I'm waiting for future episodes where Dev laments how taxes are annoying but necessary or how it's scary to think about death.

Mornings is probably the best episode of the season and it's basically just the premium-cable version of Scrubs' Bed, Banter and Beyond episode from nearly 14 years ago, except Scrubs had the grace to have JD & Elliot break-up in the same episode."
Please like Me,"The absolute best thing about the show is the wonderful direction. I will wrestle anyone who thinks the show isn't absolutely gorgeous at times.

It's just that the great execution make his pedestrian meditations on how there should be more diversity on tv or how you shouldn't dismiss old people because they might have interesting stories seem more thoughtful and astute than they are in reality. Once you unpack what he's trying to say with most of the episodes, it's actually quite disappointing imo."
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,"32 year old dude here. About 2 years ago I was going through a really rough time, super depressed, unhappy at work...I sat down on the couch and scrolled through the endless Netflix offerings and somehow landed on Gilmore Girls. I watched on a whim fully expecting I would move on after a few minutes...but I never did, I watched the entire goddamn series.

I'm not going to say the show changed my life or anything, but it made me happy. Stars Hallow was like a refuge that I could go to for a few hours to escape all the shit I was dealing with, it made life a little more bearable for the few weeks I spent watching. 

But like all good things it came to an end. I was sad it was over, but happy I decided to watch it. I can't say I was thrilled with how the show ended but I'm hopeful that this new addition will change that.

So to anybody out there who hasn't seen it and just wants a quirky show to escape from life for a little while. Do recommend."
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,I'm gonna cry the moment Richard is mentioned in those episodes. 
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,"So, a few months ago, my wife was talking to a friend of hers, and Gilmore Girls came up. Wife's friend was *horrified* that my wife had never seen the show.

So she gets home from work that day and says that she's been tasked with watching the entire series on Netflix before the new episodes are released. ""I remember hearing good things about that show,"" I say, ""and there must be something to it if it lasted as long as it did and now they're bringing it back."" And so I join her in the Gilmore Girls journey. 

Little does my wife know that during my unemployment in the winter of 2008, I spent every weekday afternoon from 4 to 5 watching the syndicated hijinx and heartbreaks of Lorelai, Rory, and the Stars Hollow gang."
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,Why is Kirk at dinner?  WHY IS KIRK AT DINNER???  I HAVE TO WAIT AN ENTIRE MONTH TO FIND OUT??
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,"how did they manage to get back the entire cast?  I would've been sure Melissa McCarthy would've turned it down.

What about that mean fast talking uptight blonde girl?

Also, am i the only one that noticed the lighting was a little bit different in some of the scenes?  looked very sitcom like"
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,"Oh man, this might be the first show that comes back from the dead and ISN'T in some way disappointing!"
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,I have never seen an episode of this show but these trailers somehow generated nostalgia. I kind of want to watch this now. Should I watch the entire series? 
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,The grandma looks like she hasn't aged a day! 😯
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,"My girlfriend has a fun theory about Lorelai and Rory. We call it the ""Shallow Hal"" theory. In every episode of the Gilmore Girls they always talk about how much they eat or go to the diner for a huge breakfast. There's even an episode where they eat three (THREE!) thanksgiving dinners!

The theory is that the audience has been ""Shallow Hal-ed"". Rory and Lorelai are actually massively obese but because they are generally good people, they are shown as thin, attractive people.

I mean, obviously it's a joke but seriously... just take note of how much they eat and how often they talk about food!"
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,I'm a 27 year old male and I am beyond excited to watch this with my SO.
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,How many times can one watch a trailer before it becomes creepy? And how hot are Jess and Dean? Really?
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,Why does it feel like they didn't age at all in the past ten years?
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,"So much better than that weird Amy Schumer teaser. 

Also glad they're addressing the death of Richard head on. I always had a soft spot for Emily Gilmore so those scenes are going to be very emotional. "
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,ITT guys who watch this show with their SOs who want you to know that there's nothing wrong with doing so.
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,Well it's time to get my binge watch on! I've put it off long enough.
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,And I'm going down the rabbit hole and watching every single episode starting right now.
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,I screeched when I saw Jess on screen again. So happy. Copper boom
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,"My girlfriend has been looking forward to this for a loooong time.

...I'm looking forward to it too! Should be a fun, semi-nostalgic time."
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,"Why would anyone even joke about being embarassed to watch this? 

I'm a 43 year old guy who watched every episode of GG when it was on originally (along with just about all of the WB lineup) and my Thanksgiving weekend plans are football, Gilmore Girls, gaming and food.  No apology necessary.  Gilmore Girls is GOOD. 

As for being too ""female-centric"". That's nonsense. 

The difference between Gilmore Girls and the stereotypical ""unfunny female standup comedian"" is that the writing on Gilmore Girls is actually funny and the delivery is amazing. 

Lorelai and Rory might have vaginas, but the punchline isn't  ""my vagina"".   They might make geeky popculture references but they NEVER come across like theyre just being geeky for attention.  They might be hot as hell, but they DRESS LIKE NORMAL PEOPLE. The show might still focus on the romantic relationships a bit too much but these are still some of the more well rounded female characters on TV.

This show is the opposite of an embarassment.  "
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,Why does it appear to be mostly men that watch this show? What am I missing? 
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,"38 year old butch lesbian here, also way up in my feels over this and can't wait. Just posting cuz all the guys talking about being up in their feelings about this show made me jealous :)  SO not as overjoyed, but slightly less eye-rolling over my re-watch of GG than when I cycled back through all of Dawson's Creek.  "
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,"I am so excited! My two best friends live in other states, but they're coming over that weekend and we're ordering pizza, Chinese, getting poptarts, bagel bites, all sorts of candy etc. and watching the hell out of this. "
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,"I didn't want to watch this series but my wife insisted. I watched it and I enjoy it. I can't wait to watch these new episodes. 

I'm almost 38. Should I be ashamed? Maybe, but I couldn't care less about worrying about it."
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,I noticed there was no ring on Lorelei's finger. What the fuck is wrong with her? It's been nine years! Just marry the guy already!
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,"I really like that it's four 90 minute episodes, one for each season. That's a great format"
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,"so excited for this. people should check out the podcast Gilmore Guys show if they have a chance! there are two hosts, one who is watching it for the first time episode by episode and the other who is a huge fan, with special guests!

Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,"So incredibly excited about this! The song alone was enough to bring a huge smile to my face.

It's really hard to find a more perfect show than Gilmore Girls. And the fact that the entire cast is back for this reunion after so many years and so many different solo careers just proves that they've all enjoyed working together back in the day. That makes me happy."
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,"About two years ago, I found Gilmore Girls was being rerun every week night on some obscure channel, and I thought I'd introduce my 10 year old daughter to the show. I hadn't seen it since it went off the air. It didn't take me long to realize that about 80% of my parenting technique was based on Lorelei, and consequently, my daughter is a complete Rory. Even my mother is an Emiy (minus the money). It's a liitle disconcerting at times."
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,I watched this with my mom when the show was still running on TV and I absolutely loved it and have rewatched it on netflix.  If Rory was a son I could compare me and my mother's relationship along with our love of coffee with them.  Great show I am absolutely excited.
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,"Like a large number of guys I got roped into watching it as ""her show"".  Ended up really enjoying the writing and pacing. 

This trailer seemed to be running in quick sand in comparison to the prime of the show.  That really doesn't strike me as a good thing."
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,Is there a subreddit for guys who like GG? Should there be?
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,Someone mind giving me a brief overview of why I need to watch this aside from Alexis Bledel being stunning? Seems like an interesting show but I have no idea what it is about watching that trailer.
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,"I literally just watched an episode of Supernatural this morning, but seeing that half a second shot of Dean made me giddy like I hadn't seen him in years."
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,So no one is gonna mention Logan? 
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,When me and my husband first started dating he would watch this and I thought it was so annoying but then after watching it with him I got into it... I was 18 he was 24 now I'm 28 he's 34 ten years later and we can't wait to see this together 
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,"You can see Kevin and Demi, hosts of the Gilmore Guys podcast, sitting at the table in the background at 1:05!"
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,My wife and I are watching Season 7 now because we didn't catch the season when it aired because we were busy having kids. Even our two year old son likes GG. Great humor and I can't get enough of the fast talking. 
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,If you liked Gilmore Girls you should try Hart of Dixie.

Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,"29! long time fan, and can't wait for this!."
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,Really looking forward to this
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,I binged on GGs (again) when I was pregnant. My daughter just turned one and I'm so excited to watch the new episodes. Part of me wants to watch them with her even though she's too young and I don't let her watch TV! 
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,[deleted]
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,"I was just saying it was something else to watch, not as good for sure, but still filled with very watchable harmless nonsense. Same set mat ecplain why I liked the second show at all."
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,"a) Lorelei looks just SO much older to me. She really did not age during the original series! 

b) I always like, 80% believed this was taking place in ""Connecticut"" and the clip with her in the obviously Southern California mountains kinda fucks with me a bit.

c) I miss when Alexis Bledel was so young and carefree as an actress, I feel like she's gotten too stiff.

d) EMILY IS WEARING T-SHIRT AND JEANS!?!"
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,This thread reads like an /r/anime thread about K-On!. Gotta check this show out.
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,"Gilmore Girls is one of my favourite family tv shows.
I really love Stars Hollow and all it's inhabitant.I first watch it early 2015 and since them I watched it a few times already.
So glad Netflix will released a new short series of it and i missed all the characters and my favourite mother and daughter relation :)
Nice to see almost all characters back in this trailer and it is better than having movie."
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,"My wife watches this show, she's seen the whole thing like 3 times so I know the characters and a general idea of what is happening. 

I however, just can not get into this show. To me it seems super scripted, normal people aren't that witty and quick to respond with a funny answer like that. It just doesn't feel real to me. I'll admit I have had a laugh or two but seriously, slow the fuck down woman."
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,"Does it look oddly... fake to anyone else. Like, it looks incredibly obvious that they are on a set. 

It looks like a sitcom now."

Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,When Moms looks better than her daughter. 
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,"I'm gonna play devils advocate. 26 year old man, who works in TV Production. Watched this whole show with my gf. Hated it. Literally one of my least favorite things I've watched. Liked the OC more than this. Gossip Girl, PLL, Charmed, all much better. It's a show with no stakes (which is why I think people find it comforting-- nothing is won or lost. It's like the humor on the show-- no setups, just references that are there) and cheap execution.

But this trailer looks good. Emily was always my favorite character and she shines in this. This doesn't look cheap. There looks like there's effort on screen. Also after her stint on Mad Men, it looks like Alexis  Biedel learned to act. 

Tldr; hated the show, will watch this."
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,I just watched 2 episodes and I already know every character in this trailer lol.
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,"Dude, let the backwards ballcap go..... Jeez.... "
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,"as someone that followed the original show, 

Does this seem like a forced version of the original ? like a satire of the original except its not funny. "
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,"Ah, I see that Upper Class White Girl Problems is back"
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,"Where the hell am I?!

I felt for sure this would be like a Sex in the City kind of thread where women would be discussing their favorite characters and I wanted to comment on how old these girls look since I last saw them.  But this is not what I expected.

I don't think I've ever witnessed so many middle age guys trying to score pussy points in one thread before.  Frankly, I'm uncomfortable with how emotionally secure and open you guys are acting.  I gotta get out of here.      "
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,I still can't believe Melissa McCarthy's not even doing a guest shot. Not right at all.
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,The last time I posted this I got downvoted a lot but I'm sticking to my guns and saying this: Gilmore girls is a fucking terrible cringeworthy pile of steamy shite.
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,[deleted]
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,[deleted]
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,Grew up as a dude with 2 younger sisters and can confirm Gilmore girls is the shit. Well written and funny. Great show that I'm not ashamed to praise. 
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,"25 y/o dude -- This show got my sister and I through a depressing and lonely childhood and remains one of the coziest fucking shows of all time. Watch it after every firing, breakup, or death I experience in my life. 10/10"
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,"32 year old also.  My wife introduced me to it when we first started dating at like... Season 6 or something.  I liked the banter and asked her to fill me in on the characters.  That was like opening the dam and it sounded boring as all get out, but then I bought her Season 1 on DVD for a birthday present and we binge watched it.  Then bought the rest on Apple TV and binged those.

Now, she's had me watch the entire show at least a dozen times since then.  We still find new references we didn't understand initially every now and again.

She's super stoked for this series and I'm excited for them to fix that ending (holy crap, that last panorama shot is the most awkward thing I've seen filmed)."
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,"28 year old dude, reporting. My wife and I watch through the entire series every Autumn, and it honestly keeps getting better. It's a phenomenal series."
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,"You're entirely right, Gilmore Girls is one of the ultimate escape shows. I know there were a lot of times when I just wanted to live somewhere where everyone was funny and talked fast and mostly got along. 

Friends was the same for me, sometimes I just wanted to sink down in Central Perk and just feel good for 24 minutes at a time."
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,"33 year old dude. I watched the show from like the middle of season 2 on as it aired live. It was either on directly before or directly after the show Smallville which I was obligated to watch as a nerd and prior to the whole DVR thing that meant if there was no other show on you wanted to watch sometimes you put the tv on early or just left it on whatever channel you were on so you could have background noise. Eventually the dialog made me super curious and I just started watching it outright in college.

It's a lovely show with good dialog, interesting quirky characters, and good plots. It's all relatable somehow despite being about rich white people in New England. It's strangely wholesome despite being somewhat progressive in terms of how it handles sex. (IE I remember thinking it was a strange counter point to shows like Dawsons Creek that the main character didn't have sex for a long time and not to give away spoilers but when she eventually did she wasn't shamed for doing it; it she shamed for who she did it with.)"
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,"40-year-old dude here.  I discovered the show about 5 years ago.  I'm having a real bad time at work these days and escaping to Stars Hollow really helps.

I'm really looking forward to these 4 new episodes."
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,"20 year old chick here so a little different but same with the depression/rough times/unhappy at work. Gilmore Girls functioned similarly for me. It's invaluable that something, for however short of a time, can take you somewhere else, y'know? And what that quote... Don't cry because it's over but smile because it happened? I felt like that. But yeah in short I also recommend this for a good escape. Or, if you're satisfied in life and aren't trying to escape from the gaping black hole your heart has become, it's a nice way to kill some time!  

Also, I hope you're doing better! Depression is a son of a bitch but one nice unintended side effect is I discovered *Gilmore Girls* because of it haha"
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,"Yep. I refer to it as the chicken soup TV. 

I used to watch it when hungover on a Sunday morning when a UK channel showed 5 episodes back-to-back during the mid-2000s when I was in my late 20s and having a rough time."
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,"Parenthood is really good too, also on Netflix.  I became a huge fan of Lauren Grahams from GG, and really only started Parenthood because she was in it.  It also gives that comforting feeling, and does an amazing job of portraying real life.  "
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,"40 year old dude and I had another dude turn me onto GG while the second season was on the air. I've gone back and watched it during may bad times I have had. 

My usual joke is I'm having a bad day, I guess it's pizza Gilmour Girls and Ice Cream kind of night."
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,"Another 33 year old guy reporting in. Started watching while I was studying abroad around series 5. Came upon it in the midst of a really dark time and I don't think there's been a year (maybe a month!) since that I haven't been back to Stars Hollow, although thankfully not always from such a dark place! This revival makes me feel giddy with excitement"
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,27 year old dude. thought about starting it in the past...this thread convinced me. 
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,34 year old dude.   Wife made me watch first few episodes.   I made her finished the series.   Just now having a conversation with her on who we think Rory ends up with of the 3.  If she does of course.
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,"Good thing this is on Netflix.  All of us guys watching it would really screw up the demo for ad sales on broadcast or normal cable.

(I'm seriously looking forward to this - they better not fall short.  Non-psycho Emily has me worried.)"
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,"43 year-old man here.  My wife and I watched the show together when it first aired and loved it.  Didn't hurt that I had a crush or Lorelai and my wife on Luke :)  But that aside, I can 100% relate to what you're saying.  It's a show that many guys would never even give a look at but as long as you don't have some artificial reason to not like it (""a REAL man wouldn't watch that!"" sort of thing) then I don't see how you can't just feel good watching it.  It's just a FUN show.  Can't wait for these new ones.

By the way, for OP or anyone else, if you don't also watch Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt then you're missing out on another absolute feel-good gem!  Some shows just make you smile no matter what crap is going on in life, GG and Kimmy are definitely two of them."

Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,In the Marines my entire infantry company had several seasons of Gilmore Girls on DVD while we were in Iraq and people would fight who got the watch them next. There would be groups of around 10 Marines all huddled around a laptop watching Gilmore Girls. This was a line infantry company the guys who participate in direct action against the enemy not guys in the air wing or supply doing this. 
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,Check out the 'Gilmore Guys' podcast. 
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,It was an incredibly well written and perfectly casted show. Im really keen on what is to come. 24 year old male who never gave it a chance until mid way through this year
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,"Many many years ago, this was the show I watched with my Mom. Every week, sometimes every day (watching repeats on cable) we'd watch this show and laugh and bond. This show is special to me, and I'm glad that it's special to you too."
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,"Hi there friend. It's exciting to find other people with a similar story! As a guy in my late 30's there haven't been too many opportunities to confess to people how I feel about this show. In my early 20's especially, I also struggled with depression. Gilmore Girls always makes me feel better and is very comforting, I agree. It has stuck with me over the years, and has continued to be a source of inspiration for me. 

Full disclosure I think Lauren Graham is one of the most beautiful women of all time. And I love all the characters in the show. They seem like real people, and I care about them all. But especially Lorelai. She's so lovable, and kind. Strong, determined, and smart. She's always looking out for others before herself. I just want her to be happy.

Someone else mentioned it's nice to think of Stars Hollow as if it were a real place, and I love that thought. If I may confess one more thing - when I am my best self I am working towards being a good citizen of Stars Hollow. One day I hope to be someone they might have accepted. Someone Lorelai would have been proud of, and maybe even called a friend. She'll always own a piece of my heart. "
Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,It seems like it would be hard for a show like this to be interesting. What kept your attention throughout the whole thing? Doesn't seem like there were many cliffhangers or boat chases and such.

Then for over two hours, they take turns going in and out of there taking huge mud pies and over flushing. Then they go in there TOGETHER and you hear a bunch of ScRoUnGiNg around and then you hear a bunch of YELLING and on of them is standing in the bathroom doorway shouting at you that his friends foot stuck in the toilet. And he says, ""help him, you gotta help him!"" and when you go in there to help him, he just pulls it out easily, and laughs 'cause his foot wAsN'T stuck. It wasn't stuck at all he was just faking it.

Sailor Moon Crystal,"There is good American animation and there is bad American animation. There is good Japanese animation and bad Japanese animation. The best American animation is comparable to the best Japanese animation, and the worst American animation is comparable to the worst Japanese animation. You can't really generalize."
Sailor Moon Crystal,"Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo have some of my favorite animation ever.  Meanwhile near the end Dragon Ball Super had no issue with shoving thirty people on the screen and have all of them but the one talking be COMPLETELY MOTIONLESS for entire conversations, or having a ""fight"" scene that is just the same three frames of Goku looped over and over and over.

Trying to encapsulate ""anime"" in to one thing that can be declared good or bad is ridiculous."
Sailor Moon Crystal,"yeah it's bullshit, Quality varies in both anime and western animation, even Disney who are thought to be high quality have blatently recycled animation in the past:

 [https://www.thepopple.com/disney-scenes-copied-68250](https://www.thepopple.com/disney-scenes-copied-68250)"
Sailor Moon Crystal,This is amazing.
Sailor Moon Crystal,"I remember being Sailor Moon obsessed in the early '00s. My cousin found the bootleg trailer on a toonami fansite (on Quicktime). I had so many questions. I never expected to ever see actual footage and oh, is it more of a trainwreck than I thought it would be."
Sailor Moon Crystal,The best part of this is >!that it was just sitting in the Library of Congress for copyright protection!<. Imagine all the lost media just sitting there waiting to be stumbled upon.
Sailor Moon Crystal,"Forget dodging a bullet, We dodged a Scud Missile"
Sailor Moon Crystal,"Fascinating stuff, it's wild how Sailor Moon ended up as an enormously popular aesthetic in the west despite executives fighting it as much as possible, makes you wonder what would have happened if it and other anime were given a bigger push."
Sailor Moon Crystal,Lol Venus washing her face with a loofa wtf
Sailor Moon Crystal,"The song though. My god. It reminded me of “How I Met Your Mother.” 

“Let’s go to the mall… today!”"
Sailor Moon Crystal,"My mind is blown by how obvious it is they studied the source material and how randomly it’s implemented in the show. 

They used the crystal compact and some of the hand gestures when the sailors used some of their attacks, but tuxedo mask doesn’t get his top hat? 

And now imagine, if you would, this is a mid to late 2000s Disney Channel project starring Hilary Duff as sailor moon.

I wonder if it could have all worked somehow."
Sailor Moon Crystal,"I barely made it to the end of the intro song but absolutely loved the early 90’s checklist that went into it. “Lessee, need a black kid, an Asian kid, somebody in a wheelchair… inclusivity goddammit! Need a montage of trying on different hats and being wacky. Dammit Johnson, more Breakfast Club references! I demand that weird 80’s dance. What kind of hack writing am I paying you for?”"
Sailor Moon Crystal,"This is one of those ""it's so bad that it's good"" sort of things."
Sailor Moon Crystal,"I love the 90s theme song that has to explain the premise, and then once the episode starts it moves right into War of the Worlds.
Also, great that they had to give them windsurfers and boats so their was a reason for them to be sailors.

Amazing stuff."
Sailor Moon Crystal,"I guess the sailboards and sailing vessel-style vehicles were to make the ""Sailor"" part of ""Sailor Moon"" make sense to American kids, but I wonder why they bothered to keep the sailor *fuku* uniforms if that were the case. I suppose it was to appeal to fans of the anime, although I can't imagine a fan of the anime not being completely turned off by this."
Sailor Moon Crystal,classic 90s tv - they get actors in their late 20s to play 16 yr olds
Sailor Moon Crystal,More importantly… Is Sailor Mercury in black face?
Sailor Moon Crystal,People in the lost media community knew about this for a bit but it was hidden and behind a lot of collectors; and we only got snippets before. This is huge.
Sailor Moon Crystal,"There’s a timeline where we grew up with this instead of the Dub of the real thing. What a horrible, horrible reality."
Sailor Moon Crystal,"I remember seeing footage* of this wayy back in the day!!

*the footage being someone using a old home movie camera to record the footage being played at a convention back in the late 90’s lol"
Sailor Moon Crystal,*so what do they call you? Wheels?*
Sailor Moon Crystal,"Damn, that was awful. Thank God it didn't make it."
Sailor Moon Crystal,That’s really freaking cool
Sailor Moon Crystal,Burn it. Fear it. Dread it. Run from it
Sailor Moon Crystal,This is so cool!
Sailor Moon Crystal,"As a kid I would've never admitted to watching Sailor Moon, but thank God it was the original that we got and not... whatever that was.  I live in Canada... I guess because the dub work was done in Canada, it aired in Canada first so I was watching it as early as 1995 on television and I would've been around 10 years old.  It was this airing at normal hours and the original Dragon Ball airing at really weird hours in the night where the only hope of seeing it was randomly waking up in the middle of the night.  These two were my first experiences with anime that I can remember."
Sailor Moon Crystal,"So they fly on windsurfing boards and one of them is in a wheelchair that turns into a hoverchair when they transform, also it's live action mixed with animation. I feel like we both dodged a bullet and were robbed of a spectacular trainwreck."
Sailor Moon Crystal,Ray Mona was also the one that discovered the lost Mean Girls game. A real legend.
Sailor Moon Crystal,I remember hearing about this ages ago. Glad it's been discovered
Sailor Moon Crystal,This thinking about another time line got weird American remakes instead of dubbed anime.
Sailor Moon Crystal,“Americanized”
Sailor Moon Crystal,Did they use Jeff Wayne's War of the Worlds in the track right after the opening song? Wtf
Sailor Moon Crystal,"I’m getting some extreme Power Rangers meets Sabrina the Teenage Witch vibes, which makes sense coming from Saban, lol. The dialogue is terrible, reminiscent of 80s/90s shows and honestly, I’m intrigued by the idea of this show, lol."
Sailor Moon Crystal,"I remember hearing about this like, a decade ago from moviebob, i think. Glad someone was able to find more of it because this shit is wild."
Sailor Moon Crystal,great value sailor moon
Sailor Moon Crystal,I don't think this pilot really is as bad as a lot of commenters are saying it is. The animation is decent and the cheesy feel of the live action scenes was on par with a lot of 90s kids shows. Sabrina was a big show back then so that cat stuff wasn't odd for the time either. I think this show could've worked and been successful.
Sailor Moon Crystal,"This is terrible but not so terrible to loop right back around to being awesome (like Captain Planet).

Quite an accomplishment."
Sailor Moon Crystal,NANI??????
Sailor Moon Crystal,Love this I remember seeing some at a animal convention years ago
Sailor Moon Crystal,"r/badwomensanatomy

Ouch, my back"
Sailor Moon Crystal,This has been on YouTube for quite a while.
Sailor Moon Crystal,"Oh yeah, I think I saw this at a convention a few years ago. What could have been!"
Sailor Moon Crystal,If only this video was so cringe 🤦 neat footage and story though
Sailor Moon Crystal,Hey I know who that is. Thats the girl that found the mean girls ds game and refused to give the rom. Still not over that one
Sailor Moon Crystal,I think is is an absolutely horrible piece of shit and I’m glad it didn’t get made. Why did they think it would a good idea? Everyone needs to see the live action sailor moon.
Sailor Moon Crystal,"The cynic in me is constantly nagging in the back of my mind that at this point in time, it's hilariously easy to find ""lost footage"" of anything that is rumored to have existed at some point. 

Like the conspiracy theory of content creators injecting themselves into VINE compilations of yester year to retroactively create clout."
Sailor Moon Crystal,"I dunno. This is awesome. But burying the pilot in a multi hour story feels a bit self congratulatory. It’s like we have to high five her a lot _before_ getting the goods (which start an hour and  49 minutes into the doc). Like I would have preferred the sort of short two minute intro and then a supplementary doc. Not to undermine, but it does feel a bit presumptuous of the audience. Find for Patreon subscribers, less so for general audiences. And consequently rather than hearing a brief intro I like many will just skip to the right part."
Sailor Moon Crystal,"Seems cool, but why would they make a separate Americanized version instead of just translating the original? Are Americans so racist that they can’t watch a cartoon just because the pictures show somebody from another race?"
Sailor Moon Crystal,Cat is adorable
Sailor Moon Crystal,"This is going to sound horribly sexist, but there are exactly 2 reasons why this failed."
Sailor Moon Crystal,"I’m confused, how is it “lost media” if it was in the Library of Congress.  That’s like discovering a “gold mine” of seeds in the doomsday vault after an ecosystem collapse."
Sailor Moon Crystal,"Damn that’s cool asf, timelines are converging and here we are with cool shit."
Sailor Moon Crystal,Anyone think that was Tika Sumpter in the pilot?
Sailor Moon Crystal,NO WAY
Sailor Moon Crystal,Commenting to watch later
Sailor Moon Crystal,This is really interesting
Sailor Moon Crystal,That’s awesome this was found. Haven’t had a chance to watch it yet but I will shortly. Commenting to save it lol
Sailor Moon Crystal,...was there a sailor scout in a wheelchair in space?
Sailor Moon Crystal,I have a primitive x sailor moon white hoodie and I get mad compliments for it from people who also love this anime. Looking forward to sharing this lost media find with my younger sister who is also an even bigger fan of the series!
Sailor Moon Crystal,"If THIS is what we got instead of the dubbed sailor moon, I would of legit cried.  It was already bad enough having Super Sentai adapted. This would have been a nightmare for the anime fans."
Sailor Moon Crystal,"In an insane kind of way, yeah.

[Here's the footage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qWP1Dz-egw)

The producers of Power Rangers couldn't just recycle footage from the original Sailor Moon anime (like they did PR). So in-between the filmed segments they went to the trouble of animating a whole new cartoon for the action scenes.

And then like three years later after this idea flopped, someone else decided it'd just be easier to dub the original anime for America."
Sailor Moon Crystal,The intro looks like a mix between a commercial for the board game Mall Madness and a porn parody
Sailor Moon Crystal,"Yes, I distinctly remember having seen some of this live action material before when I went through my Sailor Moon phase in ‘00-‘01. I remember the girl in the wheelchair specifically. I don’t recall if I ever saw any of the animation though - all I remember is the live action."
Sailor Moon Crystal,"I definitely took the same thing away from this. 

All lost media may not be lost, just stashed away. 

I’ve been trying to come up with something lost that’s worth trying to find."
Sailor Moon Crystal,Why did you put a spoiler on that?
Sailor Moon Crystal,Yeah the thing is you can't get a copy of this kind of stuff unless you have written permission from the copyright holder :/ (which the girl that got this pilot managed to get)
Sailor Moon Crystal,This the same way they recently found the lost episode of [Sesame Street with Margret Hamilton](https://www.primetimer.com/news/lost-1976-episode-sesame-street-too-scary)
Sailor Moon Crystal,I can't believe we're less than 2 years away from The Day The Clown Cried from being released. It's been so long
Sailor Moon Crystal,"There's more to it including a Saban adaptation of Saint Seiya. Apparently, you can just find it in a public search engine for LOC. Even Harmony Gold Dragon Ball is in there too.
https://twitter.com/magicalstarlite/status/1561536096781029376?s=20&t=zRjK8e-rtbD2SvVAu9JeUg"
Sailor Moon Crystal,Thank the fuck for **[Toonami](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBJz-xmr1qk&list=PLKx6bqElhtJnnHrC1jMhQerxP1O_Kb6GK)**
Sailor Moon Crystal,She was using it like it was a soft powder puff omg
Sailor Moon Crystal,"Oh my god. My husband wanted to know what had me scream-laughing on my phone this morning, but I couldn’t possibly explain what I was seeing."
Sailor Moon Crystal,I’m pretty sure it was implying that she was using it to apply makeup.
Sailor Moon Crystal,What's wrong with that?
Sailor Moon Crystal,Timestamp ?
Sailor Moon Crystal,"Ah okay, so I was correct in questioning whatever she was doing with that loofa, I thought it was a ""guys wouldn't understand"" moment."
Sailor Moon Crystal,The line she said while doing it was blatantly homoerotic. Good to see they planned on keeping up that tradition from both the original and dub.
Sailor Moon Crystal,"Honestly, based on how long it went on for, I was expecting something like ""Too Many Cooks"", and that it would keep on going."
Sailor Moon Crystal,That was exactly my first thought.
Sailor Moon Crystal,"Well he IS Tuxedo Mask, not Tuxedo Tophat"
Sailor Moon Crystal,"I… almost think THAT hypothetical version could have worked, with a twist: Hilary Duff is a typical white American girl in her mid-twenties, who is suddenly empowered to become a classic anime Magical Girl, with all the juvenile fluff and frills attached. 

Suddenly, she’s forced to fight for truth and love and the hearts of little girls everywhere, despite having zero interest in doing so. And other unwilling or unexpected people are having the same experience, so she’s on a team with, idk, Sandra Oh and William Jackson Harper."
Sailor Moon Crystal,"At the the animation would have been better looking, and maybe the acting… maybe."
Sailor Moon Crystal,"It's interesting because the adaptation sent them to a boarding school with school uniforms, but they're standard blazer uniforms, not sailor fuku."
Sailor Moon Crystal,Sometimes even in their 30s...
Sailor Moon Crystal,This is still a thing. Easier to work with adults and less legal hassles.
Sailor Moon Crystal,Uh...that's still the same in 2022. What's the point of this comment?
Sailor Moon Crystal,"Heck, the guy that plays Paxton Hall-Yoshida on Never Have I Ever is thirty-one. That just filmed!"
Sailor Moon Crystal,Going by how child actors were treated in 90s prob for the best
Sailor Moon Crystal,"I think the actresses were between 17-22. I know  “Sailor Mercury” was under 18.

Also getting actors in their late 20’s to play teenagers is still a thing."
Sailor Moon Crystal,"Holy shit, I thought you meant the live actress"
Sailor Moon Crystal,?
Sailor Moon Crystal,"No kidding. I'm actually kinda stunned at how different my childhood would have gone if this had been what we got, and no dub."
Sailor Moon Crystal,One where DBZ also a result didn't get a major hit dub either.
Sailor Moon Crystal,The whaaaaat?
Sailor Moon Crystal,"I agree. It's super cheesy but that was de rigeur. And the multicultural cast has looped around into popularoty again. I also think it's very cool that Mercury has a space wheelchair too, and she doesn't transform into a hero who can walk around. That's kind of a big deal, as small as it is."
Sailor Moon Crystal,Is an animal convention a furrie con?
Sailor Moon Crystal,"A bootlegged recording of that being screened at a convention was the only footage known to have existed for 28 years, until Ray Mona tracked this down."
Sailor Moon Crystal,"I mean, go find some then lol. Took her about half a year for this, so you should be even faster having a guide to work off of."
Sailor Moon Crystal,"The format though is setup as a documentary around finding the lost pilot for American Sailor Moon and it shows the efforts they did to get as much information needed to find the lost footage. It also offers a good insight on what was going on at those studios during the start of anime being accepted in America.

~~Plus I am sure the YouTuber will release the video files/upload them to Archive.org which they did for the Mean Girls DS game they got a hold of.~~  


Edit: scratch that, I mis-remembered, they can't upload the ROM of the Mean Girls DS game as that would put them in legal hot water. But they did a full playthrough and had someone help with debugging. So I am betting they can't upload the pilot without the watermark they added, since they got legal permission to show via YouTube."
Sailor Moon Crystal,That's why I posted the article... it links timestamped right to the that part of the video.
Paranoid,"""He cheated on his girlfriend regardless of if he’s right on a technicality.""

Yeah, the technicality being that she wasn't his girlfriend, which she acknowledged multiple times.

The deeper problem with the analysis is that all the characters (except possibly Phoebe) subscribe to a code where casual sex is no big deal. It might earn them some teasing but it's not ""wrong"" until the writers move the line a little bit so that Rachel can be wounded by it."
Paranoid,I appreciate the smokescreen of asking a general question about narrative television writing only to decide at the last minute that all you really want people to respond about is whether Ross and Rachel being on a break frees Ross up to have sex. Because now that's all anyone is going to talk about.
Paranoid,"“Oh no, the beautiful and brilliant woman I’m desperately in love with is so successful I can’t maintain a career of my own (a career I have no need of, because no only is my goddess of a wife incredibly successful she’s also fucking loaded) so I must follow her about to the most beautiful places on earth on a life long vacation!  Truly terrible, the only solution I can see is divorce!”

I don’t hate the HIMYM finale the way that a lot of people do. It got us where we needed to go, it answered the questions we had, we finally had a good reason why this story ostensibly about meeting the mother was 95 percent “I’m desperately in love with with Robin and always will be.”  But dang if they didn’t fumble the ball on the “why aren’t Barney and Robin married in the future?” front."
Paranoid,[removed]
Paranoid,"I assume the murder you're talking about is in S3 where Saunders wants Ryan Chapelle killed or he'll release the virus. President Palmer doesn't have a choice in the matter. He had CTU do all they could to try to find Saunders and stop him before the time limit, but they couldn't. At that point could he really have had millions of people die horrific deaths and the terrorist continue his assault for not having Chapelle killed? Sad as it was, it was the only option. 

As for your prompt, I'd say Lorelai Gilmore running away with Rory to go look at colleges instead of getting married to Max Medina in Gilmore Girls. I don't remember what reason she gave for not wanting to go through with the marriage at the last second and not even wanting to face Max and discuss it, but I remember it being so fucking stupid that I hated her character after that."
Paranoid,"Actually, honestly, I wanted more to discuss the 24 examples if anything which is why I went into more detail on them. I on.y included the Ross-Rachel example to lighten it up a bit with a sitcom example and it’s one of the more well-known examples of what I’m talking about, but the 24 ones are more fascinating to me."
Paranoid,"The thing is “the fact that you could be comfortable going on a date less than 24 hours after we broke up makes you a person I don’t want to date” is a perfectly legitimate complaint.  If she’d just said that the debate would be over, that is a perfectly fine reason to not want to date him again.  But she has to keep insisting he cheated on her, which is a different story than what actually happened.  Because she broke up with him. So he wasn’t cheating. That doesn’t make him not an asshole. Just not a cheater."
Paranoid,"“Taking a break” isn’t exactly the same thing as “breaking up.” 

She was very upset and mad when she said it and not in the right frame of mind to make an accurate thesis on the viability of their relationship. He took advantage of that to bed another woman. It may not technically be “cheating” to some but he still did cheat because she still considered them a couple long-term, hence the taking a break for now. 

They were taking a pause, but we’re still very much an item. He didn’t even bother to clarify what she meant."
Paranoid,Schrödinger’s cat of a relationship. Simultaneously alive and not alive at the same time.  It’s a binary system. Dating or not dating. They were not dating. Like I said there’s nothing wrong with her being angry at something he did while they were not dating. She’s entirely within her rights. But they weren’t dating.
Paranoid,">She was very upset and mad when she said it and not in the right frame of mind to make an accurate thesis on the viability of their relationship

That my friend is just the values that words have."
Paranoid,"That’s simply according to your own definition of “taking a break,” though. I think it was written specifically to not be cut and dry. 

However, you cannot specifically say they weren’t dating because Rachel intended to patch things up the very next day (the decent thing) so she clearly didn’t think their dating pausing temporarily could give him permission to cheat. It’s be different if she said “break up” but she didn’t. You could say they were broken up for about 5 minutes so technically you’re correct it could be interpreted that way, but they were on hold, awaiting further discussion.

Let me give you an example: 

Let’s say you’re calling your doctor’s office and are put on hold for 30-45 minutes (or however long), are you still not waiting for someone to begin a conversation on the other end of the line? Are you officially broken up? Why don’t you just call them back later? Possibly a clunky analogy, but Rachel was holding on and Ross hung up and was embarrassed when he found out Rachel still hung on the other end of the line."
Paranoid,"I follow a screenwriter/executive producer on tiktok. He literally had a video on this topic and made it very clear that he doesn't give much shit what happens once he cashes his check. They sell the show and sometimes stay on as showrunners but not always. They get paid for the show and he goes on his merry way back to his writing desk to continue developing the next pitch.

Maybe it's different for creators who are new to the grind though."
Paranoid,"Netflix doesn't have Pilot's episode. If your work has at least 1 season, that could be everything to the team making the series/film.

Netflix has the largest demographic of viewers

Netflix has the largest global space for your show/film to be seen."
Paranoid,Yeah who would want a job in their chosen field. Not me.
Paranoid,"That's like asking why people start businesses even though there is a good chance that the business might fail after a few years, or asking why people write books if there's a good chance that someone might not read them. 

Netflix is still a huge and successful company and if Netflix picks up a show that's still a big win for many creators even if they wish they got more seasons upfront."
Paranoid,"I get what you're saying but like other people said there are two big reasons it doesn't matter. 1) The money 2) I'd rather my dream come true for a day than never, so if it was Netflix or nothing that's what I'm doing. 

Think about how long all contracts in the NFL were non-guaranteed (and many still are), you could work your whole life to be a pro-football play and get cut tomorrow. That doesn't stop people from trying. 

If I was a show creator (I mean, hopefully some day) the thing that would really give me pause would be Discovery/HBO, it's one thing to let me make my show and then cancel, whatever I got a shot. But to cancel my show and that essentially delete the file for a tax write-off, that would be a different story."
Paranoid,"I wouldn't want my show, my baby that I've been working on for multiple years on one of the biggest streaming platforms in the world either /s"
Paranoid,"why? Even if it's for one season it's better than nothing. And Netflix loves burning cash, which isn't bad for those who get it"
Paranoid,"""Why bother with life when everyone is eventually forgotten?""

Everyone should be proud of the little flame they produced before it dies out. Not everyone gets a bonfire and no flame last forever, be proud of the small flame you made if it seems insignificant."
Paranoid,Beggars can be choosers apparently
Paranoid,having 1 season of a show is better for your career than having no seasons
Paranoid,"Still better than HBO/Discovery. Netflix might cancel your show, HBO/Discovery might remove it from streaming completely"
Paranoid,It’s their own fault for pitching multiple seasons. Netflix or any other streaming services only greenlight one season first. The showrunners/ writers are the ones greedy fuck who go on “oh we have multiple seasons planned” bullshit in interviews and gave us cliffhangers ending. Netflix don’t write those endings.
Paranoid,I find it funny that people think going to Netflix is somehow worse than HBO.
Paranoid,"Netflix orders shows other networks don't want. It has always been this way with all streaming platforms. Even peacock (owned by NBC) will order shows that NBC would not want either...the reason is because live-tv networks have a higher rating threshold.

Cable is also more open minded as well, but streaming platforms such as Netflix,Hulu, Amazon work on a much smaller budget and they count ratings differently.  I remember when we put Fuller House on the air people said the set looked cheaper than on the original show...and they were right....it was because we could produce the show and create episodes on a smaller budget.

Same with the New Kids in the Hall, removing the laugh track saved thousands of dollars and many sketches could be filmed outdoors...for free! When it was on original tv it was much more expensive to film, plus we had to pay for the studio audience for the entire day."
Paranoid,"For marketing, then u can sell it to other studios who might not wanna take a risk with u. the outrage of cancellation will give them an idea about its future success for risk mitigation"
Paranoid,"Because selling a script and getting a show made is hard and most pitches don’t lead to a bidding war between multiple networks and streaming services.  If you’re trying to get something made, you take it anywhere you can get a meeting.  Sure if you’re lucky enough to have HBO want your show, you’re probably gonna go with them over Netflix….well, unless Netflix offers more money."
Paranoid,Reminds me once I was watching Talking Dead after Fear the Walking Dead. The cast guests always talk about how much they love the franchise and watched since the beginning and feel so blessed to be a part of it. Then they had Rubén Blades on and they started to bring up something like that for him and he just laughed and talked about how it's just his job and he's glad for the paycheck. It was awesome.
Paranoid,"Sounds interesting, can you share their account name?"
Paranoid,No it’s not. It’s like asking why anyone would open a business in a town that’s notorious for store closings when there are fourteen other towns nearby with a better track record.
Paranoid,"Used to be a sure fire winner.

Now unless your show is binge watched to completion by a large audience with the first week, the chances of a season 2 are negligible…"
Paranoid,so will amc - and so will netflix soon
Paranoid,"Wrong. Netflix producers push writers heavily for cliffhangers. Warrior Nun’s witter had to fight them to even put a scene that confirms the main characters fate in because Netflix wanted a bigger cliffhanger. Then of course they cancelled it.

Inside Job was supposed to get two more episodes but they decided that they would be better in the next season since Netflix already had told them they are renewed. Then Netflix unrenewed and as such these episodes are now forever lost to the world."
Paranoid,Depends on the type of show.
Paranoid,It's Michael Jamin. He does YouTube as well.
Paranoid,"Because the difference is that all those other towns are too competitive and you probably wouldn't even be able to open up a store in that town because you aren't big enough to get any of the permits or zoning licenses required and at best they might let you get one day at some town business fair and if your booth doesn't get enough attention on that one day you will be told to take hike. 

Meanwhile Netflix town gives every business, including the ones that every other town rejected, a chance to prove themselves for a full year before they ax you. 

The thing you and most of this sub routinely misses is that most shows don't get picked up and most shows don't get a full year if they do. Many don't make it out of a few weeks of production, many don't make it past the pilot or even finish their first season. 

Netflix is usually the one that is giving them the chance to exist at all. Yeah you take the risk that you don't hit the big numbers they want, but the truth is, you aren't getting the opportunity most anywhere else."
Paranoid,The key being there are not 14 other towns. Most people are lucky to get 1 offer to buy their show.
Paranoid,"Why does everything need to be continuous? 

Squid Games writer spent 10 years getting rejected to be finally picked up by Netflix. Does he really want a second season? Probably not. He's happy his baby was finally made."
Paranoid,"in the Mr Robot sub folks have been REAL hot and cold about this season. 

Lots of talk that Sam may be in the process of fucking the ending up, and others arguing its fine and everything going smoothly 

a couple characters deaths seemed out of nowhere. S3 was an absolute masterpiece, hard to top. Seems writing a good, satisfying, ending to a  TV show is FUCKING HARD to do."
Paranoid,"Haven't had the time to watch it yet, but Mr.Robot is my favorite show of all time. 

&#x200B;

Are they really still doubting Sam after season 2 and 3?"
Paranoid,"Sam is just experimenting is how i see it. i completely trust his vision. wasn’t a big fan of the plot in the recent episode, but as an episode of television it was very beautiful"
Paranoid,"I'm pretty lukewarm on this take. The last episode got some backlast on the sub because 'nothing happened!' which is typical of that *type* of episode. But the first three episodes were a pretty high-octane thrill ride and I remember the weekly discussions being overwhelmingly positive. 

As for the characters - of which I won't spoil the names but there have been two now - one of them definitely looks like a behind the scenes issue rather than a natural conclusion to their story. But the other very much remains to be seen. I would expect a lot more bodies to drop before the season ends and I'm not expecting all of them to go out in extremely satisfying and epic ways, but rather senselessly, brutally, seemingly randomly and sadly. This really isn't a show where characters go out in a blaze of glory. They just get merked. That's always been the case tho lol. Aside from one very memorable episode in season 3 - which kept everybody in the dark for the entirety of season 2, mind - there hasn't been one single character in the entire show that didn't have a random, senseless death. Even very intriguing characters and fan favorites just get knocked off the board like pawns, because most of them are. 

I'm very hopeful it's going to end on a strong note."
Paranoid,"That last death was one of my biggest disappointments in the whole show, I hope there's more behind it than what we got"
Paranoid,And the fanbase has targeted him now that fans started doing digging and the females cast have had a much lower pAy than the men
Paranoid,"I am bewildered by the most recent character death, we spent 5 years with them only to fucking die like that? I am SERIOUSLY worried Sam is going to fuck up this last season."
Paranoid,"I don't. I'm absolutely loving the new season right now, tho it reminds me more of season 2 where there are lots of questions and character studies."
Paranoid,"well apparently one character got killed off due to IRL drama off the set 

so thats a pretty big dissapointment."
Paranoid,"Well there's certainly a loud faction on the subreddit that's getting increasingly antsy that we're getting into the final season and their nonsense time machine theories aren't true yet. It's going to be ""fun"" once all that doesn't come true."
Paranoid,"Episode 4 seems to be very divisive among that sub, which I was surprised by after watching the episode. I thought it was great, but others are complaining that it didn't really further the plot at all/nothing really happened. The season is only 1/3 over but half the sub is starting to act like the sky is falling because some questions still aren't answered. Not sure why they seem to think the remaining 9 episodes won't be enough time to wrap everything up."
Paranoid,"Yes, Season 4 started off with a bang but squandered a lot of goodwill this last Sunday"
Paranoid,"the cinematography is among the best in TV

Robot, Better Call Saul, and Euphoria and the 3 best TV shows when it comes to visuals and cinematography 

You are right, the Ep looked absolutely amazing. The woods scenes were hauntingly beautiful."
Paranoid,"> The last episode got some backlast on the sub because 'nothing happened!' which is typical of that type of episode.

This is true plotwise, but I think those types of episodes are usually heavy on character development, and nothing really changed for any of the characters and we didn't learn anything new about them."
Paranoid,[removed]
Paranoid,There's 100% more to it. Those POV shots of the car driving down the road definitely have a deeper meaning
Paranoid,[deleted]
Paranoid,">I hope there's more behind it than what we got

This show has a long history of explaining/elaborating on major events later on. I believe that will happen with this."
Paranoid,"Relative to who tho? Raimi and Slater are the undisputed main characters and also producers on the show. None of the women in the cast have as much screen time or involvement as they do. Now, if Darlene wasn't getting paid more than the guy who plays Price that'd be some bullshit, but nobody is being very specific about it. 

If it comes down to Portia Doubleday - the fact is that she was always supposed to be a side character who's role got dramatically extended because she killed her performance. But she was never a lead in the show."
Paranoid,So far the season has been great. Last episode I considered it pretty slow but still really good because of all the interactions of the characters.
Paranoid,That death worked very well for the plot though. There really wasn't much left for them and set more movements forward and gave us a hot start to the season
Paranoid,I really think people blew that whole deal out of proportion.
Paranoid,"But that’s all speculation at this point isn’t it? People always complain when a character they like is killed off. However, there is nothing that indicates that the decision to kill off that character is in anyway related to the off set drama."
Paranoid,Awwww shit. I think I know who it is then )=
Paranoid,Which actor had IRL drama?
Paranoid,What were the reasons?
Paranoid,Can you tell me what the drama was? Who wasn't getting along with who?
Paranoid,"Wait, really? Details?"
Paranoid,"well WR's project has to be alternate time line thing or VR or time travel or some kind of fucking thing like that. 

If not...what?"
Paranoid,"> their nonsense time machine theories 

Nonsense??? But what about all the Back to the Future references???

/s

Really though, people are still talking about time travel/multiverse like it's inevitable. 75% of that sub is people throwing out wild theories on the off chance that one sticks so they can turn around and say ""See? I knew it!"". Just look at the discussion there surrounding the latest episode."
Paranoid,"It drove home how hopeless Elliot, MR, and Tyrell actually feel about it all. You could include Darlene and Dom too.

We certainly learned a lot about Elliot and Tyrells feelings towards each other and a lot about how Tyrell sees himself."
Paranoid,According to Sam that was just artsy with no meaning behind it
Paranoid,"The glow the character saw before death was just Sam being Artsy fartsy 

I don't think it has any plot value"
Paranoid,"you did the spoiler incorrectly, its easy to fuck up"
Paranoid,Yeah I really can't imagine where they'd even fit into the season at this point. Things were already beginning to meander a bit.
Paranoid,Yeah you should probably leave this thread if you don't want any of season 4 spoiled for you.
Paranoid," [spoiler](#s ""actress who played Angela"")"
Paranoid,"[spoiler](#s ""Rami Malek and Portia Doubleday broke up"")"
Paranoid,"Total batshit insanity and delusional narcissism on her part, is what I'm guessing. I think she's orchestrated all of this because she really is just fucking nuts and everybody who's suffered and died for it did so pointlessly. 

I think it's *likely* that virtual reality is her 'goal', but that the goal is a figment of her delusions. Pretty much exactly what Price said at the end of season 3."
Paranoid,"White Rose is pretty clearly insane. One of those things could be her end goal, but as far as it actually becoming a reality on the show...I guess we'll see."
Paranoid,"Yeah that does seem to be the core of it, not just with Mr. Robot but with lots of fandoms. People are way more concerned with shouting out as many ""theories"" as possible just so they can be right than stopping to make any sense. It's basically become a hobby each week to just ask the simplest questions in regards to all the Mr. Robot theories and watch people struggle to understand their own ideas.

""Tyrell is an alternate personality of Elliot's that was separated from Elliot's mind and given physical form by White Rose"" was an actual one I saw this week. I'm still waiting on the response to ""but why?"""
Paranoid,"I don't really buy that, but I also don't think it's going to end up being as big as some people assume."
Paranoid,"I agree with the the glow thing.. But I still don't think the death happened that way. Something is going on, the episode doesn't really make sense when you think about it."
Paranoid,"[spoiler](#s ""The theory I'm going with is that the blue light was the radio that we saw the DA guy listening to at the start of the episode, and was also what was making those noises in the woods. It may have been placed as some sort of signal beacon to the DA, and Tyrell may have disarmed it before dying. If that's the case, the death is ultimately pointless but it does follow the broader trend of everyone being a pawn in the game between WR and Elliot/Robot. They made a tragic misstep in this episode and Tyrell got taken off the board for it."")"
Paranoid,thx (I assumed so but wasn't sure)
Paranoid,"No, that wasn't the reason. According to Carly Chaikin they got paid way less than half of Rami's and Christian's salary. She probably quit because of that.

/u/Killafornia95 /u/Gobble_Snob"
Paranoid,I didn’t even know that lol. I wondered what they would have done with her if they didn’t happen but it was super sick tho. She was dope but they way they handled was brutal and I liked it lol
Paranoid,">""Tyrell is an alternate personality of Elliot's that was separated from Elliot's mind and given physical form by White Rose"" was an actual one I saw this week

Wow, I must have missed that post lol"
Paranoid,"Speaking of ridiculous theories, I just saw this one:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/MrRobot/comments/dpbrvh/new\_theory\_price\_is\_elliot/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MrRobot/comments/dpbrvh/new_theory_price_is_elliot/)

I'm convinced OP is trolling in this one."
Paranoid,"Yeah I saw that one. I had about 100 questions related to how nonsense it is and then decided it wasn't worth it. But hey, I'll at least give him credit for having an explanation behind the madness, even if the explanation is equally mad. Usually it's just ""Vera is Elliot, change my mind!"" and you don't even know how they think that could even be possible."
Paranoid,"Unbelievable this is a ""summer pickup"" on USA of all channels.  Pretty sure if this was released by HBO it would be the talk of the country right now.  Really is well written, all the characters are fleshed out, and it's so well cast and acted.  

I also love that really they didn't try to reinvent the wheel.  They basically just took the good parts of many different shows/movies and mashed them all together to make a really good, but unique on it's own show.  With ""inspiration"" from things like [spoiler](#s ""Dexter, Fight Club, Sherlock Holmes"") and probably quite a few other things I'm not even picking up on yet.  

*Shameless self promotion that my podcast [covered it last episode](http://opzombies.com/podcast/so-much-butt-stuff-plus-magge-san-andreas-mr-robot-and-true-detective/) and will be covering it every episode forward.*"
Paranoid,"Actually this is not a bad title. His character is mesmerizing (I am borrowing this description from somebody's description of another show I recently discovered again: Rectify). 

I hope it won't go Fight Club way, I really do. It's always cheapening. "
Paranoid,I'll call it realistic when it turns out the drug dealer that gave him ecstasy in exchange for sex turns out to be a delusion. 
Paranoid,I just searched for this in my guide because I want to watch it. [I think they may have overdone it with the episode titles.](http://imgur.com/WuBTKXJ)
Paranoid,"So far, this is a fantastic show!  With the last episodes cliffhanger, I believe this is about to become even more intriguing.  Stay tuned, this show has a whole heck of a lot of potential!"
Paranoid,I wouldn't say realistic...
Paranoid,Love this show
Paranoid,"Shameless plug to Person of Interest that started this trend of well written, technically accurate, shows. "
Paranoid,"It is quite good, but the computing side is a bit cringey and bullshitty. Still worthwhile."
Paranoid,"i'd like to point out that he's an unrealistic hacker because it's 2015 and he uses GNOME. GNOME. unless he is very nostalgic (which he doesn't strike me as) about his de and still uses GNOME 2, i can't accept him as a hacker."
Paranoid,"I hate to say realistic here, as if all other portrayals are somehow ""wrong"". Rather, it's more that he shows a type of hacker, a type of loser that we rarely get a chance to see, ever. We're all so used to the effortlessly attractive, charismatic, girl charming, athletic protagonist that for reasons that the audience is never told is somehow seen as a social outcast that when we're confronted with a straight up unlikable person we don't know how to deal with them.  "
Paranoid,"but don't you think it's too much of a dexter rip off? from his narration, to burning cds of his hackers and filing them in a ""digital slide show"" to him being the smartest nerd @ work to him stalking his ""victims"" for hacks whilst wearing a hoodie? "

Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ❤️"
Shooter,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
Shooter,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.
Shooter,No Atlanta? Both seasons last year were incredible
Shooter,Pachinko is the most slept on series of 2022
Shooter,"1. She hulk
2. Ted lasso
3. Ms Marvel
4. Harley Quinn show
5. Lord of the rings
6. Spy x family 
7. Chainsaw man
8. Loki
9. Mob psycho
10. Hot D"
Shooter,Which ones did you see? 🤔 amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?
Shooter,"> is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
Shooter,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
Shooter,🙂💕
Shooter,It’s great but it’s depressing.
Shooter,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
Shooter,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
Shooter,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
Shooter,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7… cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
Shooter,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
Shooter,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
Shooter,Oh my bad. I’m late to the party.
Shooter,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
Shooter,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

damn. guess i gotta hurry and check this one out now. lol."
Shooter,"You should check out Kotaro Lives Alone, such a good show!"
Shooter,"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven’t managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
Shooter,I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!
Shooter,"Funny to hear them draw the line at first person shooters considering some of the crap they've had on Showtime. It is impressive, though, to think these folks made it so far without understanding what an adaptation is."
Shooter,Remember when Halo was huge and Microsoft sent out a film script with a fully Mjolnir armored person to stand over executives as they read it?  Only to take the script back once they were done?  No wonder this is the first huge Halo IP thing being produced.
Shooter,"Stargate SG-1 did begin on Showtime (and it was a weird fit, but not a bad property to have)."
Shooter,"It’s not like they can’t tell a good story in the Halo universe. The first trilogy, the books, the comics, and even the anime anthology had good stories. You could even just wholesale rip off ODST, my favorite of the series story wise. My concern is they will just ignore all the most interesting parts of the universe in favor of “Space Marine go burrrrrrr”."
Shooter,[deleted]
Shooter,Please be good.
Shooter,"Halo done right has it's moments of drama ,but also it's moments of comedy.It's inclusive in that way.
In regards to the execs thinking it's a odd fit,I'd say that the  more weird element of this marriage is Halo being a sci-fi  epic. That genre and budget ain't in Showtime's whellhouse normally."
Shooter,Cowards. How the fuck did this network give us SG-1?
Shooter,When's the last of us coming out.... That's the only show I care about
Shooter,Showtime made Stargate SG1 back in the day.
Shooter,This shows that the execs have no idea what they're talking about. Halo has an immensely rich story world that's easily full of drama and political intrigue.
Shooter,"Showtime is so far behind HBO, Netflix and many other peers including AMC and FX when it comes to original programming. They need to take risks with known properties like Halo. 

I’m curious if/when ViacomCBS merges Paramount Plus and Showtime into a single entity. Not enough differentiation or content on either to support a dual platform strategy like Disney Plus and Hulu."
Shooter,"This was the first Showtime show in ages I was actually looking forward to watching, and go figure, they moved it to Paramount+, when I'm all tapped out on getting yet another streaming service."
Shooter,"The real issue was Microsoft wouldn't hand off total creative control as they wanted to protect the property, unlike most video game adaptions."
Shooter,"I need more info on this, lmaoo"
Shooter,"I’ve been watching parts of the first season. Man it’s rough, especially the second episode. That’s a show that got much better as it went along."
Shooter,Yeah seeing full bush on a rewatch is always a little surprising.
Shooter,"Yes, but the move to Sci Fi after season five is a very noticeable up in quality."
Shooter,"There is also the live action Halo: Forward Unto Dawn that was enjoyable and a live action series that I think was online only when the Master Chief Collection came out that wasn't bad but, for me at least, wasn't really memorable."
Shooter,Hopefully they just hire the red vs blue writers if they decide to mail it in
Shooter,[deleted]
Shooter,Perhaps a big budget will prevent them from dragging it out for eight progressively worse seasons like every other show they do.
Shooter,Sir this is a wendys
Shooter,That’s will be on HBO not Showtime. TLOU has only started filming recently. I heard it will take a year to film.Then there will be several months of editing and other post production work. We may not get it until 2023 or 2024.
Shooter,Still shocking that Twin Peaks: The Return was on Showtime
Shooter,"I agree with you but Halo was the wrong property to take that risk on. Everything about Halo is something you'd expect to see in a big budget Sci-Fi movie, and the only chance that concept ever had fell apart over a decade ago when Halo popularity was at it's peak. It's story is one of grand battles and aliens and spaceships. Halo's story is fine but I really don't think it's the kind that would lend itself well to the episodic structure. Showtime has been struggling for years to make this show happen for a franchise that, to be honest, has been on a downward trend for many years."
Shooter,All of their shows are just cheap looking to me.
Shooter,They definitely need to merge and the transition would be so easy it could just be paramount+showtime
Shooter,"Totally agree. That's why I'm surprised they seem to have a kind of exciting slate going right now? *Yellowjackets*, *The Man Who Fell to Earth*, *The First Lady*, *I Love This For You* and *Let the Right One In* (the only one here not yet ordered to series) make for one hell of a promising future for them. Hope it works out and they're able to put out more consistently interesting stuff in general."
Shooter,They ruined shameless and I'm still mad about it.
Shooter,"I mean unless you've been subscribed to Showtime all this time despite not looking forward to any of it's shows, wouldn't you need to get another streaming service or subscription either way? And Paramount+ is only $10 for commercial free while Showtime costs $12 I think."
Shooter,"I have Paramount+ and don't have Showtime so the change works for me. Also if no Showtime shows in ages appealed to you, wouldn't you not have it, and thus have needed to subscribe to it to watch the show anyway?"
Shooter,">Man it’s rough, especially the second episode.

Emancipation is so bad it's not aired in syndication and it's written by someone who wrote an equally trashed episode of Next Gen with the same exact plot."
Shooter,Do you recommend Forward Unto Dawn or should I not bother?
Shooter,"Leaked plot though, not so much. Which is a shame."
Shooter,I mean I don’t know how you could determine a movie’s quality off of still images
Shooter,since when leaked images dictate how good a tv/movie is going to be..?
Shooter,My bad.... Man halo is coool...when's the last of us coming out ?
Shooter,"kinda sounds like it was a nightmare for lynch to produce and they were the only ones who would take it on

seems almost certain if it returns (again), it won't be on showtime"
Shooter,"It is the PERFECT property for a movie. You can't develop the Spartans that much. They were abducted as children and surgically, genetically, chemically altered to be SINGLY PURPOSED instruments of war. Yes they have personalities but they're...uni-dimensional. You have the AI and wartime leaders to balance them and contrast the stark, laser-like focus of the Spartans. 

Now if you were going to focus on the Covenant you'd do well with a show. As expensive as it would be you have complex hierarchies and politics. Personally I don't care about the covenant or their point of view though."
Empire of the Tsars,"It's a long article, here's where it says the problems start:

>At some point during the third season of Rick and Morty, multiple sources say Roiland simply stopped showing up — and when he did turn up in the Burbank offices, he’d typically avoid the writers room. In fact, Roiland’s colleagues often knew he was there only because they could hear his dogs. Or they’d hear his remote-control toy car, which had a microphone on top of it, zooming around the office. At least once, Roiland sent it into the writers room, says a source. “You wouldn’t have seen him in weeks, and then you’d see the car come in, which was insane.” Roiland would make exceptions to bring through famous fans, of which Rick and Morty has legions; at various points, his visitors included Kanye West, the comedians on Impractical Jokers and porn star Riley Reid, who gifted the room a succulent.

 
>By that time, Roiland had a girlfriend, who became a fiancée, and he would talk openly about their penchant for threesomes. “It was something we just ignored because it was disgusting,” says an insider. Multiple sources say it was also during that period that Roiland sent a female employee a “really creepy” text, late at night, requesting that she come to his home (they declined to name the staffer). “She didn’t want to run it up the flagpole,” says one of the sources, “and then it was just this really fucked-up, awkward thing.”

His Relationship with Dan Harmon:

>In the meantime, the relationship between Harmon and Roiland had grown so acrimonious that the show brought in a mediator to try to salvage what was once an inspired partnership. And though those efforts were unsuccessful, the pair was able to put aside their differences enough to secure a massive, 70-episode renewal from Adult Swim in May 2018. The pact, which ensured that the show would run for several more seasons, appeared to reward Rick and Morty for its precedent-smashing ratings for Adult Swim; by season five, the Emmy-winning series was reportedly generating hundreds of millions in merchandise revenue alone.

>In the years since, Roiland’s involvement on Rick and Morty has largely been relegated to voicing characters, for which he’d take no direction and record from his home. In fact, it has been years since anyone can remember him stepping foot in the show’s writers room, even when it’s been virtual. Recently, a similar situation has occurred on both Solar Opposites and Koala Man, according to multiple sources. On the former, which he co-created, he had, until mid-January, voiced one of the show’s leads. “He knew the power of being the voices,” says a source, noting how Roiland had revealed early on that he believed securing key voice roles would safeguard him from being fired one day. On Koala Man, on which he’s simply an executive producer, he was given a character to voice in the show’s third episode but, per two sources, the writers almost blew their deadline waiting for him. The character was killed off at the end of the episode."
Empire of the Tsars,Who knew that Dan Harmon would turn out to be the affable one?
Empire of the Tsars,"The Roiland and Harmon part was pretty interesting, had no clue they had such issues with each other. I wonder if there was a single event or just what was discussed in the article that strained it?"
Empire of the Tsars,"Sounds like Rick and Morty losing Roiland is not really going to effect that much, get a new voice actor or two and maybe they’ll actually show up and take direction. Could overall be a net positive for the series."
Empire of the Tsars,"I really, really want to know what I have to do to get a job where I…

- Make millions
- Surround myself with geniuses
- Win my industry’s most prestigious awards
- Gain an army of rabidly enthusiastic fans
- Get more responsibilities and opportunities

…while also…

- Rarely show up to work, FOR YEARS
- Be loud and derailing in meetings
- Sexually harass women the instant I gain professional access to them
- Blow company money at Toys-R-Us
- Make everyone around me look and feel bad

And literally not one person rats on me? Fires me? Blows my shit up? Not one?!

Like. How. Where. What do I have to do to get a life where I am coddled like a precious boy-king."
Empire of the Tsars,Why is he Sonic
Empire of the Tsars,"The only time I've heard Justin Roiland speak (as himself) was an episode of Harmontown he appeared on. The dude seemed really out there. Like on drugs AND a crazy weirdo.  When listening I was thinking ""uh oh...he's one of those show runners. The kind who will be in the news eventually"""
Empire of the Tsars,So...like [John Kricfalusi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kricfalusi) and *Ren & Stimpy*?
Empire of the Tsars,"A tale as old as time: “We were always aware of the unethical/illegal actions of this person who made all of us a lot of money, but didn’t want to say anything until the actions are already made known to the public.”"
Empire of the Tsars,"It’s amazing how often this article repeats how Rolland is barely involved with Rick and Morty, as if to ensure it can continue on Adult Swim with minimal blowback.

That said, would Roiland still benefit from royalties even as he is cut off?"
Empire of the Tsars,"I don't think Roiland was ever considered a genius, unlike Dan Harmon. He was funny, with a lot of energy, and was a big part of the show's success... but that's not genius territory."
Empire of the Tsars,"I don't know about the rest of yall, but I never attributed R&M success to roiland, I always thought it was Harmon with a good writing room. I always assumed roiland was just voice work...and not good work at that. All his fucking voices sound damn near identical...except Rick IS unique compared to the rest."
Empire of the Tsars,"Is it really a surprise that fans felt his career was ""suddenly derailed"" when the reason why was kept a secret up until just recently?"
Empire of the Tsars,"Honestly I'm hopeful that the R&M writers will make the best of this. From this article and others it seems like Harmon and the other main show runners have been done with Roiland for a LONG time and he hasn't had meaningful creative input. Hopefully this is like a weight lifted for the rest of the writing staff.

The bigger unanswered question as I see it is what the next season will be like. Fairly sure it's already completely written (and maybe completely voiced too?) So do they rerecord Roiland's lines? And I feel like they'll have to add in at least a 30 second joke about the voice change. I hope the show carries on the same or better though 🤞"
Empire of the Tsars,"As a fan of the show (who’s used to liking things with awful fan bases) I was always annoyed by roiland and thought that he was only around because the seed of the idea was his from back in channel 101 days… but it’s so obviously Dan harmon’s show and ideas.

edit: originally autocorrected fan bases to canvases lol"
Empire of the Tsars,Never meet your heroes
Empire of the Tsars,"I'm reminded of what happened to Noel Clarke in the UK. BAFTA fellowship winner to career effectively over in under a week when 20 women came forward with claims of bullying, verbal abuse and sexual harassment. 

ITV had to pull the final episode of a ""stripped"" series from regular airing when the advertisers bailed, Sky had to cancel *Bulletproof* and BAFTA revoked his fellowship. No charges were filed due to lack of evidence, but he's done."
Empire of the Tsars,You either die a Morty or live long enough to to see yourself become the Rick ah geee
Empire of the Tsars,"He always gave off a manchild vibe, like he never actually matured to adulthood. Good riddance, I suppose."
Empire of the Tsars,Clearly this is another example of sex addiction a disease that overwhelmingly affects rich and powerful men.
Empire of the Tsars,"“More recently, multiple sources say that Roiland, other than voice work, has not had any meaningful creative presence on any of the series that bear his name. In fact, many of his former colleagues say they haven’t heard from him in years, and when they have, it’s been unpleasant.”

I have been theorizing this for YEARS and I’m not just saying that because this article is shitting on him. I’ve always felt like he’s been a hyped up voice actor, with the limit of his creativity in R&M being the designs of the characters and Ricks ship. I’d be curious to see what else he came up with, but it’s always seemed like he did barely enough to earn that co creator title with Dan Harmon, who actually writes it. Maybe Rolland came up with the idea, which would make him a creator, but that’s the bare minimum of what people consider a creator."
Empire of the Tsars,Can these people just stop being creeps so that shows/movies/music stop getting ruined
Empire of the Tsars,"“I turned my self into a felon, Morty! I’m WIFE BEATER RIIICCKKKK!!”"
Empire of the Tsars,"I had heard from a chick I knew, of his predilection. She said he was into 3 ways, but also mid teenage girls. Something like once he had some $ or any amount of power/fame he used it to hookup with the girls that wouldn't have given him the time of day when he was still a nobody."
Empire of the Tsars,"The moment I heard that Justin Roiland and Alex Hirsch had been hanging out together a lot, I knew exactly what was wrong. This guy doesn’t show up to work and thinks he’s the hottest shit for the work he doesn’t show up to anymore"
Empire of the Tsars,"I wish I was surprised by the fans' reaction, but I'm just not."
Empire of the Tsars,Imagine you're in a meeting and the boss drives a little R/C car in there with a microphone stuck on top and just parks it lol
Empire of the Tsars,Eerie similarities with John K. and how that sexual predator went down in flames.
Empire of the Tsars,It derailed before that. He was apparently a raging alcoholic. I hope he finds help.
Empire of the Tsars,"I love how it's always ""quirky genius"" instead of ""fucking asshole"" until the appalling behavior comes to light."
Empire of the Tsars,"Let's be real, who isn't really excited to see the next season now?

First you have two main characters getting recast and you know damn well they will find fantastic talent. Even if you can just barely hear a difference, I'm looking forward to that. And the obligatory meta scene about it. Hell make a whole episode plot about it!

Plus I always felt Harmon was the man behind the great story telling. And now this just confirms it. Without Roiland, I bet that Harmon won't be hindered by Justin's douchebagerry and we will see some of the
Best story telling the show has seen.

And there is a part of me that wants Roiland to watch R&M succeed even more so without him just so he can feel some negative emotions and knock that fucker down a few pegs."
Empire of the Tsars,Is there anyone here that remembers Bewitched?  One week they just replaced the dad and no one said a thing. I was confused but the new dad was a huge improvement from the old one.
Empire of the Tsars,"Dude was never a genius. He was a drunk idiot who did funny voices and threw out ""lolsorandom"" ideas in the writers room at best. Guy cant write a story to save his life and the best thing hes ever come up with is Lemongrabs scream. He never has or could, so I never understand why people think just cause his names in the opening titles that hes actually making these stories. Every episode is writers + Harmon with random shit sprinkled in by Justin. Writers + Harmon alone will be fine and probably better as the weirdest fans of this show always seemed to be the ones on Roilands dick."
Empire of the Tsars,He sounds like an asshole who made something cool once or twice. R&M is hilarious.
Empire of the Tsars,"I always scratch my head after reading a story like this, in which only one the interviewees is quoted as being concerned about whether this individual was inappropriate with a female colleague. Everyone else is worried about the prestige of their creative products. I’m not saying you can’t worry about that—of course, it’s natural—I’m saying…Roilands are everywhere, and they proliferate in part because most people do not care about the targets of their abuse until it becomes a larger issue."
Empire of the Tsars,"I've heard from people who know him that he's a total dick. Like, obviously funny from afar, but insufferable if you have to interact with him."
Empire of the Tsars,I have a family member who works in the entertainment industry and they told me years ago that there’s been rumors of this stuff. Sucks to hear it’s true.
Empire of the Tsars,It would be great if his punishment could also somehow include McDonald's Szechuan Sauce.
Empire of the Tsars,Never go full John K
Empire of the Tsars,"Following his Instagram years ago was what led to that realization for me. Getting that extra little look into how he is when he openly expresses himself quickly tipped me off that this guy just isn’t right. He really just comes off as this emotional immature, overly volatile person who can never identify when to stop. And that last one is a big sticking point"
Empire of the Tsars,"Not a single person I know, fans included, were surprised by this"
Empire of the Tsars,"It’s always great when the people in power who had the ability to call out shitty behavior years ago, all come out after the fact to say they knew about it. See Harvey Weinstein."
Empire of the Tsars,This was not shocking to me. Rick and Marty while intelligent is clearly a cry for help and the “method acting” behind the scenes video he put out of him getting drunk in the office back in like 2017 was the first indicator to me that he was unwell mentally in some capacity.
Empire of the Tsars,Quirky? I thought the mofo was just creepy
Empire of the Tsars,"It's not a long list, but I've never found people who have to drink to be creative to be good people. It's well known that Justin and many of the other writers would get drunk in the writing room and Justin would get drunk to do his voice acting work.

Roosterteeth is another company that's going through some controversy now and has always had a pretty steep drink culture.

I say this as someone who drinks, and likes to get drunk when the mood is right. If you have to get shit-faced to make entertaining stuff you've got a problem."
Empire of the Tsars,"Someday, maybe “colleagues” will speak up in these situations.  

Unless we want more George Santoses and Justin Rollandses?"
Empire of the Tsars,"While interesting I'm kinda skeptical of tabloids after watching Harry & Meagan. But really does make you think, curious what Harmon's take on this guy is."
Empire of the Tsars,Can’t trust someone in thin glasses
Empire of the Tsars,"""Suddenly derailed"" by charges from like two or three years ago 🤔"
Empire of the Tsars,Imagine being such a maniac that Dan Harmon is the adult in the room.
Empire of the Tsars,"Not to downplay Roiland as being a massive creep, but I have to admit; I did get a bit of a chuckle out of the article's attempt to wring maximum salaciousness out of the Riley Reid angle by framing it as him ""parading a high-profile porn star"" around the writer's room as if he had her naked and filming a hardcore scene in front of everyone to their maximum discomfort, when apparently it sounds like it was actually one of the more wholesome parts of this whole affair. She bought them all a houseplant for heaven's sake!"
Empire of the Tsars,Seems to me they put this article out in an attempt to assuage fans of their fears that this guy leaving will destroy the show.  It’s no different from an advertisement in the form of an article.
Empire of the Tsars,You read the bizarre defenses of talking about threesomes in the workplace and then you understand why the Rick and Morty fanbase is considered so toxic.
Empire of the Tsars,"All the people here saying ""I always thought Dan Harmon was the genius...not Justin Roiland"" are so full of shit. Some of us were here on Reddit when Rick and Morty originally dropped and y'all had Roilands cock so far down your throats."
Empire of the Tsars,Ah geez 😳
Empire of the Tsars,"I am glad to hear he wasn't doing the writing. At least I know the show won't be missing that aspect and I don't care much if Morty changes a little. The only question is how much was riffing that I enjoyed in dialog, but I am sure an actual voice collaborator will make up for this."
Empire of the Tsars,100 years
Empire of the Tsars,"Honestly not to sound judgmental but I wasn't surprised when it came out he had been messaging underage girls, the kind of ""jokes"" he was making a lot of the time on podcasts were in line with that."
Empire of the Tsars,I would be willing to bet a large sum of money that Dan Harmon has lots of sexual misconduct skeletons in his closet
Empire of the Tsars,It turns out the toxic fan base is recantation of Roiland himself
Empire of the Tsars,"I guess it’s not surprising that Justin turned out to be pretty fucking weird and exploitive, given how his creative career started with insane shit like Doc and Mharti

Like, I’m pretty sure most people that weren’t totally disgusted by it were thinking “holy shit this guy is nuts, I wonder what would happen if he was given a real budget and a staff”. Fast forward and… he’s an abusive sociopath! Surprise!"
Empire of the Tsars,"So he hasn't been involved in the show's writing room since season 2.

That's weird, everyone at /r/rickandmorty kept saying how essential he is to the future of the series."
Empire of the Tsars,"I’ve suspected that the writers have long detected red flags with Roiland.

While these companies are free to work with anyone he and to a degree Harmon seem to be the type of people you should probably have a “parted ways” statement on standby."
Empire of the Tsars,How is this a surprise. He’s a POS and said some really weird stuff to minor girls through DMs. Doesn’t help how unfunny he is either; always the same stupid voice
Empire of the Tsars,"How brave of these colleagues to speak up now after the crimes have been made public and their comments don’t impact their own ability to make money. 

True heroes."
Empire of the Tsars,But no one  still listens to Chris Brown right??
Empire of the Tsars,"Justin Roiland's contributions weren't even really to writing. His idea of writing is just making up characters with silly names like ""Shploobie Bibbles"" and juvenile gross-out humor. 2 of his 5 writing credits over 6 seasons of R&M were inter dimensional cable, which we all know is largely improvised, and see my point above about Shploobie Bibbles. New voice for the titular characters will be the biggest change, and I doubt very many reasonable people will end up giving a fuck."
Empire of the Tsars,His behavior was troubling in public.  I listened to one episode of his podcast and felt like my soul needed a powerwashing afterwords.
Empire of the Tsars,Thumbnail at a glance makes him look like a bad Sonic the Hedgehog OC.
Empire of the Tsars,Lol I saw him as sonic in the thumbnail instead of Rick and was very confused
Empire of the Tsars,So all the people freaking out about Roiland's involvement blew it way out of the proportion outside or doing voices
Empire of the Tsars,But Elon Musk said he’s the heart of the show!
Empire of the Tsars,When did assholery become ok some might say. Others would say it’s always been. I’m sad for folks who he wronged. Feel stupid for finally getting to these shows and then this.
Empire of the Tsars,What a big dumb douchebaggy bag'a douche.
Empire of the Tsars,"&#x200B;

Holy shit, the [tiny RC car with a camera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii6XuM187Zo) on it is real"
Empire of the Tsars,"Amazingly well researched article. 

What a creepy fuck this Roiland turned out to be"
Empire of the Tsars,Next time they gonna say is that he started his own religion. Pigs are people.
Empire of the Tsars,"If story accurate, all he did was make himself easy to replace. Never a good idea in any job. His role was get the ball rolling and voice work. Like any exec producer really.  

This is different then why most of us thought which was he was neck deep in the day to day work of getting the shows made and so his voice (literal and figuratively) were a critical component. That clearly isn’t the case.

If you think all those Steven Spielberg producing credits was him rolling up his sleeves and getting to work, you lost your minds. His roll was to pitch it, get the money on board and then sit back, let everyone do the actual work and reap the benefits.

After that the actual creatives did the heavy lifting of the writing, directing, animating while Roiland just did voice work from comfort of home. Not saying voice actors are not important, but unlike some live action shows, they can be replaced as there are many that can mimic the voice.

As for his silence, well duh. Even a first year law student will tell you to “shut the f—- up” when involved in criminal and civil cases. The worse thing he can do is say anything. Look at Adam Baldwin and his ill advised interview and how that is going to be used against him."
Empire of the Tsars,"For a man who created Rick Sanchez, I'll say it again, I'm not that surprised."
Empire of the Tsars,"Ahh yes, Hollywood reporter, they’re not bias or clickbaity."
Empire of the Tsars,"It really sounds like roiland just kept being himself and the success made everyone else be more cautious and that just didnt vibe with the “we are successful now so we must change” turn everyone took

You know, excluding the abuse stuff which is obviously terrible"
Empire of the Tsars,Whoda thought that the alcoholic who disguises hedonism as “complex” nihilism is actually an annoying and crass human being.
Empire of the Tsars,Incoming netflix docuseries
Empire of the Tsars,Yoga
Empire of the Tsars,How is everyone in this comment section ignoring the fact that he's a huge pedo? That news is definitely what resulted in adult swim cutting ties.
Empire of the Tsars,"so basically, everything was fine as long as he brought them fame and power? yeh, sounds bout right."
Empire of the Tsars,Roiland trying to be Rick in real life.
Empire of the Tsars,When I first saw Rick and Morty I thought it was funny. When I saw that everything he has ever done is the same damn voice and humor I found him way less funny.
Empire of the Tsars,It’s always guys like Roiland that try to get their reports to join them for a threesome. 🤢
Empire of the Tsars,"An episode aired last night with the toxic versions of Rick and Morty and it never occurred to me that Morty seduced two grown ass women, until just then. Never really put much thought into some of the shit that happens in the show until this stuff started coming out."
Empire of the Tsars,"I really like Solar Opposites, more than R and M. It’s a shame celebrities turn into raging douche canoes when they get a little money in the bank"
Empire of the Tsars,"He’d get shitfaced drunk to record his lines for Rick, how anyone would be surprised that he isn’t an alcoholic piece of shit outside of the recording booth is beyond me."
Empire of the Tsars,"Quirky genius? No, fuck that. 

I once pointed out awhile back, before the accusations began, that someone whose entire fame started with a BTTF parody in which Doc Brown wants Marty to suck him off, might not be the most stable guy in the room. I got downvoted to hell for it because you can't question the 'genius"" of some artists I guess. Those fans helped this guy gain his power, that he went on to abuse other creators and artists. They saw a guy who went through a lot of trouble to make the joke, ""a grown adult  wants oral sex from a teenager"" and said, ""shut up and take my money"" and he went on to become a grown adult trying to fuck teenagers. 

Who.

Fucking.

Knew."
Empire of the Tsars,"They should just write in Morty going through a late puberty, hire an actor with a crazy deep voice and never mention it again"
Empire of the Tsars,"Any true fan would have seen this coming a mile away, when I saw his method acting video like 4 years ago, I knew he had a lot of demons and trauma he wasn't able to deal with and his alcoholism was only going to get worse and get him into trouble."
Empire of the Tsars,He stopped showing up around the Third season? That’s when it all went downhill quality wise
Empire of the Tsars,This show is has been a minefield for its staff. I find it weird that few articles are mentioning the sexual harassment instances with Harmon as well.
Empire of the Tsars,"I first became a fan of Justin’s when he started his podcast way back in 2010. Generally he came off as a good person, with a crazy sense of humor, quirky ideas, and love for his friends and fans. He’d even get deep talking about his childhood, sense of paranoia for the future, and depressive episodes. Sometimes he’d come off as somewhat controlling, but it was his show after all. Just like in Rick and Morty he also did characters that went on comedic rants that were over the top, overtly sexual, scatological (lol), and just straight up funny and weird. Even if he responded to fan mail as one of these characters going on a lewd rant, he’d come back as Justin and usually say it’s just for the shock comedy and he loves his fans. Fast-forward to today and I’m not sure how to feel about Justin… Worst case scenario, he was always an abuser deep down and it’s just finally come to light. Best case is he spiraled out of control under pressure becoming the personalities he always portrays in characters. Of course neither are excuses. I hope any victims get justice. I hope Justin gets therapy. And I hope the friends and family of everyone involved are doing ok."
Empire of the Tsars,"TBH he kind of sucked and all his 'projects' were him just him riding the coat tails of Rick and Mortys success, and doing the same characters again and again."
Empire of the Tsars,"Rick and Morty fan here, and I hope most other fans can agree with this next statement, fuck this guy, we don’t need him, just find other people to voice his characters."
Tales by Light,Thanks!
Tales by Light,"Watched it over the weekend, loved it!"
Tales by Light,[deleted]
Tales by Light,"Many/most of them are worth watching. But not every viewer will enjoy every bit of content they churn out. For instance, The Get Down and Hip Hop Evolution was something I was super psyched about. Would someone that is not into hip hop enjoy those? Probably not!"
Tales by Light,"Most shows labelled 'Netflix Originals' aren't really originally produced by Netflix. Netflix only holds the US/International distribution rights to the project and thus labels it a 'Netflix Original'.

Shows like *Daredevil*, *House of Cards*, *Luke Cage*, etc. are created by Netflix and are true Netflix Originals. 

Most others they just paid to be the sole distributor and are branded Original. This includes Stand up specials, Documentaries, reality shows, foreign speaking shows.

From the ones you listed:

* *White Rabbit Project* was produced by Beyond Television Productions and Netflix is the dristibutor and Network
* *Crazyhead* was produced by Urban Myth Films. Distributed by StudioCanal. With it originally airing on UK's E4 network then on Netflix
* *The Crown* was produced by Sony Pictures Television. Distributed and airing only on Netflix.
* *Spectral* was produced by Legendary Pictures. Distributed and airing only on Netflix.
* *Pacific Heat* was produed by Working Dog Productions, which was then sold to Netflix.
* *Tales by Light* was produced by Untitled Film Works. Distributed by Distribution 360. Originally airing on National Geographic.
* *Paranoid* was produced by Red Production Company. Distributed by StudioCanal. Originally airing on UK's ITV then Netflix."
Tales by Light,"The thing to note is that for some people, Netflix is the only thing they use to watch TV. Like any old TV channel, they can't just have a couple of shows and that's about it. They've got to have a wide variety of content, otherwise they'll alienate a large percentage of their audience. 

I wouldn't say they have too much, so much as they have a large variety of programs on. "
Tales by Light,"You do realize that stuff like 3% and Club de Cuervos is not necessarily meant for you?

Netflix is a global company, they are not making stuff just for americans."
Tales by Light,"Club de Cuervos is a funny show (only watched season 1 so far), but it's about owning a soccer club, probably won't have the same pull for people who don't care about soccer just like a show about American football probably won't be of interest to someone in South America.  I'd still give it a try since it's not really about Soccer but about a stupid man inheriting ownership of a professional sports team."
Tales by Light,"Everyone here is talking about a show they liked but another that they didn't like, and the vast majority of the titles mentioned are different in every post. So yeah, they're producing a lot and it's not all meant for a single viewer, but overall they're making quality content. Each show has some audience. None will likely have 100% viewership, but they're targeting their viewers well and making sure they're all served in some way by at least 1 thing they produce."
Tales by Light,"You're asking Reddit. The answer is no, and they're all worth watching, of course."
Tales by Light,I actually find it really interesting how low key their advertising for shows is. ie Stranger Things. I heard nothing about this until someone posted on here that it was a really cool show and then it just exploded. 
Tales by Light,"They're definitely not putting out too much, that is the perspective of someone who thinks Netflix expects you to watch everything they put out. TV watching these days is very niche, there are so many shows out there and most of them live on niche followings. Netflix is catering to this by putting out a ton of different things. You aren't meant to like all of them, you're meant to have a wide array of choices giving you a good chance to find something that's in your wheelhouse."
Tales by Light,Chewing Gun is really funny. It's a mix of the inbetweeners and girls.
Tales by Light,"I haven't watched the majority of their original shows but so far I've enjoyed Bojack Horseman, House of Cards, F Is For Family, Stranger Things and Bloodline. I tried Marco Polo and 3% and never got into them. But they definitely do have original shows worth watching"
Tales by Light,"Sometimes it's overwhelming. I really cant keep up with all the shows even though they could be binged in a week.

I am finishing up the Marvel series while starting The OA and need to put Narcos S2 aside for a bit. Haven't even watched one episode of Black Mirror, so that's next. Then there's A Series of Unfortunate Events in Jan that is a must watch for me!

Is it overdoing it? No... because there's a genre for everyone. I tried The Crown and HoC... a bit too slow. You can pick and choose which series to follow and luckily the originals should be on the permanent inventory so I'll pick it up whenever. 

Speaking of HBO, it definitely has been taken to the back burner. I've tried 3x to start The Wire. I know it's good... it's legendary in the sub, but I get amped for new content from Netflix all the time."
Tales by Light,I really like the Medici: Masters of Florence. It's very interesting if you like shows like the Borgias and Game of Thrones
Tales by Light,"I mean when you churn out 60 shows in a year, theres bound to be several duds. They are still above average compared to most networks. The difference is that Netflix isnt really canceling their bad shows (besides Marco Polo) like othee networks, so theres some selection bias."
Tales by Light,"I wish Netflix would make a distinction between ""Netflix originals"" (shows they bought the rights to from other networks) and ACTUAL Netflix originals (House of Cards, Orange is the new Black, etc) on the app."
Tales by Light,"Yeah, I feel like they're going a little nuts. Most of them are actually quite good too, but the sheer quantity of them makes me mentally perceive them as being possibly lower in quality, and also possibly being an indicator that they're neglecting their non-original content. Even if neither of those things is actually true, that's the perception it creates (to me)."
Tales by Light,"Yeah, I wish Netflix would learn the difference between Netflix Original and Netflix Presents.  The latter is more appropriate when the content originally aired somewhere else, even in another region."
Tales by Light,[deleted]
Tales by Light,"I admit it's overwhelming, but started Glitch last night and really loved it."
Tales by Light,"I don't think OP's point was that there are too many shows, and that sheer ammount was just egregious. I think it was more about being able to successfully advertise/hype/give room to a show? 

OP if you're still lurking, please clarify, because I tend to agree with the latter. "
Tales by Light,"I think a key part of innovation is trying out lots of different things and accepting that many of them will fail, so from that perspective I don't see the quantity itself as an issue.

For me, Netflix has had quite a few hits in the last year or two. Most of the ones in this batch are somewhat outside my domain of interest, though, and I've only seen Spectral so far. It was entertaining with a cool premise, I would say not bad but not great either; a somewhat generic sci-fi military shooter with the tropes you'd expect. I watched it mainly because I'm a fan of Stalker and Orpheus."
Tales by Light,Club de Cuervos is great. 
Tales by Light,Grace and Frankie
Tales by Light,3% is awesome
Tales by Light,Some of these shows are purchased and just labeled exclusives here in the US.  These shows might run on tv in another territory. 
Tales by Light,"I'm a bit disappointed. To me the appeal of Netflix was the long tail. Now they're just turning into an HBO clone.

Every month I see an announcement of something leaving Netflix that I didn't even know was there due to their shitty channel organization/promotion. I'd have enjoyed the hell out of watching old Columbo movies. Instead it kept trying to get me to watch OitNB and rewatch(What the hell?) Stranger Things."
Tales by Light,"The bad part for me is there are so few of them I'm interested in.   Sorry, stand-up comedy and history documentaries do nothing for me *shrugs*
"
Tales by Light,"If they'd put some fucking money into them I wouldn't mind but they're very clearly cutting as many corners as possible with their budgets.


""So who what superheroes should we make our shows about?""


""Hmmmmmmm, lets do Punchy man, Punchy Woman, Punchy Black Man, Punchy Asian-Themed Man and Gun Man to start out with."""
Tales by Light,I didn't like Jessica Jones as much as Luke Cage or Daredevil.  I am suspecting that deep down I am either gay or the kind of sexist who chooses Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton.  I am hoping that I am gay.
Tales by Light,I think this is the best explanation of why there is such a high quantity of Netflix originals. Their user base is massive and diverse. They're currently doing the best job of putting out quality shows for every demographic. 
Tales by Light,"> A show like Hater's Back Off has never been pushed to me

awww, it's great. I feel like any lover of internet culture would like it."
Tales by Light,i don't really like hip hop and I thought it was a lot of fun.
Tales by Light,"Can confirm. I tried watching The Get Down. I can recognize that it's a very high quality show. Acting, writing, cinematography, music, everything fit right. It just wasn't my thing.

It's like almost everyone complaining about The OA at the moment. Granted, I've just finished episode 5, but I'm still enjoying it."
Tales by Light,that's because you're a television addict! get help!
Tales by Light,Medici was produced by Bright Light Productions and aired on Rai 1 in Italy
Tales by Light,"Likewise, in the UK we get THE EXPANSE even though it's a Syfy show. It's still slapped with a 'Netflix Original' title. "
Tales by Light,"> Shows like Daredevil, House of Cards, Luke Cage, etc. are created by Netflix and are true Netflix Originals. 

None of those examples were created by Netflix either; the Marvel shows are produced by ABC Studios, House of Cards is produced by Media Rights Capital. So far there are only a few shows (such as The Ranch) that Netflix has actually produced and they're quire recent, though Netflix is looking to increase in-house production going forward."
Tales by Light,"Is there a list of *true* Netflix originals? And where does something like Arrested Developmenr fall, which was created by another network but is not actually produce and created by Netflix?"
Tales by Light,You are really mischaracterizing this.  Some shows netflix brands as originals they just bought the rights to but that isn't the case for all the shows you listed.   Having a separate production company doesn't mean the show isn't an original.  It is a pretty standard setup that also exists in regular television.  No one is going to say Breaking Bad wasn't an AMC original or that Seinfeld wasn't an NBC original.   Doesn't make sense to start doing it for Netflix shows. 
Tales by Light,"Really glad you pointed this out. I've often thought this was the case. As a result, the productions that ARE actually original (Daredevil, HOuse of Cards, etc) are usually predictably better than many of the sub-par shows they are branding Netflix, but have actually ""rescued"" from oblivion. Yea - way too much ""original"" content."
Tales by Light,Thought 3% is more familiar in the sense that it's mystery type fun show so it will attract more viewers. Club de Cuervos doesn't look like something Americans would watch.
Tales by Light,"My cousin told me to watch it a year ago but I brushed it off initially. They're visiting from Mexico and we were watching it one day and I binged the first season in a week. I don't watch Spanish TV and I'm not really into soccer ( I will watch it occasionally, but don't follow it) but I was surprised how much I was invested into the show. I'm fluent in Spanish so I understand it all, but I wonder how well the humour would translate into English with subtitles. 

I recommended it to my brother, but it's hard to recommend it to friends that don't speak Spanish because I'm not sure if they'd like it. 

It's a great show and the 2nd Season just came out but I hope it gets renewed for another season, because I would love to see more of these characters. 

"
Tales by Light,"> I actually find it really interesting how low key their advertising for shows is. ie Stranger Things. 

there was nothing low key about that, they advertised it all the time on regular tv channels, even billboards up in my city. I think i even saw a trailer/ad for it in the cinema around the time it came out.

they pushed hard on the advertising for that show and it was money well spent."
Tales by Light,They pretty much just drop the trailer and move on. They sometimes pay for commercials too.
Tales by Light,Nice to see Walder Frey finally got Robb to marry his daughter 
Tales by Light,Ahhh fuuuck I would certainly like to see more rob
Tales by Light,"For me the hard part is figuring out which shows are worth watching. There's a couple shows that I can't find any reviews on at all. For example, I've heard some people love The OA and other people who hate it. And since my time is really limited I don't like investing in a show unless I know it's going to be good. "
Tales by Light,Why?
Tales by Light,"Yeah, it's like that thing in cognitive psychology where the more choices you have, the less satisfied you'll be with the one you pick. Sure, this one show might be nice, but I'm always going to be wondering if I should be watching one of the other 29 shows. It doesn't help that Netflix doesn't keep a convenient list anywhere - every time I click the home page I'm bombarded with 7 new original shows and it's actually pretty hard to keep track.

HBO only has a handful of really outstanding shows (Deadwood, Rome, Sopranos, Carnivale, The Wire) so I don't feel too bad picking one to binge watch. "
Tales by Light,This as well. It was really strange to see Glitter Force (Saban's attempt to dub Pretty Cure) advertised as a Netflix Original.
Tales by Light,"> Stranger Things (it's not that great though

this show has gotten so much hype. I just finished watching it and it's not perfect but I think it does the 80s so damn well it gets a lot of hype. but seriously I love how no one made a big deal about barbara going missing and not being found."
Tales by Light,"Black Mirror is a continuation as well, Netflix is only directly responsible for the third season."
Tales by Light,what is it about?
Tales by Light,"Exactly. More content is nice, but if I don't want to jump into a show unless I know it's good, *especially* since I've been burned so many times by getting really invested in a Netflix show only to find out it was mediocre (Narcos, Luke Cage, etc etc). 

It also drives me up a wall that it's impossible to find a list of their shows they released. I spent like a week trying to find a show because it popped up on my home screen once but never again and it was impossible to find. "
Tales by Light,"This is a weird line of thinking. Maybe your TV preferences have nothing to do with your politics?

Jessica Jones sucked btw and I voted for Clinton."
Tales by Light,"> I am suspecting that deep down I am either gay or the kind of sexist who chooses Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton. I am hoping that I am gay.

this has to be the weirdest form of reasoning ever "

Tales by Light,Episode 8 will make you hate everything retroactively.
Tales by Light,The oa is shit though 
Tales by Light,I still don't get why they didn't just release it on the damned Syfy channel in the UK rather than making us wait over a year only to give it to a competitor... so confused.
Tales by Light,"MTV's Scream is a ""Netflix Original"" in Canada."
Tales by Light,"All those shows were original content commissioned by Netflix.  Even *The Ranch* was commissioned by Netflix, with production done by Ranch Hand Productions."
Tales by Light,Yeah but that's common. We always identify shows by their network not their production studio. Often ABC studios shows will appear on Fox or vice versa.  Of the top of my head I can think of Scrubs (ABC Studios) airing non NBC and Brooklyn (NBC) airing on Fox.  The examples can go on. 
Tales by Light,"[Here's the list of Netflix Original Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_original_programs_distributed_by_Netflix#Original_programming)

Tales by Light,"I found the OA to be dreadfully slow and just a bit 'off' for my liking. 

The Expanse on the other hand I really enjoyed. "
Tales by Light,"from what I heard it was slow to start but got really good, and then a lot of people strongly dislike the ending."
Tales by Light,Word on the list nonsense. Netflix has always had major functionality issues. If youre gonna pump out 226 shows a year atleast give me the ability to sort through them.
Tales by Light,"> It doesn't help that Netflix doesn't keep a convenient list anywhere - every time I click the home page I'm bombarded with 7 new original shows and it's actually pretty hard to keep track.

They are really lacking on educating their users on when new shows are coming out.  I feel like there will just randomly be some new show out, and I just wait for internet buzz to tell me what to watch.

Even if it was something as simple as new series release on the first Friday of every month. Then you could get hyped about something."
Tales by Light,Yeah it's decent. It was over hyped with so many people watching it because of the hype some people are bound to be disappointed.

Tales by Light,"Small town cop gets a call that there is a disturbance in a graveyard. There is a boy witness to what happens there, but he is hiding so does not report it. Cop shows up and finds 4 confused people covered in dirt with various accents. Rescues them and brings them to a small local Dr. Office where there is a fifth person found earlier. When the cop sees the fifth person the show gets really interesting."
Tales by Light,"I mean, it's possible the shows you've stumbled upon just weren't your thing. I thought Narcos was great and so did a lot of people, for instance. Actually that's why they release so many wildly different shows, they're trying to get *everyone* hooked to something. You and I aren't supposed to like everything, we're supposed to love a couple and like a few others, just enough to stay subscribed.

From my point of view the only valid criticism you're making is how difficult it is to find stuff worth watching. Although that is a deliberate choice of theirs, I do agree they could design the whole thing better so you more easily find stuff you could be interested in.

[As for a list of all their originals, Wikipedia is your best shot honestly.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_original_programs_distributed_by_Netflix) They divide by genre, list future shows, differentiate between actual original content and acquired shows from other producers, and most importantly, their list is constantly updated."
Tales by Light,Narcos was mediocre?  You are spot on about trying to find a show you were interested in and never put on your watch list. Very confusing trying to find shows to watch. 
Tales by Light,"Considering Netflix costs $9.99 or so a month, anyone who is complaining doesn't have much ground to stand on. Netflix could cost $20 a month and it would still be worth it over cable and wouldn't feel like you were subsidizing shows you aren't watching."
Tales by Light,it grows on ya
Tales by Light,"I hate episode 8 as an ending, but could see myself coming to appreciate it if there is a second season. "
Tales by Light,They probably did some market research and determined it wouldn't do well there.

As were some of the shows you listed as not being 'true' Netflix Originals, so I'm not sure what distinction you're trying to make. "
Tales by Light,"This wasn't about what network we identify a show with, it's about which company actually owns and produces the show."
Tales by Light,Crazy Head aired on tv already.  That is like saying Lost or The Almighty Johnsons is a netflix original.

Tales by Light,"I don't have any way of knowing which episodes you have seen or not but it is safe to assume you haven't missed anything. All three seasons are on Netflix (in Canada at least), it's just that the third was produced by Netflix instead of Channel 4."
Tales by Light,"I mostly agree, but I think OP is onto something with the psychology of it. It's tough not to question the quality of anything mass-produced and at this point, relative to other outlets, they are mass-producing shows. I have no problem with them trying to cast a wide net with programming, but I think that effort has to be coupled with distinct and effective advertising, as well as easy access to all of that content or they risk drowning good shows in a sea of press about mediocre or hyper-niche shows--- you gotta let a product breathe man, you don't see Mercedes releasing 3 new models at once or Adele dropping 14 radio singles in a day. "
Tales by Light,The cancer or the show?
Tales by Light,"The list I made was showing the distinction between true Netflix Originals (Netflix commissioned for these projects to be made 'Distributed and airing only on Netflix') and ones that Netflix bought the distribution rights to and thus were branded Netflix Originals.

>Series creator Andy Breckman is writing and executive producing the film, with Shalhoub executive producing in addition to starring. Randy Disk, who executive produced the series and directed nearly three dozen episodes, will direct and executive produce the film.

>Shalhoub, Ted Levine, Traylor Howard, Jason Gray-Stanford, Melora Hardin, and Hector Elizondo are set to return"

Case,"I will be on the couch with my “Randy Disher Project” t-shirt on, ready to go."

Case,It’s a jungle out there
Case,Awesome!  I am happy to see they’re getting a movie.
Case,I hope that's a working title
Case,I love Tony Shalhoub so much. I wonder if Monk will be as OCD as before because at the end of the series he wasn’t. I hope they don’t kill off the step daughter that would crush him.
Case,I love the idea of seeing Adrian and the gang again but that title has me concerned.
Case,"Damn I thought I had all the time in the world to rewatch the series and then finish the last season which I missed at the time. I'd start now but Im already rewatching Futurama to prepere for that revival. I guess this is an odd modern dilema to be in. Finishing shows before their inevitable revival comes out.

On that note, with how fun the Psych revivals are, I really wish Peacock (I think it was them) didnt completely destroy the 30 Rock reunion with far too many in universe ads"
Case,"After the success of Poker Face, Peacock found its gold mine on crime solving.  Maybe more Monk in the future soon."

Case,I tried to post Monk a while back but it kept getting removed (I’m not adding words just to add them)…I’ve been rewatching it and it’s seriously feel good vibes and a fun time. Awesome show. I think Peacock saw how many people were watching it on the app and made a good decision.
Case,It's a Renaissance of quirky detective shows. Thanks Rian Johnson!

Mar de Plástico,"Kurtwood Smith for all kinds of things, but particularly for season 1 of Patriot."
Mar de Plástico,"Wasn't in love with season 3 of True Detective overall, but I'm absolutely floored that Stephen Dorff wasn't nominated alongside Ali, his performance was one of the highlights of the show for me, excellent character."
Mar de Plástico,"**Freddie Highmore for Bates Motel** I was certain he'd get nominated for the 5th and final season of that series. He was superb all 5 seasons, but the last one was his crowning achievement. Took one of the most iconic characters in film history and added layers and dimensions to it and made it his own.

**Julia Roberts for Homecoming** Was expecting her to get nominated this year and she would have been my choice. Her performance was superbly nuanced.

**Dylan McDermott for American Horror Story:Murder House** He's been nominated for his earlier series The Practice, but I thought his character Dr. Ben Harmon was the heart and anchor for, to this day, the best season of AHS. McDermott was also superb as Bloody Face in Season 2 and reprising his role of Ben in Apocalypse. Everybody acts too much like Jessica Lange, Evan Peters, and Sarah Paulson are the only actors of any worth on that series. 


**Cameron Monaghan for Gotham** Jerome/Jeramiah/Joker/J/Whatever, if I had to pick ONE actor from that underrated series to win an award, it would be him. The best interpretation of The Joker might actually be on a series that almost no one even talks about or paid attention to.

**Noah Schnapp for Stranger Things** While Season 1 was Millie Bobby Brown's season as Eleven, Season 2 was Schnapp's season as Will. She was actually nominated for Season 1 (and Season 2 as well). He should have been nominated for Season 2.

**Tim Daly for Storm of the Century** One of the most underrated actors on television. Really could have been nominated for anything, but if I had to choose, I'm going with his superb lead performance in the classic 1999 Stephen King miniseries written specifically for television. Daly stole the show as stalwart Constable Mike Anderson.

Not an actor, but in terms of Black Mirror, **Hated in the Nation** was actually the best episode of Season 3, not San Junipero. The Emmys showered the wrong Season 3 episode with all the awards."

Mar de Plástico,"There’s too much emphasis on awards. Seriously! While it must be nice to receive an award for the effort that goes into the craft, recognition alone is its own award for the performance. With different stories, and different scripts, and different characters, how does one judge the performance of one actor over another? Not everything has to be some great cinematic experience. To  be honest, the awards, they’re not for the actors, they’re for the studios. It’s a way to market film, TV, Music, Or whatever to draw more interest to make more money. If you think that’s not an accurate statement, why do they even mention being nominated when they don’t win? It’s never Emmy Award Loser, it’s Emmy Award Nominee, or Winner of blank Emmy Award, including Blank Blank."
Mar de Plástico,Rami Malek in Mr Robot and Christian Slater
Mar de Plástico,[deleted]
Mar de Plástico,Tea Leoni for Madam Secretary.  Honestly most of the cast deserves emmy nods for their performance.  It sucks that Bebe Neuwirth left MS as well.  She was my other favorite actress on the show besides Tea Leoni.  Bebe also deserves a nod for her acting in MS as well.
Mar de Plástico,"I think half the cast of Star Trek TNG was deserving of a nomination, but back then, syndicated shows were basically ignored.  I think the last season of TNG got a nomination for Outstanding Drama, but most of what they won were technical emmys (hair styling, sound mixing, makeup, costume design, etc)"
Mar de Plástico,Liev Schreiber or Eddie Marsan should win one. Ray Donovan is severely underrated. It such a good drama show with fantastic actors.
Mar de Plástico,Such a tragedy.
Mar de Plástico,"An absolute outrage, his performance is incredible."
Mar de Plástico,That's very true.
Mar de Plástico,The Leftovers in its entirety not being recognized with nominations is a criminal act.
Mar de Plástico,She should’ve definitely been nominated for the episode “Janet(s)”
Mar de Plástico,He got a nomination
Mar de Plástico,"That look on his face when the main character draws that circle with his left hand, worth all the statues."
Mar de Plástico,Fucking cyclops motherfucker should have clinched it
Mar de Plástico,I completely agree about Noah Schnapp and Cameron Monaghan.
Mar de Plástico,Tim Daly and you dont bring up his best work Wings
Mar de Plástico,Andrew Scott definitely deserved the nod but I still think that Tony Shaloub deserved the Emmy.
Mar de Plástico,Malek was nominated in 2016.
Mar de Plástico,It wasn't eligible. June 2018 to May 2019 is the cut-off.
Mar de Plástico,Bebe neuwirth had to get at least a guest nod for cheers she and kelsey carried the later seasons. Just checked she won twice
Mar de Plástico,Was Jim Rash?
Mar de Plástico,Yes.
Mar de Plástico,"The episode won a Hugo, at least."
Mar de Plástico,Because his best work was Storm of the Century
Mar de Plástico,Whoops my bad
Mar de Plástico,He already has an Emmy. That's probably why he was deanied another nomination.
Mar de Plástico,Nope
Mar de Plástico,Oscar winner jim rash is too big for emmys
Mar de Plástico,[deleted]
Mar de Plástico,Barack Obama was scared of him.
Mar de Plástico,That's not an EGOT attitude.
Mar de Plástico,"I'm just here to make puns, man."
Mar de Plástico,Oh shit I forgot all about EGOTing
Mar de Plástico,"Binged it all in a day. It reminds me of Insecure but more serious. 
Pretty good series in general but can be a bit pretentious especially with the forced film/arts references at times."
Mar de Plástico,I really liked the style and I though it was enjoyable and an easy watch. I’m definitely gonna like this one. 
Mar de Plástico,"Am I the only one who thought this was horribly bad and cringey?

Nola has no realism to her. She appears to be nothing more than a caricature of the ""strong independent black woman"" trope and further, a mouthpiece for a writer perhaps. When she's talking to the camera, I don't believe one word she says. Her lines are like they were written by somebody who just finished a few classes in Gender Studies. It's just so canned and ...artificial. Lots of buzz words used in odd contexts with very little substance behind it. I don't get it. 

Her guys are not much better with the exception of Mars, who is the most genuine in my eyes. Jamie Overstreet is a coward of a man, not to mention a horrible father and husband and I'm supposed to believe that Greer Childs is a real person? He's laughably cheesy and of course, unbearably narcissistic. 

And what's with all of them making love to the camera? I get that they're supposed to be ""unapologetic"" about their sexual energies or whatever, but it was a little over the top with all that sultry, breathy talk during the 4th wall breaking.

The show also goes SO EASY on Nola. These guys are just so ready to put up with her shit and it's not believable at all. If my lover tricked me into an awkward thanksgiving dinner with his other lovers, I would immediately feel insulted and walk out. these guys  instead are STILL FIGHTING OVER HER?  The show punishes everyone but her for their actions. Not to mention, SHE DOESN'T EVEN GROW AS A CHARACTER. 

Nola starts as a strong black independent woman who is unapologetic about her sexuality, art, and sexual partners and she ends as a strong black independent woman who is unapologetic about her sexuality, art and sexual partners. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. What were we supposed to learn on this journey?

I really liked the gentrification subplot and some of the commentary about race relations but it all seems to not really connect with any of the main part of the plot. 

This is SO, so bad, yet it has great reviews and I'm pulling my hair trying to see how people don't see what I see. "
Mar de Plástico,"This has been getting great reviews! I've been loving the emergence of high quality black centric television. 

Atlanta, Insecure, Dear White People have all been great. Started Queen Sugar (been pretty good so far). Add in Master's of None because that's a special show as well"
Mar de Plástico,That musical act in ep 2 was so good.
Mar de Plástico,"Watching the first episode, it's kind of hilarious if you are in the right mood. That scene where they introduce Greer had me rofl-ing. I like the main character, she's a refreshing contrast to the typical twee awkward hipster-girl in the city trope. But I think the show will rub a lot of viewers the wrong way because they'll take it too seriously just because there's no laugh-track.
"
Mar de Plástico,"Watched the first episode of my commute this morning and enjoyed it quite a bit. Funny, smart, the composition of shots and cinematography were gorgeous for a comedy show, like almost Master Of None level gorgeous as far as comedies go. I think I'm going to enjoy this one quite a bit"
Mar de Plástico,This seemed like pretentious trash to me. The fact that in episode one this Spike Lee character launches into a monologue about how the film Malcolm X (Directed by Spike Lee) didn’t get the recognition it deserved is to say the least just weak. Each character mugs into the camera and is seemingly perfectly self aware while they couldn’t really have any less of a clue what is going on. Overall it just seems like a tone deaf reboot of story no one needed to hear.
Mar de Plástico,"Saw it, I thought it was okay. The cinematography and the music was fantastic. Nola needed to either be better written or better acted, because I hated her character. She was a selfish irresponsible asshole who toyed around with everyone's feelings and was arrogant about it. Super unlikable."
Mar de Plástico,"The style is really cool and fresh but the ""lessons"" that Nola force feeds you and her friends became pretty cringe worthy fast.  "
Mar de Plástico,Watching right now...I'm so amused! 
Mar de Plástico,You're not brave and manly for dealing with this type of woman. You're just crazy. She's insufferable. 
Mar de Plástico,I'm liking the vibe and cinematography. The album covers of the songs used does get annoying after the first couple of episodes 
Mar de Plástico,"I wonder if this show is supposed to empower me as a woman? After watching it I am rather questioning my feminism than feeling good about it. But maybe that's the whole point. Maybe it's supposed to challenge you. Then I ask if a male director is the right person to challenge feminism? 

Whatever, I kinda liked Nola in the beginning, my liking became less and less and when she was late to her first art class, I was literally yelling ""Are you serious"" at my tv. Being late is one thing, but being late with this ""Who cares? I'm Nola Darling, I'm a strong independent black woman."" attitude was the first time my sympathy hit rock bottom. 

Then her art. Ugh. Sure, the paintings are skilled in brushstroke and realism. But her art says nothing. It's just near-photo realistic. She doesn't tell me anything about what she or her pain or her drive is about. And when Greer asks her for her perspective, she gets offended and asks for the check right away. She refuses to be challenged when this is the very concept of art: Creating something to start a discourse. If you don't wanna deal with it, then you're just a painter and no artist. Sorry. 

And her taking responsibility. Somebody wrote earlier, that she takes so much from her fellow human beings, yet gives so little. In this regard she reminded me of Carrie Bradshaw in later seasons when SATC went downhill. She confuses being unapologetic with being a selfish brat. Your own freedom ends where someone else's freedom begins. Being unapologetic and self sufficient doesn't mean to trample on your friends and partners. And she always explains it by being a feminist. Yes, I understand that feminism is about making male norms acceptable for women, too (and vice versa). But a lot of the shit she did is not acceptable for any person. Not everything any men does is generally accepted. The story missed the mark here and did a disservice to feminism. 

I really liked the gentrification subplot and got interested in Shamekka near the end. I would have loved to hear more about her story and about the accident aftermath. Also it was briefly hinted twice that Clorinda has her own Sugar Daddy. I would like to know more about that. 

Overall I watched it til the end even though I see so many flaws. "
Mar de Plástico,Did anyone catch him talking about his own movie lol. The Malcom X segment was sort of meta if you think about it 
Mar de Plástico,"I just finished the first ep. I like how she is unapologetically sexual. Some people still seem to think that in this day and age, sex is a 'man's thing' or that the woman's pleasure doesn't matter. 

I like Mars. He's funny. The other two guys are annoying. The biracial guy is so up himself to the point where he makes me want to vomit. "
Mar de Plástico,"I watched a couple of episodes and I think it's pretty alright, but the show feels like it's straight out of 1995.  "
Mar de Plástico,"10/10 like her. Her character is as relatable as it can be for a woman these days. It's detailed and structured. Subtle but direct, and yet genius! 

I think she's not a caricature. She surpasses that idea of the strong independent black woman, with her passion, impulsiveness, and optimism of the future. A lot of that, composing, an in-depth lively character that also goes beyond race. "
Mar de Plástico,"Just finished episode 4 (Opal), which really highlights what annoys me about Nola. She's all about being a strong independent woman who doesn't need anyone and finds her worth from herself. This is great in theory, but like people...need...other people. That's kind of how humans work. And Nola disregards other people all the time because she's so caught up in herself. "
Mar de Plástico,Uuuuugggghhh this show stresses me out. I don't deal with ppl like Nola very well. Also there are like weird shots every now and then that are random and make you feel uneasy? Like at the art show the random lady that comes up to Nola to praise her art and hugs her. I haven't finished it yet so I don't know if it holds any significance later. My husband is interested in Shemekka's story. I can empathize with her waaaay more than I do with Nola. Welp. Here's to the last few eps left. Oh boy.
Mar de Plástico,I know Spike Leee gon kill me but lemme finish 🎶
Mar de Plástico,Brilliant reboot
Mar de Plástico,I was thinking the same. I think this is because she mentions the films full title and directors name in casual conversations which normal cinephiles don't do. It would come off a little less pretentious if she simply said the title
Mar de Plástico,"Thank you! I thought I was missing something. I'm not finished with the series yet, but I honestly can't understand why we should be invested in Nola's story? It seems she has no actual personality aside from her knowledge of cinema and being a typical starving artist who seems entitled to everyone's time, affection and resources and offers nothing in return. Can't commit, finishes her 'cleanse' with men as soon as she's confronted with her inability to be responsible for anything but her outrage. 

Honestly, I'm not sure why anyone is friends or wants to be with Nola or be in a relationship with her apart from her attractiveness. She isn't a good friend. She is a flake who only wants you around if it benefits her, and when it doesn't or she goes on a self-richeous rant you are thrown to the wayside. Honestly these men have no self respect aside from Greer, who so far (I'm almost finished with the season) hasn't been rejected for an exclusive relationship. She even takes advantage of the kindness of her therapist. Oh and her landlord. 

Don't get me wrong, live life on your own terms, but when yours are the only ones you consider, don't be surprised when people stop coming around. Got a real GirlBoss feel from it. 

And is it just me or were these characters' and dialogue ridiculous at some point? Greer is wholly unbelievable, every child actor was fairly awful. And do they explain the loving bed concept? 

I liked the exaggerated personalities of Greer and Mars, and I thought the girl that got the injections had an interesting story and was an important look into the non-gentrified portion of Brooklyn. 

IDK. I mean, I haven't seen the source material so maybe there is something to this story I'm missing."
Mar de Plástico,"So much this. Although I did find the show very enjoyable. But I fucking hated Nolas character. And yes, I would've hated it also if she had been a man. Just a fucking self-centered douche who had no regard for anyone else. Everything she did she did for Nola. And sure yeah people gotta watch out for nr. 1 but seriously.. I don't care if you have sex with a hundred dudes, but she stringed each and every one of these guys along. She knew they all had feelings for her and she new all along they'd all end up getting hurt but she just didn't give a flying fuck."
Mar de Plástico,"Overall, I enjoyed it 

You're not supposed to believe that Greer is a real person - I think a lot of the characters are purposefully overplayed - that's a big part of what gives the show its character and humour, and it really knocks the point home. 'What point?', you then ask. 

The point that Mars stands for comfort and excitement, Jamie is the obvious father figure and represents security and safety, and Greer Childs is just raw passion and lust. In the end, Nola realises that she never needed any of them to live a fulfilled life, because she can draw all those values from within herself.

I don't necessarily think we're supposed to like Nola. Otherwise she wouldn't be painted as this egocentric person who plays with emotions, can't commit to anything and have a hard time taking responsibility. Her bad sides were illuminated constantly. I agree that it was a bit weird in the end when she said that she'd now learnt to indulge in those relationships on her own terms - because that implies that she didn't already do that. And I think right from the get go, she was the one in control and were toying with the three guys for her own convenience. But that's besides the larger point.

I thought the show was good, moving and, at times, extremely funny. I especially found Greer to be hilarious. Generally I found the characters to be great. Also liked the other boyfriends as well as the therapist and the school principal/teacher. 

Like you, I also enjoyed the gentrification subplot. 
 
Some of your critique is fair enough, but when you criticize the show because you didn't like characters and actions that weren't supposed to be likeable/agreeable in the first place, it seems like you are missing the point. 

Also (and I'm not taking a jab here, just found it a bit funny), why did you spend six hours finishing a whole season of a show that you thought was ""SO, so bad"" ;-) "
Mar de Plástico,"Ahh, same!!! I sat through the entire series bc close friends told me it was “groundbreaking” and “so good” and “bgm” (which I generally believe is a lame descriptor but...ok). 

My main problem is that Nola was portrayed as heroine of the show but between her narcissism, irresponsibility, and inability to adult, how am I expected to support that? There is literally nothing likeable or relatable about her.

Agree with just about everything you’ve said, including the fact that Anthony Ramos (Mars) was one of the few redeeming qualities of the show, in addition to Clorinda and Shemekka (though her overdone, NYC “round the way girl” caricature was irritating at times).

And let me just add that most of Nola’s art was so terribly cliche that I just threw up my hands in exasperation, (the “strong black woman” portraiture...ugh seriously?). I’ve seen better pieces at the local flea market...she may as well have painted them on velvet. 

Spike Lee dropped the ball on this one and methinks the critics are too afraid to call him out on it."
Mar de Plástico,"From my understanding of Spike Lee, his style is very close to Quentin Tarantino, but with the vehicle being the Black Community and Character Dimension instead of Violence. 

In this sense, he's for telling the story that needs to be told without giving his characters a justification for playing a part in that story. I'll use Do The Right Thing as my example, because I feel that is his most accessible and deepest project, much like Pulp Fiction is the same of Tarantino's films.

In Do The Right Thing, we have Mookie, a black man living in Brooklyn just trying to maintain his identity and well-being, surrounded by the city. He is morally grey, biased in many ways, and completely unapologetic because he is human.

We also have Sal, his Italian boss. He is morally grey, biased in many ways, and completely unapologetic because he is human. Through the lens of the movie, both characters are either neutral, or completely in the wrong.

Sal cuts Mookie a break when he takes a long lunch to see his baby's mother (neutral). Sal is also horribly racist; he refuses to acknowledge Black leaders in his pizza memorabilia, and he has many problems with a man who wants to buy a slice of pizza on the premise of his race.

Mookie observes lots of things on a hot day in New York, but does not weigh in on what he sees, for better or for worse (neutral). He also takes action at the height of racial tension to break the window at Sal's pizzeria instead of saying anything to the police who just murdered his friend in cold blood. In a racial sense, he's in the right and has committed injustice against a racist business owner as an eye-for-an-eye towards the cop's injustice against a black man who just wanted to play his radio loudly. But in a moral sense, he's driven by personal means and it's wrong and he knows it, as acknowledged at the end of the film. As it happens, Radio Raheem is also morally grey; he literally has ""love"" and ""hate"" on his hands! 

The only people who do not act morally neutral or badly in the film are Mookie's baby's mother and Da Mayor, and they're both largely ignored beyond subplots.

This is much like life & society, in which there is no moral compass or guiding force. There are only people. The actions of morally good people don't typically move the plot forward because they don't affect the disposition of others, and though Spike Lee's characters are likely based on real people, they are only a part to play on the stage of the film to drive the story forward and be an open book for the audience to digest. Life moves forward, people don't change all that much and the moral of the story isn't always clear.

At least, that's what I got out of Nola. She's selfish, pretentious and driven more by her desires than her art, but at the same time she's unapologetically human. As a protagonist she's certainly not a fantastic person, but she moves her own story forward."
Mar de Plástico,Anyone liking this show weeds out all the corny ones automatically for me. Just like with J. Cole.  
Mar de Plástico,"I enjoyed Nola until the last episode. That seriously killed a lot of enthusiasm I had for the show. Even if you accept having that stupid turkey dinner, she basically tricked them into getting high and having an implied orgy. And then gets the girl at the end.

She wasn’t upfront once about what she meant by polyamorous because she made it sound casual between the other guys. She should have listened to her therapist and figured out how to have multiple lovers in a consensual way. It’s not like it’s impossible. 

This was originally a 9/10 and would’ve been up with the best Netflix originals. Unfortunately, it’s a 7/10 despite its cinematography, style, acting, directing and soundtrack being top-notch. 

Seriously, that’s one of the worst finales ever created, Spike Lee should have rewritten the ending from scratch. "
Mar de Plástico,"The album covers were actually one of the few things I liked about the show. Yes, they kind of interrupted the flow of the show, but I do like seeing exactly what I'm listening to, so I don't have to Shazam it during the show or look it up afterwards. "
Mar de Plástico,"I think Spike Lee also wanted to present the album art, which is an item that has sort of been lost in time. "
Mar de Plástico,"To preface my comment, I am a man, but I think there is a problem here. First of all, I agree that being sexual isn't a man's thing, and I'm not sure who is quoted as saying this but I think they are becoming fewer by the day (fortunately).  

It is one thing to be a sexual person without apology (a right both men and women have), but her method is where you lose me. She takes gifts, for the most part she lacks transparency with the men, and she does things like inviting all of them over for thanksgiving without them having knowledge of each other. Especially that last part is just kind of fucked up. 

I don't think she ever truly found fault in herself for any of her problems. It was always someone else's fault, and when her friends are trying to push her career she so desperately wants along, she gets mad at them too because it wasn't exactly how she wants it to be.  

So, really, I think it's great if she wants to be pansexual and polyamorous, but doing so doesn't take away her responsibility to these humans that she is taking to her 'loving bed'. 

You are right about Greer (who is most likely equally as culpable as Nola), and Jamie is just selfish. Mars is the only character who truly seems real oddly enough."
Mar de Plástico,"That was the original Nola, from the movie. "
Mar de Plástico,Agreed. The last time I heard people drop full film names and directors in conversation was at film school. Outside of that it comes across as pretty douchey if the other person in the convo isn’t also a film fan. 
Mar de Plástico,">She even takes advantage of the kindness of her therapist. Oh and her landlord.

Yes!! This also irked me. I think we're supposed to assume that she pays her therapist and landlord back with Catlett grant money?? 

> Greer is wholly unbelievable, every child actor was fairly awful.

OH GOD. Do you remember when Opal's daughter just straight up says ""I'm precocious!"" wtf. You don't write a precocious character to say they're precocious. Also, what she said didn't even fit in with the context of the scene. That's actually a major issue I had with the show. A LOT of telling (exposition) and not showing. 

Also, there's a serious lack of subtlety in the series. Everything is spelled out for you in big, bold speeches and letters. Like all the dress scenes were whack.All these men know who Nola is. It doesn't make much sense for them to police her fashion choices. 

 It's awkward to watch. 

>I haven't seen the source material so maybe there is something to this story I'm missing.

So I watched the movie afterwards! I personally think it's WAY more believable and realistic. Kinda boring (not as funny), but it was more like a ""slice of life"" than the show. It's a lot more subtle actually."
Mar de Plástico,"i just watched the original film after finishing the series.  there's a rape scene near the end with Nola and the Jamie Overstreet character.  apparently Spike Lee said that's the one thing he regrets about that piece, that he thought it was a joke or something... i was kinda horrified to watch that, and super glad that nothing like that took place in the modern series."
Mar de Plástico,">But I fucking hated Nolas character. And yes, I would've hated it also if she had been a man.

Yes. okay, so this needs to be addressed. If Nola were a guy, she would probably be just as, if not more annoying/unlikable. Yet the show just keeps using the idea that ""if Nola was a guy, she would be considered normal"" as a crutch. She's just so selfish and selfish isn't an attractive quality in anyone. I'm saying this as a woman, though. Maybe guys would view that differently (though I doubt it). 

When Nola finishes Greer's question of ""What kind of lady...?"" with ""...behaves like a man?"" in the Thanksgiving episode and all the guys change the subject, I really didn't understand it.

What kind of guy (person, really) throws a thanksgiving dinner and invites all their side chicks so they can ""get to know each other""? Who strings along all of their lovers making them all think they have a chance to be exclusive with them when that's not the case at all? A shitty person, that's who. And both men and women can be shitty. Maybe this premise made more sense in the 80s, but it seems outdated in 2017. "
Mar de Plástico,"What is this stringing along business you talk of? They knew what the deal was when they started hooking up with her. If they are getting stringed along, it is their fault. No one is forcing them to keep sleeping with her. 

Btw, I have only watched the first episode but that is how casual sex works no? If someone catches feelings, it is on them and they need to decide how they are going to deal with it. "
Mar de Plástico,"Thank you for taking the time to write that out. It’s nice to see it from another perspective. 

Overall, the show was very entertaining to watch, even with all of the criticisms I have for it. "
Mar de Plástico,Ooooohhhhhh huh. That's why it was kind of weird. Thanks!
Mar de Plástico,its because it oozes spike lee's ego.
Mar de Plástico,"> what she said didn't even fit in with the context of the scene

i thought what the (vegan!) kid said was spot-on: ""This other stuff doesn't fit in with yours.""  another way to look at that statement is, Nola's work doesn't fit in with the other artists'.  

This thought is repeated later in the art critic's review when he said ""Ms Darling's work is almost out of place, and overshadowed"" by the other artists."
Mar de Plástico,"Oh man, I feel like we are on the same frequency entirely. I just finished the last episode and thought, 'what the fuck was that?' 

I literally had to pause when she said the whole 'lady act like a man' thing. It's like, what universe is this girl living in where it's socially acceptable for anyone to spring a meeting of lovers on one another without their consent. I'm a guy and went in to this open minded about the whole polygamy take, but I have to imagine polygamists would be embarrassed by this portrayal. 

Had the roles been reversed and Jamie invited her to his Thanksgiving with his separated wife, I have a feeling Nola would have rightfully flipped her shit being put in such a combative situation. 

And you're totally right, it's like Nola *knows* these guys want her to be exclusive with them, but won't because, ""I won't let them own me.""

Cool. Do you girl. But stop fucking people who don't understand your lifestyle choice. It's their fault because they won't grasp monogomy is never going to be on the table , and her fault for not realizing they are not capable of the relationship she's asking them to be a part of. I understand it isn't her responsibility to make them accept her lifestyle , but as one half in whatever you would call their relationships, you would think she would care and be empathetic enough to not allow these men to string themselves on.

And what kind of pettiness was that blow up against Jamie for his check bouncing? I think it's beyond obvious that he paid 10k for that painting for Nola's benefit and not his own. And if she's deluded enough to think that his feelings had nothing to do with such a generous purchase price then she's more narcissistic than Greer. I get it, he bought it from you, it was for your work and you earned it. But the pretense of that sale were not just an exchange of hands of art. And her tantrum goes to illustrate that she's not willing to take Jamie's problems into consideration when everyone else jumps at the chance of considering hers. 

And holy shit when I found out she was 27?! She's a year older than me! I would expect such immature behavior from a 21 year old but come on lol. 

I understand Spike Lee is all about hyperbole and in-your-face lessons but I found the lessons to be rather narcissistic (it's okay to be a completely horrible excuse for a friend and lover as long as you maintain that you're an 'independent woman who don't need no man') and I think the hyperbole overshadowed any reasonable lessons that could have been communicated. 

I feel like this is a bougie depiction of a 'struggling artist' that doesn't actually have to struggle because there are safety nets everywhere (landlord, parents, 3dudes, Opal, etc.) that she claims to not need but that she leans on and relies on to solve her self-made problems in almost every situation she got herself into. 

Honestly I think Shemekka's character would have been more interesting, as she seems to actually have to struggle and rely on herself to make ends meet and while she goes down the wrong path with the injections, you see her progress as a character far more than Nola.

Edit: Curious to get your take on it, but do you think Nola would have given that 10k back had she not gotten the grant? In a TV show with a character that they obviously want to have ...well ...character (strong independence), I would expect she would still give it back, but based on the actions of Nola herself, I personally believe she would have kept it."
Mar de Plástico,"It's not just casual sex. And she is not honest about other men/women she sees, there's no transparency, even when someone asks for it. Sure, her rules, they agreed to them. But when she knows knows that these guys are falling for her hard, and she barely tries to make it clear to anyone that nothing more substantial will ever happen between them, and yet she still continues seeing them and acting like she has always before, she is being an asshole. She fucks with people and mistreats them every chance she gets, and then just goes and hides behind her ""I'm a strong black independent woman"" facade, as if that would make hurting people ok. "
Mar de Plástico,"> I'm a guy and went in to this open minded about the whole polygamy take, but I have to imagine polygamists would be embarrassed by this portrayal.

You're absolutely right, because here's the interesting thing - in the trailer, she says she's a ""sex-positive polyamorous pansexual.""

By definition, polyamory is ""the practice of or desire for intimate relationships with more than one partner, with the *knowledge of all partners*."" So, if Nola was truly polyamorous, she would have sat all of her lovers down way before the first episode and told them that she was polyamorous, wanted to be in a polyamorous relationship with all of them and made sure they consented to that before moving forward with them.

Polyamorous people are all about communicating and being transparent. Polyamory done right is making sure that everyone understands what's going on and is content with the idea that they are not their lover's only sexual partner. 

But Nola never does this, goddammit. It's not even clear whether any of the guys truly suspect that there is another guy(s) until Nola starts distancing herself from them. The whole thing is just really selfish and inconsiderate on her part, and I can't imagine any polyamorists being happy with this portrayal. 

>And what kind of pettiness was that blow up against Jamie for his check bouncing? I think it's beyond obvious that he paid 10k for that painting for Nola's benefit and not his own. And if she's deluded enough to think that his feelings had nothing to do with such a generous purchase price then she's more narcissistic than Greer.

OMG don't even get me started on that painting fiasco. She acted ridiculously entitled when that check bounced. 

What really pissed me off was how she wasn't even willing to *listen* to Jamie and truly understand his situation on that phone call. She just YELLED at him after he tried to do something unimaginably generous for her (because let's be honest, that painting is probably only worth the list of supplies used to create it, at least at this point in her career). She denies that he's a ""sugar daddy"" as Clo calls him, but that's exactly the kind of role he's playing and it makes me uncomfortable that she doesn't acknowledge or even realize that. 

If you just imagine for a second that Cheryl or Clorinda is the main character and Nola's a background character, most people would see this scenario as a grown, married man who is supporting his mistress's dreams by buying her worthless painting.

>Curious to get your take on it, but do you think Nola would have given that 10k back had she not gotten the grant?

No, because I don't think she considered it a loan. I got the impression that she saw Jamie's money as payment for her art. She seems a little delusional and narcissistic to me based on what I've seen so far, so I don't think she would have given back the money if she didn't get the grant.

Mar de Plástico,Okay. I think that is where my mistake lies. I thought it was just casual sex but it seems a bit more than that. Makes sense since the men bought her presents on her birthday. It just seems messy tbh. 
Mar de Plástico,"Thanks for taking the time to type out these responses ! But yeah I can't say much else other than I totally agree with everything you've brought up. 

I feel like this was supposed to be a story of a 'unapologetic independent black woman' when really it seemed to be a snapshot in time of a selfish and manipulative individual who retreats to the 'strong independent black woman' facade whenever she gets bored of someone. She's willing to tell everyone what her rules are, but too selfish to acknowledge that she's not willing to put in the work to establish consensual and healthy polyamorous relationships. She just fucks who she wants, when she wants, where she wants (every time she called it her 'Lovin Bed' I nearly broke my back cringing) with no regard for anyone's feelings but her own. I'm all for being a free-spirit, but there should be a way to live your truth without being an awful human being about it, then trying to excuse it by making sweeping generalizations about how men use women also.

Maybe I would have been more on board if Jamie, Greer and Mars were actually the tropes of 'possessive and oppressive' men that it was obviously trying to rail against, but her explosive reaction to every misstep each of them has just invalidates any point that could have been made  and underlines the one-sidedness of these relationships. 

Overall for me I came out feeling kinda gross cause it was like you were supposed to support Nola based on the fact that she was a woman, the fact she is black, and the 'perception' she is independent but not based on **Nola** the individual. 

That being said I might cringe-watch season 2 lol. It's not a terrible show, it was interestingly shot and the character of Mars was fun to watch, I just hope they realize being black and a woman isn't a substitute for a substantiative character."
Mar de Plástico,Messy is probably the best descriptor for all of this.
Mar de Plástico,"There doesn't seem to be much interest in the US for non-english speaking TV. IMDB, which is more international than RT, doesn't have that much reviews either."
Mar de Plástico,I'm in the US and love foreign tv. I use The Guardian and Telegraph to read tv reviews. Obviously they cover UK shows but they'll also review a lot of Euro/Scandi TV. 
The Crown,"I'm only 3 episodes in, and there's no doubt she resembles Diana...but holy smokes, she absolutely nailed Diana's speaking voice. It's so spot on."
The Crown,Isn’t she the gold lady from Guardians vol 2?
The Crown,"I randomly met her in Chicago once. Picked up her, Jacki Weaver and Lucas Haas while driving uber. They were in Chicago filming a movie. 

Elizabeth is so nice it's unbelievable, as was Jacki. Lucas was just quiet. 

And yes. In person Elizabeth is just as beautiful and incredibly tall. Jacki was like a sweet grandma and listening to their thick Australian accents were lovely to listen to."
The Crown,I've said it before and I'll say it again...Debicki always gives it all to every character she plays.
The Crown,"Honestly the woman who plays Camilla knocked it out of the park as well. 

This whole season is full of amazing casts. Elizabeth, Diane, Camilla, Mohamed Fayed, Phillip and the lady who played Margaret. That scene where she confronts Elizabeth about how she took a life of happiness away from her was so good."
The Crown,"Even if the season is highly divisive whether the plot, pacing, screenplay, or some of the character's acting (looking at you Philip and Charles), no one can deny in critics and fans that the standout for this season is Elizabeth Debicki as Diana. Hope she can win the acclaim she deserves."
The Crown,"Having recently watched the show, it's too sensationalist for my liking, but the main actors are all generally incredible. I saw some candid clips of young Queen Elizabeth on youtube and was shocked to see how much Claire Foy nailed her overall vibe."
The Crown,"As a viewer it's not important that Debicki is a towering 6'3""/190cm, but it does make it sort of comical to pretend that you could mistake her for the real Diana in person.

Just marketing fluff though, I know."
The Crown,Would pay good money to see a movie with her as Diana and Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth. Two hours of just the two of them talking back and forth with Charles cowering in the corner.
The Crown,"“Oh hai, Diana”"
The Crown,"I worked on a theatre show with her and Mark Strong a little before she broke through and she was lovely. Same came into the same theatre a few years later because Vanessa Kirby was doing a show and they’re mates, and a few of us ran into her and she remembered us all, which was nice."
The Crown,Charles III going to die from watching this season lol. Onto William I suppose.
The Crown,She is so great (and I know we use the word Great a lot but here it's for real) it gave me goosebumps. As someone else mentioned ED is the highlight of this season and imo she gives one of the best actings of recent years.
The Crown,she has the longest neck in hollywood
The Crown,"While I have only watched S1 of this series, I love the approach to recasting, i.e. not being afraid to use different actors. I vastly prefer this approach to the trend of digitally aging, de-aging or simply recreating a specific single actor (nearly) every time."
The Crown,It was awesome when she made Tom swallow his own load. So hot.
The Crown,Debicki is the best.
The Crown,[I’d like to think that Anthony Edwards’ portrayal of Diana on Saturday Night Live was the definitive one.](https://archive.org/details/saturday-night-live-s-21-e-07-anthony-edwards-foo-fighters?utm_source=pocket_mylist&start=3205)
The Crown,My wife and I are *madly* in love with this actress.
The Crown,"I'm sure Debicki is lovely, but I just can't get over her sharp features and narrow jaw in relation to Diana's lovely soft features. She just doesn't do it for me. 
As far as the portrayal of our Beloved Princess, at least from this American's viewpoint, I loathe that the series makes her look pathetically depressed, self absorbed, whiney, etc. She may have had small elements of those problems but her whole being wasn't consumed by the loneliness and depression. She gave so very much to our world, if she were consumed with herself she would not have been able to give so much. One can only give what they possess, so think about that..."
The Crown,"She's brilliant in Widows where she steals every single scene she's in, which is a shit movie otherwise."
The Crown,Like being in Tommy Wiseau’s “The Room” with Diana?
The Crown,"Excited to see the show because I've mostly loved it so far

I just really think Diana gets way too much pity in popculture and the fervor around reminds me of some weird peoples obsession with marie antoinette (oh no not the rich aristocrat living in luxury at the expense of dying poor people). What she did with the AIDS patients was phenomenal, but everything regarding her relationship with royalty to me was a lot of 'I deserve to be rich and famous and they won't let me.' Felt very narcissistic to hear a 30+ year old woman say ""I just want to be the queen of peoples hearts"" when it was clear she really wanted to be royalty and all the priveleges that come with it.

Obviously the royal family were awful to her, I don't doubt that either. It just bothers me that another person might be like ""right then fuck this fuck yall goodbye"" like yknow... prince harry. but instead diana played up the victim framing, acting like they were denying her something she was owed, and simultaneously wanting to be part of the family while denouncing them.

but the aids hospital thing was amazing. I dunno. diana was a controversial person."
The Crown,"It's pretty wild that princess Diana gets portrayed by like 3 different people every single year lmao, gotta be coming up on the record for historical figures with the most on screen depictions"
The Crown,"No matter how good Debicki is, Emma Corrin was perfect in the role.  Really wish they had kept her around."
The Crown,Looks like Leslie Knope.
The Crown,that picture looks like a snl parody
The Crown,It wasn’t. Their wasn’t this genuine sadness and care Diana had that you could feel despite it being nothing but a recording
The Crown,"Diana being too tall in season 5 shouldn't be more distracting than Diana being too short in season 4, but, and I'm sorry to say this, it is. Whenever I see Elizabeth Debicki towering over every man in the show, it weirds me out and makes it impossible for me to think of her as Diana. I admit this may just be a me thing."
The Crown,Before zooming in I thought that was Nancy from Stranger Things.
The Crown,"I hate every portrayal I’ve seen of Diana, including this one. They all seem like caricatures."
The Crown,"How come no one is saying anything about how they don’t portray the Royal family’s racism. 

4/10 doesn’t respect the source material."
The Crown,Well I’ve only watched half the season so far but TBH I don’t agree with the praise around her. Every scene with her I’ve seen so far just felt so wooden. Actually that’s the season so far for me other than the third episode which is the best episode so far and it’s not even close. The whole cast for the royal family for season five feel like a cast of side characters and no one has stood out. Even the episode where the focused on Dominic West as Charles felt like he was the side character in the episode.
The Crown,"ummm


no"
The Crown,"Cool, more Netflix astroturfing on Reddit."
The Crown,There's so much propaganda in article form for this terrible show.
The Crown,Enduring this new season rn.  Who knew she suffered so much with bulemia and suicide attempts.   I can’t even believe in a few more episodes she’s gonna be in “ a bad wreck”  ffs
The Crown,Shame the show is such a snooze fest. Maybe remake that awful Kristin Stewart movie with her instead
The Crown,She looks like an SNL version of Diana.
The Crown,This is the craziest crossover Nancy from Stranger Things has done yet.
The Crown,I think Kristen Stuart would have been better
The Crown,"Yes, impressive, but she is taller."
The Crown,How many fuckin projects need to have a portrayal of princess diana in them
The Crown,[deleted]
The Crown,Too skinny.
The Crown,Even harder to do without having a primary to follow and observe
The Crown,Did they use forced perspective like in LOTR?
The Crown,Well yeah no duh cause Elizabeth Debicki is a freakin goddess
The Crown,I think it’s time I finally watch this show
The Crown,I love this show so much.
The Crown,I find it ridiculous that the won’t be doing a scene of her death in the show. Cowards choice
The Crown,She is one of the most charming and talented people I've ever seen
The Crown,I’m so excited for new episodes of parks and Rec! Amy Poehler is looking good!
The Crown,ED is like 7 feet tall though. She can play Brittany Grenier in the inevitable movie!... She's a very good actress.
The Crown,And the weird way Diana would stand to try to look smaller
The Crown,Three episodes in? I thought they were only releasing 1 episode a week? Am I behind?
The Crown,She was also the glamorous villain from the Man from UNCLE.
The Crown,My favorite performance of hers is Jordan Baker in The Great Gatsby
The Crown,"She was also in The Night Manager with Tom Hiddleston, Hugh Laurie, Olivia Coleman and Tom Hollander."
The Crown,She’s in Christopher Nolan’s [Tenet](https://youtu.be/AZGcmvrTX9M) (2020) as one of the leads!
The Crown,Yup
The Crown,Based on these comments it sounds like everyone missed her amazing performance in Widows (2018).  Honestly one of the best movies of that year.
The Crown,She’s in Widows too 👀
The Crown,She's back in vol 3 as well!
The Crown,I remember her channeling my Blood Echoes in *Bloodborne* but maybe it’s a different person
The Crown,Also one of the main characters in Widows
The Crown,"She was great in The Kettering Incident, which shamefully never got to follow up on its great season 1 ending"
The Crown,Great villain in Man from UNCLE. Super sexy alongside Henry Cavill.
The Crown,yes and she'll be in GOtG vol 3 too!
The Crown,I thought you meant Diana and my mind instantly went “Uber? Diana?” 🫣😅
The Crown,was this recent? because she must be filming crown season 6 right now and not a movie
The Crown,Her upcoming Rosa Parks biopic shall be her finest hour
The Crown,I went to uni with her. Even back then she had such a star quality.
The Crown,Leslie Manville as Margaret was amazing. Such a great actress.
The Crown,"Dominic West as Prince Charles! I’m very interested to see that performance (Netflix hasn’t released it here yet, ugh!)"
The Crown,"It's Jonathan Pryce playing Phillip, can't really get a better old man actor at the moment I'd say, aside from Anthony Hopkins.

Both play amazingly opposite each other in The Two Popes."
The Crown,Ngl I forgot Imelda Staunton was umbride in the first five seconds she appeared on screen. I was worried I would be able to stop seeing her as unbridged but she's such a good actress and they made her up so good I completely forgot
The Crown,"Dominic West may not look like Charles but I feel like he perfectly captured Charles's mannerisms and persona.


And Staunton has been perfect. Olivia Colman was great but Staunton's Elizabeth actually feels a direct continuation of Claire Foy's portrayal. It genuinely feels like Claire Foy's Elizabeth will transform into Staunton's Elizabeth 40 years later."
The Crown,"> or some of the character's acting (looking at you Philip and Charles)

I do love Jonathan Pryce, but I have to admit he really just feels like Jonathan Pryce in this and not really at all like Prince Philip (either as the real life version or as a continuation of Smith and Menzies) aside from the fact that he keeps his hand behind his back when he walks."
The Crown,The actor they picked for Philip doesn't look like him at all.
The Crown,"Nope. 

It's a decent impersonation but mediocre acting by Debicki. She's is basing her whole performance on Dianas' interview with Martin Bashir. So in this show, Diana talks like she did on TV in private with the Prime Minister, her husband, her kids etc."
The Crown,"Whoever is doing the accent training is absolutely nailing it for everybody. If you close your eyes and hear Claire Foy or Staunton speak in the show you can literally picture the actual Elizabeth speaking. 

For that this show is top notch."
The Crown,I like it just because I’ve been used to just seeing sycophantic BBC portrayals of the ‘royals’ where they can do no wrong. Makes for a refreshing change that the warts and all are finally shown.
The Crown,"One thing I thought was cool about Tenet was that they made absolutely no attempt to hide the height difference between her and John David Washington. Usually there's shoe lifts or camera tricks or even platforms, but Tenet? Nothing."
The Crown,"wasn’t it a pretty similar situation with Churchill in season 1? The man was like 5’6 apparently, and yet John Lithgow is a whopping 6’4. That’s a 10 inch difference! (pardon my use of imperial)"
The Crown,Diana was quite tall tho — 5’10”
The Crown,"I haven't watched this season yet, but does it look like they pulled any camera tricks to make her look a little shorter or just closer to everyone else's height?"
The Crown,"Yeah my first thought was, come on she can't be *that* bad."
The Crown,V
The Crown,"Agreed! I think it’s much more fun to see different actors with different takes on the same character. Plus, I can’t unsee Robert De Niro digitally deaged but moving like an old, old man in the Irishman. I recently watched The Godfather 2 and the difference between how he actually physically moved and carried himself when he was young, and how he moved in The Irishman, is absolutely enormous."
The Crown,I feel like we were watching different shows…
The Crown,That was a different actress
The Crown,You what?
The Crown,"She was so good in that role, Christopher Nolan basically copied that character of hers and was put in Tenet as Kat. She's good at playing wives of gangsters, arms dealers and now royal princes."
The Crown,Different actress hoss
The Crown,Her brother is Earl Spencer. They’re upper class of the aristocracy.
The Crown,"Well, prince Harry did something very similar actually, a 30+ year man complaining that his family doesn't give him money anymore because he doesn't work for them... it's... something...

But yeah, princess Diana was controversial, people act like she is a Saint, but she was complex, she was a real person, with flaws and very good things too. If you are into podcasts, I would recommend you to listen to the series of princess Diana of You're Wrong About, they make such a good portrait of all of her life, without leaving the nasty side of it, but making it so much human."
The Crown,"Before she died, she also called for an international ban on landmines. Sorry just wanted to add that."
The Crown,"tf are you talking about?

There have only been 3 in the past 3 years. Emma Corrin played teen Diana in The Crown, now Debicki plays the adult. Prior to Kristen Stewart's ""Spencer"" in 2021, the last time Princess Diana was portrayed on-screen was Naomi Watts in 2013."
The Crown,she would look too young for 90s diana
World of Winx,"The show was canceled, and there won't be a third season at Netflix. I think it was confirmed in 2019, but not sure on that."
World of Winx,I feel like the author needs to either watch or address shows like *Invincible* or *Pantheon*.
World of Winx,I really love Vox Machina.  So glad we already know it will have a third season!
World of Winx,Anime Watchers: What gap??
World of Winx,"Absolutely love this show, it’s just so much fun with great characters and voice acting and amazing fight scenes"
World of Winx,Undone was the shit
World of Winx,Really feel the same way about it. The earnestness is what sets it apart for me. It wears its heart entirely on its sleeve from moving emotional moments of growth to the kind of raunchy jokes and swearing people rattle off with their real friends. It feels far more real.
World of Winx,"It's fun. Too much toilet Humor at times but it's a nice destraction from the usual doom and gloom stuff.

The characters are assholes sometimes but not *all* of them and not *all* the time.

The world is colourful and bright."
World of Winx,"Just finished the first season. Its ok... Nothing really spectacular storywise and the animations are a bit weak.

It might be because I've just finished shows like Invincible, Castlevania, and Arcane. But this pales in comparison. As someone not familiar with Critical Role, there's nothing I've gathered from the first season to make me care about the characters or the world."
World of Winx,"It’s ok, but got tired of them trying too hard to be “adult” with the jokes, sex references and swear words. Like calm TF down and let your story breathe, folks."
World of Winx,"It's become one of my favourite series of many many years.

Love the animation style, the characters, the silly jokes. I love videogames and medieval fantasy and we don't get many shows like it.

I had no idea what critical role even was before to be honest."
World of Winx,"It kind of feels like ""Western anime"", to me. In that it's a lot of fun, but it *does* feel like it sticks to themes of ""the power of friendship"" a bit *too* much. Like... sometimes, it feels like they sort of achieve things through sheer power of *emotions*, rather than tactics.

I also feel like, as fun as the action *looks*, it sometimes feels a bit like visual-noise. I'm kind of a novice when it comes to tabletop RPG's, and my father (who I've been watching it with) had never played one (though he's a big fan of MMORPG's), and it doesn't feel like there's any sort of consistency on how powerful these characters are or what they can do? I don't need hard ""power-levels"" or anything, but it's just hard understanding where these characters are in relation to the world around them. They seem effectively demigods sometimes, and then relatively ""normal"" other times.

Overall though, it's been fun.

My only two criticism are A) they lean *super* hard into ""this character is on the verge of death! wait, not really, they're totally fine"". Like... it felt like almost every episode. A part of me actually *wants* a character to die -- not because I don't like any of them, but because it's a cheap writing tactic to get people invested, and they've done it so much that it feels like there are no stakes. Either stop doing the ""fake-out"", or actually kill somebody.

The other criticism, for me, mainly concerns Vax (I think? the male twin). I get Critical Role is all about being super inclusive, that's something baked-into the world they've made. For a lot of folks, and probably the creators themselves, that's part of the appeal. But it creates for kind of a confusing world when seemingly everyone is attracted to everyone else, and in the case of him specifically, I feel like it's created a situation where I don't understand what the relationship dynamics are supposed to be. It feels... inconsistent. The characters can all be Bi, that's fine, but just help us understand what their relationships are, to each other and to other recurring characters."
World of Winx,"Yeah honestly it rubs me the wrong way that invincible came out first but vox got a s2 first.

Also I would probably put this lower than shows like invincible, Castlevania, Primal, and arcane. STILL really fantastic, but idk that's just me."
World of Winx,"Easily one of the best animated shows I’ve seen. Considering that the original goal was one 22-minute special episode for longtime fans, the actual outcome is phenomenal. It’s amazing to see this love project become so successful. All of my love to the Critical Role Fam."
World of Winx,Huge gap??
World of Winx,"It's thoroughly okay, in all aspects. Fun time-filler but I wouldn't call it exemplary in any regard."
World of Winx,world??? lol. japan put 20 anime a season. Gtfo.
World of Winx,Vox Machina is just flat out a really good show.  I'm not a D&D guy at all and just randomly popped the show on one day and have been hooked.  Can't wait for season 3!
World of Winx,"Great show, definitely recommend it"
World of Winx,"It is… okay. Lotta fan service that cuts into the show. I wouldn’t call it bad, but I really can’t suggest it to anyone who isn’t a fan of the stream."
World of Winx,This show is so amazing
World of Winx,I had no idea that it was based on a D&D campaign. The table to screen compilations are 🔥🔥🔥
World of Winx,I completely agree with the author! I love animated sci-fi and fantasy but typically these stories star teens. Matter of fact my husband has started teasing me about watching high schoolers save the world. It is not my fault that most things that fall into this category follows teenage protagonists. Things like Vox Machina and Lower Decks are a breath of fresh air for me! I get my animated sci-fi/fantasy with adult protagonists that I can identify with more and not so much of the goofy ridiculousness as you would find in things like Family Guy and Rick and Morty. I hope more stories like these start coming out cause I am here for it!
World of Winx,What gap ?
World of Winx,So many better shows than vox.
World of Winx,"I dont know if I've just only seen shitty scenes from it, but the dialog is increadibly cringe in that show."
World of Winx,"Just finished season 2. Would highly recommend.

It's got great voice acting, great art and superb story.

Can't wait for season 3."
World of Winx,Second season is even better than the first one.
World of Winx,"Such a fun show, I hope it has a nice long run great really funny and a great fantasy show"

World of Winx,"It’s genuinely just a fun show. Saw S1 when I had no real idea what Critical Role was, and was only vaguely aware of what DnD itself was or how it worked, but still enjoyed it a lot. 

Didn’t care much for the humor early on, especially in the first couple episodes- it actually reminded me a lot of the first couple episodes of Harley Quinn in how it just front loaded as much profanity, gore and sex jokes as possible. But it balances out over S1 and Season 2’s humor is, while still raunchy at times, far better balanced the same way Harley evened out. 

It’s definitely not a straight up grimly beautiful drama like Arcane. But its heavy enough to have substance while never being outright dour. It reminds me a lot of older scifi/fantasy adventure shows like Stargate, Farscape or Xena in how it has its heavier moments but there never stops being an underlying feeling of fun to it all, like it never takes itself too seriously. The kind of thing you put on and just have a good time with. 


I’d easily put it on par with later Castlevania seasons. Not as good as that shows first Dracula arc, but better than the subsequent ones. Vox Machina also seems to improve with every new batch of episodes as well. 

Id say its worth checking out for anyone who enjoys fantasy, and particularly found family stories, but isnt strictly looking for a pure drama."
World of Winx,Just finished season 2 last night. It's a good show.
World of Winx,"I enjoy the show to an extent but I feel like it is fueled by tropes and stereotypes. When an epsidoe begins, you almost immediately will know how it will end. I also hate how death is nothing in this show. And the modern spin coating everything is tiresome. I mean jesus... Grog is now just ""god of war"" but weaker and dumber. 

Amazon is afraid to get really creative. They play it too safe even in their great tv shows like The Boys or The Expanse."
World of Winx,"As far as original shows go, it's certainly up there as a fantastic addition to streaming shows. Definitely one I didn't expect to enjoy as much after so many other stinkers."
World of Winx,In the American view of the animation world.... Jesus.
World of Winx,"I’m really enjoying Vox Machina, but it’s not “filling a huge gap” when there are tons of Japanese anime shows right now that honestly blow US cartoons out of the water.

Modern Western cartoon is honestly bare bone when it comes to finding good shows that isn’t shitty adult comedy/ Rick and Morty clones. They just never want to branch out to different genres and keep doing the same stuff over and over again. It’s either comedy or fantasy action, that’s it."
World of Winx,Best show of the year so far
World of Winx,"This show is actually very mediocre.

if ""ehh"" was an animated TV show, this would be it"
World of Winx,"To it’s credit I did finish the 1st season, but I just felt like it was so corny. Like I want American FMA, HxH, Monster, Berserk… not this."
World of Winx,"Pantheon 

Primal

Invincible

Castlevania 

*gestures vaguely at anime*"
World of Winx,Arcane is amazing.
World of Winx,Bruh how can this be adult animation with no comedic gore or gross humor
World of Winx,I completely agree with the author! I love animated sci-fi and fantasy but typically these stories star teens.

World of Winx,"Vox is fun. That means a lot. Doesn't take itself seriously. Action, comedy, adventure, absurd musical numbers, and fisting jokes. Perfect TV"
World of Winx,What’s the show about?
World of Winx,"I really hope culture changes enough in the next years so that people don't write embarrassing shit like this anymore. ""Saving a fantastical world with the power of friendship isn’t just for kids."" *Yes, it is.*"
World of Winx,Primal was fucking great too
World of Winx,Don't forget Castlevania. I'm excited about that sequel series they revealed.
World of Winx,"Those are coming-of-age stories with teenage protagonists, which is precisely what the author of the article *isnt* referring to in the title. 

VM is ""special"" because it has a cast of adult characters with adult humor going around fantasy land and saving everyone. Most shows with a similar premise tend to feature, like I mentioned, teenage casts and coming-of-age stories. Castlevania is the big exception, but it ofc has a very different tone to VM."
World of Winx,PANTHEON!! Totally got screwed by it’s platform. If it was on a bigger/more accessible service that shit would have blown up.
World of Winx,Then on top of those two you also have Dota: Dragon's Blood and Dragon Age: Absolution over at Netflix. I guess Arcane is more YA than adult aimed but it is definitely serialised fantasy in animation.
World of Winx,[deleted]
World of Winx,"They didn’t pay for an article, fuck em."
World of Winx,And Pantheon got cancelled despite being awesome.
World of Winx,RIP Pantheon.
World of Winx,Arcane?
World of Winx,"The author is an idiot, but this comment is hilarious because it's the most upvoted and yet dumbs down the conversation so much. Now we have to take a step back and explain to this smug poster what ""coming of age"" means"
World of Winx,Don’t forget King of the Hill
World of Winx,"I feel like you should read the article, the author has seen those shows:

> The Legend of Vox Machina is not the first of these shows, but it is the one that made me realize just how wide the gap between Steven Universe and Rick and Morty is."
World of Winx,"to be fair she said ""fantasy animation by adults for adults"" while invincible is a superhero show and pantheon is science fiction."
World of Winx,Also that they're working on Mighty Nein as well.
World of Winx,"Critical Role gets a lot of love, and rightly so, but the space for actual play D&D style games has really blossomed ( partly because of CR).

My personal favorite is dimension 20 -- relatively high production values and a cast with a comedy background.

So if people want more of that sort of story telling and are willing to take a chance on medium, check out a few actual play shows and see if one tickles your fancy"
World of Winx,They really have started to create harry potter levels of empire.
World of Winx,"To be fair the article does touch on that, even though a lot of anime is more willing to be mature a huge chunk of the mainstream ones are ultmately still coming of age stories about children, and a lot of these are still definitely aimed at children, we're just able to enjoy it too. One example I think about is how both Naruto and Ben 10 gradually aged up the cast, and once the cast got old enough instead of making a show about the adult cast they just reset to being about kids. 

Which isnt to say there's nothing like that in anime, I havent started new Trigun but old Trigun was definitely in that niche of action based fantasy/sci fi story about friendship. There is a lot if you search for it though I suspect the average anime fan just watches the most popular shows to come out each year like cartoon fans do. I also feel like a lot of mature anime about adults ends up not being action at all, Oddtaxi was amazing but I dont know if I'd say its comparable to The Owl House."
World of Winx,"It seems like no one in this thread has actually read the article. The article is specifically talking about how VM is unique by being a high fantasy adventure comprised entirely of adult characters with no coming-of-age plotlines.

There are bound to be *some* animes that do fit that bill, but most anime fans will agree that the vast majority (especially the most popular) don't. Some fantasy seinen have mostly adult protagonists and themes, but almost always also have extremely dark tones and settings that Vox Machina avoids. They also rarely get any attention in the west, which is dominated by shounen."
World of Winx,"The gap of non-ecchi anime.

I know some people can accept sexualized anime, but most of it is trash and feels very pedo. Girls who look childish but are “hundred year old demons” or whatever is fucking gross.

Even Your Name, brilliant until the end, all of a sudden up skirt shot at the end “but it was a boy in a girls body.” Fucking pervs."
World of Winx,Shows that don’t have characters that need to go on internal monologues about how they need to be stronger and have more willpower for a decent 20% of the show’s total runtime in the voice registry of a 7 year old boy
World of Winx,Cartoons
World of Winx,"Agree, the fight scenes are epic, especially the ones in the S2 premiere and the last three eps.  I really liked the character arcs for Vax, Grog, and Scanlan this season, too.  They are all great voice actors, especially the guy who plays Scanlan.  His musical numbers are always so much fun.  He is a terrific singer!"
World of Winx,"A shame the entire underdark got skipped, i liked the dwarf city and the party ""friend"" they picked up. Guess they didn't want more stuff with the dragonborn sorcerer"
World of Winx,"For sure, but rotoscope is kind of on the edge…"
World of Winx,"The moment that really really sold me on the show was in episode 3 when >!Percy had a panic attack after seeing the Briarwoods and the whole crew came together, no jokes, no banter, and asked what they can do to help him. 
I was a little worried the show was gonna be a bunch of troppy assholes arguing the whole show, and had already written off Grog and Percy as 1-note, but that moment made me fall in love with the whole team. Percy and Vex are fucking adorable together!<"
World of Winx,"I just wish they'd do a bit more show don't tell.

The last few episodes were at some points kind of ridiculous when it comes to flashbacks during pivotal character moments. You'd have long flashbacks to scenes that happened only one or two episodes ago."
World of Winx,"Yeah, they did it their way. There aren’t corpo shills telling them, “no, we can’t have Scanlan sing about anal beads or masturbation.” They gleefully and accurately translate the spirit of that game into the cartoon. =)"
World of Winx,"See I’ve never watched/listened to Critical Role either, but I loved the first season! I wasn’t expecting it to be groundbreaking or anything, just wanted to have a fun experience and that’s exactly what it delivered."
World of Winx,"Did you really just compare the animation to invincible?? Where they literally had some of the hero’s moving through still shots? Don’t get me wrong, I liked the show, but vox machinas animation was MUCH better than invincible; which was clearly rushed."
World of Winx,"Speaking as a fan of CR, the first season of Legends of Vox Machina mildly sucked, especially compared to other adult animated shows, like Invincible and Arcane.

The second season is much better.  Sadly, I don't think very many people are going to get through the first season with any impetus to watch on."
World of Winx,"okay there's not much that can compare to Arcane, that's an unfair expectation"
World of Winx,"I finished the second season. The show feels like it was written for CR fans, and no one else. The show starts with an already established group with characters in the middle of their own characters arcs. The second season is better, only for the fact the characters are a little more established. Otherwise,  you're correct, you have no reason to care about any of the characters"
World of Winx,This is true the animation isnt great
World of Winx,"It's essentially just a show based on scripted RP. No matter how vehemently the fan base screams that it's all organic you can definitely tell they've been workshopping their material with each other and coming with up bits to do together. It's scripted, workshopped, rewritten, and practiced. Both CR and the show by extension get a lot of leeway with various aspects of their performance because it's all supposed to be made up on the spot and you can tell it's just not. That's not a deal breaker for a lot people but it is for others. 

It's very average and pretty derivative (ie they have a character whose entire concept is ""Sokka but he gets laid"")."
World of Winx,I feel like season one was kinda meh but season two is considerably better because it actually has character development for everyone.
World of Winx,I must have been sick or something the week I watched Arcane.  Do not understand the hype at all.
World of Winx,"I am pretty sure the source material had even more, just more improvised"
World of Winx,Most scenes with that unfunny gnome make me want to drop the series.
World of Winx,"Surprisingly the music is really fucking good too, Adds lots of point sin my book"
World of Winx,"I tried getting into the show recently myself and I pretty much agree with that. Though I thought their horny for everyone thing was just them making fun of the decades old trope of every d&d campaign always having at least one guy that tries to sleep with everyone and everything and use charm for everything  (which in my gaming in middle and high school was certainly on point). 

But yeah the show overall reminded me of Saturday morning cartoons from the 90s. Not the good ones, but the stuff like Captain planet. I would definitely say we need more animation like that today. It's definitely not anime and its not adult animation, it's more like the older cartoons and that's pretty cool tbh.

Also I haven't read the article fwiw."
World of Winx,">My only two criticism are A) they lean *super* hard into ""this character is on the verge of death! wait, not really, they're totally fine"". Like... it felt like almost every episode. A part of me actually *wants* a character to die -- not because I don't like any of them, but because it's a cheap writing tactic to get people invested, and they've done it so much that it feels like there are no stakes. Either stop doing the ""fake-out"", or actually kill somebody.

A lot of this is down to the source material being a D&D game. Because... yeah, nearly every big fight, at least one character was on the verge of death. If that wasn't the case, the game wouldn't have been fun to play. Additionally, >!they *did* kill a character this season - but of course, she was resurrected, because that's something that can happen in D&D.!<

They could definitely work on being more creative with the stakes, but when you have a character in the party that can literally magically heal just about any wound/injury, the stakes do have to be pretty high for there to be any tension."
World of Winx,"eh, Legend of Vox Machina season 1 was funded by kickstarter, and Amazon came in 2019 to boost the season 1 funding and give the second season. Invincible released in 2021 - while LoVM release was delayed to 2022 - but LoVM could go straight into production for season 2 with no downtime once the writers etc were done with their portions for season 1."
World of Winx,"Personal opinion, animated superhero shows aren't something new, we have tons of them.

Not interested in invincible because it's too violent for my taste.

But a medieval fantasy animated show? We have way less of those. The ones I remember now are DOTA, the Witcher animated movie, castlevania and dragon age absolution. And I loved all of those.

Also I love toilet humor, what can I say. I might be 40, but my friends and I still joke with that. So it's nice and refreshing when most adult cartoons in that style are a bit overly doom and gloom."
World of Winx,"Let’s be real Amazon has the money to produce both at once, it was probably more a matter of choice considering how well received Invincible was and scheduling conflicts. I know Seth Rogan is a minor VA in it, and I think he also participates in writing and directing. I think it’s the same thing for The Boys. When Amazon has a banger of a show they typically know to keep it going and how to do so successfully despite some of the shitty adaptations. 

I mean didn’t The Expanse get picked up and flooded with cash because it’s a book Bezos enjoys? They do have big IPs they’ve made flop, so they aren’t even close to infallible, but they seem to do well with the content they manage to get roots in the ground for."
World of Winx,"yikes, you must be never see damn thing else then. poor soul"
World of Winx,"I know it doesnt bother some anime fans but sexualizing little girls is a big turnoff for most people not desensitized to it through years of anime watching. Its why anime like Attack on Titan and Demon Slayer break through to mainstream pop culture once in awhile; but the larger volume of series with names like ""my little sister is sexually frustrating me"" get ignored"
World of Winx,"Yeah  
he's crying ""oh, we finally have a adult animated show""  
Wait, do you think stuff like Black Lagoon are for children ???  
Fuck, i am 45, and i still have a hard time watching the twins arc"
World of Winx,I mean anime is almost as bad as cartoons are in terms of the good:trash ratio.
The People v. O.J. Simpson,He was in prison for an entirely separate crime committed years later. 
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"When I first watched the ending episode to this show, I thought to myself. Imagine if this was all a fictional event. How would audiences react to the twist ending like that when it was so obvious he did it? "
The People v. O.J. Simpson,I'm surprised you didn't know the real verdict. You must be pretty young 
The People v. O.J. Simpson,Spoiler: he did it
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"Yeah rich people generally avoid justice by paying immoral lawyers to baffle juries.

The storyville documentary is worth watching even at 5 90min episodes"
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"What surprised me was that in the last monologue for arguably the main character of the show they decided to change the place she was raped from Israel to Italy... why? It seemed like a really odd choice in a show about a real life event to change something like that.


Legitimately the only reason I can think of to make that change is to not cast aspersions on Israel? Which is fucking dumb but I can't think of anything else."
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"This is such a great coincidence. I also read about his parole recently, so I started watching People v OJ Simpson, not knowing anything about the outcome. Great show though. "
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"Thanks for this post, I just finished it last night.  The series was really excellent and much better than I expected."
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"I watched it live. I had enough of it when it was on every channel for days and weeks on end. I have NO inclination to watch it as a ""show"". "
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"Same! When I watched it, I knew he was in jail so I was expecting a guilty verdict. "
The People v. O.J. Simpson,I loved how after he was found not guilty on the show the first commercial was [this.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Uyrcxa63ONU)
The People v. O.J. Simpson,I've binge watched the show recently for the first time and as you I didn't know much about the real life case. The show was spectacular.
The People v. O.J. Simpson,Those 3 were also my favorite things back then.
The People v. O.J. Simpson,The diner scene with the Kardashians was hilarious. It felt like it was just a giant ad for their worthless bullshit. I enjoyed the series/season though.
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"Spoiler: he did it, but he got away with it."
The People v. O.J. Simpson,He's also in prison for completely different crimes than what the show covers.
The People v. O.J. Simpson,You must be under the age of like 15.
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"It was really odd that Judge Ito didn't kiss his wife when she stopped by his office. For a show obsessed with racism, it was really telling that Hollywood didn't portray an asian male being affectionate to his white wife, nor did the show comment on jay Leon's the dancing itos, which was a racist attack against asian males since it feminized Ito, and asian males are thought of as emasculated compared to other races. "
The People v. O.J. Simpson,Shitpost. This has to be a shitpost.
The People v. O.J. Simpson,well i guess it wasnt ENTIRELY separate...he was trying to steal back memorabilia of his that he had to sell in order to cover the cost of his civil suit.
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"I liked the line by that one journalist ""This is insane! You couldn't get away with this plot twist in an airport paperback!"" 


It wasn't said about the final verdict, but it was super memorable."
The People v. O.J. Simpson,I thought the show did a pretty decent job setting up the circumstances and the social environment that led to his acquittal. 
The People v. O.J. Simpson,Yeah. Also not American.
The People v. O.J. Simpson,i was born in early 90's and not american. i have no clue who OJ Simpson was until this series got nominated for Emmy.
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"For people either very young or not yet born, their exposure:  there was a trial then and he's in jail now.

Not too surprising to expect a guilty verdict."
The People v. O.J. Simpson,That happened when I was in the sixth grade.  The announced it over the intercom school wide.
The People v. O.J. Simpson,Since when does that matter ? 
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"Immoral lawyers? You don't believe people accused of crimes should have the right to representation? If you hold lawyers accountable for what their clients are accused of, you're essentially saying that you don't believe in innocent until proven guilty."
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"I was there with it too.  They cut into the middle of one of my classes in high school so we could watch the verdict live.  Motherfucking Bronco chase interrupted an episode of the X-Files that I was really into.  

That said, it's a superb miniseries.  "
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"I was about 8 when it started and you could not escape the coverage, it was every where and got old so fast. My wife is a year older than me and made me watch the fx show with her, she didn't know anything about the case, I was like how!?! They had TVs in their house..."
The People v. O.J. Simpson,[deleted]
The People v. O.J. Simpson,Ok.
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"Me too man, but the American crime version is pretty entertaining.

Until you start getting to the end and remember this is a true story and what the fuck is wrong with our justice system etc etc etc then it gets depressing.

... Yeah, don't watch it actually."
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"thats EXACTLY how I felt, and it's why I avoided the series when it first aired last year.  But then I watched the whole thing in like 3 days and absolutely loved it lol."
The People v. O.J. Simpson,Did he?
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"The OJ Simpson trial was decided 21 years ago, and people who were born like 3 years before that won't have many memories of the trial. So really, it's not unreasonable for people under 25 to not know much about the case."
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"I don't think he wanted to sell it to pay the lawsuit, that sale wouldn't have even made a dent and even though the Goldman's receive 100% of the money made from his sports, TV, and whatever else dealings he makes/made I'm guessing that shit would have been an under the table cash sale made by one of his associates. You think he was actually considering armed robbery to get money just to pay them? "
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"that was my favorite line from the show too

sometimes reality really is stranger than fiction"
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"> ""This is insane! You couldn't get away with this plot twist in an airport paperback!""

When was that line said?"
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"Absolutely, there were so many driving factors in that case, internal and external, that influenced the case. The show handled it pretty well. "
The People v. O.J. Simpson,I urge you to watch OJ made in America it's like an 8 hour documentary in 5 parts
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"Same here. I knew his name but never really cared who he is. Whole history is so unbelievable - chase, home ""makeover"", gloves and whole plot twist with Mark Fuhrman and judges wife. It hit me harder every time I thought ""this really happened"". So fucked up that people celebrated murderer getting away with what he done, I know there were diffrent times and so much was happening in America but now looking back it's so wrong. "
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"It gets referenced A LOT in popular culture. But if you don't know about him or the case, the brain will just filter it out. I bet you will start to find his name everywhere now. Good ol' Baader-Meinhof!"
The People v. O.J. Simpson,Your spoiler tag just made me laugh
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"I'm about the same age as you and I only ever heard a single conversation about it when we were visiting my aunt one time, which she initiated. I don't think my parents must have followed it too closely or watched TV news, if they did they didn't talk to me about it. I was only interested in playing Super Nintendo, watching cartoons, or reading Goosebumps books, which allowed me to escape the coverage."
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"I was in 5th grade and our sub let us listen to it on the radio, but then the teacher came back before the verdict and everyone was pissed because we couldnt listen in lol."
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"Yes but its so ingrained into pop culture and our cultural zeitgeist that anyone thats been circling the sun for a decent amount of time should know the very basics of the case.

I was in 5th grade when the case was going on, i paid no attention to it, to a typical 5th grader thats not something that seems entertaining, but i still know all about it through pop culture and when watching the people vs. OJ i already knew alot more about the case than i thought."
The People v. O.J. Simpson,It's more likely that he felt entitled to his own trophies. He did assemble other men to do the job with him. Not the sort of thing you'd do for a quick smash and grab job meant to be fenced quickly to pay legal bills.
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"no youre misunderstanding me. He had to sell his memorabilia earlier to pay for the civil suit. THEN he felt cheated by that and wanted to steal it back, hence the robbery."
The People v. O.J. Simpson,In the episode where the judge almost had to recuse himself because of his wife's involvement in the tapes
The People v. O.J. Simpson,Academy Award win already convinced me. It's on the list.
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"After watching it I realized I saw the entire series in real time from the Bronco to the verdict and I don't think there was any part of the documentary I didn't already know and fully experience over the course of the  1 1/2 years. 

EDIT. I am talking about the ESPN documentary, not the Made in America series. "
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"What if you watched the documentary first?  Is it still worth it to watch American Crime Story?  I feel like the story was explained pretty well in the doc, I'm not sure how much a dramatized version would be able to add to the doc, not to mention that I suspect the scope of the show is much narrower than the documentary was.  "
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"> So fucked up that people celebrated murderer getting away with what he done, I know there were diffrent times and so much was happening in America but now looking back it's so wrong.

Is it really any different than where we are now?"
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"You also should review his career in sports too, to really give this whole situation perspective and why the public was so fascinated with the story. "
The People v. O.J. Simpson,Yeah I watched it last night and I get why people were celebrating but it still made me cringe.
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"Yeah, you're right he probably felt the same kind of entitlement to those trophies as he did the woman he abused and brutally murdered."
The People v. O.J. Simpson,Move it up your list - it's amazing!
The People v. O.J. Simpson,It's phenomenal.
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"Did you know...?

**Spoiler**

Titanic sinks at the end of the film!"
The People v. O.J. Simpson,I'd say so yeah 
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"I meant LA Riots but I guess you are right, things happen all the time. "
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"It's hard for me to imagine how famous he was because I know nothing about NFL but I read analogy in some thread that he was Michael Jordan famous level. Now that I think of it, I recognized him from Naked Gun movies, I loved them as a teenager.

I saw on youtube [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nsnuhz-Kb7k).  This is surreal, looks like whole country stopped to heard verdict. Just crazy."
The People v. O.J. Simpson,Did you watch the show? He was found Not Guilty.
The People v. O.J. Simpson,hey just curious here. I know all about the case /lived through it. I know like 3 shows came out all around the same time. One of the shows was hailed as an amazing documentary. I am kinda confused on which show is which. Which one should I watch?... I understand that they all might be good but I could not care less about OJ... I would however spend the time if the show was really well done. 
The People v. O.J. Simpson,I watch it just for the nostalgia of simpler times
The People v. O.J. Simpson,Which film?
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"Maybe the best comparison these days is if it were Shaq.  Not even quite Michael Jordan because Jordan hasn't stayed in the limelight, gotten into other fields, known as a fun clown type, etc.  OJ was all over the place."
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"You should watch both, but The People Vs. OJ first. It's highly entertaining and takes enough liberties with the story, plus the big moments from the trial are built up to perfectly.

After that you might be interested in learning more about the context of the case and stuff you might not remember about it, at which point OJ: Made In America could come in."
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"They're all very good. The FX show, American Crime Story: The Peope v. O.J. Simpson, was a dramatized version of the story, not a documentary. The documentary was an ESPN series titled O.J.: Made in America. I'm not sure about the third one, I didn't hear anything about that. "
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"American Crime Story: People vs OJ Simpson is the TV show that aired on FX. 

OJ: Made in America is the documentary.

They're both amazing and powerful but for different reasons. People vs OJ's power comes from the performances. Made In America's power comes from the context it places the case in.

I also don't give a shit about OJ but two of the best things I saw last year were about OJ."
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"This one  
http://www.espn.com/30for30/ojsimpsonmadeinamerica  

Looks like its on Hulu"
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"I'm talking about ""Made in America"", it's a 3 part series. I haven't seen the other ones but will give them a watch."
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"I watched The People vs OJ first, and then watched the documentary immediately after to see the comparison/contrast. "
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"Lol what??? The first episode is about race riots... Followed by celebrity culture, murder, and the 24/7 news cycle machine...

When are these simpler times you mention?"
The People v. O.J. Simpson,Imagine telling yourself that at the time
The People v. O.J. Simpson,The Empire Strikes Back
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"> Maybe the best comparison these days is if it were Shaq

I was thinking about this the other day and came to the same conclusion that it'd be someone like Shaq, or maybe Michael Strahan. Glad I wasn't the only one thinking of Shaq."
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"90s were dope dawg.

 And bad things have been happening since time began but there was a disconnect, atleast I feel like there was BC the world was bigger then.  Internet was just starting so the world felt much larger. And yes my age did have a factor in my original comment. 

I was a teen when the oj trial was happening and I remember watching everyday and it being everywhere.  But there also felt like there was a right and wrong.  "
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"Very true, but if you were a kid especially it felt simpler.  And it was pre-recession, pre social media and (to an extent) social media, so I get seeing it as simpler."
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"I mean, think about the 90's and think about now.  We're living through some pretty complicated times, what with the infowars, extrajudicial drone killings, people calling torture 'enhanced interrogation techniques', proxy wars in Syria and the Ukraine, Stuxnet, economic sanctions, hacked elections, superPACs, police on video murdering people, a president that probably committed treason, and God knows what else.  The 90's were cake compared to this. "
The People v. O.J. Simpson,But who was the ship's father?
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"The 90's included the Rwandan genocide, that resulted in the death of between 500K and 1 million people. There was also the Bosnian genocide, and the Timothy McVeigh bombing. Half of the stuff you mentioned were also present in the 90's. Not to mention all of the civil rights gains that have taken place only recently.  

There's no such thing as 'simpler times'. Only short-term memories."
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"Disinformation, extrajudicial killings, torture, proxy wars, sanctions, coups/hacked elections, police murdering people (smartphones didn't exist)?

I hate to break it to you, but that shit's been going on for decades, in America. Basically our entire South American foreign policy for decades. Lynching, Jim Crow, slavery, the list goes on eternally.

I know times seem tough and trying - and I get that, they are - but don't buy in to all the rhetoric. 

Be nice to people, try and sift through the bullshit and you'll be alright."
The People v. O.J. Simpson,The 90's was also the most violent decade in our history in terms of crime. The USA is a much safer country in 2017 than it was in the early 90's 
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"You're not wrong, but never has it been so obvious to so many people.  The question I think people are asking now, that they didn't really ask then, is what are we going to do about it?  I lived through the 90's, and was old enough to be culturally and politically aware.   Things definitely feel much different now, like things were in control then, for better or worse,  but now they're not."
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"She and Evan Peters are basically the only good thing about Amercan Horror Story, I'm glad she's getting better material in this show."
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"""We didn't think anyone was gonna like this show so thanks for giving us this award""

Lol"
The People v. O.J. Simpson,"Well, Steve and Kristen have the best bit of the night."
The People v. O.J. Simpson,Ok that Jon Snow part was good

The People v. O.J. Simpson,WOW Donald Glover unseats the mighty Jeffrey Tambor in Transparent. That's awesome
Basilisk,Some boarding and prep schools have houses. That’s not something Rowling invented. She took things from real life and just applied them to a school for magic.
Basilisk,"I am totally convinced this is a rip-off of the HP franchise. Here are some examples:

- Wednesday is ‘the key’ just as Harry is the ‘Chosen one’
- The secret gathering room gives me HP 5 vibes with a rip-off ‘room of requirement’ including a Dumbledores office-like entrance.
- ⁠‘normies’ are ‘muggles’
- ⁠the wolf-fighting is so similar as the fight in the forrest in HP 3 (Sirius Black vs. Professor Lupin).
- ⁠the (biology) professor that turns out to be the bad guy and was planning to kill Wednesday from the beginning just like how professor Quirrel tries to kill Harry ( HP 1 ending).
- ⁠the rip-off of the ‘Tri wizard Cup’ in HP 4 looks very similar.
- the mermaids attacking the contestants under water similar to HP4.
- ⁠the way Wednesday asks the guy out is exactly the same as when Harry asks Cho Chang to ball.
- ⁠the way and the theme of the dance is also exactly the same as in HP4.
- the way Wednesday comes walking down is also the same as how Hermione walks down the stairs.
- ⁠the death of the Headmaster (HP 6).
- at the final scene when Crackstone and Wednesday are fighting Crackstone gets stabbed from behind by Bianca looks similar to when Neville fights Naghini with the sword of Gryffindor.
- Crackstone dissolves just like Lord Voldemort style in a burst of ash and flames.
- Wednesday and her friends have saved their outcast community from eradication, just like Harry Potter and the Battle of Hogwarts.

There are a lot more similarities but I just remembered these few."
Basilisk,">really obvious parallels that jump out are the four established cliques/houses

This has been a thing in some schools for decades, my high school had 4 houses named after different birds of prey with corresponding red, blue, yellow and green colours."
Basilisk,Your mind is going to be blown when you find out that “magical academy with hidden secrets” has been a fantasy sub-genre for decades before Harry Potter came out.
Basilisk,Did you see the finale yet? It feels and watches exactly like the finale of Harry Potter
Basilisk,I don’t think Wednesday is a Mary Sue either.  She screws up a lot.   At one point I was thinking she was a terrible detective.
Basilisk,"Maybe but that's not exactly an original concept either, harry potter just happens to be the most popular one amongst certain audiences."
Basilisk,The boarding school setting is just derivative in general.
Basilisk,"My suspicion is that the script-in-development-hell idea might be true. While the whole notion of a ""magical academy"" is fairly common (there have been multiple such series in recent memory), the series tends to break with the Addams Family mythos with an explicitly magical world rather than an implicitly magical world.

That is, in previous incarnations of the Addams Family, they're weird and they're *like* these various horror/magic archetypes, but they tend to exist in a (mostly) grounded reality rather than one where everyone just blithely accepts that vampires, werewolves and merfolk simply exist as an entire cultures - or that you've got mystical powers such as precognition and telekinesis as every day occurrences."
Basilisk,"""Hogwarts"" is just the name JK Rowing came up with for her version of a reasonably popular trope. magic school

Happy Days Era ""witch school""

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabrina\_the\_Teenage\_Witch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabrina_the_Teenage_Witch)

Sabrina the Teenage Witch is a comic book series published by Archie Comics about the adventures of a fictional American teenager named Sabrina Spellman. **Sabrina was created by writer George Gladir and artist Dan DeCarlo, and first appeared in Archie's Madhouse #22 (cover-dated Oct. 1962).** Storylines of the character at elementary-school-age also appear under the title ""Sabrina -- That Cute Little Witch"" in almost all of the Little Archie comics.  


this is the ***pre-internet*** Harry Potter.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Worst\_Witch

The Worst Witch  
The Worst Witch was first published in 1974 by Allison & Busby, and proved to be an immediate success, selling out within two months.\[9\]\[10\]  
Plot  
The novel begins with Mildred Hubble and the upcoming traditional assembly where all of the first-years are given their own black cats that they will teach to ride on their broomsticks with them. Unlike the other girls, who receive black kittens, Mildred receives a tabby cat, which she simply calls Tabby. The kitten is unable to sit on a broomstick, so Mildred carries Tabby in her bag. Miss Hardbroom disapproves and Mildred has to stop. Afterwards, another witch called Ethel Hallow teases Mildred about it, and dares her to turn her into a frog. Mildred loses her temper and turns Ethel into a pig instead."
Basilisk,"There was moving statues, staircase paintings, a werewolf turning, bringing back people from the dead, them inside the food lift in the house (similar to when the basilisk was in harry's parents house), sirens, the water themed sports with a merman involved...   if you ask me its more than just a coincidence..."
Basilisk,"I agree, this show is a total copy of Harry Potter. The ‘normies’? Oh and she is also “special”? Werewolves and magical creatures? Dang. Writers literally made a cheap version of Harry Potter."
Basilisk,"Ask Tim burton. Until then, don’t make things up."
Basilisk,"dont say things like that. as a pottercholic i can eat that shit right now. and if i puke, thats on you. literally."
Basilisk,"did ""Naruto"" script start as a Harry Potter copy cat?

&#x200B;

Substitute wizards for ninjas!"
Basilisk,Like the episode where they canoe race & the sirens are trying to stop them? Very very similar to the Harry Potter movie where they did the same thing
Basilisk,Completely agree
Basilisk,"Harry Potter is explicitly set in an environment that would be recognisable to Brits - but perhaps less so to other nationalities.

The ""house"" system, for instance, is ubiquitous - every British kid would recognise it.  There are some details that vary from one school to another - in some schools, house membership is in no way related to where you sleep - but the general thrust of it is very recognisable.

I think a lot depends on the nationality of the original scriptwriter.  A Brit could very easily have written ""Wednesday"" and not even considered the similarities to Harry Potter."
Basilisk,"yes, it's like HP and the goblet of fire."
Basilisk,"The show takes from a lot of previous works, and it is self aware of that. I found it entertaining. Rowan looked just like Harry Potter, and I found it hilarious when he came out as a villain. I wasn’t expecting his quick demise. There are a lot of magical academy shows, Sabrina and X-Men just to name a couple more. There were times these first 8 episodes felt like Harriet the Spy, Twilight, Goonies, Star Wars, Batman, and Beetlejuice. It’s somewhat a love letter to fantasy and science fiction. I liked the literary references too."
Basilisk,WEDNESDAY ADDAMS IS A RIPOFF OR HP!! I AM PISSED!
Basilisk,"I started writing down the similarities from episode one and stopped at 50 and i was still on episode 2.

Some off the top of my head are: (not already mentioned)
. The quad looks so familiar
. The tree in the quad is a smaller whomping willow.
. The big hole in the principal's office for a mouth of a structure with long hairs, it is there chamber of secrets
. The dialogue, why is it you at the centre of everything?, is McG's why is it always you three.
. The mention of obsidian.
. Using Harry/Wednesday's blood to bring voldemort/crackstone back. 
. The visions.
. Final exams getting cancelled.
. Neville and the bee guy.
. LUNA LOVEGOOD AND the roommate.
. Crackstone converting in ashes.

Overall, very poor writing. I completed it for Jenna Ortega.

I guess it was made for children who think HP is too old for them or they don't have the patience to watch it."
Basilisk,"I got only half, but as I was recognizing them, they just seemed more fun. I just wanted to watch it for why this show is going famous, but then I ended up finishing it and liking it😂😂😁. Especially Enid's fight, amazing💯.

And till now, I was just thinking to watch a movie or 2 from hp, but guess I'm gonna binge it now😂😂"
Basilisk,"It was at this time I noticed it as well. Sure there are plenty of character and creature tropes that would obviously dip into the same pool, but storytelling as well. I made a list the other day… I would suggest not reading it if you haven’t finished the show 

Spoiler warning 

 both were real world outcasts who ended up getting shipped off to their school filled with similar people and entering a world where they were new. 
They both found they were part of a prophecy 
We got the normies as muggles 
We have the evil teacher who turned out to be good and the good teacher turning out to be evil 
We have four teams at the school having competition for a trophy and guess what, 3 of them share the same colours scheme as Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and gryffindor
The main character had to deal with a father figure suspected of murder 
There’s a scary creature going around terrorizing people that’s actually a human who transforms 
Ghost of ancestors come to save the day 

There are others but these were the most obvious"
Basilisk,"Was the winter ball being a direct rip off from goblet of fire a sub-genre before harry potter? How about the secret society of nightshades copying the order of the phoenix? Or the chamber of secrets/phoenix statue thing they had with the nightshades headquarters? 

How about the town of Jericho being a ripoff of Greendale from The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina? The scene where Enid and Wednesday go to the crypt is literally Ron and Harry looking for spiders in the forbidden woods. The whole kiddy mystery feel of the show just felt like a 12+ version of stranger things.

The headmaster being killed by the villain etc…

The tri-wizard tournament and sirens in lakes… please… have some decorum."
Basilisk,"That's wild, man.

(I do find it a bit ironic that the OP is implying that the Wednesday show is derivative, but references something that I always thought was cribbing off other works a lot, as the original.

I mean, depending on who you ask, Harry Potter is the plot of Star Wars, with a bit of Books of Magic for looks, or ripping off any other combination of some of someone's favorite works.

At this point all art is derivative, it seems like, the question is how obvious it is. In Harry Potter's case, I'd say it's fairly obvious.)"
Basilisk,"lol. I read the Harry Potter series when they came out.  But I was so over the ""chosen one orphan being brought up by assholes who finds they're talented in magic and are trained by an old wizard"".  From Star Wars, Wheel of Time, David Eddings, Sword of Truth, blah blah blah

By the time Harry Potter came out I was so over it.  Hero of a Thousand Faces and all that."
Basilisk,"I guess I could’ve done a better job of titling the post. It’s more that I find it weird that the marketing surround the show was “Addams Family returns with a show centered around Wednesday”, but from what I’ve seen they’ve just plugged Wednesday Addams into a generic school for magical gifted children. You could swap her out with a moody version of Hermione or any other female fantasy protagonist, and show would be virtually identical."
Basilisk,Could you elaborate
Basilisk,"Also her personality causes a lot of her own problems throughout the series. She's by no means treated as perfect Mary Sue. Ironically, the Christina Ricci version from the films was a lot closer to a Mary Sue because she was almost always in the right on every subplot, got one over on absolutely everyone, always had the upperhand and was portrayed as far too intelligent for anyone else to compete with."
Basilisk,When was the basilisk in Harry's parents house
Basilisk,Somebody's cranky today
Basilisk,Thank you for bringing up Books of Magic. Because a simple google search will show you how similar the overall aesthetic of the main characters are.
Basilisk,Did you just call Tam Al'Thor an asshole?
Basilisk,"Congratulations, you're over one of the basic elements of human storytelling since storytelling existed?"
Basilisk,"Agreed, how different is this show from say Winx. . . . except for the styling."
Basilisk,Just watch both then report back
Basilisk,">She was almost always in the right on every subplot, got one over on absolutely everyone, always had the upperhand and was portrayed as far too intelligent for anyone else to compete with

That is not what a Mary Sue means.

A key element of a Mary Sue character is that she excels at everything and that she is liked by (almost) everyone.

Wednesday is an outsider and there are very clear limits to the control she has over her surroundings.

The original Mary Sue was a parody for a reason."
Basilisk,I have what I meant to ask was like do you mean the finale of Harry Potter the series or a specific movie and what aspect of the ending because if it's where the actual fight they seem very different
Basilisk,"No a Mary Sue is an writer stand in. She doesn't need to be liked by everyone, she can be disliked by all the wrong people. Wednesday is literally only disliked by obnoxious shitty privilege people in the film that are made out to be people that deserved to be taken down a peg. Even the original parody Mary Sue had the silly green androids capturing her. It's okay for antagonists not to like her. Wednesday  pretty much won in every situation of the two films and flipped every situation on it's head and could easily manipulate people into thinking she was doing the right thing. Wednesday in the movies is smarter than everyone she comes against and pretty easily outmaneuvers them all the characters that you would want to like Wednesday generally like her. The only difference between her and a conventional Mary Sue is the typical Addams Family twist that she's very macabre. 

The show Wednesday isn't that. She constantly faces obstacles she can't overcome because some of her qualities are presented as flaws that hurt her. Not the case in the films."
Basilisk,"The key is that a Mary Sue is liked by the establishment.

Technically James Bond is a Mary Sue, he's a part of the establishment, extremely competent in almost every aspect, respected by men, and desired by women.

If we take away the trust MI-6 has in him, he would not be a Mary Sue, but the misunderstood outsider who is always right. Dirty Harry perhaps?

The Bond villains are his green aliens.

As for being a writer stand-in, allegedly Bond was a type of wish-fulfillment for Fleming who was not accepted into MI-6.

A Mary Sue is a special type of writer stand in.

It's a character that exists in a world where the establishment fully embraces the alter ego of the writer because they acknowledge the character's competence."
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,"I wish Amazon would adapt Gone by michael grant. 

This just seems like your generic YA story."
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,[deleted]
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,I LOVE the Gone series!
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,That's been the way for movies since our entire life. I read once that 60%+ of movies come from books on average.
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,What’s wrong with adapting books?  The books are still creative and the shows change a few things.
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,Glad it seems that Brock and Misty will play a decent role in this.
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,"I was 9 when this Cartoon came out , i was already a pokemon super fan and the show took it to another level

used to run home from primary school for its airing 

Still got a soft spot for Ash now ...may he retire in peace"
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,Gary Motherfucking Oak
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,"If there is any justice in the world, the American localization will be a remix of ""Gotta Catch 'em All"" and the original title sequence like how this one is a remix of the original song and title sequence for the Japanese version."
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,Ash's pikachu is probably strong enough to crack the earth in two by now.
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,But will we finally find out the identity of Ash's father?
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,I just need Ash and Misty to confess their love for each other DONT TELL ME THEY ARE TWELVE THESE TWO ARE FORTY
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,"I hope the series mans up, and finishes it the way it should: Ash catching all the bullshit legendaries he has befriended and uses them to take over the world and create an oppressive autocracy. Misty, with tears in her eyes, Shoots Ash in the head. The world thinks its saved. But no, Celebi turns back time. Ash laughs. Fade to black."
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,Okay but it’s -kind- of funny to me that he’s been the protagonist for like 25 years and yet 90% of the clips are from the Indigo League season(s).
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,25 years and the main character still hasn't beaten the main villain of the original games.
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,Always trips me up that they changed the names of Pokémon. When I first heard Lizardon is put me for a loop.
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,The end of a long journey. Really looking forward to the new protaginist and how he handles things
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,Obviously I haven't watched in years and years but that characters doesn't look like Ash at all lol.
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,"sad to see Ash go

but Pikachu? i hope that little shit dies or evolves in the final ep, ive hated that annoying little fuck for years."
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,I thought they lied and wernt retiring him.
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,"they were the OG buddy crew. Naturally Misty had to go back to Cerulean Gym because her sisters are too busy being hot to take care of it, but Brock is always a good companion to Ash and they seem to like his cooking lol."
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,"The words you are looking for are:

Let’s fucking goooooooooooooooo"
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,">	used to run home from primary school for its airing

OMG! Same here! It used to come on ITV at 3:30pm but my primary school would only finish at 3:15pm. So I used to literally run home to be able to watch it in time. Good memories to be honest."
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,Retiring at the ripe age of 10 good for Ash.
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,Did he quit being a Pokemon researcher??
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,I watched the original Japanese opening so many times after somehow figuring out how to download and play it on Realplayer... Nostalgia bomb watching this
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,Would singing the original lyrics in the paste tense work?
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,"""Pikachu use Iron Tail on the ground!"""
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,"They should do the ""Who's that pokemon?"" screen but for Ash's father and it's Alec Baldwin"
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,[deleted]
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,oh man reminds me of this song on a pokemon cd i bought a long time ago i used to play A LOT.  lol found it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_6f6DWp7Nk
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,"'misty I love you......' ""ash you owe me a fucking bike"""
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,Peak
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,Why does this weirdly sound like AoT
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,I think I read they're changing some of the clips shown each episode.
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,One of the pokémon is Japanese is known as blackey. Safe to say that name isn't in the English versions (think it's Umbreon)
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,alright team rocket
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,No. He's retiring. He has completed his mission
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,The man who has somehow gone through 7 years of med school and become a doctor but ash is still 10
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,Just in time to sing that intro theme !
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,He was part of Project Mew with Goh which was one of the main main story lines last season alongside Ash competing in Pokémon World Coronation tournament
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,I watched like 200 Japanese pokémon episodes until the site was discontinued. 😐
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,Have caught them all!
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,Weird pull but okay
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,"Sorry, I’m a few hundred episodes behind."
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,"I haven’t heard that CD in over 20 years and still know exactly what song you’re talking about. Still remember some of the lyrics, too."
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,That’s pretty cool. :-)
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,"it's so weird that they didn't age him at all during the course of the series

he's 12 and he's already accomplished his dream. what does he do for the next 44 years? (ash dies at 56 in a jetski accident)"
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,"So you’re saying that he’s now the very best, like no one ever was?"
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,"They didn’t actually reveal his father, guy you were talking to is being weird for some reason. He’s alive but we dont meet him."
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,Watch the Distant Blue Sky special. It's mostly Standalone.
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,Moves out into the mountains waiting for trainers to show up so he can kick their ass.
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,"It's pretty standard for long running animes and mangas though. Hell, even standard in the west with comics and the such. In marvel, characters only get to hit the age of 35 after three decades and then they stay there forever until somebody wants to do a shakeup."
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,…While attempting to jump a shark
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,He’s alive. So that 1 minute pause in episode 2 meant nothing???
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,Brock and misty returning too. Wonder what happens to team rocket as well
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,"According to [Rica Matsumoto](https://twitter.com/rica_matsumoto3/status/1603735287422558209?s=46&t=r-fN1S_tc6QNQ71zoleb6w), Ash’s Japanese actress, Ash won’t be completely out yet. My guess? He’ll make a few appearances in the next show or more oneshot movies or specials set in the I Choose You timeline."
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,"The episode is finally going to say ""The End"" after all these years of ""to be continued.."""
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,Pokémon ends ….  New season : Pokémon Shippuden
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,[deleted]
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,I can’t believe Ash is 35 now. He looks great for his age.
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,"Hopefully we get a reunion with his Pidgeot, primeape, charizard, and butterfree (unless it died), etc."
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,Will his dad finally come back😭
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,Will he finally have an eleventh birthday?
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,I hope they do a time jump where ash is older and is a Professor or something and then they continue the story by him giving the new kid their starter pokemon.
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,"> The Pokémon Company said on Friday that it will air 11 final episodes of Ash and Pikachu’s journey before beginning a new chapter in the long-running series. The final arc of the anime will begin on January 13.

Event Television. Haven't watched the anime in years, but I'm absolutely gonna watch these every week, then sob like a baby when it ends."
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,"I'm sure that Ash will be back one day, standing atop Mount Silver, waiting...."
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,FIRST MEREDITH GREY AND NOW THIS? WTF 2022
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,"I can't believe I live in a timeline where Samurai Jack actually got back to the past, Goku became a god, Tai became an adult, Shinji Ikari got a happy ending....  
  
And now Ash became the strongest Pokemon trainer in the world  
  
That's a lot to take in. I was with this series since literally Day 1. I liked Journeys conceptually but I wasnt a fan of how they executed a lot of things, but I'm glad they're giving Ash an ending and letting him retire with a legendary W like beating Leon and a final adventure that hopefully lets him go out on a high note!"
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,First ballot hall of famer imo.
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,Someone able to do a 25 year recap very quickly? I only like saw the first season as a kid.
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,I hope it ends by showing us his journey was just the 8 minutes of DMT after Pikachu killed him in the first episode.
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,"See ya later, Ash. Thanks for all of the memories and the battles. May your story inspire those to never give up on their dreams."
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,"If they want to hit us in the feels. 

All I ask is the same opening sequence from the original show( Pokemon: Indigo League)

We open on an intense Pokémon battle and then we reveal that it’s Ash battling being the current champion. Then it reveals that the new characters are watching it on TV the morning of the day they receive there first Pokémon.

I actually like the idea that now Ash is this model figure for kids to look up to. We’ve come full circle."
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,I can't believe they fucking killed him
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,"Damn, this actually makes me really sad"
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,"To protect the world from devastation, to unite all people within our nation. To denounce the evils of truth and love, to extend our reach to the stars above."
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,"Pokemon: Thousand Year Blood War. A mature take on the pokemon world staring Ichigo as Ash Ketchum, Rukia as Misty, and Chad as Brock."
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,BRING BACK PIDGEOT AND BUTTERFREE DAMMIT
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,How come I never win anything using Pikachu.
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,"Well the question has to be asked:

Is he the very best? Like no one ever was?"
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,"I've always had a feeling they will end it with him encountering Ho-Oh again, but that won't happen I'm sure."
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,"And this punk never went back to get Pidgeot did he?

You made that promise in 1999, motherfucker!"
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash, the end of a career for ash
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,Can we get a pokemon series where the characters age and mature? Like if a proper sequel to XYZ happened??
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,Guessing he didn't catch em all?
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,"I'm a little disappointed purely because Ash's final battle was against Leon and not Gary.

Also, what the fuck was up with that guy who had a fucking Latios and Darkrai in Sinnoh's league? Was that ever explained? How did Cynthia even beat him???"
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,"Lebron first championship after 9 seasons: it’s about damn time. 

Ash: hold my beer."
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,I remember being a kid and discovering this show. I used to wake up an hour early every day before getting on the bus so I could watch one episode and 15 minutes of the Sonic cartoon where he was obsessed with chili-dogs. This is too sad.
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,"Curious what happens now. I've been rewatching the series, partially in Japanese from 1-6 and then in English from 7 on forward. Throughout that time Ash has not won one single tournament (well he won Orange but that wasn't the very best). Through 25 years he's only won 2 major tournaments, with his latest being in the 25th year. 

The Pokeverse is very big so I wonder if we can get a new protagonist. Ash has been trying to be the very best longer than Tom Brady has played football!"
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,"Makes sense. His story has come to an end with him recently becoming the world champion. He reached his goal. 

Now they can start a new character and spend the next 25 years telling their story."
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,Hope they bring back the original voice actors for these
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,"Also I'm not opposed to this. Pokemon had a brief series which didn't involve Ash, remember the Pokemon Chronicles? Some of those episodes involved Brock dealing with his dad who was suffering because Brock's mom had taken over the gym, or Misty handling a Gyrados at her Cerulean gym. Heck even some of those Chronicle episodes involved a totally new protagonist and his friends trying to find that legendary Pokemon, or what I consider the best, the Pichu brothers and the Teddiursa and Meowth engaging in hilarious antics. Eager to see the new direction of Pokemon."
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,Finally they made it🏆🏆🏆 take that Gary oak
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,Haven’t watched since I was a kid but genuinely curious if Ash ever reunited with his Charizard that went off to the Charizard island to toughen up?
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,I am preparing a class action lawsuit against The Pokemon Company for the emotional damages of this announcement.
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,Can we get a Brock and Misty show
Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash,Will Pikachu finally evolve into Raichu?

Love Me or Leave Me,"He was one of those actors who you just paid full attention to, he truly had a screen aura. I've been a cinema lover since I was young, and television of course but this death has truly saddened me since I heard it. He seemed like such a gent off screen too."
Love Me or Leave Me,"Definitely feels like it was written with him in mind. I also like the idea that they ran a few stories by him and he was like ""I got to do that one."""
Love Me or Leave Me,"Dude was fucking jacked in The Wire, 8 pack."
Love Me or Leave Me,"Also, I think I learned from that show that he was a real talented piano player, which is why he kept jamming on it in the show."

As soon as I saw the title and his face the first time I watched this, I knew it was going to be epic."
Love Me or Leave Me,"i guess we have a different sense of humour. i laughed outloud at that line. 

For context i'm afab, but identify as pretty gender queer... tho also schizophrenic. Sooo, maybe my craziness makes me think weird things are hilarious? 🫣

In another context i might *not* have found the line funny, and i might have even thought it was offensive, but this hit me just right."
Love Me or Leave Me,And a voice I will never forget.
Love Me or Leave Me,"I’m right there with you, this is one of if not the hardest hittin celeb deaths I can remember for me, such a great actor and by all accounts and even better person. Such a huge loss, Lance goes down as a legend in my personal book. It’s gonna be really damn bittersweet watching John wick 4 next week"
Love Me or Leave Me,"Yeah, he always wore a suit and everything, then you see him in the scene shirtless for the first time and it’s like daaaaaamn"
Love Me or Leave Me,"Man was ripped as fuck for his legendary Eric Andre show appearance. Seems the guy loved fitness because he was ripped consistently for decades. Just goes to show how fragile life can be, Lance was in better shape than like 99% of 60yr olds. What a huge loss"
Love Me or Leave Me,"I was like, they waited four seasons before dropping this card??"
Love Me or Leave Me,"I've been watching the Wire this past few weeks, and I'm sure he had one scene in season 1 where he answered the phone shirtless. My reaction was also along the lines of daaaaaamn!

Think that was when his wife told him there was a call, and might have been when he heard the young'un had lost his eye."
Love Me or Leave Me,"What was your favorite scene to be a part of, either acting, directing, or writing?"

I love the elegance that ""less is more"" can bring to many aspects of life and I'm sure it's happened somewhere in your career in film.

Is there a film of yours where budget or resource constraints led to filmmaking decisions that you can attribute to the success of said film? Perhaps even a specific scene you could mention?"
Love Me or Leave Me,Curly or shemp?

Love Me or Leave Me,"First let me say your work is incredible, thank you for the endless entertainment and sometimes thought provoking body of work you have given the world. 

People have tried to read and translate [Commandments 11-15](http://www.jewishhumorcentral.com/2013/05/found-at-last-mel-brooks-lost-five.html?m=1). Are they in fact:

Thank you again."
Love Me or Leave Me,"Will you be my friend? You don't need to do anything, but can I tell people were friends?"
Love Me or Leave Me,"Many years ago, you and Carl Reiner came into the TV station where I worked to do a live interview. Most celebs who did live interviews hung out with the on-air folks before the show, but you and Mr. Reiner spent time with the writers, having a friendly chat with us. I just wanted to say, I really thought that was great.   
Why do you suppose it seems like so many ""talent"" don't have respect for writers anymore? Did they ever?"
Love Me or Leave Me,"First I just want to say, I grew up watching your movies with my dad who passed in 2015. He would have loved History of the World Part II. Your movies, especially Young Frankenstein are a comfort to me. 

What's your personal comfort movie? Whether it's a movie you made or one you just love to watch?"
Love Me or Leave Me,Hey Mel Brooks I just wanted to say I am a huge fan of you and your work and your book is a great read and my question to you is is there any actor or actress you wanted in one of your films but never got the chance to work/ have them in one of your films?

Love Me or Leave Me,"Mel, the book was great. Thanks for making History of the World Part 2. What is/was your favorite historical subject to parody? I still open my teaching with the French Revolution scenes I can show to HS kids and say it was the best of times and the worst of times, but mostly it was the worst of times…"
Love Me or Leave Me,What’s your favorite joke that didn’t land?
Love Me or Leave Me,How has comedy evolved since the beginning of your career? Who are some of your favorite comedians working today?
Love Me or Leave Me,"A quick story for you, Mr. Brooks.

As a child, I was afraid of everything (and not without reason). Then, at the age of 14, something wonderful happened. I saw the Producers for the first time.

Over the course of that film, I began to experience a monumental shift. It was physical, emotional, mental and spiritual. Somehow, as Zero Mostel was wooing Gene Wilder over to a life of crime, he was teaching me how to adjust my own perspective on life. This culminated in the rowboat scene. In a matter of moments I knew that, if I wanted to turn my life around, I would have to move (psychologically) from one side of that boat to the other - from Bloom to Bialystock. He taught me how to ""be happy"". By the time the fountain went off at Lincoln Centre there were tears in my eyes.

Mr. Brooks, That moment changed my life and I haven't looked back. I've always wanted to tell you that - and to thank you for helping me to become the fearless and wonderful fifty-year old I am today!

Sincere best wishes and eternal gratitude,

Randolph J. Johnston

P.S. I joined Reddit specifically to leave you this message. Wishing you nothing but continued great health and happiness."

Love Me or Leave Me,"Could you share just one funny story from behind the scenes/on the set of one of your comedies? There are probably many, but what’s one that sometimes pops into your head and makes you chuckle to yourself when you think about it?"
Love Me or Leave Me,"Mel, you changed my life. Seeing Young Frankenstein sent shockwaves threw me. I would watch it every weekend on VHS. Then, when The Producers musical came out it became an obsession. Today, I’m a TV & commercials producer & writer who has worked a lot in comedy horror. I even screened a short at a festival where a short you were in screened! I know I’m not the only one. How was it working with so many people you inspired on History of the World Part II?"
Love Me or Leave Me,"Mel, I just wanted to let you know one of the best memories of my life was sitting in my 8th grade Art class in 1990 and it was movie day. Now I was no stranger to your work as one of my father's favorite movies was Young Frankenstein, and I even recall my parents taking me to the theater to see Spaceballs, but this day in 8th grade Art class will always be truly special to me as I was about to see a Mel Brooks film I had never been aware of until that day....

I saw Blazing Saddles for the first time in 8th grade Art class.

In a predominantly white class, aside from the one black kid."

Actual question: Is there any project you never got to or had to pass up that you’d still love to revisit? Considering History of the World Part II is just out now I like to think anything’s possible."
Love Me or Leave Me,what is the combination to your luggage?
Love Me or Leave Me,"I watched a clip of you on Conan O’Brien’s show talking about the German General sketch with Sid Caesar. I watched The Last Laugh to see where you got your inspiration and I really enjoyed the movie! Are there other movies you could recommend where you drew comedic inspiration?

Also, I’d love any more stores about Sid and Carl Reiner if you feel like indulging me."

Love Me or Leave Me,"Looking back, what would you have done differently, Mel?"
Love Me or Leave Me,"#How is Blazing Saddles STILL so incredibly relevant regarding Racism in today’s society?

Full disclosure, my friends and I rented the movie when I was 14 and we re-watched the fart episode segment at least 100 times and peed our pants. Literally. 

It wasn’t until I shared it with my son almost 40 years later, and realized how ahead of its time it was, and how you really captured Racism in America.

Pure genius. Did you realize at the time how incredibly powerful it was when you wrote it and produced it?

I’m curious what your outcome was when you created the movie versus what it represents today."
Love Me or Leave Me,I'm a huge fan of your movies and each one features unforgetable characters! I was wondering which character of yours is your favorite?

Love Me or Leave Me,What was the one project that you wanted to do but couldn't manage to get made?
Love Around,"It's not really well known in the UK. People will have heard of it, but most won't have seen it. It was never really shown over here, like Friends or The Simpsons was, which is a pity."
Love Around,"If I'm not mistaken, it is only popular in countries that celebrate Festivus."
Love Around,"It's not well-known at all in France, I don't know much about it myself (never watched a full episode, only know it because well, obviously I'm interested in American culture, I didn't even know the guy's face that well before 30 Rock). 

France doesn't have anything that compares to American sitcoms, culturally speaking the audience has always had a soft spot for shorter episodes (between a sitcom and a sketch), and aired between the news and the evening's movie. Usually short, comical/comedic with a bit of a satiric element to it (if you're interested I can give you the names, but as you said for Seinfeld : it wouldn't translate well either ! and also, while some of the stuff can be funny it's nothing you can't live without).

To be honest with you, what France has that comes close to Seinfeld is... Friends. It's been aired a thousand times, back in high school people would talk about the episode of the day before, and in college we would lend DVD's to those who hadn't seen it yet. It was a must-see."
Love Around,"I was in south America and two locals that knew English asked if I liked Seinfeld after I said yes they proceeded to sing george's answering machine song.  ""believe it or not George isn't at home....where could he beeee"""
Love Around,"We loved it in the Netherlands :), still showing reruns on comedy central over here. "
Love Around,My friend lives in Australia and he said people love it there
Love Around,[deleted]
Love Around,Quite popular in India with re-runs running throughout the year. But nowhere near as popular as Friends for some reason. The average 20-something in an Indian city is likely to be a huge fan of Friends with little idea about Seinfeld.
Love Around,[deleted]
Love Around,"I love it, but it's horribly neglected here in the UK. It appears every now and then sprayed all over the TV schedules. So I have the box set instead.."
Love Around,"I studied abroad in Galway Ireland in 2002. It was on TV and people didn't get it. I don't think neurotic Jews in New York translated well to small town Ireland. On the other hand people loved The Simpsons. 

I also lived in Salzburg, Austria for a summer, and none of my Seinfeld references caught even an acknowledgement. "
Love Around,also how about curb? is that popular around the world anyone from a country other than the US? I wonder if the humor translates well. 
Love Around,I remember it was quite popular here in South Africa. Nowhere close to Friends in terms of popularity (which I think aired during the same period of time) but lots of people loved it.
Love Around,"From India: Every year or so, a different channel airs the show. And each time all 9 seasons are aired. Its been on air for the last 12 years here and remains popular. But i have to add that it is not as popular as FRIENDS (at one time it was on air on 4 different channels at the same time. You basically had 2 hours of FRIENDS on 4 channels showing a different season of FRIENDS). At present Seinfeld was on air last on Comedy Central India. God i hate FRIENDS. "
Love Around,"What's crazy reading all the responses was how Friends is almost universally watched around the world, but Seinfeld was only picked up in a few select places. I find this sad since I always thought Friends was terrible and Seinfeld was genius."
Love Around,"I'm from Scotland. I've heard people (I assume Americans) talking of it on here, but I've never seen it, and as far as I'm aware it isn't really shown here."
Love Around,hmm.. i can only tell for myself here in germany: Seinfeld - best tv show ever. I own the whole series on dvd and i have watched every single episode + all outtakes and bonuses multiple times (in english of course. i haven't watched a single episode in german. ;))
Love Around,[deleted]
Love Around,Portugal: It's been in re-run for over 9 years on cable as one of the flags of the programming table airing constantly on one of the most popular channels whose demographics are young males from 14-25. It's pretty well known.
Love Around,"Seinfeld was too sophisticated and niche for most foreign audiences. They simply won't get a lot of the references to white, middle class American culture. African Americans didn't even watch it, when Seinfeld was still  on and #1 for whites in the TV ratings it was down at #54 for blacks.

Keep in mind the global market is where the shitty summer blockbusters full of CGI and explosions make their money.

"
Love Around,I teach in China and most of them haven't even heard of it before.
Love Around,"I can confirm that it is well liked in Canada.

Does anyone know what happen to the 24/7 Seinfeld stream? http://tgun.tv/embed/sein.php doesn't seem to be working for me. "
Love Around,It's not very well known in Poland. Friends or Married with children used to be huge mainstream prime time hits. Seinfeld used to run on obscure 2nd rate channels. 
Love Around,"UK here.

Watching ""The Maestro"" episode when I saw this thread.

I got into it about 7 years ago or so. Found it from kicking about the internet a lot, absolutely loved it. My friends/flatmates started watching it and absolutely love it too. We've all seen every episode probably a dozen times.

So it's appreciated, just needs more exposure. Plus I personally think you need to watch 4/5 episodes before you understand the characters and style and really find it hilarious."
Love Around,"As an Australian I really liked it..so did my friends...

Didn't hurt that *we* were in our thirties and single too.."
Love Around,"Outside of US/Canada, I think it was biggest in Australia. It had a prestigious timeslot (~730pm Wednesday or Thursday) and once it had been on for a while, it started getting daily repeats at noon. Its final episode was a well-advertised event, and Jerry and George made the cover of entertainment magazines a bunch of times. Repeats are still shown on TV regularly and everyone over 20 knows it. 

Friends was still bigger at the time, although it seems like Seinfeld has retained more of its popularity today. I know lots of people who still watch Seinfeld and have all the DVD sets, but I don't think I've seen anyone with a Friends DVD set. Maybe that's because Seinfeld has a bit of a unique sense of humour, while there are a handful of modern shows similar to Friends? Or maybe it's because a big draw in Friends was the will-they-won't-they of the character relationships, which isn't interesting on reruns? "
Love Around,"Friends is way more popular worldwide, because it's been aired constantly almost everywhere.  Seinfeld not as much.  Such a shame."
Love Around,"Yea its pretty well known here in Dubai, UAE, Middle East... although im not a huge fan my self... im more into friends... that shit is hilarious... but yes we do have a ton of re-runs and such juat like the us.... and its pretty well known to the people who grew up with a tv... :)"
Love Around,"I grew up in Ecuador. I used to watch Seinfeld and I loved it, but it wasn't a popular show. I was lucky that my family could afford a super premium cable package, and the best channel to watch sitcoms was Sony Entertainment Television. 

However there are other sitcoms that were and are super popular. Full House, Fresh Prince, Friends, Alf, The Simpsons and The Nanny were probably the biggest ones. These were overdubbed and played on local networks. However Seinfeld was never overdubbed, only subtitled and you can only watch it on cable television."
Love Around,In Australia reruns are often some of the highest rating shows on cable.
Love Around,"Australia here:  

  I find the man himself extremely irritating but I must admit of the several shows I watched over a decade ago, there was some funny stuff in there.  

  Admittedly though that was usually involving the other characters.  Not Seinfeld in particular...  

  TL;DR - No."
Love Around,24 hour Seinfeld. http://tgun.tv/embed/stream1.php?widthid=640&heightid=480
Love Around,"I live in a German speaking country so if it does play Seinfeld, which is usually late at night, it's dubbed and nowhere near as good as the original version. I was lucky to have a Sky reciever from England so I was able to catch every episode in English.

Most people have heard of the show but it definitely isn't as popular as it is in the US, Israel or other places where it's still shown all the time today."
Love Around,[deleted]
Love Around,[deleted]
Love Around,"I don't think I've ever watched a full episode of the show, only clips on YouTube which I really didn't find funny. I've never heard anyone talk about it. I know Sky Atlantic show over hear in Ireland. I always wanted to get the Season 1&2 boxset and try it, but I never got around to it."
Love Around,"not by me the characters are just so uninteresting, George is the only enjoyable and relatable person. 

Jerry is just plain unbelievable cardboard actor. 
Elaine is a selfish brat and I cannot find any enjoyment in her character.
Kramer; just flat out unbelievable and ludicrous, I personally do not enjoy that sort of character in any show.

Other than that the show delivers on the 'nothing happens' shtick and in doing so is completely devoid of any enjoyable plot.

There are quite a few scenes and that are very funny, but as a show I cannot invest in spending time watching it. 

To be quite honest when I have to watch the big bang theory I enjoy myself more due to the mostly consistent and interesting characters. 

But, I am just one man with one opinion and my area loves the fuck out of the show."
Love Around,"i don't care for the show in i live in the good old usa,so i don't blame them"
Love Around,I’m
Love Around,"I never understood why. It seems perfect for Channel 4. Or even Sky. E4 could show back to back repeats 24 hours a day for 10 years and never repeat an episode. 

Note: That isn't real maths"
Love Around,"Both Sky One and BBC2 aired it during its original run. I remember BBC2 airing it as a double-bill with Larry Sanders in a late-night slot. Seinfeld repeats are currently airing on Sky Atlantic, but have aired on Virgin 1 and Paramount Comedy over the years.

I think Seinfeld started at a funny time when none of the then-four terrestrial channels were airing many imports. Friends really changed that, but even post-Friends we still didn't get a ton of hit US comedies until Sky/Freeview became popular (e.g. Home Improvement and Raymond)."
Love Around,What show would you say is the UK's 'Seinfeld'?
Love Around,"Friends was always much bigger than Seinfeld where I live. If anything, Seinfeld felt more like a cult hit than a major show for some reason.

"
Love Around,Festivus for the rest of us!
Love Around,[deleted]
Love Around,"I should give you reddit gold for being the first person to respond to all of my questions, but I won't. I'm sorry, but thank you!"
Love Around,That's interesting as Comedy Central does not show it here in America. I guess syndication is based on who will pay the most.
Love Around,Does it air with subtitles?
Love Around,"Can confirm, I love it, my whole family loves it and my gf loves it."
Love Around,"Australian checking in. Also can confirm, I can yell ""THESE PRETZELS ARE MAKING ME THIRSTY"" and people (seem to) understand what I'm talking about. "
Love Around,"Yeap, known well enough in Australia that you can make references to it (""no soup for you"") in everyday life and people will ""get"" it. Also pretty much constantly on reruns on a channel somewhere."
Love Around,There's a British Seinfeld?! Heh only kidding.
Love Around,"Same here in Sweden.

And I love it.

"
Love Around,"I feel the same way. I have all nine seasons and people regularly ask me what it is.

I've found that it's more of a cult thing over here."
Love Around,[deleted]
Love Around,"On the other hand, the Americans have been trying to make a new version of Father Ted for a while. It's never come to fruition. Probably for the best given that American remakes almost always are nothing compared to the original, with the one exception off the top of my mind being the Office"
Love Around,"In the UK, I know a lot more Curb fans than Seinfeld fans, because it actually got a decent showing over here. It's still a cult thing though."
Love Around,Oh ya that would also be interesting to know. I don't even know a lot of Americans who have even heard of it.
Love Around,"rest assured it is a show, and it's brilliant."
Love Around,"That's awesome. Secretly this is just becoming a list of places I want to visit because if they show Seinfeld, it's got to be awesome there right? Haha"
Love Around,http://tgun.tv/embed/stream1.php?widthid=640&heightid=480
Love Around,Friends seems to be a very translatable show. Also the Simpsons.
Love Around,"Yeah, they barely drink at all outside of Kramer, who could relate to that?"
Love Around,"I didn't hate it, but I don't think it's aged well. It was groundbreaking at the time, for sure. A cynical, pointed comedy for an increasingly cynical audience, and the humor was such that it didn't matter that Seinfeld couldn't act and George, Kramer and Newman were ridiculous, one-dimensional caricatures. But I think if anything, the audience has passed it by. The edginess is gone and what you have left is stilted delivery of material that is no longer surprising.

Just my (unpopular) opinion, of course."
Love Around,"Ya that's the tag line I've heard used here in America over the years, I just happen to agree :)"
Love Around,This is interesting because I can't stand BBT.
Love Around,What shows do you like?
Love Around,"BBC have never been good at showing American shows. Seinfeld, Larry Sanders and Arrested Development were all on BBC, but they constantly changed the times and put them on at weird times, before just dropping them all together. I think it was on on Sky, but most people don't have Sky, especially back then."
Love Around,"Me and my best friend used to watch it every day after school. This was 10 years ago now. I think it was Paramount? Either way if we didn't have Sky, we would never have known how awesome it was. Those were the days, eating super-noodles and laughing at George Costanza"
Love Around,"It's a shame Channel 4 didn't get the rights to it. They seemed to know what to do with US imports back then, Friends, Frasier, Will and Grace, ER, NYPD, The Sopranos, etc. All seemed to do well with Channel 4. It's a pity they don't really do that so much anymore."
Love Around,"As in the most loved sitcom? Probably Fawlty Towers, Only Fools and Horses or Blackadder. Only Fools and Horses kind of ruined it by having poor Christmas specials every year for about ten years after the series finished though."
Love Around,"Faulty Towers.  Massivly popular and also of the highest standard, just like Seinfeld."
Love Around,"It's a bit older but only fools and horses has always been the nations favourite sitcom, started in the 80s but reruns still air daily."
Love Around,"There isn't really a UK Seinfeld. I suppose a long running British comedy that nearly everyone here loves would be ""Only fools & Horses"""
Love Around,Please let it be Coronation Street
Love Around,Festivus is a Seinfeld reference. It's basically a holiday in which George's dad creates to replace Christmas because he once fought with person over a doll. He's not a sane man.
Love Around,You're welcome ! I will always remember this as the day I almost caught Reddit Gold.
Love Around,"Most of the night shows on CC are pretty old over here.. Married with children, Fraiser, Dharma & Greg etc... "
Love Around,We also got the Seinfeld -> Mad about you -> Friends transitions too. Friends was always a dumbed down version of Seinfeld. 
Love Around,Oh can you imagine... Gerard Signfield and his television programme regarding the utterly inconsequential!
Love Around,"To my knowledge it's considered just another sitcom here in Finland. My opinion is that it's ok, just like like Friends."
Love Around,"I've seen it every now and then on Sky 1. BBC has also shown it in the past, but lacked commitment."
Love Around,"I'd say that in Sweden, Curb is a lot less known than Seinfeld. 

Seinfeld was on weekly during an era where there was a more limited number of channels, and scheduled TV still ruled. Curb is one of those shows that mainly TV buffs would talk about and follow.

 It's title also got a rather poor translation: ""Simma lungt, Larry"" (lit: ""Swim calmly, Larry"", better translation: ""live easy""/""take it cool"") which I'm certain made lots of people ignore it. "
Love Around,Don't you mean *spectacular*?
Love Around,Holy shit thank you! Do you know if there's an alternate link for the simpsons stream they used to have? I've missed that one dearly. 
Love Around,[deleted]
Love Around,"don't get me wrong I don't watch BBT of my own accord I just find the show characters more likeable, as a show I would watch BBT over Seinfeld. If I just have to watch 5 minutes of the best parts then for sure its Seinfeld."
Love Around,"Arrested Development was on BBC? Crazy. Maybe I got into it late. 

To be honest I rarely notice what's on tv, I download or netflix it. Prime example: I only just found out that Breaking Bad hasn't aired here since season 3, and that was on channel 5. Yet there's always room for programming like Big Fat Gypsy Weddings. "
Love Around,"Yes, Channel 4 had alot of imports but with the exception of Friends they all had very poor ratings when broadcast during 'prime time'. Will and Grace would get more viewers on T4 Sundays than it would on Friday nights."
Love Around,I've heard this a few times-- I'll have to check it out.
Love Around,[deleted]
Love Around,Literally none of those shows play here in America on CC. Wow.
Love Around,Couldn't agree more with your last line.
Love Around,[deleted]
Love Around,Oh wow I didn't know that. Crazy how different the name is haha
Love Around,">They weren't likeable people at all.  

Which is the entire point of the show. They aren't likeable. They're bad, selfish people. Maybe since that was so rare to see on TV (among ""protagonists"" anyway), it's what made it as popular as it was. "
Love Around,That is literally the plot line of the final episode. After years of being assholes it finally caught up with them. 
Love Around,"Yeah, I know.  Was making a poorly flavored joke."
Love Around,"I think Arrested Development was on the front cover of the Radio Times before it was first shown. It was originally shown at like 8pm on a Wednesday for the first few weeks, then they started moving it round. Think it ended up late night on BBC4 or something, not sure if they went as far as season 3.

Are Channel 5 the only channel that still buys American drama now? Everything else ends up on Sky Atlantic, which is annoying."
Love Around,"Yeah, it was ""for British eyes only"""
Love You,"Oh man, I hope her docs can find a way to manage her symptoms!

Best of luck!"
Love You,My wife has it. Don't wish this on my worst enemy. It's just so humbling to have no idea what your body will be capable of each day. Stay strong to those who are also suffering.
Love You,Let’s give a quick shoutout to Christina Applegate!
Love You,"Jeez, so Christina Applegate, Selma Blair, Emma Caulfield are all fighting MS. Wonder how many other actors are silently fighting this?"
Love You,Man beatinv breast cancer diagnosis at such a young age just to come back to get this 🥺
Love You,"She has been dealt such a shit hand health wise between the cancer scares and now MS. Christina is one of my favourite actresses and Dead to Me was her masterpiece, I’m glad she was able to get it done while she still could."
Love You,Two of America's sweethearts in that picture. And the world loves them very much.
Love You,"Christina Applegate is amazing. She and her mother were staying at a hotel I was working at almost 20 years ago, and I had a great conversation with them one evening, and she couldn't have been more gracious and kind. Just a genuinely nice person. I really hope she's able to fight this."
Love You,Quick shoutout to Christina Applegate
Love You,"I watched that “oops we killed the babysitter“ flick so many times.

Christina taught me how to be a strong career oriented woman, and im not even a woman."
Love You,That girl cannot catch a break.
Love You,It’s not just a physical issue.. people don’t understand the half of it. Depression hits an all time high and people distance themselves from you that aren’t true family and friends in times of need.
Love You,Awe Katie & David were there. How sweet 🥺.
Love You,"She's so amazing. I hate that she has yet another tragedy to deal with, and she's still finishing her show for us. We don't deserve it."
Love You,Samantha Who was pretty good
Love You,"Love right back to her. From being a Bundy to shaking her booty with Cameron and Selma to anchoring with Ron, Christina has given stellar performances for decades. 

Now I hope she can rest and fully focus on this next journey; knowing she has the full support of her fans."
Love You,How can you not love Christina? I grew up with her having watched her on Married with Children… I feel she’s like a sister to me.
Love You,Her role in Vacation is by far my favorite roll she's ever played. Her doing the obstacle course and suffering from the hangover in that rediculous van had me crying with laughter.
Love You,This woman has dealt with more than her fair share. Wish her the best.
Love You,Love how Peg was there for literal support
Love You,Surprised Ed O’Neill wasn’t there
Love You,And god bless Katey Sagel for being right there with her !
Love You,"Awww, Kelly Bundy we love you too."
Love You,Fuck MS.
Love You,I adore her. Always have. Wish her every blessing in this very difficult journey. So brave.
Love You,Oh fuck.  I didn't know she had been diagnosed MS
Love You,I appreciate your bravery. It has been hard for me to actually accept my diagnosis and it has been more than five years. Fortunately for me. I have the recurring/remitting kind. It is still scary to know that at any time it can all go terribly wrong.
Love You,Awwww and Katie is there... oh here comes the feels 💖
Love You,"My mom had MS and only lived until she was 46, I know how crippling of a disability it can be for someone."
Love You,"Poor woman can’t catch a break with her health. Hopefully she will have good luck with treatment though, there are a lot more options than there used to be for MS. The new biologics and stem cell treatments are helping a lot of folks manage it pretty well. 

I feel for her though, I had a really bad bout with mono that lasted like a year and pretty much almost killed me. Some years after I had a bunch of weird nervous system issues that they thought might have been MS and I was terrified, it’s definitely a scary diagnosis. Thankfully my blood work has remained ok and they never found any lesions on MRI, most of those symptoms went away and haven’t returned as of yet (knock on wood) so my doc thinks I’m in the clear. Hopefully was just a freak thing, but knowing the link between EBV and MS along with how bad my body got rocked by that virus is a little scary."
Love You,best of luck to her ❤️ hope she is doing well
Love You,May she find peace.
Love You,"I get y’all are sending your sympathies, but jeez everybody is acting like this put the nail in the coffin for her. MS is an awful disease, believe me I know, but the worst thing you can do to a chronically ill person is act like they are dead/dying. Life got a little different for her, and she will continue to live it!"
Love You,[deleted]
Love You,I'm kinda sad that Ed O'Neill didn't show up for this when Katey and David did.
Love You,She really let herself go....
Love You,Shoutout to christina applegate
Love You,Poor woman has been through so much already
Love You,I would swear I heard about this years ago.  But maybe I am thinking of Selma Blair.
Love You,"I’m a big fan of Christina, really feel sad about her diagnosis of MS."
Love You,"Damn. This is a wonderfully gifted comedic actor. And from what I know, a genuinely good person. :/"
Love You,Didn’t she also have a double mastectomy due to cancer? Keep up the good fight. I’ll be cheering.
Love You,"Poor Kelly!!! I’m not normally one to care about celebrities. I was raised by Married with children. 
I just learned her and my middle daughter share a birthday. 

I hope she and her medical team can manage it for a long time and she has a good quality of life."
Love You,She’s a really good person and I hope she can still live well
Love You,"I’m right on top of that, Rose!

Best movie for young girls ever."
Love You,"We have been watching Married with Children again recently, I loved her in everything she was in."
Love You,Touching but very heartbreaking
Love You,"Man between breast cancer and MS she has had a rough go of it, hope everything works out for the best. This woman deserves a break."
Love You,"I don't know how risky it is, but a friend of mine with MS tried everything and kept getting worse, eventually went to Thailand for a stem cell treatment.

It's kind of like a reboot where they basically nuke your immune system with chemo, give you stem cells, and hope they regrow without the auto immune, self attacking MS aspect.

She isn't ""better"", in that she is still at the state before she left, but hasn't gotten worse since. So it seems like it worked."
Love You,New breakthroughs every day and lots happening
Love You,"That Eric Andre ep is always gonna hit different now, she deserves that shout out"
Love You,It's like 90 degrees in here
Love You,"Woah, Bundy!!!!!"
Love You,Gillian Barbari
Love You,You listen to Wakka Flocka at all?
Love You,I was surprised at how prolific MS appears to be.  Wishing her the best and looking forward to seeing the last season of Dead to Me.
Love You,"Jamie Lynn Sigler was diagnosed while she was still filming The Sopranos. She was very young, I don’t think she opened up about it until very recently."
Love You,"For those of us they are a bit older and remember Teri Garr, she has it as well."
Love You,"Emma Caulfield too?? God fucking damn it  :(

It’s so weird that it’s all these actresses of the same age and level of celebrity, and they all seem really nice too. I wish them all the best."
Love You,"It seems quite common.

I'm interested in the fact that studies are making links to Mono/Epstein-Barr virus possibly setting the wheels in motions for MS down the line. I'm wondering if we'll see that with more illnesses in the future.

https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/epstein-barr-virus-found-to-trigger-multiple-sclerosis/"
Love You,"Rachel Miner, too. Loved her in Californication and Supernatural."
Love You,">Emma Caulfield

Is Emma the one from *Timer*?"
Love You,[deleted]
Love You,I literally finished the final episode like 15 minutes ago. I cried my eyes out. So many emotions.
Love You,It's really uplifting that they're still close and support each other.
Love You,Follow up question - what is this?
Love You,Don’t Tell Mom the Babysitter’s dead…metallicabreath
Love You,"Very good, underrated movie.  Prior to seeing that, I had that stereotype of Kelly Bundy going, and she just completely obliterated it."
Love You,This. My wife has it and so much of it is stuff like depression and fatigue and other things that aren’t the “typical” symptoms folks talk about. It’s truly awful
Love You,"It would have been really great if Ed was there too, but I'm sure he had some prior commitment he couldn't get out of."
Love You,"It was!  I think it was partly a bad title that sunk it, though."
Love You,"I don't think I've seen that! It's on my list now. My favorite is Dead to Me, followed closely by Samantha Who."
Love You,I'm sure it was because he just couldn't make it for some reason. He showed up at Katy's star unveiling and spoke warmly about them all being family. There's also [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htMI951uia0) if you need anymore proof that they get along.

Love You,"So ignorant. [Everything Christina Applegate has said about MS, from weight gain to filming Dead to Me](https://netflixlife.com/2022/11/16/christina-applegate-ms-multiple-sclerosis-dead-to-me/amp/)"
Love You,"Also, didn't her old boyfriend upload a bunch of nude pictures of her?  Another BF recently died of an OD.

What a rough life."
Love You,Right?! Give a girl a freaking break! She’s an American treasure!
Love You,"There’s research into how stress affects the immune system and increases the risk of both MS and cancer. Different kinds of hidden stress as well, like people pleasing weirdly. There’s a book by Gabor mate  about it."
Love You,Same thing I was thinking. She was handed a shit stick health wise. It’s amazing that she can stay positive. She’s a good soul…
Love You,"IIRC, the MS can be a side effect of the chemo."
Love You,There is no working out for the best with MS. It’s terminal and agonizingly slow deterioration
Love You,A distant acquaintance of mine mentioned getting chemo for their MS. I didn't know that was a possible treatment. Now I am wondering if they also travelled and got stem cells.
Love You,My stepdad is about to do his second run of stem cell treatment this today and it’s the same as you said. They don’t miraculously start walking but it’s better than watching them waste away in a month. Saddest reality I’ve ever faced
Love You,Chemo for MS is very dangerous. The treated person has no immune system at all. One germ/virus and you can die. Only used in severe cases of progression. Progression is irreversible. When damage is done it is done.
Love You,BLEUEGH 🤮
Love You,"The NEW ALLANTE!!!! {bounce, bounce}"
Love You,"Yeah, it’s a surprise each time someone comes out. All the strength to them in their battles. All three of the women I mentioned are amazing, it’s a joy when they pop up in something I’m watching."
Love You,"I may be mistaken but MS is not well understood in terms of aetiology, when last I had training on it in 2021, we were told it’s often a genetic disposition and environmental trigger that sparks it. 

So I wonder if there’s something in the air in wherever these people spent a lot of time. I’m sure someone not on a phone would look up research but I’m not them."
Love You,"My Mom was diagnosed with MS in 1987, and lived with it until she passed of a pulmonary embolism in 2016. 

She had a bout with meningitis when she was young, and was kind of “sickly” as one of my aunts remembers it. Poor woman never got a fair break, and she passed at 60 years old. I miss her dearly, and watching her struggle with her disease was hard. She could not tolerate hot temperatures. She was really difficult with big, stressful life events. Plus she had some mobility issues, including the “shuffle” that lots of people with MS had. Poor coordination, and it was eventually this bad coordination that lead to her taking a fall, that set in motion the events that lead to her passing. 

Only later did I find out that blood clots were pretty common for people with MS. I wish I knew that before, as maybe we could have prepped for the possibility, and maybe things would be different. She never lived long enough to see me get married, or buy my home. Life was better with her."
Love You,It’s a sadly common disease. I know two people in my personal life that were diagnosed with it. One of which was only 37 when she got diagnosed.
Love You,"Yeah, I do remember Teri Garr very well.  When I was a kid back in the 80s and early 90s, she was in everything.  She virtually disappeared shortly after she went public with her MS.  The last thing I saw her in was in Ghost World and that was over twenty years ago."
Love You,EBV may be a trigger for ME/CFS as well so I’m not not surprised.
Love You,"I wasn't aware she had MS.  I saw her in Supernatural a long time ago and while she was very good, I noticed she got really heavy, particularly around the face.  I'd assumed she was sick in some way, and that was probably a side effect of whatever medication she was on, now it makes sense."
Love You,"My diagnosis took about 3 years. That’s the thing about an MS diagnosis, it’s like, all this fucked-up shit is already happening to your body, and you already feel hopeless and broken, the diagnosis is honestly just a door opening to treatments and support, and at least for me, a huge relief."
Love You,"That’s how my friend who got diagnosed felt. She didn’t have mobility issues, but she would just go through periods of debilitating exhaustion. She was only 37 and a new mom so of course doctors just wrote it off as stress and a poor diet, but it was like unreal exhaustion. Like she physically did not have the strength to move out of bed some mornings. Her diagnosis allowed her to get treatment that significantly improved the quality of her life."
Love You,I just finished it now. The finale was beautiful and heartbreaking at the same time. Gonna be thinking about those two characters for a while. Christina and Linda made magic happen on screen.
Love You,Watch the Eric Andre Show
Love You,Looks like a clamp of some sort?
Love You,Multiple sclerosis: when the immune system start attacking the brain.
Just You,"Sorry everyone.  It's my fault.

My daughter likes to do her homework with Netflix on the iPad next to her, and when she came back with some failing marks, I told her that this arrangement was finished.  I then logged in and hit ""sign out of all devices"". 

I thought it only applied to things under my own account!
"
Just You,someone finally broke kimmy Schmidt 
Just You,Mine started working again about 10 minutes ago. It probably heard me say I was about to watch something on Hulu instead.
Just You,They filled it with so many shitty B movies that it exploded.
Just You,It was working 100% fine for me when all this was going on. Huh.
Just You,"Hey OP, I’m also binging the Staircase, do you know where I can find a thread where people are discussing it? It’s not as artfully crafted as Making a Murderer but I’m still hooked and I’m curious to see what others think about it. "
Just You,Sorry I didn’t comment earlier I was watching Netflix 
Just You,Thank you ! I was upset there for a minute
Just You,Working fine for me in Canada
Just You,I never experienced any problems and I've been watching the last several hours. Lucky me I guess? 
Just You,lol didnt net neutrality expire today?
Just You,"Aaaah, that is why my internet is working so quickly today."
Just You,"They still snail-mail DVD's, y'know.

In case it takes a while."
Just You,"working fine for me, but thanks for the minor heart attack "
Just You,Netflix making space for a new season of Imposters hopefully 
Just You,And people questioned net neutrality. It ended yesterday everyone.
Just You,http://www.isitdownrightnow.com/netflix.com.html
Just You,Are they prorating next months subscription for time down?
Just You,"You did the right thing by telling us. We’re not mad, just disappointed. "
Just You,Damnit
Just You,"Still less of that on Netflix than there are on Prime, at least in Canada.  So much crap that barely had a home on Twitch or YouTube, let alone a full-blown media streaming service like Prime.  :\"
Just You,"Yup, no interruption in our endless TNG marathon this afternoon/evening."
Just You,"I haven’t looked yet I wanted to experience it all first. I’m sure there’ll be plenty of threads when people finish! Yeah it’s not quite as good as The Jinx or Making a Murderer, but well made and intriguing. I really like the defense attorney, he handles everything really well (except when he’s yelling at the PowerPoint guy haha)"
Just You,"It did.  I'm surprised I can browse any websites at all, or at least that's what Reddit drama queens would have you believe 6 months ago."
Just You,What's a DVD?
Just You,"There was an email informing me I had control over everyone's logins, but I must have immediately deleted it assuming it was a promotion for another wretched Adam Sandler project.

Again, I'm truly sorry. "
Just You,It's a MIRACLE!
Just You,I know I felt bad for power point guy. Although I definitely get the feel the Peterson is full of shit. Like in episode two when the defense lawyer tells him about the guy who came forward about having a sexual relationship with him and he acts all incredulous. 
Just You,Not a single person said everything would change the day after. The only people saying that are people going out of their way to misrepresent the argument. 
Just You,They will have a resurgence after the nuclear war puts an end to the net.
Just You,You're grounded. No Hulu for a week.
Just You,"Interesting, I came out thinking he's like 80% likely innocent, and 100% deserving of a ""not guilty"" verdict. "
Just You,I'd rather play with puppets than go back to that resolution.
Just You,That's not even a punishment.
Just You,"I’m on episode 7 and I think it was sometime in episode 5 when I found myself realizing I actually thought he wasn’t guilty also. I hope to finish it tonight, but I’ve definitely changed my mind from for sure guilty to probably innocent. "
Just You,Wow I 100% actually think he’s innocent now. So sad. 
Just You,"It really seems, to me, that the state found he had gay porn and was so disgusted with that that they really thought anyone so twisted to be gay also had to be a murderer. Durham may be in North Carolina but it's a Carolina and that snooty DA assistant wears her homophobia all over her face."
Just You,"Make you look up the stuff not included in the doc, like the financial motive. "
Just You,"Omg yes! I just watched her closing argument and it was dripping with disdain, but boy was it powerful. Ugh I have to work tomorrow but I want to finish this tonight!"
Just You,Is it something the prosecution brings up the documentary didn’t include? 
Just You,Yeah
Just You,God. I still can't believe this happened 
Just You,i liked it back then and i like it now.
Just You,"Twin Peaks fans: Man, I hope Cooper returns tonight.

Just You,One of the greatest moments of this television year.
Just You,I laugh every time I remember the scene in the original series. When this happened last episode I lost my shit. Renee? being moved to tears just made it even funnier
Just You,"It's not that bad, sounds like a Deerhunter song to me"
Just You,This was the most head-turning moment! I literally opened my eyes wide opened to the brim when I heard those familiar strings
Just You,"When I heard his name announced I started explaining the ""Just you and I"" song to my wife, and was left stunned when he actually started ""singing"".  One of my favourite parts this season, even if I found the original scene super cringy."
Just You,I yelled out loud and then had to skip it. How many more times are we going to have to hear this awful song...
Just You,[deleted]
Just You,"Neither can I, but we're the only ones. It's JUUUUUSSSSSTTT YYYYYYOOOOOUUUUUU AND IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII"
Just You,"We've been trolled by the great David Lynch himself.

LYNCH'D."
Just You,Can someone explain why this is such a big deal? Like everyone on the twin peaks subreddit is going nuts and I don't get it. Did everyone hate James? I thought he was pretty OK. 
Just You,James has always been cool.
Just You,"I fucking love it man, I play it on my ipod every now and then. It gives me a nostalgic feeling for a time I wasn't around for."
Just You,"Twin Peaks fans: Man, I hope we see Audrey soon

Just You,fuck u james was always cool
Just You,heretic
Just You,You sicken me 
Just You,"his arc on season two was pointless and annoying, have been happy that he has barely been in this season
"
Just You,Forever. 
Just You,"Yeah a lot of people found the original song to be either cringy or silly or they just hate James in general. 

I'm with you though. James suffered from a couple bad plots but I still like him and I unabashedly love this song. It's meant to be melodramatic and saccharine. Much like a lot of other elements of the show. "
Just You,"James is kind of generally looked down upon as this sort of dopey guy that the show really wants you to believe is a cool loner.

This season they are clearly having some fun with this perception, with this song, and in one of the earlier episodes when we first see James and Shelly says something like ""James is still cool. James was always cool."""
Just You,James has always been cool 
Just You,"> Besides working at the Great Northern, the only thing we know about James is that a motorcycle accident made him “quiet.” Will the circumstances surrounding that accident be addressed?
I’m not allowed to say anything! Sorry! You’re going to have to wait and situate. This whole thing has been such a trip, that’s all I’m allowed to say.  
  
> And he’s different in ways that we’ll find out later.  
  
Crazy how it will actually play into the whole thing, if I get it right. It was probably more than just a regular accident.  
  
I actually liked the song and the character, and after reading the article I have a lot more respect for the guy."
Just You,">“I’m not even going to watch another episode! This is so frustrating! They’re not tying up the characters at all! I can’t believe it!” **But yet they keep on watching it.**

This happens with so many shows. 

I have no idea why people want to spend many hours of their life watching stuff they don't enjoy. There is so much TV out there, it's a waste of time in my opinion. "

Just You,two and a half men is multi cam right so it reuses sets a lot or whatever probably and doesn't do a lot of on location filming.
Just You,Multi camera v single camera. Single camera  has more locations  and more takes v multi camera shot mostly on reused sets with a couple takes at most.
Just You,"Multicam shows are more like doing a play, you can run through a lot more of the show in one take and cover a lot more angles at a time. Longer takes + fewer setups = much shorter days."
Just You,"Actor/entertainment worker here.

Multi camera sitcoms like 2 and Half Men, Big Bang Theory, Seinfeld, all are shot like stage plays that are also being recorded. The actors have to memorize all their lines and scenes and marks and it takes a lot of preparation. But you show up to one location (the set). All the set locations are built for you (the office, the house, the back yard, etc). Lighting is already set up. And in a few hours on filming day you can shoot a 22 minute episode. The general order of things is something similar to this: script is Monday. Table read/rewrites Tuesday (and of course throughout the week). Rehearsals/camera blocking Wednesday and Thursday. Friday is filming. Maybe a handful of pickup shots throughout the week. But it's a very efficient way to do things. 

On a single camera show, you're not limited to a few sets. The scope of those shows usually means a larger number of locations. And often you're traveling to them. And with that, it requires more time to set up. Everything has to be lit, set dressed, etc. You're not just shooting the same three walls week after week. You need four walls and you have to find them often in new places. You have to close down streets and coordinate stuff. And like the name implies, generally there are a lot of shots only using one camera, or at least that's the aesthetic. So you have to set up constantly for new shots. And setting up those shots takes time to coordinate lighting, camera people, actors, etc. It's more involved. So rather than set up for one big scene to be filmed at a time from afar, you're setting up hundreds of shots to be filmed individually. You're filming every day rather than on one day. It's constant. It's going to take longer filming 4-8 pages a day versus shooting it all in one quick go of things.

Granted, you could still do single cam like a play with the only difference being people hold the cameras and there's no audience. It's Always Sunny shoots most of their bar stuff that way. But what happens with those styles is that you often have more locations to go to because you can. It's not just everything in the house/office/bar. And you're spending a lot of time traveling and getting things perfect. You're less likely to see shots of actors covering their mouths and laughing like you would with friends. You have more passes and retakes of doing the thing. There's less structure in that style of creating that just expands the schedule."
Just You,Game shows are the best production schedule. Bang off a couple of weeks shows in a couple of days.
Just You,"My Name is Earl was a single cam show with locations that were a mix of soundstages and on location. Two and a Half Men was a Multi-camera show shot exclusively on one soundstage with very occasional trips to a backlot.

Multi-camera is often shot with a live studio audience. They're often there for a long time, but it's not like 10 hours. You can literally just brute force scenes through and it's a lot like live theater with the same urgency and energy.

Multi-camera sitcoms are also usually all shot on one soundstage with a couple permanent main sets all adjacent to one another. Changing locations for a scene usually just means scooting over to the left or right by a few feet. On special occasions they will shoot exteriors, always on a backlot. They do these sorts of scenes infrequently because they are more expensive.

Multi-camera sitcoms are... multi-camera. You have a few cameras recording the same action. In single cam shows, you have to reshoot a scene again from scratch if you want a different angle. Every time you move a camera you have to adjust lights, focus, move production equipment around so it's not in the shot, etc. Takes time.

Film sets are a lot of ""hurry up and wait."" It's long hours, but a lot of that time is involved with the technical process of setting up a shot. For multi-cam sitcoms, a lot of that tech debt is done ahead of time before the actors even show up for the day. All the lighting is figured out ahead of time and camera movements are simple and routine."
Just You,">  I was just listening to Ashton kutcher on Howard Stern and besides the crazy facts that he made $750k an episode on 2 and half men

Why is that a crazy fact?

Kutcher is an A lister who was replacing the lead of a hugely successful show whose main character's public image had disintegrated. Kutcher had everything to loose."
Just You,"In a sense, his relationship with his father drove him to make that much money."
Just You,Imagine working 8 hour days and earning that much money 🤯
Just You,Because sitcoms are always 1 set.
Just You,"*He* worked 8 hour days. I bet the crew and background were there 12-14 hours. My kid is typically on sets for tv shows 12-14 hours at a time, but not every day. And, most don’t film on weekends. 😂"
Just You,Live studio audience? I didn't watch 2 and a half men.
Just You,"Eh, you've already got answers, but I'll add the main one I don't see anyone else saying. 

It's shot regularly on a soundstage at a studio. Most of the crew is union, so you avoid overtime by making it 8 hour days to stay within budget. 

Also, the live audience can't be there more than 8 hours because of some laws or something. 

Also studio time is framed around an 8 hour day."
Just You,"Sitcom is predictable, like every week is the same and you know what to expect:

Example

Monday 
Table read through 

Tuesday 
Blocking on set

Wednesday
Read and blocking

Thursday and Friday audience show

Also Ashton was a well seasoned actor and the 2-1/2 men set was a well oiled machine when he was added on."
Just You,"Number of cameras, number of scenes, number of actors, number of locations. All lower. Sitcoms cost way less time and money to make."
Just You,"Most of the the entire show takes place in the same living room and sometimes kitchen, yes."
Just You,Whereas so much of *Earl* was shot outdoors.
Just You,Which also means the lighting and the like is a known factor. Effectively a setting you want for the set as opposed to setting stuff up and then not have it look how you want it and messing with it until it’s perfect
Just You,"Also if it has a studio audience (which I believe Men did), then they probably have set times for the actual tapings so there's some sort of regularity for the crowds they bring in."
Just You,"Yep. ""Single camera"" is basically like shooting a movie, both on location and on sets. ""Multi camera"" is the old fashioned 4 camera sitcom style which is largely confined to 2/3 sets.

The location work of single cam leads to long 12-14 hour days, just like any other film or tv show and you shoot five days a week. Multi cam hours are much saner since you're all just working on the same soundstage and only actually shoot two days a week. The rest of the week is spent rehearsing. Source: me, I work on both kinds of shows. Lots of people behind the scenes prefer to work on multi-cam."
Just You,Almost 3 times as many takes…
Just You,Is it also a shorter day because of child actor(s)?
Just You,"Judge Judy had the best job. [3 days a week, every other week, $50 million a year. ](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/judge-judys-year-round-schedule-enormous-salary-and-career-advice/ODBY5UBHX32JC3AJEI5IL2PSNY/)"
Just You,Yes. My kid has been an audience filler on a few shows like Family Feud back when the kid first started acting and this is how it was done. One long day to do a week’s worth of episodes.
Just You,"Wait until they hear the person Kutcher initially replaced was making $1.8 million/episode

Chewing Gum,">""When there are police involved, and footage, of people carrying your sleeping writer into dangerous places, when cuts are found, when there’s blood … what is your job?""

I'm confused though, if there's video evidence of the suspects, why aren't there any charges?

"
Chewing Gum,That’s terrible.
Chewing Gum,"Hopefully someone clarify, but I'm having a hard time putting together a coherent narrative based on her testimony, here are her comments:

>""I had an episode due at 7 a.m. I took a break and had a drink with a good friend who was nearby. **I emerged into consciousness typing season two**, many hours later. I was lucky. I had a flashback. It turned out I’d been sexually assaulted by strangers.""   
>  
>""When there are police involved, and footage, of **people carrying your sleeping writer** into dangerous places, when cuts are found, when there’s blood … what is your job?""

&#x200B;

So let's break this down:

1. Under pressure to deliver a deadline the next morning at 7am, she goes out for a drink with a friend. *(Why go out drinking if she has an urgent deadline?)*
2. She gets blackout drunk to the extent that she doesn't wake up being carried out, or rouse any suspicion at the bar/restaurant. *(Why does her ""good friend"" abandon her? Why get blackout drunk before a 7am deadline? Any witnesses at the bar to indicate whether she blacked out at the bar?)*  
OR
3. She is drugged and abducted. *(The question remains about why her friend abandoned her blacked out or why there are no witnesses at the bar.)*
4. She is carried away by the plural ""people"", so at least 2 people carried her across town. 
5. Whether drunk or drugged, she ""emerges into consciousness"" at the office, at her desk, typing away at a script. *(Is it consistent with trauma to have major memory loss, and coming-to while engaging in a complex cerebral activity? Was she carried by the ""people"" to be raped in the office? Or did she walk back to the office and continue writing after the trauma, while blackout drunk/drugged?)*
6. Once realising that she had cuts and blood, she calls the show producers instead of the police or checking herself into a hospital.

So many questions. The story doesn't seem to add up imo. Did she go to the hospital eventually? Surely you'd want to get checked and treated for STDs etc. Is she pursuing the issue with the police? Surely you would want justice for such a brazen violent crime in full public view. Instead of seeking justice, she's complaining about the way her producers handled her deadline, and making comments like this: ""Like any other experience I’ve found traumatic, it’s been therapeutic to write about it, and actively twist a narrative of pain into one of hope, and even humor.""

Chewing Gum,No one cares
Chewing Gum,"Unfortunately, not every rapist gets their just desserts.

There was a Channel 5 documentary last November talking to ten rape survivors (one male, nine female) and of the group, only two of them saw their attacker in court and only one of them saw their rapist jailed.

It's a damn shame, honestly."
Chewing Gum,"She seems to imply she knows who assaulted based on video evidence of her being carried away by these people and that the producers know who they are as well. How would she know there's footage if she hasn't seen it? Did they destroy it? Then surely they are complicit in obstruction of justice.

I agree it seems odd if there was physical evidence of forced penetration, if her drink was spiked and there's CCTV of her being carried off... why wasn't there an investigation? Hell, why not say something sooner? And why expect the producers to be responsible for meting out justice and punishments? That's what the legal system is for. If I help fund a show's production, I'm expected to maybe be asked for more money in the budget, not to handle a rape case investigation. 

EDIT: It's so nice to see the idiots decide to downvote rather than reply. Sorry logic offends you."
Chewing Gum,"Video surveillance isn't necessarily enough to be able to identify someone. In many cases it's only going to give you a rough description of the person. And even if there's a clear image of their face, you still need someone to compare it to. "
Chewing Gum,"> (Why go out drinking if she has an urgent deadline?)

Writers tend to drink. There are actually scientific studies that suggest it helps with the creative process. Also, people engaged in stressful work sometimes want to take breaks. Walking away from things for a little while can also help stimulate creativity. 

Her narrative is a little out of order, but the implication seems to be that someone spiked her drink, she was taken somewhere, then made her way back to the office while still drugged, and fully snapped out of it when she was back there. Yes, other details are lacking, but it's not a police report. "
Chewing Gum,[deleted]
Chewing Gum,[removed]
Chewing Gum,But... Video evidence... Were they wearing masks or something?
Chewing Gum,How many of them passed out at work and apparently know there's footage of them being carried off unconscious before they woke the next day with signs of rape or forced penetration? I'm assuming most of them weren't raped at work on office premises and aware of CCTV footage of them being carried away.
Chewing Gum,"I'm getting heavily downvoted here, but I'm not suggesting that no assault took place, just that the story as presented currently, doesn't add up. Whether that's a failure of the journalists who are covering this to provide sufficient details, or whether the incident itself is sinister, what we're being presented is suspicious. I'm simply asking for clarification, not making accusations. "
Chewing Gum,[removed]
Chewing Gum,It says there's video evidence of someone carrying a person. That's not a crime 
Chewing Gum,[deleted]
Chewing Gum,"They may have just filmed the act and not shown anything to identify them, which the police then have to watch repeatedly if they have the footage to figure out who it might be, take DNA from them and match it (if she gave DNA samples in the days after the assault).

Even then, there's still no guarantee they'll be charged, let alone jailed."
Chewing Gum,[removed]
Chewing Gum,"If that person appears to be passed out and then the next day cuts, vaginal tears and bleeding around her genitals are found AFTER it appears she fell unconscious and was carried off, it wouldn't take fucking Sherlock Holmes to put two and two together here. ""Passed out woman carried away by men wakes up with signs of rape""... hmm, what possible could have happened? Guess she just slid down a rough set of stair bannisters that hadn't been sanded. /s

Come the fuck on. "
Chewing Gum,"We should automatically believe the victims.

EDIT: While it is good to see this bullshit is downvoted, I'm perplexed to see the parent not much different than this still has positive score."
Chewing Gum,Even then some places have a backlog of rape kits they haven't tested yet for some crimes. 
Chewing Gum,"Why would they film their own crime? More to the point, if they did, doesn't that kind of automatically frame them as the actual fucking culprits who made their own evidence? 

"
Chewing Gum,[removed]
Chewing Gum,The justice system is a bit more complex than ‘putting two and two together’ 
Chewing Gum,"I get that you asking “what possibly could’ve happened?” was supposed to be rhetorical, but seriously. About 10,000 different things could have happened. That’s why the standard of proof is so high in the legal system. I’m surprised you don’t already know this. "
Chewing Gum,"> t wouldn't take fucking Sherlock Holmes to put two and two together here

That's not how a trial works, though."
Chewing Gum,"because the person who carried her, would say they carried her back to an office or somewhere else so she could sleep. Then you have to prove that the person who carried her off raped her. If there is no physical evidence it becomes increasingly difficult to convict anyone. Just because something doesnt look good doesnt mean its evidence of a crime and thats a problem with getting a conviction. "
Chewing Gum,Personally speaking yes but legally that’s not enough. As a Redditor I’m fairly convinced but if I was a juror with that as the case I couldn’t convict. I’d be sad about it but it’s too much speculation. 
Chewing Gum,"Come the fuck on, are you pretending to be retarded or are you baiting or are you actually retarded?

Someone carrying someone does not beyond reasonable doubt prove rape.

""I took her to her room and then I left. I don't know who did it.""

^ How can you convict that? What if that person actually just took her to the room?"
Chewing Gum,"Why?

What about the false rape claims? Do we extend this to petty crimes? Robberies? Theft? Too absurd? So on what legal basis do we not? How do we prove that we didn't do something? All based on alibis? Are you aware of the fact that a lack of alibi is common and does not mean guilt of the crime? Are you aware of the fact that in Law, it is *generally* (emphasis on generally, as *few very specific* exceptions apply) accepted that negative claims cannot be proven by design and thus should not be, whereas only posititive claims can be and thus must (burden of proof). Do you even know what that means?

""Mr. Investigator, this man absolutely stole my money and I absolutely did not game it all away in gambling."" 🤔

You have absolutely *no* idea as to how the reversal of burden of proof would backfire and you are clearly completely uneducated on the matter."
Chewing Gum,"Some people have done that because they're sick fucks who pass it around to their friends. Not all of them get jailed, though. Unfortunately, it's another reason why rape survivors don't report it."
Chewing Gum,"I don't think believing the victim necessarily means we are locking up people willy nilly with no care for the justice system.

When I have heard people talk about the 'believe the victim' mantra it is about getting through the first hurdle that impedes or stops people reporting rape and sexual assault. Many people believe that they either won't be treated seriously, will be interrogated about every little detail, or questioned about why they didn't do x, y, or z. 

If it is taken that the victim is telling the truth when they arrive to talk to the police there is a greater level of comfort and safety in reporting the crime. 

Once all of their statements are in place, and they have established a report with the police the police can go about doing their job."
Chewing Gum,"YES exactly. ""Always believing the victims"" does not mean ""always convict the accused"". 

&#x200B;

When someone talking to you says ""ugh this asshole rear ended me today"" you don't say, ""Hm do you have any proof? Where's the dent exactly? Are sure it wasn't your fault?"" Etc. Etc. 

&#x200B;

Double standards are a wild thing"
Chewing Gum,"Super sad to hear this news. While the show is definitely not for everybody, it is still great comedy with a lot of promise. The two seasons are available on Netflix and I highly recommend watching. Super short and very bingable. "
Chewing Gum,"Oh. The last episode did feel like it could be a decent end for the series, but I still wondered. I hope she makes some other show then. *Chewing Gum* is hilarious. "
Chewing Gum,"aw, bummer.

discovered it on netflix and loved it, we binged it in a sitting.

"
Chewing Gum,"I'm okay with that. It seems a lot like Kimmy Schmidt, in that the series works with a dumb/inexperienced protagonist surrounded by weird people, but nothing ever gets better. Season 1 was fine. It ended in such a way that the series could have been over, and I would have been fine feeling that things were bad, but Tracey and Connor were going to stay together, no matter how bad it got. In that last moment, it felt like they were growing up. The story had a beginning, middle, and end.

Season two fucked that up right out of the gate, and it was just a free-for-all of terrible decisions by *every* character that were mostly too cringe-y to watch."
Chewing Gum,Lost its flavor?
Chewing Gum,Too busy challenging for the NXT title.
Chewing Gum,"I disagree on your sentiment of season 2 to an extent, but I do think that the 'seriousness' tone of the last couple episodes should have not been as sudden as they were."
Chewing Gum,[deleted]
Chewing Gum,"I watched it and thought it was pretty funny, some scenes outright hilarious. I think it's coming back soon too."

Chewing Gum,"I watched few episodes and its hilarious , will catch up soon."
Chewing Gum,Does it get better after episode 1? I thought it was kinda average. It seemed to be going for a more realistic depiction of sex but it's execution was ridiculous and has been overshadowed by other shows like fleabag and you're the worst doing similar things beautifully. I'm willing to give it another chance but if I wasn't a fan of episode 1 will I not like the rest?
Chewing Gum,"Epic, so soon!!!"
Chewing Gum,I'm glad to hear that!!
Chewing Gum,"It only finished airing S2 in the UK like a month ago, S3 is way way off"
Chewing Gum,I absolutely love the irony here
Chewing Gum,"She uses it very well on the show, she gives some hilarious reaction shots."
Chewing Gum,I love it!!
Chewing Gum,Watch episode 2. If you don't like it after that you probably will be better off
Chewing Gum,Yeah I'm surprised there's not more people commenting in here actually. I think based on cover alone it was easy to pass by.
Chewing Gum,Nice! I watched this not too long ago and was left wanting more. Definitely looking forward to this.
Chewing Gum,Yes thank you. I heard they had not renewed it so I'm excited to hear this. One of the funniest shows I've ever seen. 
Chewing Gum,There is a show called Chewing Gum?
Chewing Gum,Hopefully it gets back to season 1 peaks
Chewing Gum,"Dude, Michaela is genius! I love this series!"
Chewing Gum,She’s pretty
Chewing Gum,yeah and it's really good. check it out it's on Netflix
Chewing Gum,It's great.
Chewing Gum,"I really enjoyed season 1. Short but very funny. So far I'm liking the second season even though it's not quite as strong as the first, but I'm only 3 episodes in. I think she's talented since she created and writes the show as well as plays the lead AND she wrote and performed her own theme song. Apparently it was a play before it was a show. I just wish more Channel 4 shows had more than 6 episodes. Same goes for Catastrophe.  "
Chewing Gum,Just finished season 2. The last 3 episodes are utterly hilarious!! 
Chewing Gum,"The only thing I got from this post is that there's a channel that shows nothing but 80s Price is Right, and somehow I'm not watching it right now."
Chewing Gum,This may be the most Reddit post of all
Chewing Gum,"Holy shit, I'm watching an episode right now and just saw something I've never seen before: it was the game where the contestant has to assign prices to 4 different prizes, and then a number lights up showing them how many are wrong, and they have to replace them while a time clock counts down. This time, the people running the game kept getting the number wrong, so Bob Barker stopped time and let the lady replace things. They got it wrong again, and so Barker just said, ""Fuck it, I'm giving you all 4 prizes,"" and they stopped the game and went to commercial..

Amazing. This is why Barker was a class act (and is, because he's still alive at 98)."
Chewing Gum,1 dollar Bob
Chewing Gum,"If you can guess the price of the showcase within the parameters to win it, you watch another episode.  If not, you take a break.  Get some skin in the game!"
Chewing Gum,"Omg, I remember being home sick from school and watching it at 10am as well. There wasnt anything on tv during the day back then, Price Is Right was the best."
Chewing Gum,"I grew up with that show. It’s so silly and goofy and wholesome. Bob Barker became an icon from that show. 

It’s a game show staple. At this point the trinity of game shows is Price, Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune. They might outlast us all"
Chewing Gum,"There is no hope. Give in. Go all in.

Get the suit and microphone. Then start announcing around the house and having family members name off prices. After a couple months you have enough savings to build a couple props from ebay. 

From there you double down even harder. Convince a grocery shop owner to let you work on the premise. You follow shoppers around, yelling price related questions at them. The shoppers couldn't be happier."
Chewing Gum,Thanks.  On my way to Pluto TV.
Chewing Gum,I also recommend watching episodes from the 1970s! The kitchen and living room sets are hilariously hideous!
Chewing Gum,"Are you the mom from ""requiem for a dream""?"
Chewing Gum,"Bob Barker is the OG, but I will not stand for the Drew Carey slander!"
Chewing Gum,God damn as a musician I have to say the bass line of that theme is bitchin'.  Like Geddy Lee level bitchin'.
Chewing Gum,"I'm right there with you. I may not watch nearly as much as you do, but I enjoy viewing a couple hours at a time for many of the same reasons. I just find it fascinating - the fashion, the hair, the technology, the prices, and the seemingly random conversations Bob would have with various members of the audience."
Chewing Gum,"Watch the documentary about price is right, pretty cool"
Chewing Gum,"I had no idea there was a Price is Right channel. I installed Pluto TV and now I am also sucked into the nostalgia void of psychedelic colors, amazing music, 80s fashion and the mildly passive aggressive Bob Barker.

I want to know who designed the set of the Price is Right. It's pure eye candy. Psychedelic consumerism.

I can't get enough of this. Thank you for sharing, I'm having a great time today despite a lot of really stressful messed up shit going down in my life."
Chewing Gum,"#$1, Bob!"
Chewing Gum,I did that with This Old House. Then I found TPIR channel also. At least I can do home repairs now and I'll be able to price all my future projects.
Chewing Gum,You may just see the dude that played Jesse in Breaking Bad.
Chewing Gum,Went to check and dammit now I’m watching too
Chewing Gum,This feels like a twilight zone episode
Chewing Gum,"Try watching 1950s-1960s Price is Right, it is **amazing**"
Chewing Gum,I’m loving 70s Match Game right now.  On at noon on Game Show Network.   Perfect lunch date
Chewing Gum,"PlutoTV is a guilty pleasure like the non-HD cable channels. Yes you are going to get commercials. And yes the content is not A tier (or B, or C). But you don't see anything like it anywhere else. You can scratch that itch for old Kamen Rider or classic Doctor Who while occasionally taking in a Father Dowling mystery or whatever.

Speaking of non-HD TV channels, I am glad to live in a world where Comet exists and I think more people should check it out."
Chewing Gum,"Prey, the new predator movie is off the hook. Really worth checking out and a major departure from the recent predator movies, which is a very good thing."
Chewing Gum,"Born in the 80s, grew up in the 90s. 

Gooble gobble gooble gobble, one of us."
Chewing Gum,There is nothing better than 80s audiences.
Chewing Gum,"The Wheel has done one its job!!

There is no hope for you now, the price is right is with you forever, always in the background guiding you. 

Any object you look at, while your driving, or at work you will constantly be trying to estimate  the retail value. 

every conversation with friends will slowly be hijacked and guided towards price is right fun facts that your friends will not find fun at all.

When you orgasam you'll scream "" COME ON DOWN!!!""

And you will only be able to fall asleep to the yodeling of the Cliffhangers Game

Resign yourself to this fate and please remember to have your pet spayed and neutered."
Chewing Gum,"I caught myself doing the same thing last weekend. It’s hard not to get caught up in the old prizes, large and small (cars, vacations to popcorn poppers) , the old fashions, the old prices. I recall fondly watching this with my grandmother, so it brings me fond memories."
Chewing Gum,"There’s a pretty neat documentary about The Price is Right you might enjoy.

https://youtu.be/HdFKZtZop7A

It’s also on Netflix and maybe a couple other places."
Chewing Gum,Now I'm gonna go home and find this price is right channel on Pluto. Thanks!
Chewing Gum,"Enjoy it! For me, it's the Johnny Carson channel. When I was little, my grandfather was the de facto babysitter during summer vacation, and he always loved watching reruns of shows from the 70's. There was a ""best of Johnny Carson"" show that was on every day, and we just had to watch it. I remember Carnac the Great, and how my grandpa would almost choke from laughter, watching Carson trying not to break during that sketch.

I actually haven't watched anything on the channel yet, cuz I know I'll end up just watching that. Right now I'm stuck on the CSI channel. There's no nostalgia there for me, it's just decent background noise.

Things are pretty crap out there right now, so don't feel bad for enjoying something that reminds you of when life was easier."
Chewing Gum,You sound distressed. You should probably burn your TV.
Chewing Gum,How is it possible that this entire thread exists yet I haven't seen one mention of the beautiful and hilarious Holly Hallstrom?

I'm interested in seeing what happens with all these projects over the next several years.  Will Activision Blizzard successfully establish a mutlimedia empire, where billions are made from their video games, TV shows, and movies?

We get to a red light and I look out the window to the right (was in the passenger seat) and I see what looks like Mr. Lahey driving beside us.

Did a bit of a double take, tapped my co worker and he looked over. Clearly John Dunsworth knew I was putting the pieces together and smiled, said “How’s it going boys?”

I blurted out “Good Mr. Lahey!” Just as the light turned green. He nodded as he drove off. We were both a bit stunned, saying “did that just happen?”

RIP, drinking all the liquor at the trailer park in the sky."

Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: Europe,"God dammit. Just saw him and Bo-bandy in Williston ND and did the meet and great as well. He was spry as fuck at the show too. They asked for a volunteer to go on stage, and instantly got bum rushed by a bunch of drunk Williston fucks. Well Lahey bypassed those fucks like a ninja, and randomly picked my friend Adam who was just sitting there at our table. Long story short they made him take his shirt off and Lahey tricked Adam into letting him take a body shot off of him.  Adam is shy too, totally made the fucking night epic. We called Lahey and Randy by their real names backstage at the meet and great to see if they would break character and talk to us, they absolutely would not! Totally dedicated to those characters. Even did a little act for just the 2 of us, and didn't rush us at all.

Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: Europe,"Andre the Giant may have been the greatest drunk ever, but Mr. Lahey  is the greatest drunk ever to grace the screen. Trailer Park Boys walks a very fine line between stupid and genius, but there's nobody that's more of a joy to watch than the antagonist/anti-hero than the supervisor of Sunnyvale. 

My father did radio dramas with him in Halifax and always spoke fondly of him. Mom mentioned that he was very soft spoken in real life and not a big drinker at all. It just goes to show how dedicated he was to his craft and succeeding in becoming the biggest asshole you rooted for. 

I still laugh when I think about him being completely dyed in blue ink in one of the recent season finales. The plans that never came to fruition, the scheming against the boys, the relationship with Randy and Barb and, of course, one of the best rivalries ever with Ricky. I felt that John Dunsworth had good chemistry with EVERY single actor on the show, and that's about the only person I'd make that claim for.

He used to give out postcards to fans that would ask. My girlfriend asked and got one, he said he'd send me one but I didn't get it for months and was convinced it just wasn't coming. My gf saw how sad I was and asked him if he was still doing it, and he said no the requests were too many, but that he would call me. A week or so later I get a call from Nova Scotia. And it's John Dunsworth. He started out for a bit in character, but after a bit switched to his normal persona and asked me about how my life was, the weather in California and other small talk. And that was it. Fast forward a couple of months, and my girlfriend loses her long time family dog. I reach out to him and ask him if there's any way he can maybe just send her any kind of card with his signature, as she actually lost her card he gave her during a move,(his other ones were trailer park co supervisor certificates he'd make out to you or the cover of the Dicshitnary) but he said he didn't have any but he would call. Lo and behold he does, talks to her for a good while. I didn't tell her, so when SHE saw Nova Scotia on her caller ID she was double surprised. Pretty sure she cried but I tried to let her have her privacy. That's the kind of stuff he would do for a fan, take time out of his real life, all because we loved what an amazing and hilarious actor he was."

Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: Europe,"What a blow to Halifax, everyone is getting on the liquor tonight. The guy gave his life to this city."
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: Europe,Shit.
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: Europe,You will always be the liquor my friend. Thanks for the laughs from a Nova Scotian'er who grew up watching you.  
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: Europe,Godspeed Mr. Lahey 
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: Europe,"""You know, Ricky grew up as a little shit-spark from the old shit-flint. And then he turned into a shit-bonfire and then driven by the winds of his monumental ignorance, he turned into a raging shit-firestorm. If I get to be married to Barb i’ll have total control of Sunnyvale, and then I can unleash a shitnami tidal wave that’ll engulf Ricky and extinguish his shit-flames forever. And with any luck, he’ll drown in the undershit of that wave. Shit-waves.""  

Will miss the guy :("
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: Europe,"It's not often a celebrity death has any impact on me, but this one really left me feeling sad. He was brilliant in the show. RIP Jim. "
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: Europe,shit moths randy
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: Europe,Shit. I never watched tpb but I watched him on Haven. His ability to play such polar opposite roles and make it convincing showed his strength as an actor. A coworker got to play a part in tpb the most resent season on Netflix and told us how he was definitely one of the nicest of the bunch. He will be missed. 
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: Europe,"Yeah, this one hurts. A little drinky poo is in order. RIP Mr. Lahey."
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: Europe,The Liquor died today 
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: Europe,Feels like I lost my uncle . . . RIP 😥
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: Europe,We're all The Liquor today boys.
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: Europe,"I remember the first time I saw Lahey in the wild was about 10-11 years ago. I was walking in to Pro Skates and one of the shop guys is hauling ass out the door yelling ""out of the way!"". Me kind of confused stood by the door wondering what is going on and he yells down the sidewalk "" Hey Lahey! FUCK YOU!"". Lahey turns around with a huge smile and waves at him then keeps walking. Met him a couple years later and fuck what a nice guy he was."

Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: Europe,"He slid off the end of the shit rope.. 

But seriously, easily one of the best actors on TPB. He will be greatly missed and the show will never be the same without him."
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: Europe,I feel like a shitbird right about now

Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: Europe,Top er off bud!  TPB won't ever be the same without you
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: Europe,Too bad. Best drunk acting in history.

Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: Europe,He made a run to the big LC in the sky :( 
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: Europe,Pouring a drinkypoo out for the best onscreen drunk of all time.
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: Europe,The way she goes boys
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: Europe,RIP John. By far and away the best actor to ever portray a drunk person and it's a damn shame we lost him.
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: Europe,John seemed like a really nice guy and he was definitely a hell of an actor. 
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: Europe,"The Trailer Park Boys were on a live tour recently and came through St. Louis. The night after their show they came into my restaurant to celebrate Bubble's (Mike Smith's) birthday. The whole group was there, and hands down Dunsworth was the absolute best. Just as quirky as his actual character. Incredibly nice to the staff and cracking jokes. At the end of the meal he just walked back into the kitchen and exclaimed how great the food was. 

Dude was truly a class act. And it's surreal how just a couple months ago he was fine, and chipper, and full of energy. "
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: Europe,"So many laughs and fun memories. Lahey was an amazing character. Rest in Peace, John Dunsworth. ""You might be able to fool the FBI, but you can't fool the FB-me."" "
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: Europe,Damn now im sad :( 
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: Europe,"I’m so sad!! 
A huge loss to TPB"

That really is the way she goes boys 

RIP to the legend 🙏🏼"

Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: Europe,"My fraternity loved this show so much, when I pledged I had never even heard of it. I was in a two man pledge class, my pledge name was ""The Mustard Tiger"" and my bros name was ""The Green Bastard"" I soon realized the beauty of the show and it became a huge part of my college life. Every night after hard drinking you'd hear the TPB theme song playing randomly throughout the night from all of us falling asleep watching it. It will never be the same without Jim. "
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: Europe,"I don't usually care when celebrities pass on but fucking-a this one hurts. Thanks for all the laughs, John. "

Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: Europe,"...are you fucking serious? WTF. Fuck. My condolences to his family and friends. Fuuuck...

Edit: This fucking sucks. I *really* liked this man. 

[Here](https://youtu.be/3mcQfP8k51s) is a video that I liked from him. Has nothing to do w/ TPB, just a man doing what he likes. FML. "
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: Europe,He's flying with the shit angels now. 
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: Europe,"“I am the liquor.”

Thanks for the laughs, Mr. Lahey. "
Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: Europe,"I always said if anything happened to John Dunsworth that TPB should just wrap it up. 

First they lost Lucy. Then they lost J-Roc. Lucy is meh, but J-Roc was hilarious. Still, the show could live on without those two. 

The show cannot live on without John Dunsworth. So unless they get some semi big named extremely talented actor to fill the void, I don't see TPB lasting another 2 seasons. 

RIP Lahey, you will be missed. 

PS: I suggest to anyone (who have or have no seen the show) to watch the end of season... 8? I believe. Where he has the 1% ownership in the park and Julian is being buddy buddy trying to get him to give the 1% to him so he can buy the park. 

John's scene at that part when he's asked to sign over the 1% is amazing. It's like an entire actors reel in one scene. He goes through the entire spectrum of emotions. Happy. Sad. Angry. Menacing. Horny/Filled with lust. Arrogant. All over the course of like 3 minutes. 

Truly one of the most talented actors in the world. He'd convince anyone he was drunk and the guy doesn't even drink at all. 

RIP Lahey you will be SORELY missed. "
Penn and Teller,"One of the employees at our company told all the lower wage workers what some of the office employees make.  The whole company is in chaos now, employees are upset, moral is low, and i'm here on reddit."
Penn and Teller,This is a bit of an oversimplification.  
Penn and Teller,His hair makes me irrationally angry. 
Penn and Teller,[removed]
Penn and Teller,"Yeah, it's a great show. One of the better things to come from College Humor in a while."
Penn and Teller,"I liked him for all of five minutes, but he's inferior to BS with Pen and Teller in almost every way.


First off, the humor. Its Gawker-tier insight. Penn and Teller WERE naturally entertainers, and even were quick to rectify their arguments if proven invalid (I believe their second hand smoke argument caught flak and they openly acknowledged it), not to mention having the satirical ability to mimic themselves (Why PT BS is BS). There was also a willingness in Penn and Teller to ACTIVELY explore their topic first hand, versus the absolutely **terrible** way Adam does it,


*were you AWARE you were wrong?*

*oh Adam you're going to ruin it for me lol!*


*I know rite let me show you!""*


Its borderline propaganda levels. ""No Timmy, you don't want to be a communist!""


I get the humor, and some of what its trying to do is decently researched if you find Wikipedia a scholarly source."
Penn and Teller,Everyone complaining about him being smug and unlikable seems to be missing the entire point of the show. He's SUPPOSED TO BE SMUG AND UNLIKABLE.
Penn and Teller,"Is it actually 64 cents on the dollar, or is that extremely misleading, like the 77 cents on the dollar for women? Because the 77 cents on the dollar doesn't take into account that men tend to pursue fields with higher paying jobs, as well as numerous other factors. Other than that, really interesting points, makes sense."
Penn and Teller,"Yeah but in Penn and Teller, you actually like the hosts."
Penn and Teller,I watched another video of his and found out that 90% of you have herpes.
Penn and Teller,"The style felt more like Bill Nye for adults. Or, just Bill Nye..."
Penn and Teller,Amazing show and I can't wait for season 2.
Penn and Teller,He reminds me of the guy from Good Eats
Penn and Teller,"I use to like this show, then there was an episode on video games, a subject I'm rather familiar with, and it was incredibly skewed and factually wrong. It soured my perception of the show, if they're so wrong about this what else that I'm not as familiar with are they wrong about?"
Penn and Teller,Oscar has really changed since he left Dunder Mifflin.
Penn and Teller,[removed]
Penn and Teller,"I was in charge of hiring and setting wages at a former job.  I would pay people who worked harder and were more reliable more money.  Salaries are literally putting a value on a person's work, some people work harder than others and they should be paid better.  "
Penn and Teller,I enjoy the show but not a fan of Adam Conover. Penn & Teller I'd take any day over him.
Penn and Teller,Oscar is Michael Scott. 
Penn and Teller,"When I was working at Walmart, I made $2-$3 more than my coworkers. My friends asked me how much I made, and I told them. They got pretty upset.

Recently Walmart gave everyone a raise, and I was still making more than everyone else, though my raise was significantly smaller. Then my store manager told me not to share my income with everyone else.

Glad to be out of there"
Penn and Teller,I like what he said about a 4 day work week!
Penn and Teller,So awesome to see Oscar from the Office.
Penn and Teller,He's like a real life Cliff Clavin.
Penn and Teller,Adam Makes Up Credible-Sounding Shit
Penn and Teller,"I live in a country where you can actually check how much everyone makes, because of tax reasons. Some people I know even get catalogs sent home to them, specifying the income of everyone in the town. Maybe that's why Sweden has the world's 3rd best Gini, as reported 2007/8. "
Penn and Teller,[removed]
Penn and Teller,[deleted]
Penn and Teller,"I agree that making salaries more public is healthier in the long run, because it puts pressure on the companies to keep their employees happy if they value the employees' contributions.  However, it becomes problematic if employees try to band together to demand equal pay because the employees have just now created another ""system"" that will create inequalities.  It's called a Union and those employees that control the union will ultimately leverage the collective power to their benefit (e.g.: ""seniority"", which protects those heading the unions over newer employees).  Collective systems (be it unions or corporations or governments) are inherently corrupt because they have to be run by individuals.  Federalist Paper #51, anyone?  

An individuals ultimate wage negotiating power comes from keeping connected to one's industry, interviewing at other companies, and getting higher salary offers to go elsewhere.  Then one can go back to their employer and tell them, ""If you don't pay me X, then I walk.""  The employer then HAS to decide what your true value is to them and offer you more to stay.  It's really that simple in process, yet requires additional effort in execution."
Penn and Teller,"I thought ""hey these are great, I'm going to watch a few from the playlist!""

Couldn't make it past like 4 minutes of the obnoxious hosts  zany antics"
Penn and Teller,"Meh... He overlooks the fact that in that kind of configuration, where some people are above others (here in terms of salary), people are more likely to suck up to the boss to get paid better than collectively ask for more money."
Penn and Teller,Isnt the wage gap debunked? 
Penn and Teller,"Ask CEOs of large companies how sharing their income effects what people think of them.

Because we don't all think the 1% are assholes right?"
Penn and Teller,"This guy has to be related to Alton Brown. 
He looks like his son and the show really looks like Good Eats did. "
Penn and Teller,except penn and teller is actually good 
Penn and Teller,"And not nearly as unpleasant as BS, too.  Half the stuff I agree with on that show I still feel like being against it because Penn and Teller are so annoying about it."
Penn and Teller,[deleted]
Penn and Teller,"I'm NOT sharing my salary. I've heard what many of my cow-workers make and it's far less than what I make. I already get the bullshit line of ""Well, you're near the top of your pay grade and we need to bring others up, so your raise sucks ass."" every other year. Because I raise hell and threaten to leave and they give me a better raise the following year. "
Penn and Teller,Not sure if this is meant to be a joke or not. It was entertaining though. What if one employee makes the company twice as much money as the other employee. Should they still be paid the same? 
Penn and Teller,"I'm not from the US (what a stupid wages system, btw) but isn't the likely outcome of this that everyone gets fired?"
Penn and Teller,Eh! Pat Castles! 
Penn and Teller,[muh wage gap](https://youtu.be/wjWBXbGVyQU)
Penn and Teller,and douchier
Penn and Teller,I'll remember that when my spouses co workers bitch and moan in their crab bucket
Penn and Teller,"Unless you work in a ""Right to Work"" state in which case your boss can and will fire you for sharing this information with co-workers. I've been outright told in interviews that sharing salary information is a fireable offense. "
Penn and Teller,"I never understood the taboo and used to tell people. It made a lot of coworkers uncomfortable and they never reciprocated.

But hey, I have traveled a bit and learned it isn't exactly taboo. In China people love to ask what you make and what you own, so when in Rome as they say. I didn't have any issues discussing it.

Also right now the company I work for is pouring research into how much people are payed in our industry and will publish the results to the employees so they can see where they are and what they can aim for if they wish to advance. It will give everyone an opportunity to open a dialog wish management and better their lot in life kinda thing."
Penn and Teller,"This was... absolutely terrible acting, on everyones part. Terrible writing, terrible ""facts"", just all around terrible.

The fear of sharing your salary isn't that people will 'resent you'. What the fuck kind of narcisistic asshole do you have to be to think that? It's that other people will make more money than you and will look down on you/have sympathy for you. It's that people, if they DO make less money than you, will lie and say they make more than you, just to feel good about themselves(while simultaneously making you feel like shit).

This show is nothing more than opinion, combined with terrible acting and writing.

I'd rather go and watch the big bang theory. At least the actors there are decent, even if the writing sucks."
Penn and Teller,"The wage gap is so widely debunked, it's disappointing to see it touted here.﻿"
Penn and Teller,"No, BS was libertarian, this is borderline sjw"
Penn and Teller,[removed]
Penn and Teller,"I also don't think he is completely correct about salary differences not causing resentment among coworkers.  I know when this has happened to me, I got pissed at both the employer and the coworker, and tried to expose my coworker as being overpaid/incompetent whenever I could. Probably a dick move now that I think about it, but I don't think my reaction was unique."
Penn and Teller,Alternative title: Adam Ruins Everything. It is like Penn and Teller without BS.
Penn and Teller,I remember this guy from the dog breeding and ring videos online. Good on TruTV for giving him a show to continue this format its really nice. 
Penn and Teller,Did Alton Brown get a makeover?
Penn and Teller,Doesn't sound like my cup of tea
Penn and Teller,"Unfortunately, you forget how cooperate America works. If a group of co-workers start complaining about salary then suddenly the company needs ""to make some cutbacks because of hard times"".. complaining about equality? Okay, now EVERYONE makes $6 a year, now you're equal. Want a raise? Okay, here, just don't ask for a promotion or any slack on your vacation days, you're going nowhere from now on. Quitting? Okay, I can get a computer or a some starving guy in india to do your job more efficiently for not even half the money anyway. Protesting? I'll have you escorted out by security or even call the police on grounds of disturbing the peace and disrupting business operations.. unless of course you can manage to convince a whole large group of people together to form a formal protest, in which case congratulations, now everyone has lost their job over a little air time no will remember in a week, and if they do I'm not even gonna get into what can be done to bribe or influence the right people to either forget you or completely discredit your every notion..

Unfortunately, big business runs things the way the want because they have the power and the money, and as long as they have those two things there won't be change, and if they DON'T have those two things then the economy suffers and now more people are in poverty and without jobs. Its a damned if you do damned if you don't situation.﻿
"
Penn and Teller,I remember this guy from the dog breeding and ring videos online. Good on TruTV for giving him a show to continue this format its really nice. 
Penn and Teller,"There is actually zero evidence that suggests women, or people of color make any less than their white male counterparts"
Penn and Teller,"If you watch this show and find it entertaining you should take a standard issue baskin robbins ice cream scoop and relieve your skull of your rotted brain and replace it with a handful of raisin bran to up your IQ.

Research actual data."
Penn and Teller,"I used to work for the state and everybody's salary was public knowledge that you could look up on the internet.  I was curious one day and looked up the salaries of a few shitbags I worked with.  That was probably one of the biggest mistakes I made while working there.  Nothing makes you hate a person more than finding out they do 1/4 of the work and make 85K a year.
"
Penn and Teller,[removed]
Penn and Teller,"That's pretty much accurate for the show as a whole.

It's not bad, but it always presents itself as entirely correct without hearing the other side of things or examining the studies it cites. In some cases it sites articles from random websites as proof of its claims.

Still, good entertainment and definitely gives you some fun stuff to talk about and research. Which one should do any time they hear any claim."
Penn and Teller,"Yeah, how Reddit imagines this fantasizes about this going:

""Hey! Boss! John makes 15k more than I do and I demand a raise!""

""Yes, that would be fair. Let me contact HR and you will now be getting a 15k raise.""

In actuality:

""Hey! Boss! John makes 15k more than I do and I demand a raise!""

""No. John has more work experience and had an astoundingly strong annual review last month. He's one of our all star employees. Your performance hasn't been meeting our standards. Whenever I walk by your desk I see you goofing off online. Until this changes you will not be getting a raise.""

I support being more open in salaries if you want to be, but it won't be the cure all people say it will. Gender pay gap is far more complicated than that. Saying it's all because no one is talking about wages and because the boss is actually intentionally discriminating is entirely untrue. In many industries, male and female employees start off with the same salaries, but over time, their pays start to differentiate. "
Penn and Teller,"yes but its a 30 minute show, not much time for the details and complication, they do what they can with the time they got"
Penn and Teller,"Honestly, he glosses over the idea that people would resent you for making more than they do, acting like no one would do it because it's silly.  Well, it still happens.  Some of my coworkers have been with this company for as many as four years and are only making $.50/hr more than they were when they started.  I, on the other hand, recently got a promotion and raise of $2.50/hr (our base pay is $10/hr) after about 9 months at the company.  I've heard my coworkers bitch about other coworkers who got a 50 cent raise.  You bet your ass I'm never mentioning how much I make, not like it's even something to brag about in the first place."
Penn and Teller,As is the $0.64 / $1 myth (or $0.77 depending who says it0
Penn and Teller,So what's the other side of it? How does employee having less information makes it better for them?
Penn and Teller,"Definitely.  It comes across as ""All the money that comes into the company should be used for salary!""  Sorry, that's not the case in a business.  You want heat in the winter and AC in the summer?  Want electricity so you can work?  Want a place to work (since the boss possibly doesn't own the building)?  Want office supplies to work with?  Want insurance or the company to pay in to your 401k?  Yeah, it's all called overhead and it costs.  A company wants to operate in the black so that it CAN give raises, but it has to take everything else into consideration.  This is just ""You make money, we want money."""
Penn and Teller,"How do you feel about Conan?

The Barbarian or the O'Brien, both have wild hair."
Penn and Teller,"Federal law trumps work contracts, if they try to enforce it they can be sued. "
Penn and Teller,Ah! That's where I recognise most of the actors from
Penn and Teller,"No, he's just smug and unlikeable. He did the Jeff Ruben Jeff Ruben show and it's almost impossible to listen to him prattle on about how he's been reading the New Yorker since an early age and how he can't understand why people like James Bond movies they are unrealistic representations of masculinity, blah blah blah. I like this show too but he's not pulling a Colbert."
Penn and Teller,"I never got arguments like this, I don't care if he's like that on purpose, that doesn't make it any less annoying."
Penn and Teller,And the nerds on Big Bang Theory are supposed to be over the top nerdy. That doesn't mean anyone has to love it. Just because it was the authors intent doesn't make it immune to criticism.
Penn and Teller,"Is it at least supposed to be entertaining? Cause he's not, he's like an unfunny version of Alton Brown. "
Penn and Teller,Just cause he is suppose to be that way doesnt mean itll make me want to watch him lol
Penn and Teller,">He's SUPPOSED TO BE SMUG AND UNLIKABLE.

So they don't understand that people do not like smug and unlikeable people?  I could barely take 20 seconds of him.  

Penn and Teller were smug but at least they were funny and relatable.  This guy can go fuck himself."
Penn and Teller,Maybe you're missing the point of smugness and unlikability being negative traits?
Penn and Teller,i thought he was supposed to be alton brown
Penn and Teller,"> Is it actually 64 cents on the dollar, or is that extremely misleading, like the 77 cents on the dollar for women? 

It's calculated the same way the 77 cent figure is calculated, so yes, it's very misleading.  If you already know that black people are more likely to be from the lower class, then it's entirely unsurprising."
Penn and Teller,"> Because the 77 cents on the dollar doesn't take into account that men tend to pursue fields with higher paying jobs, as well as numerous other factors.

Penn and Teller,"Youre rare. Thats not usually how it works in business. But its the fairy tale they tell people. Usually companies have a certain range set aside for certain positions. Strictly hypothetical. Say a guy interviews for an office position and their pay range is $40k - $75k a year, and the guy seems like hell be a good employee, has all the qualifications, does pretty well on the interviews, etc. When they he is looking to make, and he says $65k a year, they may hem and haw and say ""Thats kind of high. You can definitely make that if you put in the time and effort, but how about if we start you out at $55k?"" And the guy may take it or keep negotiating to get it a little higher.

Now the next person that comes in has an even more impressive resume. Plenty of experience, tons of knowledge, absolutely knocks the interview out of the park. You can tell hes gonna be a great addition to the company. When you ask what hes looking to make he says $35k a year. What do you think the boss is going to say ""Nah, I just hired a guy last week that was almost as impressive as you, and I gave him $55k, ill pay you the same."" Ooooooorrrrrrr ""Ill tell you what, how about I start you at $40k a year instead? I see good things in you. Welcome aboard!""???

So now hes got 2 new employees, one of which may be better and more valuable to the company making $15k less a year than the other one. And because its taboo to discuss these kinds of salaries the guy doesnt know his worth hell never even know about it."

I won't tell you what happens in season 4 lol"
Re: Life in a different world from zero,"Twin Peaks had perhaps the most absurd escalation of stakes I’ve ever seen. 

The pilot: “okay so this teen girl was murdered in this small town, here’s an FBI agent sent to solve the case.”

Season 3: “okay so it turns out that when America created the nuclear bomb, they accidentally tore a hole in the space time continuum and allowed otherworldly beings to leak into our reality. One of those creatures is literally the personification of evil and he’s taken the form of our hero’s doppelgänger. Our hero must now take down this evil entity and then travel back in time (and then maybe into an alternate dimension) to save the girl who died in the pilot. Except now he seems to be trapped in a never-ending cycle of finding and losing the girl over and over again, traversing from reality to reality in pursuit of a goal that will always be just out of reach.“"

Re: Life in a different world from zero,"TRIGUN.
I used the ChatGPT to generate the following summary:
  
>Trigun is a science-fiction anime that primarily takes place on the desert planet of Gunsmoke. In the first episodes of Trigun, the audience is introduced to the show's main setting, the planet Gunsmoke, and its protagonist, Vash the Stampede, a legendary gunslinger with a massive bounty on his head. The episodes follow Vash as he navigates the planet, encounters various individuals and groups, and tries to avoid violence despite his reputation as a dangerous outlaw. Along the way, Vash's encounters begin to shed light on his past and motivations, setting the stage for the overarching plot of the series.

> Despite its Western-style setting, the show also explores space themes, such as the advanced technology and interstellar travel that enable humans to colonize other planets. Throughout the series, there are references to other planets, space travel, and futuristic technology, such as advanced weaponry and transportation. Additionally, the show incorporates supernatural elements. These supernatural aspects are often linked to the show's themes of morality and redemption. This creates a unique and compelling world that combines classic Western themes with futuristic technology and supernatural abilities.

> The revelation of Vash's true nature as a [redacted] and his connection to his [redacted] at the end of Trigun comes as a surprise to many viewers, as it is a significant departure from the way the anime initially presents itself. When the show begins, Vash is introduced as a bumbling, comedic character who seems to be nothing more than a harmless and quirky outlaw. As the series progresses, however, it becomes clear that Vash's true nature and motivations are far more complex than they initially appear."

Re: Life in a different world from zero,"I remember starting AoS when it first came on, never kept up, and it was like the first Marvel thing I didn't keep up with.

Steve didn't invent anything too insane until about season 3, when Urkelbot was unveiled, but even then it was mostly normal.  There were a few things that were wild/funny, but nothing that isn't within the realm of possibility (the main one is a nuke, but that was a dream sequence).

Starting in late season 3, early season 4 though, it's like the show went completely off of the rails, and turned into a sitcom/sci-fi hybrid."

Root started off as the Joker but became more like Harley Quinn. Shaw was Red Hood. Zoe is Selina. Elias was Falcone. 

They added other DC-like characters later on like Control was so Amanda Waller. But, really, later one they went from Batman to full blown tech thriller."

S1 takes a few episodes to get going, it starts as a teen show and then becomes pretty hardcore violent sci-fi dystopia quickly.  Just stop after S3.... where it goes just starts getting weird and absurd."
Re: Life in a different world from zero,"It's *really* worth it.

It *does* start as a ""hot young adults having hot times in post apocalyptic world with perfect hair"" kind of feel to it. And in some ways that's just part of the show. It *is* a CW show after all. 

But it gets wilder and wilder as the seasons go on. Don't want to spoil it. But it really goes places you can't imagine.

Also, it has one of *the best* opening credits scenes in all of sci-fi tv. It changes every episode to reflect locations and events in the current episode. Sometimes subtly, sometimes wildly.

It *also* uses a made-up language for the earthers that's awesome and learnable. Consistent. When you listen closely, it'll start making sense."
Re: Life in a different world from zero,"Yeah same, it sounds cool and all and people talk about it like it gets good, but when I tried it things were so boring and it's hard to be interested in a bunch of angsty teens being thrown somewhere."

Tons of live action superhero content has been released better than any 90s live action superhero content.

I'm not familiar with most of these, and I watch a shit-ton of TV and movies. I really like the effort, and the writeups are perfect in length.


Again, not knowing these a lot, is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show? (Nothing against non English speakers of course) 


Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ❤️"
Street Fighter II: V,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
Street Fighter II: V,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.
Street Fighter II: V,No Atlanta? Both seasons last year were incredible
Street Fighter II: V,Pachinko is the most slept on series of 2022
Street Fighter II: V,"1. She hulk
2. Ted lasso
3. Ms Marvel
4. Harley Quinn show
5. Lord of the rings
6. Spy x family 
7. Chainsaw man
8. Loki
9. Mob psycho
10. Hot D"
Street Fighter II: V,Which ones did you see? 🤔 amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?
Street Fighter II: V,"> is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
Street Fighter II: V,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
Street Fighter II: V,🙂💕
Street Fighter II: V,It’s great but it’s depressing.
Street Fighter II: V,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
Street Fighter II: V,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
Street Fighter II: V,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
Street Fighter II: V,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7… cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
Street Fighter II: V,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
Street Fighter II: V,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
Street Fighter II: V,Oh my bad. I’m late to the party.
Street Fighter II: V,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
Street Fighter II: V,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

damn. guess i gotta hurry and check this one out now. lol."
Street Fighter II: V,"You should check out Kotaro Lives Alone, such a good show!"
Street Fighter II: V,"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven’t managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
Street Fighter II: V,I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!
Street Fighter II: V,"Asian shows on Disney+/Hulu seem to fly under the radar. There was a supernatural horror Korean show called [""Connect""](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/connect/s01) that came out a few weeks ago and was pretty good too."
Street Fighter II: V,"I've watched 2 episodes and I'm digging it

I might check out the Manga after the show is done"
Street Fighter II: V,"Pleaaase anybody know other shows as good and similar to this? I’m freaking addicted to this show. I loooove horror,thriller"
Street Fighter II: V,Its really well made.  Can't believe I randomly found this show it's so good.  Great acting and suspense.  Amazing cinematography too
Street Fighter II: V,"To be honest I genuinely can't understand the low ratings on imdb when I've been hearing nothing but praises for it. For me this show is already one of the best things I've watched recently, and I don't say this lightly, and something I would recommend to all thriller/horror fans unless you really dislike the topic or the setting. It's brutal, full of tension, twists and of interesting characters that are unpredictable. 

The overall quality is also pretty high, starring the youngest best actor winner at Cannes, the writer of Drive My Car, which also won the best screenplay, and the director, who is not a newbie, has also proved to be up to the task. The last 15 minutes of episode 3 were really something else."
Street Fighter II: V,"I think I have a subconscious block in my head where whenever I hear the title I imagine the fake ""Gangie"" movie from Arrested Development."
Street Fighter II: V,Will there be season 2?
Street Fighter II: V,"This is one of the worst season ending for a show I've ever seen.

they literally just abruptly ended the season. nothing about this episode was a conclusion or even remotely close to a season ending. 

they literally cut off the plot mid way and called it a season."
Street Fighter II: V,Yeah I'm excited to start watching this.
Street Fighter II: V,"I had no idea Gannibal got adapted ! On Disney of all places.

I started reading the manga a few months ago (publishing pace is slow as hell). After having seen ep1 it looks pretty faithful. The cast seems pretty good too although I'm not a fan of the usual over the top japanese acting. I also imagined Kuge village being a bit grittier."
Street Fighter II: V,"Haven't watched it, will check it out as it sounds up my alley, but surely the name is a play on Hannibal, no? Given that Gannibal is a direct transliteration of that name in several languages?"
Street Fighter II: V,This show was so good! Really want to see season 2 and to see the latest manga (currently unavailable in English 🫠)
Street Fighter II: V,What the fuck?! I was really interested in this manga but the translators have been taking months to drop a new chapter so I thought there was little interest in it in Japan for an anime let alone a Disney+ adaptation. Hopefully they’ll get off their asses and translate the rest of the volumes now.
Street Fighter II: V,"Spoiler alert 

Worst show I've seen in ages. Story pacing is all over the place and there is absolutely no consistency - characters will change 180 within five minutes. Examples : Agawa being portrayed as a tough guy cop but then letting villagers pretty much spit in his face. Keisuke portrayed as having no relationship with his mother and hating her, but then threatening to kill himself to save her in the next scene. ""That man"" defends the Gotos and slashes Agawa in the head but apparently just leaves him alive by a river instead of killing him. Then next scene is of the Gotos going all out to try to kill Agawa even though they could have already killed him instead of leaving him alive at the river.

The story has so many holes in it and seems to just throw red herrings left right and centre for no reason. And by far the most annoying thing is the use of the main soundtrack/theme in virtually every scene to make it sound more ominous... Gets extremely annoying 

Would rate this 2/5. Don't waste your time especially if you want to watch a show that makes sense and has some sort of closure (the season ending was just dumb)."
Street Fighter II: V,">""Set in Kuge, a fictional Japanese village, Gannibal sees police officer Daigo Agawa arriving as a broken man. A series of alarming events, including the unexpected death of an elderly villager, unfold — leading Daigo to sense something is wrong with the village and its residents.

>Thrown into a hostile environment, will the new police officer to patrol the streets of Kuge village bring the suspects to justice before it’s too late?""

That's all very marketing-y. What am I actually in for? Whats good about this show?"
Street Fighter II: V,The setting is interesting but am pretty sure they only had half a bear costume for the first episode based on the way it was framed. It would have been better to not show the attack versus that.
Street Fighter II: V,Wil there be a second season? Couldn't find any info online.
Street Fighter II: V,"I really enjoyed this show!
Also you can't go wrong with Takeshi Miike."
Street Fighter II: V,Great recommendation!
Street Fighter II: V,Loved Connect! Somebody on Netflix is good too and the glory
Street Fighter II: V,I am tempted to read the manga series this weekend but I don't want to spoil the show!
Street Fighter II: V,"I recommend kdrama Beyond Evil or Missing The Other Side on netflix. 

Another jdrama: Atami no Sousoukan"
Street Fighter II: V,"It really is the best Japanese tv drama as well as horror I've watched in years. I've introduced this show to my friends, and they all binge watched it in one day! 

The low ratings probably come from the manga fans.  I guess they are upset because the show has very different vibes from the manga."
Street Fighter II: V,Are there only 7 episodes in Season 1?
Street Fighter II: V,"I wonder if the plot will come to an end next episode. If it does, then I doubt we'll see a season 2.

Haven't read the manga too far (no english translations far along) so I don't know how it goes."
Street Fighter II: V,"As someone who has read the original manga, I have to say that the show is pretty faithful. I just hope that it has season 2!"
Street Fighter II: V,Amen. I hate seasons that don’t end on any sort of conclusion.
Street Fighter II: V,"I’m reading the manga now too and I agree with you on the point about Kuge looking maybe a little too clean and pristine, though it is a bit of a nice contrast with the antics of Goto family. 

Episode 3 was amazing (car tunnel scene)."
Street Fighter II: V,"It’s based on a manga series called Gannibal but I think the title is definitely a play on words… whether it’s Hannibal or Cannibal is one’s guess


The last 20 minutes of this week’s episode 3 was some amazing television."
Street Fighter II: V,"Solo cop new to small Japanese village discovers a series of disappearances and murders. Previous cop that managed the village went crazy and disappeared, but spoke of the cannibalism there. The locals start off somewhat friendly and things start to turn weird. 

Worth watching at least ep 1!"
Street Fighter II: V,Did they friggin end it on a cliff hanger?!
Street Fighter II: V,I try to do that only after finishing the show unless the show is frustrating me like attack on titan
Street Fighter II: V,theres no manga to read unless you know japanese. barely any chapters were translated.
Street Fighter II: V,"Yep, it definitely earned a spot among my favorites. While watching I realized that I've been craving a show like this one for a long time, it has all the elements I like: isolated village in a mountain setting, the threat coming from cultural belief, violent protagonist with family issues, slowburn mystery and suspense etc.

I think there are different reasons on why people don't like it, since jdramas usually are rather divisive. A friend of mine who watched the first episode said he disliked it because it looks too low budget, he specifically mentioned the bear and the giant. He was put off by the acting too, and he didn't found it scary, but that's not the first we disagree on something lol, it happened with Midnight Mass too (I loved it and he hated it), he's quite picky with horrors. As for me, I don't really mind: the bear only appeared for 20 seconds and ""that man"" actually looks better than I expected and I like that it's more suspense than straight up horror. It has quite an indie vibe to it and I love it."
Street Fighter II: V,We need a season 2!! So many questions left unanswered!!
Street Fighter II: V,Yes. Season finale just came out on Disney+ this afternoon
Street Fighter II: V,"So far (ep.6), it's only half (maybe even less) of the manga storyline.  I doubt the season finale will be the end. Finger crossed S2 is on its way!"
Street Fighter II: V,How did the manga end? I saw online it has concluded but I can’t find the last chapters translated in English sadly
Street Fighter II: V,"That car tunnel scene is so ridiculously over-the-top and out of place which I think made it more awesome and surprising. And it looked pretty high budget too! The camera work while inside the car was pretty brilliant. I was expecting them to get ambushed once they get to the hospital, but my expectations were subverted."
Street Fighter II: V,"Fuckit, I can get on board with that."
Street Fighter II: V,Yup lol loads of unanswered questions still
Street Fighter II: V,"Yea, something like that."
Containment,Yeah the first season is confirmed to be the first game only. At most there might be some hints as to some characters for part 2 but that's about it.
Containment,"Creators said season 1 is the first game and implied 2-3 are the second game.

https://gizmodo.com/last-of-us-hbo-length-left-behind-dlc-neil-druckmann-1849945355

That said, I wouldn't be surprised if there was a little bit here and there from the second game sprinkled in S1."
Containment,[removed]
Containment,"I think they will weave the stories together better even if just slightly. They have the opportunity to tweak TLOU1 for the better. The story had lots of limitations as a game - you need to give the player action right away etc.

If I recall Tess is showing credits for FIVE episodes- that's a lot of screen time / flashbacks."
Containment,Maybe the final scene of season 1 will introduce one of the main characters of Game 2
Containment,"No spoilers, BUT the actor playing Elle was specifically asked to not play the games or learn the story of the games, this show might branch off a bit and be it's own thing.

Which just makes it all more exciting if you give that some though."
Containment,S1 is just game 1 and likely also the Left Behind DLC for game 1. Second game will be S2 onward.
Containment,"People are trash man, I just finished Part II got it spoiled for me also when I posted I was playing it and told it was the worst game ever made and a bunch of BS it is shoulder to shoulder as good as the first game. Bunch of sad lonely rejects trying to make others as miserable as them."
Containment,Maybe not for a couple of seasons. They'll likely milk the first game all they can before they do a time jump.
Containment,[deleted]
Containment,There is no second game...
Containment,"I think they will defiantly cast an established actor for Abby’s father, but other than that probably not"
Containment,[removed]
Containment,[removed]
Containment,[removed]
Containment,They told her not to play the games because they didn't want her to mimic Ellie's performance and instead make it her own. It's a little different then 'avoid the game because we will be different'
Containment,"Except the show runners have come out and said directly that they will not be changing the story, they will stay true to the source material."
Containment,"Meanwhile Netflix Witcher -

Play all the games and read the books all you want, we're not going to base anything other than the names on the sources"
Containment,[deleted]
Containment,That’s dumb. It’s just a game. If it was a book would it be any different?
Containment,[deleted]
Containment,">might beach off a bit and be it’s own thing

No it isn’t. It’s adapting 1 and 2."
Containment,Nah bro. Creators have been very clear about not wanting to drag this on. Pretty certain to just be a 2 season show spanning the 2 games
Containment,You probably think you are funny huh?
Containment,[deleted]
Containment,[removed]
Containment,[removed]
Containment,They are changing stuff though. The spores don't even spread through the air in the show. that's a huge change
Containment,"I wouldn't trust that too much, they've also already said that spores won't be in it."
Containment,"They're probably trying to get the actors to be ""in the moment"" as far as individual scenes. If you're playing a character, that character doesn't know the arc of their story or how the future will play out.

Plenty of great adaptations have been made without the cast knowing the source material. A number of Game of Thrones cast members didn't read the books and turned in fantastic performances.

It's far more important for the writers, directors and producers to have played the game than the actors. The actors will work from the scripts they're given and the directions they get on set."
Containment,"Because the characters IN GAME didn’t know the future, either, so why should the actors?"
Containment,So the actor doesn't know what happens in the story...  It's really that simple.
Containment,Bella Ramsey is 19.
Containment,[deleted]
Containment,It’s been deleted now to avoid this issue for future readers
Containment,[removed]
Containment,[removed]
Containment,"I'm more inclined to believe the show runners over you, no offense."
Containment,Neil druckman is the co-president of Naughty Dog and original writer of the game. He also happens to be the writer for the show...I think we'll be fine
Containment,[deleted]
Containment,[deleted]
Containment,You're an amazing person. Cheers
Containment,[removed]
Containment,This is per producer Craig marzin from like 2 or 3 days ago. They said everyone would be infected if there were really airborne spores.
Containment,"Not sure many people care what you believe slavocracy. considering you ""dont read"" things longer than two sentences and have the emotional maturity of a toddler!"
Containment,Ok well when you make a last of us tv show you can get the actors to play the game ten times over and then compare it.
Containment,"
It's not a horrible decision, but it is a strong direction choice.  
Here's an article about it: https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/last-of-us-tv-shows-ellie-hasnt-played-the-game-was-encouraged-not-to/#:~:text=Bella%20Ramsey%2C%20the%20actor%20who,%27keep%20it%20that%20way%27.

I do have a question for you, did you beat Last of Us?  Do you know the games ending?"
Containment,[deleted]
Containment,🤡
Containment,[deleted]
Containment,You could be a decent human being and not spoil the second game for me.
Containment,you wanna get banned from two subreddits for spam?
Containment,"Niel Druckman is apart of it and the Chernobyl director. It’s a fun universe it doesn’t have to be, nor will, be exactly like the game. 

It’s different media and having an actor portray the honest character, not the version of the character Ashley Johnson did isn’t a bad move. 

Bella even revealed that she did watch gameplay cutscenes on YouTube anyway in secret so you’re fine"
Containment,[deleted]
Containment,"Weird, not banned from either. 🤡🤡"
Containment,You realize you came to my post which was asking if there will be spoilers for the second game and deliberately spoiled it for me? Why the fuck would you do that? Did it make your day better or something?
Containment,"there we go, finally got you to say something other than emoji spam to bleed words out ya. I win."
Containment,[deleted]
Containment,"Win what, exactly? What is your goal here?"
Containment,You're a tool.
Containment,What an absolute dick move. Why would you want to be that person?
Containment,"the arguement. you lost. :) the goal here is to irritate you and regret being a brat, i'll carry on however long it takes. block me or stop replying and i've won again."
Containment,Nah I think you lost. See I can do it too :)
Containment,"Not really, what you think doesnt matter as you sacrificed your rights the second you stopped caring what others thing with your pretentious narcassim."
Containment,"It's true, I don't care what they thing. I don't even care what they think. I'm such a stinker."

Containment,that's not the Rashida Jones I thought
Containment,If every cable news host from fox business to msnbc got fired tomorrow I wouldn't shed a single tear.
Containment,👉Ann Perkins👉
Containment,"> **Cross was the firebrand weekend host of “The Cross Connection,” a host who’d drawn the ire of rightwing pundits such as Tucker Carlson, and had also raised eyebrows — both internally, and among some viewers — with her blunt on-air comments** about political figures like Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. **Cross’ firing has been the subject of numerous conversations initiated by Jones with elite media figures in recent weeks**, nearly a dozen individuals interviewed by Variety said. **Many of the sources who spoke to Jones, a rare Black female leader in the sector, felt her efforts to present her case to industry insiders underlined how controversial the decision was to fire Cross in the first place.** Some are concerned that Cross was unfairly penalized for being an outspoken Black journalist.


> **Bryan Freedman, the high-powered attorney Cross retained after her ouster from MSNBC**, told Variety that Jones’ behavior was harmful to his client. “**There’s one kind of wrong in going around trying to justify one’s unjustifiable behavior. But, at Rashida’s level, in doing so, what she’s actually doing is defaming Tiffany in the process,**” Freedman said.


> **MSNBC sees it differently. “MSNBC made a programming decision to cancel the show,”** a spokesperson for the network told Variety. “The news group makes these business decisions all the time.”


> Sources close to the situation say **Jones was concerned that Cross ignored her directives to stop taking on rival cable and radio personalities during her show**. In the end, Jones felt that as a leader she had to address insubordination. **Other insiders familiar with Cross said only one such directive was ever given, two weeks before she was fired.**


> **Yet the response to Cross’ firing from viewers, social media users and the activist community was intense. Cross trended on Twitter for days following her firing. More than 40 prominent Black figures demanded a personal meeting with Jones to explain Cross’ firing** on the eve “a critical midterm election,” and to discuss “a path forward that is restorative to the reputation and dignity of Ms. Cross,” reported Semafor.

> **With no shortage of damage to control, Jones walked the halls of “The View” in pursuit of Goldberg first, sources said**. Appearing at the door of her dressing room door, Jones encountered Goldberg in final touches of hair and makeup while reviewing her notes for the day’s show, said the sources. **Jones requested Goldberg’s staff leave the room so they could have a private conversation, which Goldberg declined, sources said. Another “View” insider present categorized the meeting as a “quick hello.”**"
Containment,If she had a problem with Tiffany’s “tone” then she needs to the let the whole MSNBC roster go starting with morning Joe. What a joke
Containment,Rashida Jones is president of MSNBC what
Containment,That's weird. It used to be you had to tell the truth about war to get fired from MSNBC.
Containment,Every thing I’ve ever seen from cross was straight racist against white people. I’m surprised she lasted as long as she did.
Containment,"When journalists BECOME the news, it's time for them to find the door."
Containment,So much for news channels having real news without having to worry about playing nice
Containment,Apparently Morning Joe isn’t under the rules that the Cross Connection was…
Containment,From paper sales to nurse to MSNBC President.
Containment,i came here to find out that same thing.
Containment,The real Rashida Jones would never do such a thing. She is a champion for justice!
Containment,"For real, for a second there I thought Ann Perkins had made it all the way to the top"
Containment,Where is the Zenni lady?
Containment,I’d like to see a “news program” with “opinion” where the prognosticators are hooked up to a lie detector machine so when their message starts to stray off-course we get a nice BUZZZZ and their mic gets shut off. It would at least take INFOTAINMENT to another level.
Containment,So little mention of the fact Tiffany's ratings were poor and she was regularly in third place.
Containment,The only problem with that show is Mika Brzezinski's over exaggerated moments of exasperation.
Containment,Can’t even watch morning Joe anymore bc it’s too much and there’s such a weird vibe now that they’ve been married for so long and are starting to seemingly hate and resent one another.
Containment,Totally different Rashida Jones
Containment,What did she say that was racist? Never really watched her before
Containment,"I’ve read a lot of accusations of her being “racist”
From actual, bonafide racists (such as Tucker Carlson), but I’ve never heard or read anything racist that she has said herself.

Criticizing Clarence Thomas and Florida is not a racist action. Criticizing racism is not the same thing as “bigotry on their side.” Anyone who feels butthurt over anything she has said may have felt a nerve being touched inside of themselves in her words."
Containment,Don't forget her stint as a [badass cop](https://youtu.be/IsUHmxBtRHY). Probably inspired by Jennifer Lawrence.
Containment,Ann Perkins!!
Containment,Dunder Mifflin?
Containment,You'd be surprised how well-trained and/or deluded some of them are.
Containment,That should be standard equipment during debates
Containment,"Wait I’m confused… they explain in the article that it was the opposite, that she had great ratings and attracted a specific demographic the network wanted."
Containment,Tiffany's show had the best ratings of any weekend show on MSNBC.
Containment,"How are there multiple Rashida Jones?

I looked it up, and apparently this “Jones” got the surname from a previous marriage. It doesn’t say the year of the marriage, but the actress got famous in 2006, and the executive is only 40 (so the actress became famous when the exec was 24). So there’s a good chance she knew she was naming herself after a celebrity."
Containment,Haha never heard of that show until now but that montage was great. Reminded me of a Leslie Nielsen bit
Animal Kingdom,"It's another 'Bro Show', by the numbers. They drive expensive & eclectic vehicles, hot women stand around in bikinis, plenty o' guns, adult men jumping off roofs into pools. I watched for a while because I love the [original movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAJDDbvix9k)."
Animal Kingdom,I was annoyed by it pretty quickly. Tried very hard to be edgy and extreme.
Animal Kingdom,"I didn't even watch the last season, that's how dramatically the quality fell for me."
Animal Kingdom,"I like it.. those editors know camera placement for sure. Get kore unbelievable as the seasons go on kind of like SoA.

Overall its a good show."
Animal Kingdom,"I watched it all like an idiot. It sux
Omg the movie is insanely good. Go watch it right now on starz I think it was there for free movie is a million times better"
Animal Kingdom,The movie it’s based on is a classic. Watch that instead.
Animal Kingdom,I really liked it! I loved the setting and I actually liked how it finished.
Animal Kingdom,Tbh it should have ended 2 seasons ago. Iykyk.
Animal Kingdom,"Loved it. Was much better in the earlier seasons but we followed till the end. Hated the last year with all the flashbacks, but they really did fill in the blanks with how they all got so screwed up."
Animal Kingdom,I didn’t watch it but someone in my house binge watched it while we were both working from home. It seems like every time I walked into the kitchen for something I saw a woman getting killed which I didn’t notice the first like dozen times but then began to notice it and thought it was kind of weird because I wasn’t seeing any dudes dying. I’m sure it was an odd coincidence as I’m sure there are dudes that die but I’d honestly love to see a breakdown of men vs women killed on the show lol.
Animal Kingdom,"I watched up to Season 4 or so. It began superstrong with Season 1 & 2 being good but after that it lost it in my opinion. 

To me it held that War Dogs-feel good 'with the gang' but then it just shattered."
Animal Kingdom,"Its a watchable show about a family crime gang; set in CA, lots of heists, lots of family dysfunction and paranoia.  Acting and drama is slightly above average, and the early seasons were much better than the latter seasons."
Animal Kingdom,"Guilty pleasure for sure.  It def got better the last couple seasons I thought, with the way they told the story.  Its not groundbreaking, but it's fun."
Animal Kingdom,"If you liked Sons of Anarchy, you’ll like Animal Kingdom. It’s a fun show which passes the time."
Animal Kingdom,"Is it worth watching if you're a fan of the original film? My hunch is that it will be terrible in comparison (I can't think of any American adaptations of Australian media that improve on the originals, but happy to be corrected)."
Animal Kingdom,I think it’s great.  One of my favorites.   If it were on a streaming network with more freedom I think it would be even better
Animal Kingdom,"The first season was alright. I’m not a fan of it anymore. I tried to finish the last season, but couldn’t bring myself to do it."
Animal Kingdom,The movie is 100% better than show. I have tried to show the movie to people who were fans of the show but they didn’t like the movie cause it wasn’t “bro” enough for them
Animal Kingdom,"This, and it got very repetitious very quickly."
Animal Kingdom,I only watched the last season because I knew it was the last.  Last couple of seasons were not good.
Animal Kingdom,Logically I know this show exists but it seems so bizarre to see it any other context than as a commercial during basketball
Animal Kingdom,Pope plays his character so well he needs more roles like this
Animal Kingdom,"Honorable Mentions:

* Samantha Morton (""Tales of the Walking Dead"")
* Julia Lester (""High School Musical: The Musical: The Series"")
* Myha’la Herrold (""Industry"")"
Animal Kingdom,"I’ve said this before but Animal Kingdom being on TNT really killed the show’s potential it’s really good but no one really gave it attention because it was on TNT. If it was on FX, HBO, Netflix etc it would’ve been a lot more popular.

Shawn Hatosy is an underrated talent in Hollywood hopefully whatever he does next he’s able to get award recognition from it."
Animal Kingdom,Samantha Morton was great.
Animal Kingdom,"This show is great. I feel like it went under a lot of people’s radar because it’s a TNT show. If this was on FX, HBO or even Netflix I think it would be extremely popular."
Animal Kingdom,"This may not be up there with some of the high quality prestigious dramas going right now, but this show has consistently been one of the most entertaining shows for me since it started.

I wish more people would check it out because it’s tons of fun."
Animal Kingdom,Did Shawn Hattosy get work done or is he just getting older? He looks so jarring.
Animal Kingdom,"I have never watched Animal Kingdom, but I always see the promos for it…

It basically looks like “Point Break” but as a TV show. Is that an accurate description?"
Animal Kingdom,Wait I thought last season was the last!?
Animal Kingdom,[deleted]
Animal Kingdom,"For me it's like a great B-Tier show.  Fun and entertaining even though it's not quite on the level of prestige TV.  Like Snowpiercer, Yellowstone or Snowfall."
Animal Kingdom,This is the way.
Animal Kingdom,Its on netflix canada
Animal Kingdom,The movie is one of my all time favorites. I should check out the show.
Animal Kingdom,i def want to watch it whenever it hits a streaming service
Animal Kingdom,"I can confirm that Shawn is aging, it’s supposed to be a secret though 🤫"
Animal Kingdom,That’s an awful picture. He looks like a burn victim.
Animal Kingdom,Yeah that was the first thing I noticed in the pic - he ruined his face.
Animal Kingdom,"Nope.  I think its become a trend with multi-seasoned shows running out of gas.  

Say that is over (from the production's perspective), but ""fool"" you to slog through at least another season.  I figure most people that invested into watching most of the show, will slog through the final one, so its a way for the production to get another season in they may otherwise not get (or the TV network wants to keep ""the bench"" around for another season of audience numbers)."
Animal Kingdom,I liked 1-4 but I didn’t even finish 5.
Animal Kingdom,"I am with you man. 

The first three seasons were spectacular. The fourth was ok, there was enough story in the modern time line to carry it. 

The fifth season was terrible I quit watching it. 

I will be checking out the sixth season but I don't have much hope."
Animal Kingdom,I'm not a huge fan of the flashbacks but I'm interested to see how they wrap this show up.
Animal Kingdom,Once they killed Smurf they should have just shut it down.
Animal Kingdom,[deleted]
Animal Kingdom,"Well, yeah, no one said it's prestige TV. It's a fun show and I'm glad they're wrapping it up.  Pope and Ellen Barkin are great characters.  Oceanside is a great backdrop as well and they do quite a lot of on location filming which makes it feel a little more real."
Animal Kingdom,Is snowpiercer any good?  I like the movie but never tried the show.
Animal Kingdom,"I’ve seen the movie, it’s really good. It’s funny cause so many people in it blew up after it came out too."
Animal Kingdom,If you liked the movie just imagine a worse version with American accents
Animal Kingdom,The first five seasons are streaming on Prime in the US.
Animal Kingdom,Kinda starting to look like Lou Diamond Phillips
Animal Kingdom,I think there’s potential for a Smurf free version of the show that works. She was barely in it towards the end either. Season five sucked for different reasons.
Animal Kingdom,[deleted]
Animal Kingdom,"I only mention it because I think there are a lot of people who feel like if it isn't 'prestige' it's not worth watching.  I just wanted to point out that while it might not be considered A-tier it's still a great show for what it is, basically Point Break the series."
Animal Kingdom,"Its a TV sci-fi series, with okay actors and okay writing."
Animal Kingdom,"Yeah, just like I said I think it's fun and really entertaining.  In some ways I like it a lot more than the film, just because it really gets to expand on that universe.  And it's got some great characters with Daveed Diggs, Jennifer Connelly, Sean Bean, Shelia Vand, Steven Ogg and Mickey Sumner.    
  
It's like 12 Monkeys.  Show that uses the story from the movie as a backdrop to set things up and then do it's own thing."
Animal Kingdom,Its hilarious to me that J from both the movie and Tv show also have roles in peaky blinders but never shared a scene unfortunately.
Animal Kingdom,"Mendelssohn, weaver, pierce, Worthington were already huge stars at this point"
Animal Kingdom,I didn't like the movie and loved the show.
Animal Kingdom,That’s what I was afraid of.
Animal Kingdom,thanks!!
Animal Kingdom,I find it funny how the roles of J and Michael were so similar. The “found” member of the family who is brought in and turns out to be a decent criminal that eventually wants to take over. And grows to hate the leader of said criminal family.
Animal Kingdom,"I guess just Edgerton then, but to be fair, I don’t think Mendelssohn was that big in America until after Animal Kingdom."
Animal Kingdom,The show and movie has very little in common.
Animal Kingdom,"The quote from this week's Rehearsal, ""I was wiping granddad's ass while watching dragon ball z"" killed me."
Animal Kingdom,"He said ""while we were watching dragon Ball z "" meaning maybe the grandpa,  who's mental faculty are slipping, is maybe watching Dragon Ball Super"
Animal Kingdom,GaTa wins it for me this week. I haven’t been that emotional in a while.
Animal Kingdom,"Shawn is great,love Pope."
Animal Kingdom,"He is a hell of a good actor, I’ve seen him in many shows in past years"
Animal Kingdom,Fantasy Island's premiere was fantastic. Bellamy Young's performance in the opening scene alone is worth the watch.
Animal Kingdom,"yeah he absolutely steals it this week. his character is extremely stoic and hard to figure out, and after 5 seasons and like 7 years we finally see him lose it. absolute immense performance, sorry to Dave but a comedic performance won’t hold any candle to this"
Animal Kingdom,Alpha Dog
Animal Kingdom,"That finale was really well done. GaTa has been amazing on that show, he's 100% the heart."
Animal Kingdom,"GaTa is awesome in Dave. I'm really excited for season 3...With how it ended I kind of think they are going to make it about both Dave and GaTa since his name is also Dave....With the first season it ended with Charlamagne saying ""Whats your name?"" and then it cuts to the Dave logo. For season 2 it ended with them singing ""Aint no doubt about we..."" then ""DAVE"" lights up behind them. 

A lot of people were saying that this season didnt feel as good as the first because it was too focused on lil dicky and his ego but with the finale it all made sense and made the season as a whole much better in my opinion."
Animal Kingdom,"When I realized what was happening for GaTa, I cried right along with him. 

Partly for his success, partly for Dave supporting his friend, and partly cause it was a harsh moment for me to realize I don’t have any ride or die friends who would do that for me or me for them."
Animal Kingdom,Liked him since Southland.
Animal Kingdom,"When he finally broke down and told Deran what was going on, man what a scene.  Honestly one of the shows I look forward to most each week.  It might not be the *best* but Goddamn it's just so much fun."
Animal Kingdom,This show was the first time I saw him but he is killing it. His character is most interesting one in the show thanks to his acting.
Animal Kingdom,Comedic performance? You haven't watched Dave have you?
Animal Kingdom,"The scene of his southland character finding the gun in the kid's room, and screaming ""why?!??"" at the kid is somehow seared into my memory"
Animal Kingdom,"I thought killing off Smurf might have been its death knell, but I'm still into it."
Animal Kingdom,"i have, but didn't see this week. nothing against anyone on lil dicky's real life adaptation, but the 7 year build up of this character is too much to ignore, regardless of character or role"
Animal Kingdom,"He's a very intense actor, I can't help but feel that John Wells came up with the Pope character specifically with him in mind."
Animal Kingdom,What do you think of the young Smurf flashbacks?  I'm digging them.  Not sure how I feel about Pamela coming into the picture but we'll see how it plays out.
Animal Kingdom,"I think they’re just eating up valuable time that could be used by the other actors, that’s just my opinion"
Animal Kingdom,"They're intriuging and generally well done.  I'm assuming it's going to tie into why Pope has the problems that he does, among other things.  It'll probably give us more detail on Pamela too.  I was surprised that they're still doing them after Smurf got killed off.  Interesting factoid:  the woman who plays young Smurf is Vincent D'Onoferio's daughter, and she's married to Sean Penn."
Animal Kingdom,"> What do you think of the young Smurf flashbacks?

I am sick of them. They need to just carve them out into their own show or be done with them."
Animal Kingdom,Actress playing young Smurf just married 60yr. Old Sean Penn
Animal Kingdom,"Really?

Imagine being almost the age of Penn and him being your Son in Law."
Animal Kingdom,"Well, I guess that's why they call it ""Hollyweird."""
Animal Kingdom,I think it's a fun show with cool heists. Characters are pretty good. The last season was a little meh. Too many flashbacks last season
Animal Kingdom,Highly underrated show imo
Animal Kingdom,"The first four seasons are awesome. The fifth season is lousy. The sixth season, out next year, will be the last.

It is a wild cross/mashup of The Brady Bunch and Point Break."
Animal Kingdom,"Good, fun, B grade FX show. 


The Australian movie is better though and obviously more accurate as it's based on the Petingills."
Animal Kingdom,"The quality really dips, but it's good for those who like the magic criminal genre."
Animal Kingdom,The church heist from Season 2 is still the highlight of the series to me.
Animal Kingdom,It's a poor attempt at making an American version of Peaky Blinders. Finn Cole even played pretty much the same character in both shows.
Animal Kingdom,"Was a fun watch during lockdown, but I’ll be honest, I lost interest in the latest season that aired over the summer. The Smurf flashbacks and the boys present-day storyline was weak af.  Not sure I’ll ever pick it back up to see the final season."
Animal Kingdom,Tv version sucks
Animal Kingdom,It was on a cable channel some years ago and I really liked it. then I lost cable!
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,It’s the eyebrows.  They’re attack eyebrows.
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,“It’s a very small universe when I’m angry with you”
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,"Why do all doctors make such good villains? Matt , David, and now Peter. Great casting all around."
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,"It and he are very good, I spent all afternoon watching it.

Jessica Raine and Nikesh Patel are also superb.

I'll also add Jessica Raine feels so established yet the only other thing I've seen her in is Line of Duty."
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,Watching him as Malcolm Tucker taught me this.
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,Lair of the White Worm is the Peter Capaldi movie we should all be watching this Halloween
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,That kid from *Local Hero*?
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,Currently on episode 4 and enjoying it. Raine is so good and liking Patel too.
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,First I've heard of this show. Knowing Capaldi is in it though is all I need.
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,I heard about this on Reddit. C'mon Amazon! You can market more than one show
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,"Of course have to show clip from Thick of it. NSFW language as expected :)

https://youtu.be/6NwvjPlcC3w"
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,He really is awesome.
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,I remember seeing him in an alternate music video for Lewis Capaldis “Someone you loved” and I really enjoyed how he could tell the story without saying anything.
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,"Just finished the show, but I'm not really sure if I'd go out of my way to recommend it.

The acting from everyone is generally great, the editing (for the more 'dreamy' sections especially) is great and even the little amount of action is all well directed. Also want to give a special spotlight for the ominious vibe the soundtrack/sound design gives.

 That said, the pacing makes what plot there is feel *really* drawn out. A big chunk of the show really relies on the mystery. If this is your first rodeo with >!multiple timelines!< shenanigans you may find it interesting, but I've seen it done better in shows that don't feel like a BBC cop drama seems slightly grafted on. There is some interesting thematics at play too but those also don't save it.

Really should've either cut out a episode or two and smeared in some answers along the way, or hell, have potentially made this a movie. 

And for anyone who wants to watch it for Capaldi primarily: Be warned he only gets a few appearances until the second half generally. Or more specifically (minor spoiler) >!5/6 episodes he only gets 1/2 scenes, most of which are flashforwards. The finale is about 80% Capaldi, which is all great and very 12-ish.!<"
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,I enjoyed his acting on The Torchwood special.  He wasn't a bad Doctor Who either.
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,Don’t blink!
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,"Really loved this. Just finished and though the premise/reveal reminds me heavily of >!the first fifteen lives of harry august!<  (do not tap that spoiler if you have not finished!) I greatly enjoyed the mystery, and found the first few episodes really terrifying."
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,"Spoke with an accent. Irish... Scottish? Same difference. Looks to partner. Partner discreetly shakes his head. 

I got halfway and dropped it. Too long to get to reveal. Not much Capaldi. The lead detective and the guy from Andor. Wanted more of them."
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,Angry Old Man Get Off My Lawn Doctor is scary now?
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,You want proof of his terrifying capabilities? He helped get his no talent hack of a cousin Lewis Capaldi a record deal and a singing career. Truly an evil force.
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,Just a shame he was wasted in The Suicide Squad. Been a fan of his since the Malcolm Tucker days.
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,Too bad he couldn't salvage the train wreck that is the story in this series.
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,he usually plays a bad guy on TV. it was only on Dr. Who that I have ever seen him as a good guy. He is scary good at being a bad bad person on tv. To the point that you think he is the devil himself.
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,"Don't look in that mirror, it's furious !"
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,Assault eyebrows.
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,"“If you think because she is dead that I am weak, you understand very little. If you had any part in killing her and are not afraid, you understand nothing at all. So for you own sake, understand this: I’m The Doctor, I’m coming to find you, and I will never ever stop.”"
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,Thor 2 notwithstanding. (Sorry Chris.)
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,"The doctor has a lot of elements of ‘The Trickster’ archetype, which works well for villains. 

I also think that it’s just one of those characters that you need to be good at everything to play well. You need to good at being comedic, emotional, intimidating, charismatic, etc. So it attracts very well rounded actors."
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,Arguably because the doctor is a villain in a way.
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,"because the Doctor has to have a terrifying streak, which comes out rather frequently. Watch Runaway Bride for some really cold, evil Tennant"
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,"Same, I haven’t binged anything in a while a this made me binge the whole thing.  Loved the idea behind the show."
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,Jessica Raine is just incredible to watch.
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,>!Can only remember her being flung out the window.!<
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,"I felt that way too, then I realized she was also in Informer."
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,**YOU SACK OF FUCKING CUM**
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,"Isaac shouldn't be here, it's a fucking omnishambles."
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,my household just watched it for the first time last night. Nobody knew anything about it beside some vague idea that it had vampires. We were blown away. What a wild ride that movie is.
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,"Been on my watch list for years, never realized he was in it gonna have to pull the trigger"
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,People keep forgetting he was Malcom Tucker first...
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,Torchwood special?
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,They actually never met until one of Lewis’ live shows.
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,"That was his first episode too, wasn’t it?"
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,"Eccleston was incredible in The Leftovers though for sure.  He deserves his own credit, even if it's not as a villain."
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,"Chris played the army major in 28 Days Later, he was very good there."
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,28 Days Later
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,He actually was a good villain. The story just kinda sucked and didn’t let him actually do much with the role
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,"Man, I was genuinely excited for him but his character was so poorly written in the movie."
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,"The Doctor is a fearsome creature, as seen at the end of *Family of Blood*. Even the most fearsome races, including the Daleks, fear him, and for good reason. He can be civil, polite, and even cheerful and jovial, but he is not a nice ""person"".        

One of my favorite moments is when Matt Smith has an alien race look up what happened to every race that opposed him and then tells them to run."
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,The doctor is clearly not a villain
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,*listen to me you fucking jazzy bastard*
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,"Oh no. That was my introduction to him.

That said,  fuckity-bye."
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,"What a phenomenal show.


https://youtu.be/j8V_TANCjaM"
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,I believe he was a main character in The Torchwood Children of Earth.  It was a special season.  I should have added more detail.
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,Who frowned me this face?
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,How can you forget his role for Gone in 60 seconds :)
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,Two Boats and a Helicopter is one of my favourite episodes of television ever. Eccleston is so good in the Leftovers.
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,I’ll give him that one. He was good in it.
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,">He never raised his voice. That was the worst thing… the fury of the Time Lord… and then we discovered why. Why this Doctor, who had fought with gods and demons, why he had run away from us and hidden. He was being kind…

> Good men don't need rules. Today is not the day to find out why I have so many."
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,">The doctor is clearly not a villain

The Doctor is a deity. Major or minor is debatable, but tends towards chaotic good..."
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,"Thats an incredibly homophobic headline, you massive poof"
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,"Better than the doc, that's for sure."
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,It is devastating
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,I’ve seen it. Don’t remember Capaldi. Guess I’ll have to go watch Torchwood again!!
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,And G.I. Joe and 28 days later
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,I still giggle when he begs Cage to put the wooden chair down in the middle of trying to kill him
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,Then big brother takes the fall for the slip-up. It don't matter much to me. One Raines is as good as another. It never rains but it pours.
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,Just reading the quote i hear it in his voice. Chills
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,So you think he uses his powers for evil. That's what you're saying?
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,"the 456 truly the most terrifying villains in the DW universe and probably even broader

I mean alien junkies addicted on chemicals they could only get from human children willing to destroy a planet if they don't get a fix is an incredible concept... and no Doctor in sight to save the children

I'm almost positive some of the ridiculous real world conspiracies about adrenochrome and kidnapping children come from this fucking season"
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,He was also in The Others as Nicole Kidman’s husband.
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,"That's not what ""chaotic good"" means."
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,I wouldn’t count that as a villain role.
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,"Nope, but you're arguing that the doctor is in someway a villain even though he saves the world and civilizations throughout time on a consistent episodic basis.

This whole argument is nonsense. Plus to go the other route on your argument,  he's not a deity or a god. He's a god like figure. Closer to a fallen angel as his whole mythology (forgetting the Chibnall shite) is about him stealing a tardis and fleeing/being cast aside by the timelord race.

You've only been upvoted for the poncey statement. It in no way supports your argument that the doctor is a villain i.e. evil in some way."
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,"No, but I like to mention it here and there in case somebody hasn’t seen it in 20 years or so."
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,"The Doctor generally isn't a villain, but occasionally cleaves close to it. Remember the whole ""Time Lord Victorius"" thing? Or the other times where the only thing to keep him from doing terrible things is his companions. The Doctor has said it many times himself that when he's alone for too long he goes.... wrong.

I also think that you've got me confused with somebody else and you really should double check who you're replying to in the future. But what they said *is* correct. The Doctor is a deity and a terrifying existence--whether he is good or bad; hero or villain, is often down to perspective. Most of the times he comes across as good, but he is always *capable* of doing terrible things."
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,"Kate Bush:

>”I thought that the track would get some attention, but I just never imagined that it would be anything like this. It’s so exciting. But it’s quite shocking really, isn’t it? I mean, the whole world’s gone mad.”

>”What’s really wonderful I think is that this is a whole new audience. In a lot of cases, they’ve never heard of me. And I love that. The thought of all these really young people hearing the song for the first time and discovering it is, well, I think it’s very special.”

>“I thought, what a lovely way for the song to be used in such a positive way. You know, as a kind of talisman almost for Max. And yeah, I think it’s very touching, actually.”"
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,"It makes me feel good for a new generation of fans to come across music that was part of my early years. Seeing Kate Bush, Nirvana, and Phil Collins have a resurgence over the past few years has been really cool.

There's a ton of really good music from the past 50+ years waiting to be uncovered."
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,"I've really loved the new season of Stranger Things but I've practically been following the news of Running Up That Hill's chart success even more closely than anything about the show itself, it's honestly just such a feel-good story, that this song she released almost 40 years ago is now more successful than ever before and she suddenly has a whole new legion of young fans thanks to Stranger Things. I can't even imagine how this must feel for her.

It's so nice seeing such a huge win go to so somebody who deserves it so much, and she's been so humble about it all too. This whole story is honestly really amazing and I'm so happy for her!"
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,Cloudbusting is next
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,"I understand that Kate Bush was very popular in the UK and many other parts of the world including large cities in the US but I came from a small town in Indiana and no one I knew listened to Kate Bush or Depeche Mode. No one I knew played D&D, no one I knew listened to synth wave music, no one I knew was fascinated with sci-fi and horror movies and computers and science. I watched Mr. Wizard by myself because no one wanted to watch ""educational"" TV.
  
As a 42 year old guy who felt very isolated from society because of my seemingly-strange interests, it has been surreal to see the new generations embrace so many of these things that once were strange and unusual but are now seen as normal and it seems like everyone understands nerd culture. I cannot even explain to you how people used to see it, but trust me when I say that 80s movies with bullies and people who pick on the weird kid are a hollow representation of the suffering and abuse many of us faced for being strange.
  
I want to say it has been liberating but it doesn't really feel that way. I could say vindication but that's not it, I never really worried about justifying my interests, I just wish I hadn't felt so alone in them.  
  
Now I don't feel so alone anymore."
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,I really love good use of music in TV shows and movies.
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,It was wild to see some people angry that young people liked the song now. Like…how do you expect people to have knowledge of every artist and song there is. It’s great
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,I wouldn’t be surprised if they release a stranger things branded vinyl soundtrack or a cassette single. Would probably sell pretty well
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,"FYI the article appears to credits""BBC One"" for the interview when it was in fact BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour.   
Wouldn't bother me so much except that the article actually links to the interview!

Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,"They use it in the trailer for Part 2 of the season too... not going to lie... it brought tears to my eyes. It's such a powerful song, Kate Bush has been low key used in popular TV for a long time... my personal favorite https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=If-HfBw1Ft4"
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,"What I find hilarious is that I haven't watched stranger things, didn't know who kate bush was and recently fell in love with a *cover* of this song because of its music video, not knowing it was a cover."
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,">It’s been all downhill for Kate Bush’s 1985 hit “Running Up That Hill” ever since the Duffer Brothers used the 1985 hit for a pivotal scene in “Stranger Things 4.”

Either I've been using that phrase wrong my entire life, or the author doesn't know what that phrase means."
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,Its funny that this got posted because I looked up the soundtrack right after I saw that episode to find that song. Its a banger for sure.
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,">The Whole World’s Gone Mad

The world is upside down"
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,Curious what song Eddie will be playing in the upside down and if that has the same effect for that songs artist .
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,"I never cared much for the song, but when used in the show I loved it."
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,"Tbh, I didn't even know that was a 80's Kate Bush song until Stranger Things.

I first heard the song when Placebo covered it in the early 2000s... not realizing it was a cover."
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,Loved this song since it first came out. Kate Bush makes amazing music.
Inside the World’s Toughest Prisons,I've seen dozens of tiktok videos using that song just because it's popular now.

Angry Birds,Thank god
Angry Birds,Does nobody remember CBS's insanely bad Candy Crush game show from a few years ago?
Angry Birds,neat
Angry Birds,"At first glance, I thought this was just as stupid as the Candy Crush Show but if you have a show where people are actually launching themselves to destroy stuff then you might have just interested me. "
Angry Birds,">Big Fish Entertainment is partnering with Rovio Entertainment to develop the popular mobile game as a live-action game show currently titled “Angry Birds Challenge.” It will incorporate large-scale obstacle courses with classic defense zones comprised of water, wood, ice, and stone barriers, all modeled after the game. Teams also get to pick their own challenges, which will be part of the strategy for finishing the course the fastest. They must race to reach the “castle tower” and save as many eggs as possible.

>Big Fish president Dan Cesareo and chief creative officer Lucilla D’Agostino serve as executive producers, as well as Jeff Bennett and Joe Lawson, head of content licensing for Rovio. No network is currently attached.

>“No matter what genre Big Fish develops in, it’s part of our DNA to make sure we’re giving audiences something they haven’t seen before,” said Cesareo. “Partnering with Rovio to elevate ‘Angry Birds’ for television is something we’re excited to offer buyers, and to give fans a reimagined, interactive experience of one of their favorite games.”"
Angry Birds,A few years ago...don’t you mean last year?
Angry Birds,"Wow, I was jut going to ask if this was the first show of its kind. Now I have mixed feelings about it. :D"
Angry Birds,"Shit, it just feels like longer."
Angry Birds,"I think you missed the most straight-forward reason - he's appeasing Walt, who is incredibly important to his operation at this point. If you watch the scene again, Gus tells Jesse that Walt came to him and told him about Jesse's plans. Walt is even sitting on the same side of the table as Gus is. 

If Gus had his way, Jesse would likely have been taken care of already and Gail would be in the lab with Walt. But he knows that Walt likely wouldn't agree to keep cooking if he did that so he intervenes and gives Jesse a chance to avoid that fate. He similarly lets Walt keep living at the end of S4 when Jesse has turned to his side for the same reason - he can't risk having no one to cook his product.

I'd also add that while Gus is cold and calculating, he isn't always disciplined. He goes to confront Lalo himself in BCS and Hector as well. He doesn't seem to hide himself from lower level peons like Nacho and Arturo in that show either."
Angry Birds,"During the meeting Gus says to Jesse 'These men are my trusted employees', and I've think I've always just taken that at face value? I also assumed the dealers probably would've kept their mouths shut about Gus' identity if they were ever arrested, much like Mike's 11 (12?) guys, who were all being compensated for not cooperating with APD/DEA and were at least implicitly aware of the Pollos Hermanos connection. Whether or not Tomas' dealers were on the same level or had ever met Gus prior to that meeting, who knows.

My interpretation is that by revealing to Jesse that Walt had essentially taken Gus' side, Gus would discourage him from trying to take out the 2 dealers or escalate things further. A part of Gus probably expected Jesse to do what he did and be killed in the process but, like you said, he didn't expect or account for Walt's intervention at all.

EDIT: Nacho was also a very special case, Gus needed someone else to be blamed for Lalo and a concrete way to cement that blame; or for Nacho to go away and not him point the finger pointed at Gus. With his own dealers, no one would have batted an eye if he ordered Victor or Gus to dispose of them quietly."
Angry Birds,I like these discussions.
Angry Birds,"I feel like Nacho and Arturo are like the Victor and Tyrus of the Salamanca operation, they deal with supplying and and getting money from the low level dealers, and just general management of street related things. They also report directly to Hector, and Gus has to hide his involvement in Arturo's murder and pin it on another faction.

Great point about Walter. I suspect Gus had always planned to be rid of him due to Hank, but at that time Walt would need to stick around for awhile, so its absolutely in Gus's best interest to appease Walt in regards to Jesse, bonus points for stroking Walt's ego by telling Jesse how much respect he has for him. I still feel like Gus was betting on Jesse being killed in a conflict with the dealers. He gets what he wants and still has Walt, which is almost what happened if not for Walt's intervention.

In season 4, Gus really doesn't have a circumstance like this to have Walter killed, but he does still get as close as he can. He pretty boldly threatens Walt in the desert, which would have worked out had Walt had the funds to pay the vacuum man."
Angry Birds,"I can accept that the two dealers in this episode were never properly characterized as important enough to be Gus-worthy or at the same level as Nacho, Arturo, Victor, or Tyrus. But I still think the scene makes sense overall because Gus is putting on a show for Walt."
Angry Birds,"I agree, Gus knew exactly how to play Walt. Him telling Walt that he that he should still provide for his family because he is a man and that's what men do just to get him to cook also comes to mind. He sort of attempts the same with Mike with his comment about Justice, and how he understands revenge.

Also this is awkward, but I had just edited my original reply to you as I was kind of in a rush when I wrote it and I decided in didn't really make much sense, but then I refreshed when I was done and saw you had already replied, but I hope I was able to convey a little better what exactly I was trying to say."
Angry Birds,Quarry should have been more entertaining than it was.
Angry Birds,"Yeah I loved the idea, and the people involved and their previous projects, but for some reason Quarry just didn't stick with me. Watched it all but hardly remember it."
Angry Birds,"I'm... actually interested in this.

Didn't think it'd be possible for me to care about a LoL related thing, and yet, here I am... caring. Dig the animation for this."
Angry Birds,"The animation looks amazing, and this along with a universe with kinda unique take on fantasy genre makes me very excited.

Edit: They've also released a [collab with Imagine Dragons and J.I.D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9G1VOjN_84). I know its Imagine Dragons, but the tune's cool."
Angry Birds,I have never played LOL but it looks interesting and the animation is amazing. I didn't know anything about DOTO too but I liked that too. It seems like Netflix keeps making shows based on game IPs. I think they are making Splinter Cell series too. And of course there is Castlevania which was great.
Angry Birds,"Man it seems like Fortiche Productions went all out with the animation on this, it looks so good."
Angry Birds,"Act 1 (Episodes 1-3) Premieres November 6th!

Act 2 - Nov. 13th (Ep. 4-6)

Act 3 - Nov. 20th (Ep. 7-9)

Main Cast:

* Vi ⁠— Hailee Steinfeld

* Jayce — Kevin Alejandro
* Caitlyn — Katie Leung
* Silco — Jason Spisak
* Mel — Toks Olagundoye
* Vander - JB Blanc
* Viktor - Harry Lloyd
* Powder - Mia Sinclair Jenness"
Angry Birds,"Nice that there's more Western animation made, though the only ones I personally cared about were Castlevania and Invincible. I see *plenty* of value in Western animation as an alternative to anime."
Angry Birds,The art style is very similar to Dishonored. I will definitely have to watch this!
Angry Birds,This should have been the look of Marvel’s What If
Angry Birds,"So, is any knowledge of LoL needed to watch/enjoy this?"
Angry Birds,"League of legends... Meh...

...

Holy fuck... That art style is fucking incredible. Wow. I'm in.

I don't know if I've seen something like that before. That's excellent work."
Angry Birds,Netflix's Animation catalogue just keeps getting better. I don't see any streaming service coming close anytime soon
Angry Birds,Every time I see this it reminds me of this 3D CG Hotwheels cartoon that used to play on Cartoon Network in the 00's.
Angry Birds,[deleted]
Angry Birds,Never played LoL but this looks pretty good animation-wise. I don't see a rating anywhere though. Would this be suitable for my almost 10 year old kid?
Angry Birds,"Holy crap, that animation. I am absolutely loving this stylistic renaissance lately, it’s like a whole new medium. I’ve never played or been interested in League of Legends, but I am 100% sold on this trailer."
Angry Birds,It looks so much like Dishonored.
Angry Birds,"Not familiar with League of Legends, but this is white-hot fire.  BRING IT."
Angry Birds,I have no idea what this is about wrt the video game(s?) but the art direction is slick af
Angry Birds,Riot doing what Blizzard refuses to do. Instead we got... whatever you wanna call that live action movie of theirs. *Shudders*
Angry Birds,"Don't know anything about LoL.

is this leaning heavily on established lore or is it a completely new on it's own thing?"
Angry Birds,"Looks like a tell-tale game as a show. ALso didn't expect this to be about LoL. Not familiar with that world, but looks cool"
Angry Birds,God damn this looks so impressive visually.  I know it's 3d animated but they really succeeded in making every frame look like it was painted instead.  Top notch.
Angry Birds,"The animation looks gorgeous, and I'll check it out for that reason alone. Story and characters look interesting enough too, seems promising."
Angry Birds,I'll watch this just for the steampunk aesthetic
Angry Birds,"It seems a little angsty for me, hopefully it leans more into class exploitation than edgy anarchist themes. But regardless it definitely looks like one of those movies worth watching just for the visual spectacle, props to the design and animation team are due before I've even seen it."
Angry Birds,Not a single smile on Jinx
Angry Birds,Is this a show or a trailer for a new LOL Xpac?
Angry Birds,Damn can't wait not to watch this
Angry Birds,From the people that brought you a company culture of rampant sexism and CEOs farting point plank in employee's faces...
Angry Birds,"Oh cool, a new Netflix genre thing!

“From the makers of League of Legends”

Nope, fuck that noise."
Angry Birds,"finally competition to the dota anime , neat animation style but i like anime so dota wins once again"
Angry Birds,Didn't even finish the trailer. Looks so boring and uninteresting.
Angry Birds,"I'll pirate this, sure."
Angry Birds,"Children’s cartoons tend to create really toxic/insane fan bases (see: Stephen Universe, Avatar, She-Ra, Etc.). The addition of League of Legends into the mix indicates that a fan of this program will likely commit domestic terrorism at some point."
Angry Birds,[deleted]
Angry Birds,"I like it. It has that Dishonored aesthetics.

That being said, is this yet another idea that LoL stole from Dota? It has been more than a decade already."
Angry Birds,"I see so many people applauding the art style and saying it looks amazing, am I the only one that feels like the whole thing looks cheap? Everything looks... off? I can't quite put it in words, but it's like they tried to make a 3d anime and it just falls short of the mark."
Angry Birds,"Not played the game for years and years, but very few of these characters seem familiar at all. 

I don't think there's a single one of the original champions in the show, making it not really feel like the game at all to me."
Angry Birds,"Me starting the trailer: ""oh it's from the LoL creators, can't stand LoL but the animation here is cool and maybe it will be pretty different to LoL""

Me 5 seconds later: ""oh it *is* LoL, nvm"""
Angry Birds,"Riot, you are like 5 years late. The fan base is so diminished that this just feels out of place.

Still excited to watch it, but that’s not gonna make me go back to league."
Angry Birds,"As always, they copy dota :P"
Angry Birds,"I hate that this looks so good, and wow maybe Vi will get some attention in game now too."
Angry Birds,"Stopped playing League years ago and I still won't come back. Still will watch this, I'm just desperate for fantasy series, hopefully this one is good."
Angry Birds,It looks fantastic. Was it made with Blender?
Angry Birds,Awesome!
Angry Birds,"""You talked too much""

I don't know Maffews reddit username, but I hope he saw that so he can add it to a Botchamania."
Angry Birds,I like the art style. I guess I know what I'm doing Nov. 6th.
Angry Birds,"I honestly don’t mind the weekly ish releases, I just must prefer the way they are doing this. Give us a few episodes on release then weekly then on."
Angry Birds,"I've been waiting for a company like Blizzard or Square (ones that always have amazing CGI cinematics) to make a CGI show of one of their properties.  Thank god Riot stepped up, looks great."
Angry Birds,"One thing riot has nearly always consistently knocked out of the park, is cinematics and music."
Angry Birds,"Likewise. It's one of those things where I've always been disappointed seeing the actual game after watching the cinematics, seeing the art and lore behind it. I'm happy they're doing other things with it all now."
Angry Birds,"Same.  I never had interest in playing the game or anything, but I discovered the short form animations, generally in the form of music video content, Riot does a few years back and was a fan of that.   

This seems to play towards that, so I'll be checking it out for sure."
Angry Birds,"As someone who has played the game for a while and really likes some of the lore, it’s exciting to see newcomers interested in this show"
Angry Birds,"The Dota one was awesome, so I'll at least give it a chance.  Looks good otherwise."
Angry Birds,Looks very visually stimulating.
Angry Birds,"As much as the dev team comes across like a barrel of flailing fish with their 200 combined years of experience bullshit, their lore team has been pretty good afaik. 

It's been about half a decade since they established what they then called their universe team, and they've been working on worldbuilding ever since."
Angry Birds,"I dont play LoL anymore, but I still love [Jinx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nlJuwO0GDs&ab_channel=LeagueofLegends).

I hope there wont be too much LoL jargon, I'm already cringing at ""Top side is getting carried""."
Angry Birds,"The only thing that worries me is whether the content can live up to the great look.  
It would be a shame if characters and story drown in style and art.  
On the other hand - if the content is as good as the looks then I'm sold."
Angry Birds,"Yep, will be very interesting to see.

>universe with kinda unique take on fantasy

Not really unique, League world is not that different from other kitchen sink universes like Warcraft, 30s-60s pulps, comic books, Simon R Green, Discworld, etc. It's just well planned considering Riot's goals with multiple games and the fact that the story is at the beginning"
Angry Birds,"Yeah, I like it too.  It looks like a comic book illustration in motion."
Angry Birds,"I don't care much for imagine dragons, but that song bumps."
Angry Birds,"What's with all the hate against Imagine Dragons? - sure, I don't like the direction they're going recently, with their more Pop-ish songs, but I dig a lot of their earlier stuff, and afaik this anti-Imagine-Dragons bandwagon has started way before their Pop phase"
Angry Birds,That shit is a banger fam!
Angry Birds,It's a shame the money is going to Tencent.
Angry Birds,Imagine Dragons. They could not have gone with a more safe and boring option. Disappointing is all.
Angry Birds,"> unique take on fantasy genre

This LoL shit is like a fantasy dump cake."
Angry Birds,"I thought Dragon's Blood was great. With series like Castlevania, The Witcher and hopefully The Last of Us all being pretty good, it seems like the video game adaptation curse has finally ended?

>It seems like Netflix keeps making shows based on game IPs

Not sure what the case was regarding DB and Castlevania, but in this show Netflix is really only acting as distributor, the show itself was made by Riot and Fortiche."
Angry Birds,I'm pretty sure Netflix didn't make this. Riot just choose Netflix as the streaming service.
Angry Birds,"LoL has some great cinematics.

The yearly season trailers are great to watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF5Ddo9JdpY

And the Runeterra trailers are pretty fun: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbJhZW-iN0s

Speaking of which, I do hope they're doing a Bilgewater series in that tone at some point."
Angry Birds,Netflix has probably made the best adaptations of games ever. They are all really good so far.
Angry Birds,"Netflix is just the distributor for this, Riot pretty much slaved away Fortiche to do this, Netflix didn't even provide funding as this was started and done so many years ago."
Angry Birds,"> I think they are making Splinter Cell series too.

Wow they should try doing a novelization of that."
Angry Birds,I’m was so confused that you swapped the actor/character order at the end
Angry Birds,"Seems like they're not using the same actors as in LoL, which is a bit sad. The characters are younger in Arcane, so it could work, but Vi, Caitlyn, Jayce, and Viktor are all adults already, so their voices should be pretty close."
Angry Birds,Why is this a weekly release lol
Angry Birds,Oh phew I was worried each part was 1 episode and was curious how they'd fit that much in there
Angry Birds,I'm quite sure I saw Karma multiple times in the trailer.
Angry Birds,"It's weird that it took this long for companies to invest in western ""anime"" (ie action adventure animation that isn't primarily adult comedy or kids cartoons). After the success (and relative cheapness) of Castlevania, Invincible, and What If and the resurgence of Airbender in popularity I think streamers are beginning to invest a lot more."
Angry Birds,I love how animated shows are starting to get longer episodes and feel more cinematic (e.g. Invincible and Maya and the Three). They don’t have to be limited by the episodic structure we usually see on cable TV
Angry Birds,"I like western, and I like Japanese animation. What I don't like is western anime. It always falls short in several ways no matter what they try to do. 

This actually looks interesting, and while not exactly unique (steam punkish struggle between the asshole elite at the (actual) top and the good guys) it's filling a void where there's not much in the way of western animated tales in the genre.

Will be watching it after the 20th."
Glitch,"There's another show called ""Glitch"" on Netflix. This won't be confusing at all..."
Glitch,">About a woman searching for her missing boyfriend, who disappeared one night in a flash of unknown lights. With the help of a community of UFO watchers, she uncovers the truth behind a mysterious secret.

>Hong Ji Hyo is a “parachute hire” (someone who got hired based on their family connections). She has a steady job and a solid family background. Although they are no longer passionately in love, she also has a boyfriend that she’s dated for four years. The couple is beginning to think of marriage when her boyfriend suddenly goes missing.

>Heo Bo Ra is an unsuccessful Twitch streamer and a YouTuber with only a few hundred subscribers, whose content is all about mysteries. She’s a warrior who wields a keyboard as her weapon, and she’s a member of the UFO watcher community. She spends day after day inside her room, editing her videos."
Glitch,Trash show koreans fell off with their shows
Glitch,"Looks goofy but interesting, hope it’s good."
Glitch,As a kpop Stan now I understand why nana had all those tattoos
Glitch,"i loved the Australian ""people-back-from-dead"" series called GLITCH.
i love so many S. Korean/Asian shows and movies but this one does not look good to me. i'm SOOO excited for seasons 2 and 3 of Netflix's S. Korean horror series SWEET HOME!"
Glitch,Australian show? I feel like the premise has some parallels too.
Glitch,That show started so strong and quickly fell off the deep end.
Glitch,"This is one of the few new shows lately where I was actively excited about watching it.

It's not perfect--the Bree/Reed relationship is a little too trite--but I love all the characters and the arc of the show. 

I highly recommend watching it, especially if there's anyone in the cast you enjoy.

Also: Johnny Knoxville knocks it out of the park. I was...shocked."
Glitch,"Appreciate hat they don't do the faux documentary,, breaking fourth wall. I think that should take a rest for a while, with Abott Elementary being the last one to get away with it.

Love KMK, Judy Greer, even Paul Resider, who doesn't just fall back on shtick from his old sitcom with Helen Hunt. Love the writers room, esp Two Soups. Even don't not like the ""kid.""

Will watch again."
Glitch,"I'm glad to see Judy Greer in a main role, one of the funniest actresses around."
Glitch,"I overall enjoyed this show, and it feels to me like a show that could go from ""oh, that's pretty good"" to ""wow, that's fucking fantastic"" in the second season and beyond, depending on how things develop in the writers' room. The ingredients are all there for it, they just need to find their footing a bit more.

The cast is absolutely stellar - anything that gives Judy Greer a chance to shine is always A-OK by me, and I think Rachel Bloom and Paul Reiser are perfectly cast as father and daughter. >!Seeing that relationship evolve over the episodes was a lovely arc that didn't feel forced in its growth.!< Johnny Knoxville has been a pleasant surprise, as well - I wasn't sure what to expect with him among this particular cast, but he really has held his own very nicely.

That said, there's a lot of the show that still feels uncertain and uneven. It feels like - at least from the first few episodes - they were really going for an absurd send-up of the sitcom reboot (hence the whole premise and the title), but as the episodes progressed, it became a different show that focused a lot more on character development and grounded at least somewhat more in reality.

Hopefully season 2 finds a more firm footing in what kind of show it intends to be and runs with it, because the show really does have a lot of potential."
Glitch,"Solid writing, solid jokes. Having a great cast also helps."
Glitch,It’s cute. I like seeing Paul Reiser in anything. It’s not amazing. But it’s fun.
Glitch,Rachel Bloom is great. I recommend Crazy Ex Girlfriend if you're a fan of this show.
Glitch,i hope it avoids the modern family trap and doesnt just become a treadmill of the same jokes and situations recycled over and over
Glitch,When I saw the title of this new show I first thought it was the 90s 3d animated kids show of the same name and got a little excited.
Glitch,""" what's the last thing you want to hear after blowing Willie Nelson? I'm not Willie Nelson.""

I'm still dying by that joke."
Glitch,"I really enjoyed this show, although the premise is meta but the series overall is more straight forward than I expected with some interest plot points that made it much more enjoyable."
Glitch,I despise Alex Trimboli too much to watch this.
Glitch,"I think it’s… fine? It feels like one of those shows that could be stronger and find it’s voice in a second season. It isn’t especially funny, and I can’t really tell if it is even trying to be. It seems to be running entirely off of the charm of its leads."
Glitch,"I basically felt like I was continuing a season three of an established and good sitcom, pleasantly surprised."
Glitch,Knoxville is compelling af
Glitch,i finished this last week and instantly started rewatching it with my partner. great show
Glitch,I love it. Clever and easy to watch. Because of this I’m nervous it’ll fall into the same good show bin with Life In Pieces.
Glitch,The only reboot I acknowledge has a sexy green anthropomorphized program in it.
Glitch,"I love this show, wasn’t expecting to tbh. Judy Greer sold me by episode 2."
Glitch,I watched this show in one sitting. I might have paused once or twice. Very good show imo and the best thing I’ve seen Paul Reiser in for a long time.
Glitch,I enjoyed it. It was an easy watch.
Glitch,"I love this show and am glad it’s fan base is growing. They better renew it for season 2. 

The cast is also incredible, and Knoxville blew my away with his performance."
Glitch,"Steve Leviten always has a kind of mid level, elevated sitcomminess to his stuff that is immediately safe and accessible but just edgy enough to make the average viewer moderately titillated. It’s why it wins so many awards while comedies every comedy writer raves about go unnoticed."
Glitch,"The episode with Reed playing a pickup basketball game was one of the best laughs I’ve had in a while.

It felt straight out of a Key and Peele skit."
Glitch,It was good and enjoyable! But it reminded me alot of Showtime's 'Episodes' which did the premise better in my opinion.
Glitch,"Binged this show last week, highly recommend"
Glitch,This is streaming on Disney+ in Canada.
Glitch,"yeah


I keep wanting to binge it, but I like it enough that I don't want to burn through all of it at once."
Glitch,"I watched all but the finale already. I generally like the show because the cast is really strong and the relationships between the characters feels genuine. I don't find it that funny though, at least not laugh out loud funny. And I think Rachel Bloom feels a bit wasted in the show but maybe Crazy-Ex Girlfriend just spoiled me."
Glitch,Hulu been killing it as always
Glitch,"Just binged it last night. Was decent. Like the concept, hope it picks up just a bit though"
Glitch,"I love the show,  amazing cast, and great writing."
Glitch,Please tell me there's another season soon.. this was great!
Glitch,Had my doubts but the show is legit funny
Glitch,Really enjoy it so far!
Glitch,Disappointed that they didn’t paint the actor playing Enzo green.
Glitch,I'm just happy that a show in 2022 used a Modern Baseball song in the credits
Glitch,This is the first show in a very long time that I make it a point to watch when a new episode premiers.
Glitch,"It's a surprisingly good show!  Hooked me from the very first episode and kept me engaged and entertained every single week.  Now, hope it doesn't get canceled by a returning exec with an axe to grind!  ;)"
Glitch,I've been really liking this show but I really wish they would have just released the whole series at once rather than weekly.
Glitch,"It’s actually pretty good. Keegan Michael Key makes everything better, so that helps"
Glitch,"I really like it but it’s kind of an A/B for me.

It’s A level when Judy or Keegan is on, B level when the arc is about one of the others.

Overall a fun enjoyable watch."
Glitch,Hollow show. The cast and premise look great but it doesn't deliver on its promise of being smart and funny. Character interactions and story lines never resolve in an interesting way and it's hard to imagine the reboot itself being any good based on scenes filmed and the writers room. It's a vehicle that could be as funny as Arrested Development but it's being driven in a very safe and boring way.
Glitch,I love this show!
Glitch,So good
Glitch,"I thought the first episode had a good tone to it but then the rest of the show felt like what they were mocking in that episode. 

Like the finale hit almost every cliche in the book."
Glitch,"It’s a nice show, nothing great.  I would like to see it renewed."
Glitch,Paul looks like he is on cigarette 12 by noon.
Glitch,"I enjoyed it. 

I never knew Judy Greer had such a fatty back there. WOMPS!!! WOMPS!!!"
Glitch,All of those words make not want to watch it.
Glitch,[deleted]
Glitch,[deleted]
Glitch,This show was deeply unfunny. Watched two eps. Not a single gag I hadn’t seen done better in something else before. Just a lazy show. Shocked anyone found it funny.
Glitch,I would love for Sirens to have a season 3
Glitch,I was so stoned when I watched this and I didn't like it.
Glitch,"I get really tired about Hollywood insider baseball movies and TV shows, but this one is very funny and does a good job of investing you in the characters and caring about stuff beyond their careers and whatnot."
Glitch,This show only took three episodes to crawl up its own ass.
Glitch,There's only one Reboot.
Glitch,"As long as Hulu is still pulling their “no commercials” but totally have commercials scam, i refuse to use that streaming service."
Glitch,"But does he come from the net? 
Through systems , people and cites. 
To this place. MAINFRAME."
Glitch,"excellent drama/comedy, one of the few."
Glitch,Well if the article is going to talk about it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sQEb9TSACY
Glitch,"If it doesn't involve anthropomorphized computer programs, I'm not interested."
Glitch,Knoxville has been the only reason I’ve watched more than one episode.
Glitch,"Oh, not the reboot I was hoping for"
Glitch,"This show gets so much love that I can’t give it.

For me, it is merely ok."
Glitch,"It’s a trite complaint, but I hate the camera work? That shakey handycam that focuses and unfocuses and constantly bobs around really distracts me."
Glitch,"Just finished the way to short season.
Probably the best new sitcom of the last couple of years."
Glitch,"I just started this last night. I think I got three episodes in, and it feels like an Episodes rip-off to me. So far none of the jokes are really hitting either. I do love the cast though. I think I went into it expecting to be hooked immediately, and that didn't happen, which is fine. I'll pick up and episode here and there. A comedy is rarely at its best in season one."
Glitch,Knoxville really was a surprise - he’s funny when necessary but really developed his character as well.
Glitch,I really love Johnny Knoxville in it and that's not a statement I ever thought I'd make.
Glitch,It’s very good. I hope we get a second season.
Glitch,"Fuckin love Knoxville, honestly it’s a surprise to me he can even function enough to turn in a quality acting performance after all the damage he’s taken specifically the brutal head injuries"
Glitch,"Really loved the first season. Super refreshing, very smart, great cast. 

The last episode fell into some stupid tropes I was not a fan of, but overall, it was well worth the watch."
Glitch,"> Also: Johnny Knoxville knocks it out of the park. I was...shocked.

Agree, they wrote his character so he gets just the right amount of just playing himself to feel comfortable in the role. They even gave him a very meta nut joke in one episode."
Glitch,"I think the kid is HILARIOUS. He pulls up in that sports car the first time and you think he’s going to be an entitled jerk, but he’s the most wholesome member of the cast. And his teen movie titles/running gag is fantastic."
Glitch,"> breaking fourth wall. I think that should take a rest for a while, with Abott Elementary being the last one to get away with it.

This is neither here nor there, but is it really breaking the fourth wall when a character looks into the camera in a mockumentary? I thought it wasn't because that camera really is present with the character in-universe, so acknowledging the camera isn't breaking any of the rules of the universe."
Glitch,"yeah the mockumentary thing was the thing that largely stopped me from being a Modern Family fan. Even though it sorta made sense within the show it felt like such an obvious gimmick and really exposed that show's flaws. 

I think Reboot sometimes veers a little too far into self-parody with the sitcommy tropes but the writing and performances are so good that it makes up for it. Not to mention the fact that it's supposed to be kinda meta."
Glitch,"She is fantastic. Was also surprised by Johnny Knoxville. I've never been very impressed by him as an actor but he's doing pretty good in this. Not as good as Greer or KMK, but he's at least doing well enough that he isn't distracting. Great cast overall."
Glitch,YOU'RE NOT MY SUPERVISOR!
Glitch,"“Still fat to me, still fat to you, Fatty McGoo!”"
Glitch,"I feel like her missing from most of this season of Archer had to be due to filming this, and while I'm sad at a lack of Cheryl I loved her in this"
Glitch,Loved her first scene
Glitch,I was also glad to see her boobs. It gave me closure from arrested development.
Glitch,Booooooooobs.
Glitch,too bad about her weird plastic surgery face tho
Glitch,"I love this whole cast, but she is by far my favorite."
Glitch,"Me too, I love Judy. But you know what I find crazy odd though? On Hulu when you open the show, she isn't listed in the cast highlights but the random junior executive is (Krista Marie Yu). I was so surprised I looked them up on IMDB and Krista is credited with being in all 8 episodes despite... not being in all episodes?

Edit: just double checked. In addition to Krista, the fact that Johnny Knoxville \*and\* Calum Worthy are in the list but not Judy Greer is criminal."
Glitch,SAY GOODBYE TO THESE!
Glitch,"I’m only three episodes in, but I feel that the footing is pretty clear: this is a wholesome family sitcom about a wholesome family making a sitcom. They can do all manner of hijinks and one liners and then give you that “aww” factor of mending a father-daughter relationship or of making real friends. 

Im curious to see if this is all going to be long running arcs throughout the season or if we’ll end up in the once beloved space of weekly one-off episodes."
Glitch,Reminds me of The Orville. They started with a lot of the typical Seth McFarlane humor the first season. As it went along they toned down he humor and really did great in the characters.
Glitch,"The cast is great. I expect good things from most of them, but my opinion of Johnny Knoxville's acting has gone up quite a bit. And whoever the kid is that's playing Zack has really come up with a great speaking pattern and delivery for his character. 

Really enjoyed the first season."
Haters Back Off,I guess the haters didn’t back off after all.
Haters Back Off,I will forever be confused why this was on Netflix at all and not Youtube Red.
Haters Back Off,One of those wtf pickups by Netflix I'll never understand.
Haters Back Off,I don’t think this surprises anyone. Head honcho at Netflix already said they weren’t canceling enough shows
Haters Back Off,I was offended enough by the thumbnail in Netflix to be happy reading this headline.
Haters Back Off,I got through about 10 minutes of the first episode before I couldn’t stand another fucking second.
Haters Back Off,I'm honestly surprised they even picked it up for a first season
Haters Back Off,Haters win again
Haters Back Off,I almost gave it a chance just because Stevie from Eastbound and Down played her dad but after a few minutes I just couldn't. 
Haters Back Off,TIL they've started making television shows about YouTube personalities. It makes me feel old. 
Haters Back Off,"the new entertainment age: you discover a new show exists only when the cancellation is announced.

"
Haters Back Off,My friend worked on the show and apparently the lead was difficult to work with IRL and was also not nice to fans
Haters Back Off,"I gave it a chance and it really wasn't bad at all. Not fantastic, but not bad. 


The show kept her annoying character but transformed the theme into the events surrounding a dysfunctional family. It's cringey and awkward but in a good way. Maybe it didn't deserve a 3rd season but it really wasn't awful. "
Haters Back Off,"It’s supposed to be awkward and terrible...and it was, in the best way"
Haters Back Off,"Good. Took them long enough. My mother likes the show and when I told her that I thought it was a bad show because the main character I'd an unlikable, unfunny prick she started comparing it to Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia because the characters in that are assholes too. I think she forgot that the gang were assholes but they were funny, whereas Miranda was an asshole and not funny."
Haters Back Off,"Lots of hate and ridicule in this thread, but I genuinely liked the show and am disappointed to see it pulled.  It had a really talented cast that delivered very surreal, dark comedic performances.  When I began watching the show I was totally unfamiliar with the YouTube videos so I didn't go in with any pre-conceived notions.  What I liked about the show was how dark and dysfunctional it was--it really reminds me of a Bobcat Goldwaith or John Waters movie in many ways.  Comedies of that variety have a very niche audience so it doesn't surprise me that it failed to draw a lot of viewers.  I believe Ms. Ballinger and her brother created the show and I hope they don't let this setback dissuade them from pursuing other projects with a similar sensibility."
Haters Back Off,Fuck. I’m probably the 1% of people who loved this show. 
Haters Back Off,I liked the chick who played the sister. Hopefully she gets some work after this. 
Haters Back Off,"The main actress is an amazing character actress...with one character. There's a Jimmy Fallon interview where he asks her to get into character, moments later she is 180 into Miranda and flawless. 

The biggest problem is, though, this girl has developed a character so brilliantly cringeworthy and dislikable that even the viewers cannot stand her. For that, Id say she completely achieved her goal. "
Haters Back Off,"I actually didn't hate this show. In fact, I think I enjoyed it a little. 

The character was indeed annoying, as intended. You dislike her pretty much all the way through the show but there are weird moments that the show actually gets you to develop a little empathy for her.

The Uncle, pretty much plays the same character as he did in Eastbound and Down to such a convincing level that he reminds me of how well Danny DeVito plays Frank in Always Sunny in Philadelphia. I also really enjoyed the mother character.

But... the Miranda Sings character is basically someone with an intellectual disability. She has trouble with basic spelling, can't comprehend situations, incapable of taking care of herself, having the mindset of a young child, etc. Other people have already compared her to Napoleon Dynamite, which makes sense. However, just like that character, there really is no room for growth. The character could never actually ""be"" adorned to the levels envisioned by the character because it would be like watching Napoleon Dynamite become a doctor. 

At some point you realize that when you thought you were laughing ""with"" a character with an intellectual disability you start to realize that you were actually laughing at them the entire time. A part of me thinks that's why Netflix was pretty quick to drop this show. 

Edit: I really think the character was based off of youtuber Nicole337."
Haters Back Off,"Awwww. I am bummed out about this. I really enjoyed this show. I suppose this confirms my sense of humor is indeed, very dark. "
Haters Back Off,"I absolutely loved this show.  I only discovered it after Season 2, but I immediately knew it wouldn't be widely accepted.  

It's so cringeworthy, you really have to enjoy that awkwardness, to get anything out of it.  I can see this being a cult classic in a few years and wish the best for Colleen. "
Haters Back Off,I guess no-one else though it was hilarious when she filled the bathtub with skettibites when her family moved out. I thought this show was great. Sometimes a little slow but I love cringefests like this show
Haters Back Off,Liked it in spots. I think the younger artist sister played a great role. 
Haters Back Off,"I am definitely not the demographic of this show, but for some reason I like what I have seen of it so far. "
Haters Back Off,This was my favorite Netflix show 😢
Haters Back Off,I really liked this show :(
Haters Back Off,Fuck. I liked it.... 
Haters Back Off,"Yeah, first heard of her during Comedians in Car Getting in Coffee and figured out the schtick pretty quickly especially with her defenders in the comment section talking about her bad singing. But Angela Kinsey modeling that carpal tunnel glove in the pilot was kind of funny. I do think there could have been some Pee-Wee Herman type potential for the character if it wasn't so quickly monetized."
Haters Back Off,Did they promote this at all? I watch Netflix a lot and I never saw it in new releases.
Haters Back Off,"i mean, it might have something to do with the fact that no one's ever heard of it. I spend a ton of time on netflix and not once have i seen this show mentioned in the UI. "
Haters Back Off,"I love that show, I'm still planning to watch the rest of season 2."
Haters Back Off,"I have a friend who loves this show and he's tried to get me to watch it but I just can't deal with it, it makes me cringe way too much. It's like Napoleon Dynamite cranked up to 11 (and I don't like ND)."
Haters Back Off,S2 was better than the first and I was looking forward to a S3. That sucks.
Haters Back Off,"I actually loved this show, I didn't know so many people disliked it. It's awesome to me!"
Haters Back Off,"I think her character is funny in short segments, which is what YouTube is good for. 30 minutes of it is way too long. and as weird as it is, I can't really stand her anymore after her divorce. "
Haters Back Off,"ngl, I watched this show and couldn't look away"
Haters Back Off,"The first seaon had its moments and I liked the ending, but the second season was just depressing and I only got through two episodes. It's hard to enjoy watching an obviously unwell person humiliate themselves over and over. They needed a heightened reality where her character wasn't such an outlier."
Haters Back Off,"For Netflix to cancel a show, it must be terrible"
Haters Back Off,That show was awesome and you haters suck
Haters Back Off,But will she live in the Attic forever? We will never know...
Haters Back Off,angela kinsey was probably the best part of the show
Haters Back Off,"I know this will be unpopular but I kind of liked this show. It was silly but so are most shows. Her character is over the top selfish and is not a bad representation of what clueless old people think millennials are like. Francesca Reale is good in it and I wish she had more to do. Steve Little did the Steve Little thing and that is always at very least interesting if not genuinely funny. I was somewhat invested in Angela Kinsey's character, she was for sure my favorite. It took a couple of episodes to get its footing but once it stabilized it was fine. 

And it is also fine that it only got two seasons. I think this is how it is supposed to work, you give someone a shot that seems like there is something there and either it works or it doesn't. It is what it is.

I will admit I had no idea about the YouTube aspect of where this came from, so that may be a factor in why I am not as much of a hater. Most of the negative posts in this thread seem to have to mention it, but whatever, I don't think this is anything other than what it is. All shows eventually end and this one just had its run.



"
Haters Back Off,"It was actually a fun show, although I never did watch season 2. I’m not surprised people haven’t even seen it or decided not to watch it because of her awful face in the thumbnail, but if you look the main girl up she’s pretty damn pretty when she’s not intentionally trying to make herself look terrible. "
Haters Back Off,"I like the character. The show is interesting. Strange but interesting. 

At least she got two seasons out of this show. There are many Netflix shows at this point that have only lasted two seasons but far fewer that have been cancelled after only one. At least this shows not part of that group."
Haters Back Off,"sorry for the people who lost their jobs, but holy moly that was some of the worst TV that i ever gave 10 minutes trying out.

i guess it was loud, formless, unintelligent sarcasm, intended for tweens? or something?"
Haters Back Off,"Oh no - back to clickbait thumbnails and dumping people then. Don’t tell anyone or her sister, who’s male, will smash your face in. "
Haters Back Off,I really like the show. Sad we won't know how it ends
Haters Back Off,"Ill say this much about the show, At least it wasn't as obnoxious as any of the Fred, Smosh or Shane Dawson movies/shows, but it was still pretty bad. I got Napoleon Dynamite vibes from it. "
Haters Back Off,"In the YouTube videos, the character was silly, tragic, and funny.

Somehow, in the show, she became a bitch who made dick jokes.

It could have been great, but the character changed for the worst."
Haters Back Off,I tried to watch it but it wasn't that good.
Haters Back Off,My niece loved this show and my wife cringed so hard it nearly broke her back. Therefore it’s got an odd sentiment to it that might be worthy of a cult following like strangers with Candy.
Haters Back Off,This makes sense
Haters Back Off,"Lead is mentally ill/autistic? Parents are psychotic, delusional? I just didnt get it - didnt seem like a well executed joke to me. But i am an old, so..."
Haters Back Off,"Man, everyone is hating on this show but it wasn't that bad. 

I can understand why people didn't like it though because the main character is a fucking annoying bitch. "
Haters Back Off,Pretty sure she divorced her husband right before doing this show.
Haters Back Off,NOOOOO This show was actually really fantastic :(
Haters Back Off,honestly i've never seen a tv show/movie with youtube stars that was actually good
Haters Back Off,I know it’s just a character but it’s so cringey that I couldn’t make it 10 minutes in. 
Haters Back Off,This show was so bad that I had to keep watching
Haters Back Off,Haters free to approach 
Haters Back Off,I'm seeing a lot of negative feedback about this show but I'm calling this now that this will be a cult classic that ended too early. 
Haters Back Off,"I saw this show in the list of Netflix shows, but it never really interested me. I was slightly intrigued by the inclusion of Steve Little aka Stevie from Eastbound and Down, but not enough to check the show out. I guess the fact that the show was cancelled shows that other people felt the same way. "
Haters Back Off,"She’s actually a really funny comedian, but the schtick with that character is nauseating after three minutes and only funny to little children on YouTube.  

I saw her do a comedians and coffee thing with Seinfeld and she was very funny.  Great timing.  Though her actual channel isn’t for me.  

I couldn’t find a link, but here she is with Seinfeld.  He makes a good straight man to her silliness:

https://youtu.be/lxGzTehTSPw

I suppose she’s sort of a modern day Peewee Herman.  "
Haters Back Off,"TIL she was a Youtube thing. I watched the first season, gave it a shot, couldn't get into it."
Haters Back Off,It was actually pretty entertaining 
Haters Back Off,"It had its funny moments. I think the actress has some real talent, but I think there's only so much you can do with that one-note character."
Haters Back Off,That’s too bad.  The characters reminded me of Napoleon Dynamite and their idiocy grew on me. :(
Haters Back Off,"I thought the show was funny, the uncle voices peppermint butler."
Haters Back Off,"The reason this show didn’t take off is because the character is great for a sketch, not a whole storyline. "
Haters Back Off,I hated this show. There was something about the whole thing that didn’t sit right with me. 
Haters Back Off,Prayers = answered 
Haters Back Off,Does that mean the Miranda Sings character is gone? Please say it's gone
Haters Back Off,"This show definitely hurt their brand, they should be more careful about what they pick up.

I remember first seeing this as a Netflix Original, it made me seriously doubt the quality of Netflix Originals. "
Haters Back Off,I liked that show. It was so grotesque.
Haters Back Off,I see a lot of people saying they couldnt make it psst the first 2 episodes. But the show in its entirety was actually excellent. Y'all judged a book by it's cover and destroyed something beautiful. Congrats.
Haters Back Off,That girl is so annoying.
Haters Back Off,i couldnt stop cringing 
Haters Back Off,"Thank goodness, one of the worst shows I've stumbled across "
Haters Back Off,The uncle relationship was creepy as fuck
Haters Back Off,"Simply canceling this shit show is not enough, they need to take it out of their catalog. It should not have been put under the kids section."
Haters Back Off,Good. Possibly an unpopular opinion....but.....Miranda is nails on a chalkboard for my soul.
Haters Back Off,Fucking terrible show
Haters Back Off,It was a terrible show. Good riddance.
Haters Back Off,I cancelled it halfway through the first episode. 
Haters Back Off,how the hell did it even get two seasons?
Haters Back Off,There was a 2nd season?
Haters Back Off,"I've never heard of any of this.

What's a Netflix?"
Haters Back Off,"I never understood what people saw in her, she’s unfunny and doesn’t make any sense. Whenever someone plays her videos while I’m in the room I immediately walk out"
Haters Back Off,I seriously have no idea who this person is. Everyone here says she was a YouTube star or something? Not into the whole YouTube scene and following people on there so I wouldn't have a clue. A while back I watched probably 10 minutes of the first episode and it was horrendous. It was one of the worst things I've seen on Netflix. I was pissed that they put out garbage like that and I'm paying for it. 
Haters Back Off,Good. 
Haters Back Off,The trailer looked way to weird on netflix for me to watch it. It just kinda looks too cringeworthy though I couldnt even take napoleon dynamite for the same reason.
Haters Back Off,"I never watched the show so I can’t speak to the quality of it, but the thumbnail of the show is so obnoxious and annoying."
Haters Back Off,Yeah I watched about 15 minutes of the first episode. I hated it so I backed off.
Haters Back Off,"Thank god, this had to be the worst bit of television ever created. Cringey as hell"
Haters Back Off,I watched the first episode. That was enough.
Haters Back Off,"annoying no talent hack you tube ""star"" tv show doesn't work out, shocking."
Haters Back Off,"I dont care what any of you think. This show was fucking gold. I had never heard of Miranda Sings before starting it, but if you watch this from beginning to end you might realize it was secretly one of the best shows on netflix. There were hilarious moments and emotional moments. This show getting cancelled because people judged it without watching it is a shame. A real shame."
Haters Back Off,I can’t stand her.
Haters Back Off,Good. This show wasn't funny.
MeatEater,"I watched many of the earlier episodes back when it was airing, and was shocked at how extreme it starts out when I booted up season 1 on Hulu >_>

If you look up controversies there are some really serious ones from this show. People killing their family members and themselves after being on the show, for example.

And almost every aspect, even the time of day, is faked and manipulated. It's crazy."
MeatEater,"I remember when this on ABC and it was part of the prime time block that included LOST, Alias, & this show.

Greatest viewing night ever."
MeatEater,"Did you talk about astrology? did she hypnotize you?! GET OUT OF MY HOUSE IN JESUS' NAME I PREY!!!


Edit: I heard the mom is tight with the gays now."
MeatEater,"Yes, that was the whole point of the show. It would have been a really boring and pointless show otherwise.

Also no one was in danger, most of reality TV is staged in a controlled environment."
MeatEater,"It's reality TV. By which we mean ""it's complete fiction"".

The people you see are *performers*. They are working together to create interesting conflicts to keep viewers entertained. It's not like they're plucking random people off the street and just tossing them into the situation with no thought behind it."
MeatEater,Because of Wife Swap we got Leonard Washington.
MeatEater,[deleted]
MeatEater,Society was different in 2004.
MeatEater,what was the episode where the girl got a gift everyday i wanted to watch that episode but i forgot the family name
MeatEater,"...you understand that's like, the whole idea of reality TV?"
MeatEater,"So irresponsible. Similiar situation with the poly couple and the republican conservatives, the dad purposely kept reading scriptures against gay people in the front of the mom and the conservative mom tried to kick the girlfriend out of the house and kept spouting awful conspiracy theories. There's the one fatphobic mom and the poor family, basically the whole episode shaming the family for being poor and what they looked like. I hopped on the Wifeswap bandwagon, I'm only 2 episodes in (watching random episodes) and it's truly so sad. And so are most of these comments. It's not even entertaining, it's just shows me how awful people are."
MeatEater,I just finished watching the second episode you mention (lesbian couple w conservatives) and had to Google it because I was shocked at the end. Like what the fuck is wrong with that Kris G lady
MeatEater,"Oh yea I couldn’t finish the lesbian couple episode, it made me so gd mad. When the wife that stayed said something like “in the 60’s people used to think interracial dating was unnatural and against god” I screamed at the tv “TELL HER THAT, NOT THE CAMERA PEOPLE!!” Cause as a WOC who’s also queer it’s definitely the thing homophobic black people seem to forget. If you wanna act that way towards the lgbt+ community you’re the same type of person who was losing their shit over POC getting the same rights as white people

I came here cause I’m rewatching it too & tbh none of it makes any gd sense. I read that a LOT of it was fake (like the “manuals” which makes sense cause often it sounds like they’re insulting themselves & their own families), but I think it’s finally clicking how fake it must be.

Almost every gd family switch is one family always watches tv vs one that doesn’t have any, & ofc they make them switch who does & doesn’t have access to tv. But that made me think: if they’ve NEVER watched tv as they claimed, how tf did they know about Wife Swap to apply in the first place?!?

Edit fixed word"
MeatEater,You know it's fake right?
MeatEater,"Stop watching shitty TV and focus your energy on literally anything else. There, I just solved the 17 year old problem for you."
MeatEater,Ugh more of you people
MeatEater,"The ""King James Bible"" lady had to be the worst mismatch I'd seen. She's like 500 lbs talking about how the host family needs Jesus, and she screams constantly in the exact opposite manner that Jesus was recorded as having taught his beliefs.....

The only upside I recall from it was that when it came time for her to dole out the cash gift she gave a considerable amount to the kids to use."
MeatEater,"I know it’s messed up but at the same time these people know what they are getting into when they join the show so you can’t really get mad, but I get what you’re saying."
MeatEater,"My fiance is rewatching it and I've watched some episodes (missed the racist family, she offered to put it on for me as she was telling me how fucked up it was they'd do something like that but I declined), shit, some of these people I don't understand how they are even married.  


The couple in the RV who were all sharing a room, I'm pretty sure no matter how much that was edited there's no way for that family to be normal."
MeatEater,"As someone who is half black I find the Vegan families switched with the Hunters just as bad as the racists, 

Veganism is not a diet unless you go by the original word of diet which means Lifestyle. Being Plant Based is more of a diet because it doesn't come with the moral,where Veganism is about not exploiting animal cruelty."
MeatEater,i hate the racist mom tbh :/
MeatEater,I think the killing family members or themselves were inevitable tbh. Like had they not been on the show we wouldn’t have see that the upbringing probably led to it
MeatEater,"Exactly lots of the families have come out and said they filmed things repeatedly and were fed responses and told to ham it up.  I don’t think people were ever unsafe considering there were  many crew/ camera operators and producers there.    It sucks when you find out how much reality tv is produced, scripted and edited to come across a certain way.  They would take an average of 100 hours of film at both families.  So 200 hours compiled into 40 min."
MeatEater,IM A GOD WARRIOR
MeatEater,THIS PLACE IS DORKSIDED
MeatEater,"OP is also forgetting that these people were with an army of camera men, producers, security, assistants, make-up artists, and other things required for filming at all times. 

Nobody was ever in any real danger."
MeatEater,I disagree. Some of these kids needed to be removed by CPS
MeatEater,I wouldn’t say they are performers but they definitely select specific people for the best tv scenarios
MeatEater,"To my knowledge they didn’t know the family they were swapping with, so not fully"
MeatEater,"I feel like putting a black woman in a racist home for entertainment should’ve raised some flags, even yonder back in 2004"
MeatEater,"Years later, both parents went to fed prison and the daughter became a hooker."
MeatEater,Damn I just watched that one
MeatEater,Season 4 episode 1
MeatEater,[removed]
MeatEater,"I’m watching the pageant family & as soon as they said “she cares about her appearance” but then said they eat junk food I thought….well clearly not😂nothing against how they look, but doesn’t seem to match their words. The other fams who said that worked out for 6 hours a day & definitely didn’t have fast food for dinner every night 😂"
MeatEater,"Not necessarily, if they don’t know where they’re going like they claim then they literally DONT know what they signed up for, & they are stuck in a contract now & can’t just quit with no repercussions.
“Courtenay appeared in an early episode in which she swapped lives with a family who lived on a tugboat with no electricity, no running water, and, much to her dismay, no clean towels with which she could dry her face. After a rough start on the show, Courtenay desperately wanted out, but, because of her contract and her experience in TV, she knew that she would be liable for production costs if she pulled out halfway through. “

(https://www.thelist.com/255705/the-untold-truth-of-wife-swap/)"
MeatEater,She was trying to get food from sun lol. Her husband worked 15 hrs a day and also did the chores whereas she went to yoga classes. The vegan woman was awful
MeatEater,"That's quite possible, too!"
MeatEater,Gargoyles!
MeatEater,A camera ain't stopping no gun
MeatEater,Does the crew stay with them overnight? Cause some of the places seem too small for that (and I think union rules they need a proper accommodation)
MeatEater,"Apparently producers asked/edited families to fit a mold they wanted, even if it’s not exactly who they are. They want them to up the stakes basically so they really are performing, even if they’re a “real” family"
MeatEater,Always a choice
MeatEater,"It was racist, but the demographic for that show found racism to be a type of comedy."
MeatEater,[removed]
MeatEater,Wait. What the hell? I need all of the info on this.
MeatEater,"Those types always have the same physical look.

There was this Vice doc about American ""militias"" training in their own little communities.  The leader of one militia is this out of shape dude in his mid-40s whose asking his son about how slow he ran a mile while he himself is smoking a Marlboro Red and drinking a cheap beer...."
MeatEater,I just read an old AMA with someone from the show who said the crew left between around 2 am and 7 am.
MeatEater,A choice they weren’t fully informed of. Irresponsible producers
MeatEater,"Hold on I'll get it for you /u/ktq2019

MeatEater,"I was truly surprised because I’ve been binging (thanks Hulu) cause I used to remember loving this show as a kid, and like I said they had other families that ACTUALLY work hard 24/7 to look good, not just throw on makeup before going to McDonalds 😂"
MeatEater,"Sounds about right, especially for the families who sleep in longer so there’s nothing to really film"
MeatEater,"I think what the person is saying is, they could've ended the ""experiment"" at any time.  If she walked in that house and saw the stuff and chose to leave, she could have.  She had a choice about doing the show.  

I also don't know that its ""Irresponsible"".  If I tell you  ""I'm going to put you in a likely uncomfortable situation for a week"", and you agree to it, I mean, you agreed.  No one was forced to go through with it when they got there."
MeatEater,"Actually I just read about a woman who was sent to her destination and then told to stay put in a hotel room.  Then they staged things by sending a gay man in her place, telling her husband he had to pretend to be part of a gay marriage.  He refused and they wouldn't disclose where his wife was and said she wouldn't be compensated if he didn't go along with it.  In the end he did.

Kind of fucked up, imo."
MeatEater,"They have contracts they need to complete, so it isn’t as easy as “no I’m done” & the thousands of $ they spent on filming & setting it all up comes to a halt"
MeatEater,"Again, they can leave anytime they choose to.  Now, it is possible there would be a financial penalty for doing so, but they still can't force them to stay."
MeatEater,"“Financial penalty” if they literally can’t afford it they risk going into serious debt (if not being sued & that costs even more). Filming is EXPENSIVE, like more expensive then they’re even getting paid to be filmed in the first place

Edit to add: and it’s not “possible”, it’s within their contracts that they’re liable to pay filming costs if they pull out."
MeatEater,[This article does a good job at explaining the struggles Gandolfini went through while playing Tony](https://www.gq.com/story/sopranos-james-gandolfini-david-chase-july-2013)
MeatEater,"Read the article guys, they fell out towards the end (probably because volatile personalities working together for 8 years would be bound to do that) and then five years later James is the lead in Not Fade Away, directed by Chase. He’s not saying ‘fuck Tony Soprano!’"
MeatEater,Alls I know is…he can’t come to the social club no more.
MeatEater,"They didn’t exactly reconcile and become friends again but it sounds like Gandolfini extended as much of an olive branch to David Chase as his ego would allow him to by asking how his movie was going after the show ended then saying he’ll be in it

Not sure why guys are replying like David Chase is the asshole, Gandolfini was notoriously difficult in the Christian Bale sense, it’s well documented he would have violent outbursts on set, would sometimes just not show up to set and was abusing drugs and alcohol, not sure why people have this angelic good guy image of a complicated troubled actor but David Chase wasn’t the bad guy in that scenario"
MeatEater,"I really hate articles that excerpt gossipy bits from longer podcast interviews for the sake of clickbait. Always makes the situation sound more serious than it is. People seem to miss the larger context of the situation in favor of getting mad.

All this really sounds like is Chase and Gandolfini were just sick of each other. They're both a couple of strong personalities, so it's not surprising they needed some space after an intense experience like The Sopranos.  They also worked together again on Not Fade Away, so clearly they got over it."
MeatEater,"As much as their egos might have clashed at the end of production as much do I still believe that this is the greatest show ever made. James Gandolfini was menacing, ruthless, loveable, funny, an absolute asshole and a loving father and sometimes husband at the same time. He was the very definition of a realistic depiction of a crime boss to me and I will always be able to rewatch this wonderful series.

It's all I ask for when I speak about quality in entertainment."
MeatEater,"I think some of the greatest creative partnerships are just inherently volatile. Wong Kar Wai and his long cinematographer Christopher Doyle got sick of each other. feels like Gandolfini and Chase really brought the best out of each other, personal relationships aside."
MeatEater,Was the article written by an 8 year old?? The grammar makes it borderline unreadable. These clickbait websites don’t even try. 😂
MeatEater,"- Adding that Gandolfini called him “Satan” and the writers “vampires” while on set because writers would take certain incidents from real life, not from his mind you, for the show.

I cannot understand what the author is trying to say."
MeatEater,"Dont really understand why people take random incidents out of context and assume that he was a gigantic asshole and a huge piece of shit because of it. Ive been watching the show and doing a lot of thinking about Gandolfini and from what Ive watched/read pretty much everyone who spent time with him said he was one of the nicest and open people they’ve met/worked with. But he also seems like he was a tortured soul and had lots of personal demons. It could not have been easy to play a character as vile and miserable as Tony especially later on in the show, and lots of people who worked with him have implied or straight up said that he really struggled with that. Yes he supposedly went on coke benders and was hard to work with at times but I get the sense that even so most of these people still respect him and like him way too much to air out his dirty laundry like that especially after he’s been dead for 8 years. 

Combine that with the fact that David Chase is also kind of an ass and has a strong personality I can understand how they would start to butt heads after almost a decade straight of working together. But they were both brilliant at their jobs and I think they were a perfect match for each other as they made the best tv shown of all time and one of the best characters/performances of all time. 

People are complex and I really hate this redditor reactionary type stuff where people base their entire judgement and opinions on someone’s character based off internet headlines"
MeatEater,"Gandolf developed a huge coke problem by the end of the show, it made him hard to work with as coke addictions often do.  The use of which is probably what ultimately killed him.  He cleaned up some after the show was over, but not entirely."
MeatEater,"Was managing a blockbuster in nashville as Gandolfini filmed last castle, he had been rented a house in town and was renting movies most in nights, was shorter in person than the impression  on tv, like a lot…. We chatted on a bunch of occasions during that time, signed a Happy Birthday vhs set for my mom, was very personable and conversational …. Just my nice memory."
MeatEater,"I’m sure it’s more complicated than that, but all the interviews I saw with Chase, he came off pretty full of himself"
MeatEater,Still can’t believe that one guy is the guitarist from the e street band
MeatEater,I believe this was touched on in the excellent book Difficult Men
MeatEater,He worked what...2 days on NOT FADE AWAY?
MeatEater,This can happen when you are in one job for so long
MeatEater,">they fell out towards the end (probably because volatile personalities working together for 8 years would be bound to do that) 

OK, that is totally understandable, but WHY? No one thought to ask? This wasn't a real interview article, so I assume this was a pool interview?"
MeatEater,"When editing makes a difference. I read this a million times before I understood it: “Adding that Gandolfini called him “Satan” and the writers “vampires” while on set because writers would take certain incidents from real life, not from his mind you, for the show.”"
MeatEater,"I don’t understand bringing this up now. Gandolfini’s been dead for eight years, so whatever grievances Chase may have had with him seem meaningless now. I’m not saying people should be lionised when they die, but why publicly complain that someone wasn’t your friend when he’s not even here to defend himself? It’s not like Chase is accusing him of any untoward behaviour, he’s just venting that Jim wasn’t his buddy.

Seems pretty entitled if you ask me, especially since Chase had a reputation of not being friendly with the writers. He reportedly often told the writers that he wasn’t their friend, he was their boss. And he wasn’t wrong. So what was his beef with Gandolfini?"
MeatEater,I can’t read the article due to the persistent presence of an Amazon ad.
MeatEater,"> “Whadya gonna do?”  

T."
MeatEater,What am I supposed to do with this information?
MeatEater,"Chase should have asked Gandolfini how to make a Sopranos Movie, before they stopped talking… because apparently he doesn’t know."
MeatEater,"“We were barely talking,” Chase said about their relationship around the time the show was ending. “At the last party or screening or Emmys, it was the last time we’d all be together, and we’re sitting at a table, \[James Gandolfini\] went by with his food and my wife said ‘Hey! Jim, come sit over here,’ and he just ignored her and sat someplace else. He started that kind of stuff, for my wife I was infuriated. I suddenly said to myself, ‘I really hate that motherfucker, I hate that guy.’ That’s what it had come to.”

Sounds like this was a job to Gandolfini, and Chase wanted it to be more for him. I mean, granted that's rude, just sit with your cast and crew for the last time. It won't kill ya, but this sounded like just a gig for him."
MeatEater,Probably blasphemous to some but Gandolfini struck me as someone who could be a bit of a nightmare to work with.
MeatEater,"Probably because he read all the shitty scripts for the last season. I mean, there’s literally an episode where Tony runs errands. I know it’s held up as an incredible series( which it is) but man that last season was not good, not to mention the ending."
MeatEater,David Chase is a dick. You don't dunk on a dead guy while you're trying to cash in on his legacy.
MeatEater,I watched the new one. It’s….not good. Like really not good. Surprisingly shocked because Sopranos was some of the best tv ever. 🤷‍♂️
MeatEater,"I'm not excusing his behaviour, but...I'm sure he sensed that he was in n something big, very soon after it aired. To this day, people are still talking about The Godfather, The Wire, Tombstone...now compare that to Game of Thrones. Halfway through it's run, it was a verified social phenomenon, and unstoppable juggernaut. And then...the last few seasons so thoroughly disappointed fans, that few fans have watched it twice. 

The Godfather is almost 50 years old, and youtube still has videos breaking it down and saying ""this is how storytelling is done"". Midway through The Sopranos, Gandolfini must have sensed that the shows phenomenal success could become a lasting legacy, with long-term respect, along with the financial rewards that come with that.

It would have been nice if he could have provided the same performance, and then be a regular Tom Hanks between takes, or a Keanu Reeves. The sudden huge success of the Sopranos was a contributing factor in Gandolfini's 2002 divorce (show originally ran 1999  until 2007), though many have verified his struggles with alcohol and drugs.

Maybe the guy could have used some therapy?..."
MeatEater,he definitely wouldn’t have done that dog shit movie. it was one of the worst things I’ve ever seen. yes i know there was no role for him
MeatEater,[deleted]
MeatEater,I hope he is like his character in the sopranos

Mossad 101,"The Fall - from the UK, specifically set in Belfast, Ireland.

Stars Gillian Anderson and Jamie Dornan. Serial killer (Dornan) goes about leading 2 lives as a doting father but at night he murders several women. Anderson is assigned to help the case (she's from the London PD) and help catch him through profiling. A bit slow and includes a lot of talking, less action. 

Highlights include Anderson's cruel character in a man-driven world who really shows what women are capable of. Anderson herself is brilliant! She literally has 3 men weak and fawning over her by the middle of S1."

You can watch most of the episodes on the show's official Youtube channel. If you guys are in a mood for fun and catchy music or something that won't leave your head. This show should do the trick.
Mossad 101,"Terrace House on Netflix is the best reality show ever. 

Super subdued without all the fake drama you usually get. A great look into a foreign culture. The actual drama, usually caused over super small things, and the way relationships progress in such a reserved society really make for interesting TV.

Medici's, The Great British Bake Off (the only reality TV show I've ever enjoyed), Victoria, Poldark, Grantchester (charming with good whodunnits).  Wentworth (great prison drama, far better than OITNB), Versailles."
Mossad 101,"I'm only watching korean dramas at the moment. I highly recommend the new show Goblin - it's hilarious yet surprisingly not as ridiculous as sometimes is expected from the genre. Hwarang which just started is also promising, but it's basically a high school drama in a historical setting.

If you're looking for a ""quality"" show, definitely check out Signal or Reply 1988. Both were produced by tvN, which is (kinda) like the HBO of Korea. "
Mossad 101,"I started Fauda, but was disappointed. I had heard it compared to The Wire, I didn't think it would be that good, but I had higher expectations. It feels kind of like a bit better terrorism focused NCIS with a continual story. It is alright, I was just hoping for more."

The show ended with the two main characters getting engaged to be married. Then, an alien ship flew in out of nowhere and ""killed"" them. (Blasted them with something that broke them into pieces which fell into the boat they were in as well as into the water.)

Fan outrage over the cancellation was enough that the creators were given a miniseries to tie up loose ends. It wasn't perfect. They basically had 3 seasons of plot sketched out that they needed to compress into the equivalent of 4 episodes. Still, it was much better than getting nothing and the ending tied up enough while still leaving the possibility of future adventures open."

EDIT: Some people are saying it doesn't count b/c there were no cliffhangers or unresolved thread. But OP never said a series had to have those things in their original post. Star Trek TOS was canceled, then revived and given a stronger conclusion. It meets that standard.

Serialized TV was a rarity in the 60s and its not reasonable to hold a show from that time to the standard of having a strong story arc throughout."

Frequency,"A rather obscure one that half fits your criteria:

A Disney Channel show called So Weird had its lead actress leave after season 2 to pursue other endeavors. Since she was the main, the ENTIRE last season had to change. It was probably going to change anyway due to the darker nature of the scripts, but with the main’s departure it was set in stone.

The writers went online and outlined the plans for the original last season.

It was already planning for three seasons so after the third it was quietly cancelled."

"
El Marginal,Why? 
El Marginal,"Yes, but still has no subs in english IIRC"
El Marginal,It doesn’t need one. That’s why. Stop trying to make sex illegal.
El Marginal,"TV ratings were originally designed for broadcast over the air TV. What the MPAA would consider NC-17 or the ESRB would consider AO would have been illegal to broadcast under obscenity laws, so rating them would be pointless. 

That being said, the only real difference between TV-MA and a ""18+ only"" rating is the presence of explicit sexual activity right, in which case the addition of a ""sexual content"" warning under it should remedy the situation."
El Marginal,"With everyone complaining about nudity and sex in adult orientated shows, I can't see them releasing a NC-17 TV equivalent anytime soon."
El Marginal,"It's a good thing there isn't one; otherwise there would inevitably end up being a stigma against it like there is with NC-17. (Though TV ratings are decided by the network or service, not any central authority, so technically they could all just ignore the ""AO"" rating's existence and rate everything TV-MA, anyway.)"
El Marginal,"So people are often confused by TV ratings, but thr first thing you have to understand is that they aren’t real. It’s completely made up and ratings are self-selected. you can choose to rate a show whatever you want and the lack of options is part of what makes it irrelevant. It’s not meant to be real or accurate, it’s meant to be so that religious groups stopped protesting them."
El Marginal,"[TV has MA for Mature Audiences](https://entertainmentlaw.uslegal.com/censorship/ratings/tv-ratings/)

Edit: ESRB is for software only, mainly video games.

Edit 2: Since streamers aren't tv while they still have to have a warning it may not look the same here's one for [The Boys](https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/news/the-boys-latest-episode-opens-with-content-warning-about-sexual-graphic-and-taboo-scenes/). Upper left is the warning for each episode."
El Marginal,Well actually that's what TV-MA means (mature audience ONLY) it's just whoever created the rating thought you were an adult at 17 and no ones bothered to fix it since then...
El Marginal,What about for porn on PPV channels?
El Marginal,"Actually it's because whoever created the ""TV-MA"" thought you were an adult at 17."
El Marginal,Well TV ratings aren't just limited to TV they put them on streaming on DVDs in which case there are shows that are so bad they felt the need to create a new rating above TV-MA just for blu-rays
El Marginal,[That just happened unofficially](https://www.sentaifilmworks.com/products/redo-of-healer-season-1-complete-collection-blu-ray?_pos=1&_sid=15c45218d&_ss=r)
El Marginal,Agreed. I remember someone saying the high and low ratings are always rare for TV it seems to be an exception
El Marginal,The company that released this blu-ray normally uses TV rating but for this one they decided to make their own [AO](https://www.sentaifilmworks.com/products/redo-of-healer-season-1-complete-collection-blu-ray?_pos=1&_sid=15c45218d&_ss=r) equivalent
El Marginal,[deleted]
El Marginal,[deleted]
El Marginal,"Well that's because network tv is different, my 2nd edit shows the 18+ warning specifically for an episode of The Boys with a sentence of what's being shown. I'm sure the episode had one and OP may have missed it"
El Marginal,Well they [found a way!](https://www.sentaifilmworks.com/products/redo-of-healer-season-1-complete-collection-blu-ray?_pos=1&_sid=15c45218d&_ss=r) Also wait if porn on TV is still TV-MA and TV-MA is 17+ are they implying 17 year olds can watch porn. I thought porn was an 18+ only thing!
El Marginal,i translated subtitles for this series to my language back then. it was a good experience. enjoyed it much but finale not that good. such weird ending for a beautiful series.
El Marginal,Might want to mention the showrunner was [Sarah Polley](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0295264/).
El Marginal,"Not watching a damn thing by that terfstain.

EDIT: The scorn of Potter fans and TERFs nourishes me. It wasn't even a good series, guys. Rowling's a hack. Grow up, read Pratchett, conversation closed."
El Marginal,"Last episode sank the series for me, loved the start though."
El Marginal,May I ask what you're talkin' about exactly? Who's a terfstain?
El Marginal,"Margaret Atwood posted a link to an op-ed that *some* believe to be transphobic. (The initial op-ed was arguing against the growing trend in healthcare to replace words like ""women"" with phrases like ""people who are pregnant."")

She hasn't said anything actively transphobic, has spent a long career supporting LGBTQ rights, and has bluntly stated that she believes gender is a spectrum and that people can identify as whatever gender they choose. 

But somehow, you can't mention her name now without a rabid minority comparing her to JK Rowling?

I've read all the original social media from the controversy and several articles on the topic, and I still don't get it..."
El Marginal,"Those people are insane, it's a waste of time trying to find reason in their actuons."
El Marginal,"Having an opinion now gets you canceled. Sounds like she was never dehumanizing anyone, rather she was standing up for an experience only a biologically born woman can have & to have to validate men wanting to be women over women themselves is dehumanizing to her own sex. So I stand with her opinion too."
Maniac,"&#x200B;

I've seen directors say they omit subtitles in some scenes where they want the audience to be as clueless (vulnerable, confused, whatever) as the character.

Maniac,"I'd like to know what hack directors say that so I can *not* watch what they make.

Maybe what else you said is a factor though."
Maniac,"> what hack directors 

Steven Spielberg for one..."
Maniac,I'll shut up now.
Maniac,"Absolutely loved it when it came out, great performances and visually interesting. One of Jonah hills best 

Weird of Netflix’s part, they advertised it for about a week and then it got completely buried. It never turned up when scrolling. I actually thought they had gotten rid of it until I manually searched it."
Maniac,"This show was the *talk of the town* when it first came out. On here, on twitter etc. Then.... *crickets*! I don't think I've ever seen the buzz die for a series so quickly. It's like a week after it premiered the internet was done with it."
Maniac,"Annie!  It's me, Owen, as a hawk!!!"
Maniac,"Terrific show.  I still think about it a lot.  The Utangatta episode might be my favorite.  I'll say, Hill gets a lot of praise here for it (and Stone is fantastic) but I loved what Justin Theroux did in this show.  I also thought Billy Magnussen did great work with not too much material."
Maniac,"After The Leftovers, Maniac and Station Eleven I’ll watch anything Patrick Somerville does"
Maniac,Man it was one hell of a trip binge watching it on shrooms. Very under appreciated and underrated show
Maniac,I was really excited for it when it came out but it didn't grab me when I watched it and I had to force myself to finish. It may have been that I wasn't in the right frame of mind. Might be worth giving it another shot.
Maniac,"Really loved it. Nothing else to contribute, it was great!"
Maniac,"I was Dr. Mantleray (Justin Theroux’s character) for Halloween the year it came out. 

No one got the costume, but I had fun anyway."
Maniac,"7.7 on IMDB  
84% on RT   
76 on Metacritic   
7.8 on Metacritic audience"
Maniac,Great show. Thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish.
Maniac,"Yeah, great show. Re watch it when I can handle it."
Maniac,"Years ago I had heard about this show so I used my Google Home to start it. “Hey Google. Play Maniac from Netflix on the TV”. 

What I got was the original Norwegian series from 2015. https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3714902/

After watching I forgot about this version and years later I looked it up again and finally watched it and thought it was great. 

TIL the Jonah Hill version was a remake of the Norwegian original. 🤦‍♂️"
Maniac,"Idk where exactly it ranks, but this is definitely one of my all time favorite limited series. It’s incredibly well executed and there are so many details that make rewatches fun and necessary to fully appreciate it."
Maniac,"I much preferred the original, though they have almost nothing in common."
Maniac,It’s a great show.  One of the best Netflix originals imo
Maniac,That's the thing I dislike about Netflix the most they have plenty of great shows but people just don't know about them because they don't advertise them well.
Maniac,They still promote shows better than Prime does
Maniac,Bill Hader mentioned this happening to friends when he talked about Barry Season 3. I wonder if the plot was based on Maniac.
Maniac,Because Netflix keeps pumping tons of movies and seasons all at once without space to breathe.
Maniac,like any other netflix series
Maniac,One of the issues of dropping all the episodes at once. Also it was huge on released but a lot of people didn’t really like it which imo it was a unique show that was overall kinda shallow and disappointing. Unfortunately fairly forgettable
Maniac,If you watch sports then they do advertise. I saw tons of Netflix commercials during last year nfl and nba seasons
Maniac,They’ll throw everything into their cash grabs or their nonsense reality shows and then shove them in your face for months but things like rrr had two days of front page showcase and then absolutely gotten rid of
Maniac,"I’ll agree to that any day!

When was the last time they showcased originals like  red oaks, comrade detectives or the tick??"
Maniac,"They are cramming in as much as possible with no thought about whether they should or if we want it 

We used to have bojack, bloodline, maniac, sense8, derek, house of cards and now we get fucking resident evil and selling sunset"
Maniac,"I think it's in large part due to dropping episodes all at once. There isn't week to week anticipation, water cooler chatter, it's a flash in the pan right now.

One episode a week also allows for people to get see what the fuss is about after hearing about it week over week. It's in the zeitgeist longer and makes for breaks between seasone (sometimes) shorter."
Maniac,"You also get Stranger Things, Umbrella Academy, Ozark, The Witcher etc"
Maniac,"Now we also get Borgen, Jeen Yus, Stranger Things, Umbrella Academy, Sea Beast, Juvenile Justice, DP, and yes, Selling Sunset (which I absolutely love...and Snowflake Mountain which was also very good). And they’ve just released a new Bill Burr special!"
Maniac,I Think You Should Leave
Maniac,"All very okay, I’ve enjoyed watching them but they’re not great"
Maniac,Yeah to be fair I think you should leave and aunty donna are both top tier
Maniac,"I hope this has a bit more care put into it then that previous animated series based on his shorts. 

His manga is so amazing but that show made them feel so bland and lifeless in their adaptation. It was basically like someone badly traced his work and added some lifeless colours for the sake of it. The animation was also lifeless and dull, it added nothing to the work. 

Hopefully this is not connected to that though and does his work justice. If not at least the uzumaki show looks great and is being run by the same guy who did the flowers of evil adaptation which had a great atmosphere and tone to it (and I really enjoyed the look though I understand it's controversial)"
Maniac,Where the heck is Adult Swim's version of Uzumaki?
Maniac,The hanging balloons! JUST HOOK IT TO MY VEINS!!
Maniac,"Will this include an adaptation of his by far scariest work, Junji Ito's Cat Diary?"
Maniac,"Hell yes. Tomie and Hanging Balloons are great. Personally not a big fan of the Souichi stories though, I think the character is mostly just annoying. But looking forward to this nevertheless!"
Maniac,"Oh man, The Hanging Balloons has one of my favourite Ito series of panels in it, so I can't wait.

Also it never ceases to amaze me how *normal* Junji Ito comes across in person. How can a guy like that come up with some of the best most fucked up horror stories of all time?"
Maniac,Has he released anything unique in the last 10 years? Last thing I remember from him is dissolving classroom back in 2014.
Maniac,"I'd tried a few of his mangas, and I just don't understand the appeal, and I must be alone in that because all of his books have 5star reviews from thousands of people.  I recently bought Remina, and it had to be one of the most poorly written book I can remember reading.  I'll still watch this anime, maybe the dialog will be better with voice acting."
Maniac,"Judging by how detailed and well done the model sheets are (using my animation experience here), I’m inclined to think this is going to be a good one.

Also for what it’s worth Netflix actually seems to put in the work when it comes to animated adaptations of big name mangakas so I’m not too worried. If it was live action though….we would be having problems."
Maniac,"I'm optimistic about this one since the previous series was a pretty major bomb and everyone knew it.

Uzumaki has been shown to have **dramatically** more effort behind it so I would hope that Ito's being a bit more hands on with making sure the Collection isn't repeated. This one's through netflix though so it can really go either way. Netflix can say all they want 'the creator was directly involved' and we all know they're lying through their teeth. Not to say they haven't put out a handful of good anime but their track record is inconsistent to say the least."
Maniac,It got pushed back to October 2022.
Maniac,"Read that manga during my winter holiday alone in my dorm, had to close my blinds and hide under the sheets after I was done. No balloons are gonna catch me slipping lol.

Love ito Junjis work, but man you have to be prepared sometimes."
Maniac,It's to Ito's credit that he can take a completely ridiculous basic concept like The Hanging Balloons and make something horrific out of it.
Maniac,Souichi stories are just for a different audience. Always seemed like kids stories where he gets his comeuppance for behaving badly and ends with him running away with nails in his butt.
Maniac,"In terms of english releases anyway, I believe Sensor was toward the end of last year. This year we have Liminal Zone and Black Paradox in fall/winter. So, new to english speaking markets for sure. However I'm not positive on whether he's still writing."
Maniac,"https://www.mangaupdates.com/author/44ljnuu/itou-junji

Looks like one online comic in 2020 and several releases in 2018 and years before that"
Maniac,"Pulling back a little, my concern is more with how netflix works with JP creators. We all heard many tales about how they worked hand in hand with Shinichirō Watanabe for the turd that was live action Cowboy Bebop, of course we all later learned that no one on set ever spoke to him."
Maniac,That's actually sooner than I thought it would be.
Maniac,I hear you. The first time i read The Enigma of Amigara Fault i woke up 3 times that night from nightmares.
Maniac,"I have no idea why you're getting downvoted, because this info is right. If anything, there's been more stuff from him getting released in English in the last few years than ever. And some of that stuff was even new in Japanese more recently than Dissolving Classroom, too."
Maniac,"It can still get pushed back again, so I'll only believe in that release date once it's aired."
Maniac,"""I've been blinded by my mother's toxic love!"""
Maniac,I would recommend Legion and DEVS for the visual aesthetics and world building as well.
Maniac,Justin Theroux is hilarious in this.
Maniac,"Always happy to see Maniac get mentioned.

I don't have too many all-time favorite shows. Breaking Bad/BCS, Game of Thrones (at least in its prime), Mr Robot, Dark, The Leftovers, The OA, and maybe even Utopia (UK).

Maniac is also one of them. Something about it... dense quality packed in to almost every aspect. It's fun, it's got some depth, and it's visually stunning. For a miniseries, I think it's perfect (which is different from flawless, as I don't think any story can be flawless, especially considering that many flaws are subjective. For me, a story can be perfect as long as it hits enough notes higher than most stories do)."
Maniac,"I absolutely loved it as well, it's one of my favourite shows.  
   
But the storytelling is very unique and I can definitely understand how it is not for everyone. It has an almost Twin Peaks level of weirdness. Visually, it is pretty much flawless."
Maniac,I wanted to like this so much more than I did. And I liked it. I just didn’t love it. But it certainly had moments of brilliance.
Maniac,That show is really fucking good.
Maniac,I particularly appreciated the way they represented schizophrenia
Maniac,Annie I'm a hawk
Maniac,The lemur episode is one of my favorite pieces of tv ever!
Maniac,"I feel like this show disappeared from the collective conscience very quickly, maybe because it was too off the wall. But I'm glad you reminded us to que it up for a rewatch."
Maniac,It’s the best thing Netflix has produced.
Maniac,"I didn’t like it at all. So much time is spent on the meta plots they go through after taking the pills that it became tediously pointless. 

Like, when they’re doing a murder mystery party or when they’re in the 80’s trying to steal an iguana, etc, all of that felt so tediously irrelevant and pointless that it made me not enjoy the show. The characters aren’t aware of who they are in the real world, so it felt like the plot and characters weren’t progressing for long periods of time. 

Just didn’t work for me. Justin Theroux was the best part though and I loved the first episode."
Maniac,"Check out station eleven when it comes out on Thursday, same show runner."
Maniac,"It's been a while since I have watched this show but I agree,it's a really good minisseries with a beautiful message."
Maniac,It was pretty good.
Maniac,Maniac is awesome!
Maniac,I'm still using that wake up ringtone after all these years! Great series!
Maniac,I really need to get a poster of this show.
Maniac,Loved Maniac. This post might inspire me to do a rewatch. The music has stuck with me through all the years.
Maniac,I watched it and thought it'd have a good payoff in the end but it was just zany and off-putting. Wasn't my cup of tea.
Maniac,"Really well written and yes, the world building was beautiful. Emma Stone knocked it out of the park and Justin Theroux was hilarious.

I thought Jonah Hill struggled a bit with the acting scenes. He’s not a great actor and he has kind of a turkey neck in this (not his fault but it distracted me). 

Everyone else really out-acted him and I felt sorry for him. Especially when he puts on a fake accent, it was too cringey for me."
Maniac,Seemed like a ripoff of Legion
Maniac,My GF started watching it and likes it a lot. I will give it a go.
Maniac,"I watched it, but I barely remember anything about it"
Maniac,"What's wrong with the world isn't that I'm sick....

It's that I don't matter."
Maniac,"It was a really good show.  Jonah Hill surprised me, because he was mostly annoying in everything else he’d been in.


I wish we’d get more"
Maniac,"Exceptional show, really liked it. Justin Theroux kills it, i watch everything he stars in since his performance in The Leftovers. Criminally underrated actor."
Maniac,Cheers for the heads up - a comedys with Jonah Hill rated 7.7 that Ive never heard of?  FUCK yeh - thats higher than Superbad!!
Maniac,Devs is brilliant and on par with Maniac in quality even though they’re very different thematically. Great rec.
Maniac,I really loved the first season of legion. Need to go back and finish the series
Maniac,I thought Legion supposedly jumped the shark or something? I haven't watched it tho
Maniac,"While this is obviously subjective, if something is comparable to Legion, I'm instantly & completely turned off and most likely won't give it a chance. 

Legion is basically the definition of style over substance. What a waste of time that show was."
Maniac,"I know this sub can get kinda annoying with all the Patriot-praise, but based on the shows that you mentioned I feel like you would probably love it."
Maniac,a couple others I would add are Halt & Catch Fire + You're the Worst
Maniac,I don’t have the same list but it’s a good list
Maniac,"Patrician taste, i think Mr. Robot does not get enough praise, especially the last season was  absolute top-tier. Leftovers is one-in-a-million, too, next to Six Feet Under the most human show i've ever watched, extremly talented cast as well."
Maniac,"Excellent list, I would say a few strong 10/10 you got there."
Maniac,"Oh wow, I adore *BB/BCS*, good *GoT*, *Mr Robot*, *Utopia UK* & *The Leftovers*. 

Guess I need to give *The OA* and *Dark* (and *Maniac*) a shot!"
Maniac,"Another Neflix show which I think fits in this general genre of shows is Russian Doll.  It's a show you really, really have to let get going.  You think it's going to be a very specific type of season for the first three episodes, but then it really takes things in a new and pretty great direction."
Maniac,Found this while I was searching Maniac. We have very similar favorite shows. Definitely check out Severance ASAP if you haven't had a chance.
Maniac,5 6 7 8
Maniac,"I prefer Dark between the two of them, but love both."
Mobile Suit Gundam,"Damn this takes me back. I remember CN would do other music videos with their shows/characters. I remember one with Atom Ant, another with Courage the Cowardly Dog...fun times"
Mobile Suit Gundam,Big-O was a fuckin banger
Mobile Suit Gundam,This is some solid nostalgia fuel
Mobile Suit Gundam,Peter Cullen has that kinda voice that always gives you goosebumps
Mobile Suit Gundam,Yeah.. I could use a Megadeus
Mobile Suit Gundam,I remember downloading this on Kazaa. This and their other video “Mad Rhetoric”
Mobile Suit Gundam,The one downside of VoD is missing out on these vignettes.
Mobile Suit Gundam,I miss old TN and then adult swim / late night stuff till 4am…
Mobile Suit Gundam,"Man, Toonami was the absolute shit."
Mobile Suit Gundam,It's tsunami megamix is pretty good with DJ Clark Nova
Mobile Suit Gundam,"The voiceover is talking about a Terminator-style machine war, but most of the clips are showing mechs with human pilots. Even the bit from Dragonball Z has a human brain."
Mobile Suit Gundam,"Fuck this is cool, I wish I'd grown up with Toonami"
Mobile Suit Gundam,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKqFBkskx7M
Mobile Suit Gundam,My favorite was the [Jabber Jaw](https://youtu.be/Vn1pf0Xi3nU) music video.
Mobile Suit Gundam,Wow I forgot all about those. Thanks for the memories!
Mobile Suit Gundam,"Still is! basically just ""if bruce wayne has a mech"" and also everyone in gotham has amnesia. i still rewatch it about once a year, so much style in that show"
Mobile Suit Gundam,Nothing makes you feel old like finding out Toonami turned 25.
Mobile Suit Gundam,Optimus Prime talking about machines/computers wiping out humanity as they grow self aware. 10/10
Mobile Suit Gundam,Was that a site like Limewire?
Mobile Suit Gundam,"**YES THIS IS IT!!!!**

Holy shit, thank you. I'm about to look for their old school bumps and just vibe out to nostalgia."
Mobile Suit Gundam,I remember a cartoon channel put together a bunch of clips of various cartoons set to Bare Naked Ladies “Falling For The First Time” and it always stuck with me.
Mobile Suit Gundam,If you're interested the band that does this is called Pain and they make great ska music
Mobile Suit Gundam,"[This is a great channel for that](https://www.youtube.com/c/SlimD716V2/videos), all of Toonami's finest remastered in stunning HD"
Mobile Suit Gundam,"Well aware, but thank you! I'm sure Pain is the root of my love for ska as an adult."
Mobile Suit Gundam,"This show is a masterclass of raising stakes in a story.  Do not sleep on it, even if it is dated."
Mobile Suit Gundam,"Man, first Babylon 5 is remastered on HBO Max,and now Mobile Suit Gundam is finally streaming.  Good week for sci-fi."
Mobile Suit Gundam,"When I was a kid watching it on toonami I thought it was a mecha show about a whining teen pilot.

After giving it a re-watch, be2i love the spin offs 08th MS team and sequel, Zeta Gundam. I learned it was truly what showed me war is fought by kids, 16-19 year olds who should be making love, or riding bikes in the park. It's deeper than you gave it credit for. The last battle, which takes place over 3 episodes has some of the most heart string drama and best space battles I've see.

Amuro isn't whining, he has PTSD and combat fatigue."
Mobile Suit Gundam,"Recommended watching for seasoned mech fans if they haven't already seen it. 

It's dated, but it's one of the most influential giant robot shows of all time gets something from this one. Kids going to war, getting psychologically messed up and coming out of it with lost friends and more mental issues then what they came with.

Also the robots r kewl."
Mobile Suit Gundam,My body is ready for the Bright Slap.
Mobile Suit Gundam,"If you’ve never seen MSG and start with this, don’t worry if it’s not your cup of tea. The fun thing about it is there’s a Gundam for everyone. So you could try one of the other series. Want one that’s coo coo bananas? G Gundam baby! Small scale drama with a Romeo and Juliet bent? 08th MS Team (my personal favorite). There’s even ones that are beyblade with Gundam in Build Drivers. Possibilities are endless"
Mobile Suit Gundam,[deleted]
Mobile Suit Gundam,"I just checked a week ago and was super disappointed. Checked it this morning and there it is! 

Man. Brings me back to the days of running to the living room, plugging in the code to turn the huge satellite dish, and then going downstairs to watch it with my glass of milk and Oreo pop tarts on my tiny tv."
Mobile Suit Gundam,"I was really impressed when I watched this. They did an amazing job of actually making the enemy into human beings instead of just fist shaking villains. Plus, they actually had a setting in which they convinced me that using giant robots to fight made sense."
Mobile Suit Gundam,"I just wish we could get Zeta on streaming now, but I assume due to rights issues, pertaining to the opening, that won't happen."
Mobile Suit Gundam,"This show is awful, guys. Nobody watch it. Whole series is based on a lie.

The One Year War doesn’t even last one year."
Mobile Suit Gundam,A story so good they told it again uh how many series are just a new take on MSG? 7 or so I think
Mobile Suit Gundam,Can someone verify that this is what **Gundam origins** is the prequel too.  I confused myself reading up on it.
Mobile Suit Gundam,I wish I could bundle this service with other things. The cost is a little high for the amount of anime I would watch but if it were a small add on to like Hulu this would be great.
Mobile Suit Gundam,will hello kitty appear in the new time line?
Mobile Suit Gundam,I tried to get into this but couldn't :(
Mobile Suit Gundam,"Great news! I do, however, prefer the the theatrical movies, which do a good job at condensing the series and trimming out the unnecessary fat, not to mention they redid some scenes that looked kind of bad on the show. I'm just sad that we've yet to receive a proper remake of the original. The Origin OVA doesn't cover the whole Origin manga (which is an excellent remake of the original series, authored/illustrated by the original character designer). I'm also sad that we never got a 90s remake in the style of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCRtFptEMF8). Damn it would've looked good!"
Mobile Suit Gundam,No MSG added.
Mobile Suit Gundam,They're lucky they weren't sued for stealing the lightsaber.
Mobile Suit Gundam,"If your really into this kind of old anime I would suggest watching Legion of the galactic hero's, it's sort of like the [anime version of babylon 5] (https://i.imgur.com/jiVJML3.jpg). They [remade] (https://i.imgur.com/WaDOMAy.jpg) the first two seasons in 2018."
Mobile Suit Gundam,"Great!.

Now someone please sort out the details for Space Battleship Yamato (1974).

Can't even find a boxed set for the series that isn't insane due to being out of print."
Mobile Suit Gundam,So will this be on HBO Max???
Mobile Suit Gundam,Huge Gundam fan! Such a classic!
Mobile Suit Gundam,"It also has an amazingly funky soundtrack!

Mobile Suit Gundam,"In the start pretty bog standart mecha stuff, but after they arrive to earth becomes a great, but a bit corny, war drama."
Mobile Suit Gundam,"> raising stakes

You might like https://myanimelist.net/anime/19/Monster"
Mobile Suit Gundam,Babylon 5 is being remaster wha??
Mobile Suit Gundam,MSG is also on Funimation's streaming service BTW if you prefer mostly dub offerings. Just an FYI.
Mobile Suit Gundam,"Yeah there's an episode where Amuro goes fully catatonic and Bright just has him strapped into the gundam and sent off, figuring that once he was in battle he'd snap out of it when his survival instinct kicked in."
Mobile Suit Gundam,"Huh, sounds like Evangelion."
Mobile Suit Gundam,"> 
> It's dated, but it's one of the most influential giant robot shows of all time. gets something from this one. Kids going to war, getting psychologically messed up and coming out of it with lost friends and more mental issues then what they came with.

I'd highly recommend checking out Zambot 3, it's Tomino's(Director / Creator of Gundam) previous work that pushed the boundaries on robot anime. Suffice to say a lot of shit gets fucked up and it's not all goofiness."
Mobile Suit Gundam,08th MS Team is also my favorite. It really hit me different from anything else I had ever seen from Anime up to that point. It was also one of my favorite Gundam toys since it had the working backpack haha.
Mobile Suit Gundam,"I fuckin love G Gundam. It's definitely part nostalgia from it airing on Cartoon Network after school when I was a kid. But that series is what got me into Gundam. Everyone hates on it, but its hands down my favorite from what I've seen."
Mobile Suit Gundam,I liked G Gundam. I liked Gundam Wing more.
Mobile Suit Gundam,"Yeah if I'm recommending something to non-anime fans, MSG is not where I'd usually start. It can be...tedious. It is more for the anime fan who wants to see the classic roots of a franchise that now spans several universes."
Mobile Suit Gundam,"9/11 happened and killed off the anime that was ""too serious."" Then Toonami got moved to Saturday and Miguzi, which was lighter fare with shows like Teen Titans and Code Lyoko, took over on weekdays."
Mobile Suit Gundam,"Oh man, is it your first time watching? You're in for a ride! Definitely check out Zeta Gundam when you finish and the rest of the UC and other Gundam and mecha stuff in general. There's some incredible stuff out there that deals with some really heavy themes.

Mobile Suit Gundam,"They simply replaced the opening song on the blu-ray, surely they could do that for streaming."
Mobile Suit Gundam,"I haven't seen Gundam and don't know the story of it beyond that people pilot robots but if a war happened *within* one year then I think ""One Year War"" is an appropriate name for it."
Mobile Suit Gundam,Seed was like a shot for shot remake at some points.
Mobile Suit Gundam,The Gundam Origins OVA is a prequel to Mobile Suit Gundam... sorta. It’s technically pulled from the Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin manga which was a retelling of Mobile Suit Gundam and is made by one of the original illustrators of the show. It changes a few things from the original series but but you can still watch the Gundam Origins OVAs as prequel content to the original series.
Mobile Suit Gundam,"This is correct. Gundam has 2 universes to it

1. ""The Universal Century"" which is what the ""main"" story of Gundam is. Its a massive war between the Zeon and the Earth Federation

2. Pretty much everything NOT the Universal Century. These are just one off worlds/dimensions that exist to tell a single story in a season, they have no relation to the Universal Century. These stories are actually more popular in terms of viewership- ""G Gundam"" (my favorite) Iron Blooded Orphans Gundam Seed and Gundam Wing

The UC is about 2 guys, Amuro Ray who is the protagonist and Char Aznable who is the anti-villain of the show. Gundam Origins gives us the backstory of Char Aznable. Gundam Origins is hella tight though, its effectively a Monte Cristo story"
Mobile Suit Gundam,Origins won't make sense until you watch the original series.
Mobile Suit Gundam,"I'll confirm it.  Sure. 

I've seen most of the gundam universe, and honestly don't have any idea what goes where, but I'll confirm it

Shining Finger! buh buh da buh da ba da!"

I watch crunchyroll free of charge without ads. Just use an adblocking browser extension."
Mobile Suit Gundam,Isn’t it cheaper than every other streaming service?

They also have some non-anime stuff like

Mobile Suit Gundam,MSG had already showed up on Funi's streaming service and a lot of their offerings end up on Hulu so who knows.
Mobile Suit Gundam,They did just release a hello kitty gundam.
Mobile Suit Gundam,"The animation is dated and there was a lot of goofiness, because it had a lot of super robot tropes.

I'd try the movie trilogy, but it's not properly dubbed or legally available."
Mobile Suit Gundam,"Try “War in the Pocket” gundam. Only 6 episodes. 

Most “universal century” gundam series are confusing, with weird names for characters, and a lot of it can be hard to keep track of. 

But not War in the Pocket.
It’s a lovely story. And if it’s still not your cup of tea after episode 1, no worries! Don’t force yourself just because others enjoy it. You probably already have things you enjoy anyway.

(Hopefully that one is on steaming. But you might also just be able to rent it)"
Mobile Suit Gundam,"That's because despite the love, the old show is actually boring as hell, like an old episode of speed racer.  Try gundam unicorn."
Mobile Suit Gundam,"Honestly, the simple omission of the G-fighter, G-bull, etc is enough on its own to make the movies vastly superior to the show."
Mobile Suit Gundam,"Lucas stole the idea for light sabers from pulp science fiction stories from the the nineteen teens and movie serials from the thirties and forties. Hell the word ""Jedi"" is a bastardization of the term used in Japan for samurai films."
Mobile Suit Gundam,The soundtrack is also streaming on Spotify!
Mobile Suit Gundam,"The soundtrack is so kitschy and I absolutely love it. My favourite track has got to be [From Sleep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFoKkeTmYp4&list=PLE234F313FF53A39C&index=3), especially from 1:16 onward.

Mobile Suit Gundam,"To be fair, OG Gundam created most of the tropes that have become the standard for long form war anime series. The price of being a genre defining game changer."
Mobile Suit Gundam,"Still, I advise everyone to watch the updated theatrical(1-3) or read the modernized series(the origin) instead. 

They are far more organized and accessible."
Mobile Suit Gundam,Already is and on HBO Max
Mobile Suit Gundam,"I checked it out, it's not anything new just a little less blurry."
Mobile Suit Gundam,"You know what got me? I rewatched it and Bright is the only survivor of the original crew, he was a military cadet in training. He was 19 years old. Not even an Ensign rank. And he was supposed to not only captain the most advanced ship in the fleet, but wrangle a bunch of literal kids. He is basically doing a Battlestar Galactica. I feel for him this time around. I watch the show in abject horror at like 25 as all the people dying except like Ramba Ral were 6 or 9 years younger than me.
Lalah Sunn was a genius bit of writing too if you watch further in the shows."
Mobile Suit Gundam,"Turns out when you do stories with a lot of depressing themes and death, you probably have depression."
Mobile Suit Gundam,"""Shut up and get in the Gundam, Amuro.""

Bright Noa is basically Gendo Ikari."
Mobile Suit Gundam,It’s like Evangelion if Evangelion was even slightly comprehensible.
Mobile Suit Gundam,"Victory and Zeta had very dark moments, ZZ for the first half was slapstick and hammy but fans are rewarded once the theme song changes"
Mobile Suit Gundam,">Zambot 3

Thanks I'll definitely give it a watch. The reason I specified ""one of the most influential"" instead of the first or the beginning was exactly for shows like zambot and giant robot animes that came before it. 

I think Mobile suit specifically was like a big breaking point or milestone in the entire history of mecha anime. I remember hearing stories that when it's film premiered in cinemas they literally couldn't fit all the people who came to see it in the theatre because tomino apparently had a big announcement. They didn't expect it's popularity to be so wild. There are people who apparently recorded entire episodes of the show onto casette tapes just to listen on their walkmen and casette players. 

The vinyl was released and THAT became a best seller. 

tl;dr it was a huge fucking show."
Mobile Suit Gundam,"They did that in the Bandai Visual release, so I'm not sure exactly what the deal is."
Mobile Suit Gundam,"I’m just referencing a meme from r/Gundam.

Someone did the math and it’s two or three days short of one year."
Mobile Suit Gundam,Seed was more a remake of Wing IMO and Wing was a super-condensed remake of MSG+Zeta+CCA.
Mobile Suit Gundam,Yeah Seed was probably the worst regarding this. Still enjoyed it though
Mobile Suit Gundam,"To elaborate, the original show was hampered by a combination of factors. The show was required by it's sponsors and producers to have a robot fight in every episode. The producers and sponsors meddled with the show constantly, forcing the creative staff to add designs to the show that only existed to make toys (most notably the G fighter or as Tomino called it, the coffin the series would be buried in) and forced them to make kid friendly episodes that broke with the rest of the narrative of the show. In addition, the show's run was cut from 52 episodes to 43. Also the main animator Yoshikazu Yasuhiko suffered from a severe medical crisis during the production of the show and was hospitalized about halfway through the run until the show's completion.

As a result of these limitations, major parts of the story such as the origins of Char Aznable and Sala Mass were cut for time as well as a planned flashback episode which would have explained much of the backstory to the runup to the one year war. The origin comic sought to remedy these issues as well as give the designs and tone a facelift to match the modern incarnations of the Universal Century. I'd highly recommend reading it. Yoshikazu Yasuhiko is an astonishingly talented artist and storyteller.  Not only are the drawings amazing, but the panel layouts, pacing, transitions and expressions are absolutely top notch. Unfortunately the vast majority of Yaz's comics have not been translated into English so the origin is one of only two comics he drew that you can get that isn't in Japanese."
Mobile Suit Gundam,Thanks!
Mobile Suit Gundam,"G Gundam is absolutely hilarious. A martial arts tournament in giant ass robots, with all the characters and their respective nations being *hella* stereotyped. Funny as fuck. I mean, just look at [Master Asia's introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03Fdj3pVW6w) here."

Skin Wars,"There's a lot to draw on but at the same time I don't want it lost in exposition. It worked fine the way it did, loved some of the stylish scenes with the all black or all white.

Skin Wars,"I can see it work if each episode focuses on a different alien and how they interact/blend in with humans. They can also do it through the POV of the humans as say, a detective, who investigates missing people. But yeah, I agree with you. They'd have to go full-on art-house like Too Old To Die Young if they want to keep the spirit of the film intact."

Skin Wars,"It's really, really difficult to imagine another entity putting a ton of money into something along the lines of Too Old To Die Young given how it panned out any time soon (as happy I am that Amazon did)."
Skin Wars,"The basic concept is aliens coming to Earth and feeling alien, trying to understand us and adapt themselves. Give us a group of them having different experiences and I think you can take the concept pretty far.

I can see it working."

I agree so much I'm honestly not sure I want to see them try.

This seems like a real odd idea."
Skin Wars,"> have no idea how it would work as a series.

Killing Eve, only in Glasgow. In the dark. With terrible clothes. And a lot slower. Basically make it grim & dark & sparse as all shit with hardly any speaking.

The big problem would be the slow burn aspect where you'd only want the audience to see shes a killer episode 2, and that she's an alien in epi 6. 

And your core audience have already seen the movie.

Throw in Jerome Flynn as a grizzled cop trying to catch her etc."

Skin Wars,A24 is currently working with Glazer on his next project so they would likely have him at the very least consult on the series.
Skin Wars,how would this ruin the film?
Skin Wars,"> Like it was a male revenge fantasy

If **THAT** was your takeaway from a movie you missed the point completely. Character's sexiness is not supposed to be  cool, aside from the  general theme of humanity the other major theme is objectification and victimization of women. Character starts out as an emotionless hunter and the more human and feminine she becomes the more of a victim she turns into, eventually resulting in a tragic ending.

Skin Wars,">Like it was a male revenge fantasy.

Oh man, this is the funniest thing I've read today. Maybe you should watch the movie again, it seems like you didn't understand what you were watching.

I do agree that art is subjective and that people have different opinions when it comes to movies, but misinterpeting the meaning of a movie (or elements in a movie) is a completely different thing."
Skin Wars,"Damn that’s fascinating. I’ll have to check out the book. The movie didn’t do much for me but take me on a wild visual trip.

However that one scene where the woman chases to save her dog in the undertow and then the husband then chases to save her was so incredibly powerful and sad. I could completely imagine that happening. I probably wouldn’t chase my dog because I am not a strong swimmer. But I know for certain I would chase my wife. That scene still lingers with me."

while Homeland certainly has a more nuanced approach to themes, the underlying flavour is the same as 24 or any other American show. Carrie and Saul represent America therefore good, and the terrorists are still bad. Once you peel off all the facade, that's the ultimate message. Still a good show"
Skin Wars,"While I enjoyed bits of homeland, you can't really look at shows like this with anything but cynicism. It's literally CIA propaganda. It's feeding you a narrative they want you to believe is adjacent to reality. For that reason I strongly recommend people stay away from anything that involves the US military in media that was produced in the US. It almost always is propaganda. The entire concept of the ""war on terrorism"" is."
Skin Wars,Were people relieved when Brody was dropped? I dropped the show after the end of season 4 or 5. To me it was just a terrible shell of it's former self at that point. I've been thinking of giving it a second chance lately.

Skin Wars,Did you even pay attention to the show? Because it definitely does not paint our government well at all.
Skin Wars,"If you like and miss Homeland, this show is worth watching until the end. It was 8 seasons and they made a finale that is one of the most fantastic in TV series (unlike what they did with Game of Thrones).

Tier 1 season in the Homeland: 1, 2, 4, 8;

Tier 2 season in the Homeland: 5, 7;

Tier 3 season in the Homeland: 3, 6."
Skin Wars,"I mean, it does in many respects, for one it still paints us as the good guys in the middle east.. but also it's widely known Homeland was developed as propaganda that paints some really incredible lies about the nature of the US involvement in other countries.

I was not blown away by the show until the third episode- the last one I watched.

The animation is not that significant to me if I can’t get into the story.

My brain cannot process animation quality across different types and especially since movie animation still tops everything.

So the story is always more important to me and those first two episodes felt pretty typical. 

3rd episode was perfect though and hopefully it stays at that level."

I didn't understand a word you just said here. lol. 

> jesus

What are you trying to say here, that this series' realistic aspects are as ambiguous as our lord and savior Jesus Christ himself? 

😂 Jk... but nah, I'm obviously not the deep fantasy girl. I like fantasy when it's built on something real. A good example is Wonder Egg Priority. A fantasy anime loosely based on the rising female suicide rate in Japan. I like how the characters go off into this fantasy world, but eventually and inevitable have to come back to something real you know. Whether it's their depression or low self-esteem or living situation etc. you know. Arcane on the other hand is all fantasy all the time."

Skin Wars,Stop it. You know you love me. 😘💕
Skin Wars,Nah but thanks for the heads up I think I'll add it to the list.
Skin Wars,"> I'm asking you what establishment ""two sisters separated in childhood who meet again at cross-purposes"" piece of media you're referring to, here, specifically.

There are a long list of examples I could use actually. From Superhero movies, to African movies, or even regular TV drama. But I'll go with the most popular one I could think of. Naruto (*because by now we all know everything in Naruto has been done or copied a million times over*). Specifically the overall arc of Sasuke and Naruto. 

Sauke & Naruto goes on mission; Naruto gets the big win, sasuke feels useless -> They fight -> Sasuke is recruited and taken in by the bad guys -> (*of course they fight again but that's not the case in Arcane*) -> Years pass; Sasuke and Naruto are now at different sides of good/bad -> Naruto searches for Sasuke -> They build to a final battle between them (*I didn't get to the end of Arcane but that's most likely where thing were heading*) etc. 

Textbook storytelling. 

> But the world is real, to the characters of Arcane.

You didn't understand what I said in the last reply... or in the post. When I say ""real world"" I mean our real world. Earth! Reality! Real life! Of course Arcane's world is real to it's characters... but that's irrelevant. What I'm saying is for me to connect to a fantasy show it has to has some connection or undertones to the *real world*. Our real world. That being said, I'll say what I said about Wonder Egg Priority again so that it makes sense now:

> I'm obviously not the deep fantasy girl. I like fantasy when it's built on something real. A good example is Wonder Egg Priority. A fantasy anime loosely based on the rising female suicide rate in Japan. I like how the characters go off into this fantasy world, but eventually and inevitable have to come back to something real you know. Whether it's their depression or low self-esteem or living situation etc. you know. Arcane on the other hand is all fantasy all the time.

Arcane is not built on anything real. Or, from the way I see it it's a 100% fantasy world. So... it's hard for me to connect to it."

Skin Wars,"> Who... aren't sisters? Seems like maybe your example isn't very close.

Lol they don't have to be sisters. That specific detail of the story is recyclable. They could be brothers, best friends, or just 2 people with a bond. etc. The point is the story plays out the same way or very similarly. 

> Then it wouldn't be fantasy. It would be a documentary.

What!? lol. You ain't understanding a word Im saying at all. But it's cool."
Skin Wars,"Different kinds of relationships aren’t fungible. Being sisters is a different relationship than being friends.

The story doesn’t “play out the same way” at all, which you’d have some idea about if you were actually reviewing the show and not the ending you just imagined."
Skin Wars,"Same here. The first three episodes, while not groundbreaking in any way, were at least promising. It made me excited for Star Wars again and has a lead who was enjoyable to root for. 

I didn’t mind the short episodes at first either, but with the last two ones leaning more and more towards a ‘adventure of the week’ kind of thing and this series is only 8 episodes averaging 30 minutes each, the motivation to must see this show weekly is getting pretty thin."
Skin Wars,Its decent. Only reason its getting hyped and rated more highly is cuz its star wars
Skin Wars,"I agree completely. The show feels like it’s turning into a typical baddie of the week type of show like Kung Fu or more recently Firefly, but they are missing the character development element. My favorite part of Firefly was learning about the characters and how they all interacted with each other. In one season you truly felt like you knew the whole ensemble cast. With the Mandalorian the season is almost over and I feel like I don’t know any of the characters and that the story has hardly progressed. I hope they turn it around, but so far I have been underwhelmed."
Skin Wars,"Yeah SW fans react really well to relatively simple remixed fanservice. 

I actually do enjoy the show in that same ""fun but empty calories"" way that I enjoy TFA, Solo, etc. But the lack of creative ambition in all Disney Star Wars is a really big disappointment overall."
Skin Wars,ITT: People saying opinions are wrong.
Skin Wars,"I'm still enjoying the show a lot, but I somewhat agree. The slow plot progression would be fine if we had more central characters, but other than Mando and Yiddle everyone else thus far has been a one off. And a baby who can't talk yet and a stoic guy who always wears a mask aren't enough to carry the show if it's meant to be a character driven show rather than a plot driven show. Especially if the show is meant to last several seasons. Hopefully in season two we get some more expressive reoccurring characters added, or the plot picks up a bit."
Skin Wars,"Probably not, but who cares?

Hype and praise is what other people think of it. If you like it, just enjoy it to the degree you enjoy it and don't worry what others say."
Skin Wars,"The hype is strong with these ones. 

I agree with you big time. You make the same points I’ve thought about as I’ve watched it but there’s also something hard to put your finger on that’s missing. 

Maybe it’s “soul” or “earnestness” or some other hard-to-define quality but it’s missing from the tone of the show. And I think the “Baby Yoda” in the show just makes me roll my eyes cynically. Star Wars keeps shitting on the mysteriousness of its Universe through overexposure and explanation. See: midichlorians and Yaddle/Baby Yoda

But goddamn if those toys won’t sell!!"
Skin Wars,"You're not compensating for the fact it's the flag ship show for Disney+. It is being pushed on this sub-reddit and therefore overhyped. Also Star wars. 

I like watching the show because the production is amazing and i'm curious where the baby yoda thing goes. Everything else is pretty standard, borderline terrible."
Skin Wars,I was excited because the first episode was legitimately interesting if a little uneven. But it has gotten worse every episode.
Skin Wars,Seems like the old Clayton Moore Lone Ranger show with Baby Yoda as Tonto.
Skin Wars,"I love the show for lots of reasons (and I'm not even really a Star Wars fan) but you've got good points so I upvoted you.

It probably helped me that the show was first described to me as a ""space Western"", so I was expecting and looking forward to its episodic, variations-on-a-theme nature. I honestly like the simplicity and humility of the past two episodes - it's refreshing after so many overly self-aware shows so obsessed with wowing the audience that they'll kill themselves with plot twists.

But when each episode is 1/8 of the whole thing, you don't want to just stick with variations on a theme. If they had a 22-episode season to start with, it would be fine to do an episodic show with occasional special plot-advancing episodes. But an 8-episode miniseries? Make each one count - do something substantial with each, or else people will leave it feeling unfulfilled."
Skin Wars,I feel like the show is put together like an old time weekly series. You get a special guest each week. Each week you get a little more development with the story and characters. I like the slower burn. I feel like the show runners know where to go but dont want it to be a quick trip. Its like they dont care how many episodes are in a season the story gets there when it gets there. Im ok with that.
Skin Wars,"The series is fun to watch, but it doesn't seem sustainable. The last two episodes were rather weak overall.

The homage to the 1980's style acting, writing and special effects was an interesting approach. Though this comes off as rather weak as the series continues. The acting is especially flat.

The real problem, imo anyway, is that the 1980's writing style of episodic adventure won't work well once the baby Yoda hype is over. The Mando character just isn't that interesting and the supporting cast has been frankly untalented overall with a couple of exceptions.

Disney should have made a Baby Yoda show with the Mandalorian as a supporting character."
Skin Wars,It's a shit show. Ppl praise it because of the Disney branding.
Gantz,"> Netflix’s chief content officer Ted Sarandos expressed surprise at Vox Media’s Code Conference this week (via Variety) when revealing the Korean survival drama “Squid Game” is becoming such a blockbuster for the streaming giant that it could soon dethrone “Bridgerton” as the biggest Netflix television series of all time.

Gantz,"I loved the show but man I HATED the ending scene, almost ruined it for me."
Gantz,"I wholeheartedly disagree with the idea that what he did at the end was dumb/bad especially after all that we know about Gi Hun as a character. Throughout the show he's shown to have very strong morale conviction by a number of choices he makes that were technically wrong. It's an incredibly important story element that is diametrically opposed to Sang as Gi continually makes choices he feels are right instead of the one that gives him better odds to win/survive like Sang did. The guy was fired for going on strike over better labor conditions even, he's basically a stand in for the ""Good of humanity"" and it's even more obvious when he risks it all with the old man on that bet in the end. It makes 100% sense why he would be scarred by the games refusing to use the money and opt to try and stop them from happening that shit was traumatizing.

I mean he straight up was ready to leave empty handed to save Sang and was ready to save that girl once he realized it wasn't worth it. I think of it as if he has purpose now. His daughter is important to him but 100s of people getting killed without the world knowing is not something he could just let go. I think people are thinking way too much about what they would do, instead of what the character would do because so much points to this being the outcome."
Gantz,What made this show brilliant is they all let everyone leave and they were so desperate they all chose of their own free will to come back. It kinda added this whole is the black mask guy really evil sinc they all chose money over their own life
Gantz,I got excited thinking this was a show about Splatoon
Gantz,They should do a Gantz series
Gantz,"Squid Game was great.

Easily the best series I've watched in 2021. The policeman storyline was dumb and pointless, overall it was quiet predictable series yet managed to make tension and keep the plot interesting."
Gantz,They need a real Squid game but with politicians participating to win
Gantz,"I regret reading some of these comments fpr carious reasons, so if you're on your way down maybe stop here lmao"
Gantz,"All here complaining about the ending (which wasnt THAT bad)
I'm here just to hate on the only America thing they put i to that show.. The VIP's."
Gantz,That anti capitalist korean angst media sure is hot shit right now
Gantz,How is this show compared to Alice in Borderland?
Gantz,Bit of a nothing article until the numbers are released.
Gantz,"Watched it today, its solid"
Gantz,I just heard about this show yesterday. Is it any good? What do y'all think
Gantz,"Ok Netflix, hear me out. Adapt Liar Game in to a live action series, then also get the rights to The Genius and make new seasons. People like these type of games and shows. Strike while the iron is hot!"
Gantz,"Netflix social media people working over time today, huh?"
Gantz,More please!!!
Gantz,Loved it but felt the cop plot was pointless as well as the ending being too much like SAW. Also that twist ruins the marbles episode for me and now that episode doesn’t hold up well at all.
Gantz,Please don't put spoilers in your answers. Some of us haven't seen every episode as of yet.
Gantz,"Okay so let me say it right here, I hate this show. I hate it because the final episode was that bad and I liked all the episodes up to the finale."
Gantz,"Spoilers in my comment, stop reading here.



I loved it until the white dudes showed up. They ruined the whole show in the end with a bunch of bad and cliché writing.

Who's behind it? ThE rIcH! (no further elaboration) 
 
Why are they doing it? FoR fUn! (no further elaboration)  

MC makes pact with girl to look after her family, so when he wins he ignores the kid who's in a fucking orphanage for like a whole year! And then he dumps him with his friends' mother? And then he chooses to ignore his daughter? k whatever asshole i don't care anymore at this point he could literally walk under a bus and I would feel indifferent   

The frontman is the cop's brother and a previous winner of the game. (no further elaboration)   

Casting of white dudes was shite. Their lines were terrible and their delivery was even worse. Did they find these actors randomly on the street?

Also the fuck was up with that vent scene? They could've cut that out, it didn't add anything to the plot and was never mentioned or used again.

After they nearly all come back to the game, frontman wants the ones that didn't come back monitored closely. This is never mentioned again.

We find out nearly nothing about the people in red suits. How are they picked? Where do they come from? How are they all cold-blooded killers that never hesitate for a single second?"
Gantz,Just finished watching it. Was surprised how much I was engrossed in watching!
Gantz,It's Fall Guys the Movie
Gantz,"Im surprised this is such a hit, if you watch or read anime/manga that are in this genre the story is full of tropes and cliches that you can find in slot of these stories 

But maybe the success of this means that we can get some more stories in this genre maybe a live action Liars game or a new Adaption of battle Royale"
Gantz,"It is alright, but really pales when comparing to other Battle Royale style tv/movies,like Alice in Borderland and As the Gods Will, which has some strikingly similar scenes."
Gantz,Netflix PR working overtime on this one.
Gantz,"You can’t be shocked by this. Netflix plays 99% garbage, give us a good show and we’re all gonna watch it."
Gantz,"Squid Game is the best thing Netflix have ever done by a mile. 

House of Cards is the only other show worth watching even though it ends awfully after Kevin Spacey got sacked"
Gantz,Squid Games was like if CSI Miami and Saw had a Korean baby
Gantz,well deserved IMO
Gantz,I don't see Squid Game anywhere on that list.
Gantz,This show was really quite good prior to the final episode. Took a pretty major dive off of a cliff at that point.
Gantz,For me this series at best was average. if anyone is interested in this kind of series I recommend alice in borderland.
Gantz,"What’s kinda crazy is from what I hear from Korea, it’s not popular and was actually criticized for making this kind of show. How it was poor taste making kid games into murder games. But it’s extremely popular overseas"
Gantz,Weird that Alice in Borderland didnt get the same traction when it’s way too superior 🤷‍♂️
Gantz,Great series. I really liked most of it. But I did have to fast forward through a fair bit of some of the filler scenes. There's zero reason why it needed to be 9 hours long. They could have easily re-written it to be a tight 6 episodes and cut out episode 2 entirely. Ep 2 was a real slog and entirely pointless.
Gantz,This show just gets dumber and dumber with every subsequent episode. The cliche evil wealthy morons are the pièce de résistance.
Gantz,I'm struggling with this Squid Game. I made it to him trying to get money at the ATM before I turned it off. So 10 min maybe. Foreign films give me a hard time. Mostly due to lip sync with over dubs. I find it so distracting. My brain is flawed I guess. I will try again later today as we have so few good shows as of late.
Gantz,this serie reminds me of As the gods will
Gantz,The trailer makes this show somewhat similar to 'Alice in Borderland'...
Gantz,I don’t understand the gushing love for this show. It was pretty dumb
Gantz,The OA is my favorite show from Netflix I'm still sad it got canceled
Gantz,"I haven't seen it yet but I'm really confused and susprised at just how this series has become so globally popular?

There's been plenty of good Asian series on Netflix that haven't take off the same way."
Gantz,"This is one of those shows that makes me crazy because everyone says how good it is but I just can't stand it. I feel like I'm missing something. Bad acting, silly plot... maybe the ""gameshow of death"" genre just isn't my thing."
Gantz,I really doubt this and it just makes me trust Netflix’s numbers even less.  I feel they just use press releases like these to promote their shows by lying about their popularity.
Gantz,"eh, it was mildly amusing but nothing special. very juvenile plot and mediocre writing, somewhat reminiscent of a popular but average anime.

good for squid game but it does bother me a bit when shows like this become too successful. you just get the feeling that netflix immediately tossed out a bunch of creative scripts and ordered 3 more of these ""junk food"" type of shows when they saw the numbers."
Gantz,This is so crazy. Never thought I'd see kdramas reach this peak bc I used to get laughed at for watching kdramas lmao. Also this show was mediocre at its best. Alice in borderland is a better watch.
Gantz,Did anyone even watch the whole show? I just fast forwarded to the games
Gantz,"I thought the show was okayish. Ending was dumb as hell and most of the acting seemed really shit. I hated the steriotypical gangster badass guy he was so cheesy and cringe. Also that woman who was with him for most of it. Unbearable and shitty acting but maybe it's just a korean thing to ""overact"" ?"
Gantz,This show was fine but nothing great.
Gantz,Such overrated show. It started strong but then became stupid because of the protagonists and some dumb plot twists.
Gantz,[removed]
Gantz,"I find it disturbing how murder has become trivialized in entertainment media, especially on netflix."
Gantz,"Pfft - never seen such wide-spread-cross-shilling for something so sub-par.  

Want your asian-gory-game-fix?  [Try this.....](https://youtu.be/OEh1fT1IH14)"
Gantz,"I didn’t understand why the policeman didn’t tell his chief where he was going. I understand the whole “lone wolf” cliche but realistically he should of told his chief what was happening. Also, there was no reason for the Asian girl to cover her mouth from the gas, at the end of the episode we see her eyes are open, but nothing comes from it. 7/10"
Gantz,[removed]
Gantz,"I ended this series it's piss of shit !! 

They can't made a series like ´´PRISON BREAK''
Or ´´LOST ´´"
Gantz,OK i'll check it out. the picture accompanying the info on this show made it look like a bunch of people standing around but Reddit seems to be losing its shit over the show so
Gantz,"The premise sounds a bit like Panic, which I enjoyed. For anyone who has seen both how do they compare?"
Gantz,So far so good…
Gantz,Was one of the VIPS lucifer? (Lucifer series)
Gantz,Outstanding series!! Season 2??
Gantz,It had a great First episode that could hook first time viewers so easily. The show as a whole is incredible.
Gantz,"Nice.

Sucks theirs no plan for a second season."
Gantz,Worth the watch anyone?
Gantz,Why so many untagged spoilers in this thread
Gantz,"I'm super glad this show is getting so much attention. But I wish that Alice in borderland got it instead of this one... I think that both shows are fantastic, but Borderland is much, much better."
Gantz,I still don't understand the motives of the old man. He's so rich and psychotic that he wants to just run these games for the hell of it?
Gantz,"Made a short little review for it :D

Squid Game review: Game of Death Extravaganza https://youtu.be/rPgbOp0NbVk"
Gantz,So we can expect Squid Game: Tournament of Champions next year?
Gantz,Squid game is just a korean version of japanesse alice in borderland.
Gantz,"Wow I haven’t seen 6/10 of the top 10. Guess I could look into Bridgerton, Lupin, Sex/Life, Money Heist, Sweet Tooth and Emily in Paris. Just finished Squid Game last night and it was a blast."
Gantz,I really thought Sex Education would be there
Gantz,Was Bridgerton that big? I haven't watched it but trailers and such made it seems like a CW type show.
Gantz,"I have never heard of Bridgerton, not even a peep. Netflix usually shoves their original series down your throat so idk why they didn’t show me Bridgerton."
Gantz,"> Bridgerton

What is this show? I've never even heard of it lol. Never even seen it on Netflix either to my recollection"
Gantz,No coco melon?
Gantz,"And here I am, who only used Netflix for the Office"
Gantz,[deleted]
Gantz,"An important note about these numbers: they counted any viewership of these titles that lasted two or more minutes. So, if you viewed just three minutes of any of these, they counted you as a viewer.  
  
I don’t know about everyone else, but if I’ve seen less than five minutes of something, I would never say that I “watched” it."
Gantz,"Which ones of these are sci/fi or fantasy?  For some reason I just can't watch 'mundane' series for long, lose interest really fast. I watched Witcher and Stranger Things."
Gantz,"Can we petition to get cocomelon off the top 10 list?  It’s been a year now, we get it that kids love that show now fuck off the top list"
Gantz,"Same, wished it ended with the train scene and it stayed as one season only and maybe do an anthology series instead"
Gantz,The airport scene specifically? I agree. At least it didn’t seem like he was trying to participate again. Maybe try and take it down?
Gantz,"Yea the ending was really garbage, the mc lost his main reason why he participated in the first place then abandoned the only reason he wanted to stay alive? Lmao, just make him go to America and have him enter the contest there (it was stated that there are more games around the world).        
Can we also talk about how he ignored that poor child and that old lady FOR 1 YEAR after getting out? Jesus Christ"
Gantz,What about the ending? I thought it fit perfectly with Gi-Hun’s character.
Gantz,[deleted]
Gantz,It’s to set up a season 2 where he will try to take it down. He has some money to play with now
Gantz,I liked the ending enough. My man’s traumatized and depressed. His actions don’t have to be rational. The old man being the host was kinda odd though; I feel like that could’ve been saved for season 2 if they really wanted to go that route and make it good. I would’ve preferred a season arc where he does a second round of games but is inexplicably treated better by the host between the games which causes other players to hate him and allows the writers to explore how the games would be from the perspective of someone who is isolated and alone without any support system to help them through the games.
Gantz,I hated the whole last episode but the first 8 were so fucking good.
Gantz,"I don’t know why Squid Game is getting so much attention, when Alice In Borderland came out recently and was SOOO much better!!!! 

Maybe it’s because people are obsessed with Korea as of late? 

But storywise and concept wise Alice in Borderland was much better. Higher highs, lower lows. And the ending was *chief’s kiss*"
Gantz,The ending was fucking pure concentrated garbage
Gantz,"I didn't like how [Spoiler](#s ""the old man turning out to be the orchestrator of the show, which felt like a bad imitator of Jigsaw. It robs a lot of emotional moments in the series related to his character. I would have preferred if they hadn't shown us who the orchestrator was, rather left it as a mystery we cannot simply comprehend."")"
Gantz,I hated listening to the Americans talk. Their dialogue was so cringy but also they had to speak their lines so slowly it made it even worse.
Gantz,"Same. I watch kdrama for the one season shows, not for sequel baiting."
Gantz,It absolutely ruined the show for me.
Gantz,Init
Gantz,"Yea. Also, when he left his suitcase to take the stairs to the other side... So annoying"
Gantz,"I don't know about you, but if a guy who had every ability and reason to kill me told me to ""just get on the plane"", the last thing I'd do is get on the plane."
Future Diary,"""What if a reality show was fully scripted""

So The Joe Schmo Show. Or all ""reality"" (voyeur) shows."
Future Diary,I’ll check it out thanks. I really liked Love is Blind Japan (and follow them on Instagram to my embarrassment)
Future Diary,"Binge watched season 1. I'm afraid it relies mostly on meanness to the two relatively conforming, docile participants for drama, although there are romantic bits. It also functions as  travel guide to Japan. Definitely unlikely to work in U.S. because the couple are asked to deliberately sabotage their relationship at points -- which would likely result in walkoffs here. It would be interesting to see the audition process and whether participants are paid."
Future Diary,"fully scripted is like, every reality ever"
Future Diary,It's got that same sweet understated tone.
Future Diary,It relies so much on the leads being docile and shy.  Americans would be making out halfway through the first episode.
Future Diary,They basically dumped the 2nd season since they released to binge instead of a weekly release like the other shows…. And it’s a CBS production so no suprime at all
Future Diary,"Awww, we didn’t really get anywhere with the brother."
Future Diary,"Makes sense since they ddumped the second season, but from what I saw it took the most risks of the D+ originals. It was originally developed for the CW, and you don't see middle school shows show training bras and periods and stuff. Plus the brother possibly (?) being gay."
Future Diary,"It's not surprising but I think it was a pretty good show actually. I'm not the target audience, but I enjoyed it for what it was. The A storyline with Elena as a middle schooler was pretty generic but the other stuff was good. The brother coming to terms with being gay and having feelings for a friend, and then Sam becoming a step dad and all those challenges."
Future Diary,"Aww, I really enjoyed the brother and Sam becoming a step dad!"
Future Diary,I’m sure all the 10 people who watched this are heartbroken
Future Diary,This is so sad
Future Diary,This sounds like Parks and Rec.
Future Diary,"Yay! In terms of tween/teen programming on Disney+, I thought this one was much better than HSMTMTS."
Future Diary,More Sam is always a plus
Future Diary,So this is essentially the same premise as Jack & Bobby?
Future Diary,So is this essentially the same premise as Netflix's The Politician?
Future Diary,"Jack and Bobby was a great show, shame it was cancelled.  

Though one of the problems with making a show about the future is that you set early things in stone that end up not working with the way things evolve.  The pilot showed one of the brothers became president, but the show showed us the other brother should have been.  The ending even acknowledged it."
Future Diary,I was just going to write that.
Future Diary,Having to predict future wars is the problem. Future is so unpredictable.
Future Diary,"So, I guess their goal today was to take everyone who said D+ had no original content besides The Mandalorian, and pretty much punch them in the face repeatedly."
Future Diary,Hooch is crazy
Future Diary,"Every official announcement/trailer.

Future Diary,I thought this was wallstreebets DD for a second lol
Future Diary,"Nothing on any of the ""old"" Netflix series has me sad...  Nice write up, though."
Future Diary,/u/arashtp you missed Percy Jackson.
Future Diary,Super stoked on most of this. I’m especially looking forward to the Nat geo content. Can you imagine if Disney+ dropped with half of these titles? Game changer
Future Diary,"Based on the release timelines of those shows, it looks like their strategy is: 

Zeitgeist show for 6 weeks -> 1 week of cool down —> couple weeks of hype up -> next Zeitgeist show -> Repeat"
Future Diary,They're really going all out with the High Republic.
Future Diary,did She Hulk get a trailer or anything?
Future Diary,that's a lot of content
Future Diary,"So strange to realize Ice Age is owned by Disney now. 

Also I’m sort of unexpectedly excited about the continuation of Mighty Ducks!"
Future Diary,A Turner and Hooch reboot yyyeeeeessss!!! I've been a fan (we call ourselves Hoochers) for years and am flipping out right now!!!!
Future Diary,Missing rogue squadron on Star Wars
Future Diary,Hocus Pocus 2. What.
Future Diary,"A lot of this is awesome, but can I just take a moment to appreciate *Sister Act 3*?"
Future Diary,">Tiana is the first princess to have her own Walt Disney Animation Studios series

Just going to ignore the Little Mermaid and Tangled series apparently."
Future Diary,[deleted]
Future Diary,I have only read a hand full of moon knight comics but from what I have heard and read making a PG moon knight show is not going to go over well with fans.
Future Diary,Any specific dates to go with this?
Future Diary,You forgot the multiple tongue in cheek references to Matt Murdock.  Charlie Cox's Daredevil is officially part of the MCU now.  Hes apparently in She Hulk and Spider-Man 3.
Future Diary,"Damn, the Ducks end up becoming what they rebelled against..."
Future Diary,"As a bi dude I'm still waiting for literally anything big that features a non-straight dude. In film they ignored it almost completely out of fear of gay-hating countries banning it and them losing money (like China). 

Really hoping for something to come through, maybe with x-men back in the fold Iceman could get something"
Future Diary,So is Ahsoka taking the place of the Rebels spinoff? Because thats what I was most excited for
Future Diary,Disney is milking Star Wars and Marvel for everything dollar they can squeeze. There are way too many reboots and remakes. They need originally sourced content that has no reliance on existing IP. How about some original NON-Marvel/Star Wars scripted content? I think the Mandalorian is a cute show but I want to see ORIGINAL content for once. This slate of shows are not enough to keep all of their subscribers satisfied.
Future Diary,I just want to have the spin off Thrawn and Ezra travels in space show.
Future Diary,"Hey, bozo, why didn't you mention It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia?

Great list, otherwise."
Future Diary,so much content that post alone made me vomit .
Future Diary,Seems like Star Wars's future is on TV.
Future Diary,Is it weird that I'm most excited for the Josh Peck version of Turner and Hooch?
Future Diary,"Looks like they're updating Microcosmos with A Real Bug's Life, that should be cool as fuck."
Future Diary,">The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers

>Lauren Graham (Gilmore Girls, Parenthood) and Emilio Estevez (reprising his role from the original feature films) star in the next chapter of the hit Mighty Ducks franchise, premiering in early 2021. In present day Minnesota, the Mighty Ducks have evolved from scrappy underdogs to an ultra-competitive, powerhouse youth hockey team. After 12-year-old Evan is unceremoniously cut from the Ducks, he and his mom Alex set out to build their own ragtag team of misfits to challenge the cutthroat, win-at-all-costs culture of competitive youth sports.

I hope Disney has been paying attn to Cobra Kai and takes all the good from it and applies it to the Ducks!!!"
Future Diary,"Man, Tony Stark cannot keep control of his tech, can he? Well, I guess he's dead, so that makes sense."
Future Diary,The one thing I want from Marvel is an OG Nick Fury and the Howling Commandos show.
Future Diary,They forgot Shadow Hunters.
Future Diary,Disney+ launch was more like beta test to ensure their decision of allocating such resources to the platform
Future Diary,"The criticism was regarding lack of original screenplays, too. It's still true in that aspect."
Future Diary,"It's still lacks diversity, it's still marvel, star wars and Pixar animated pg-13 movies, still no new new IPs."
Future Diary,[deleted]
Future Diary,"If they don't have Phill Lewis playing the dog using mocap, they dun goofed."
Future Diary,*holds up lighter*
Future Diary,Thanks man you're awesome
Future Diary,[Rogue squadron](https://youtu.be/5bLkTjn6Y_s)
Future Diary,Not enough 🚀🚀🚀
Future Diary,"Just hints at Daredevil, from Sony in Spider-Man 3 and at the reveal here today for She-Hulk."
Future Diary,"Yeah sounds like the Multiverse in SM3 will pull in Daredevil and Kingpin. Which could be great.

Daredevil was hinted at strongly for SheHulk, and there have been rumors that DNofrio has campaigned hard and they’ve taken him seriously as maybe using his character to put together the Sinister Six."
Future Diary,"There's a big hint in Hawkeye. Maya Lopez is a definitively Daredevil character (Echo, a deaf woman who can see something once and imitate it originally hired by Kingpin to take out Daredevil and eventually befriending him). She also wore the Ronin outfit for awhile that Hawkeye wore in Endgame after his family vanished (New Avengers comics).

Edit: why am I being downvoted for this?"
Future Diary,And Swiss Family Robinson.
Future Diary,It’s pretty genius
Future Diary,Super into the Acolyte as I’d really like to see what the Sith/dark side users were up to during this time period
Future Diary,"No, but they confirmed Tatiana Maslany."
Future Diary,Tim Roth will be back as Abomination and Mark Ruffalo.
Future Diary,Its a rather deceptive line if your not in the know.  WDAS is the movie studio. Disney Television Animation is the studio that typically handles the TV side (they were the ones that made the Tangled series).
Future Diary,That's not necessarily a bad thing tbh. It's how they execute it that matters. GOTG was kinda considered a bottom of the barrel IP for marvel before they made it and it turned out well.
Future Diary,"There’s like 70 announced shows here and less than 10 are actual original ideas. Really disappointing *in my opinion*.

I get people like Star Wars and stuff, but it seems extreme to me."
Future Diary,"I think it could be done. For me at least the fun part is the mind-bendy unreliable narrator stuff and not the graphic violence. Although there is something to be said for when other characters meet Moon Knight and are like, ""oh this guy is *crazy* crazy and not just *Batman* crazy."""
Future Diary,"This didn’t mention any of the Marvel movies since it’s still not certain whether they’ll be released in theaters first or on Disney+ at the same time, but The Eternals is set to have their first openly gay main character whenever that’s released.

If you haven’t watched the Disney+ short film Out, you absolutely should."
Future Diary,"Young Avengers is just over the horizon, and that comes with the most prominent gay couple in marvel. Still a few years out though."
Future Diary,Not sure if it is 100% confirmed but I remember seeing somewhere that Valkyrie is looking for a wife in the next Thor movie.
Future Diary,"As a fellow homo, I'm sorry you're getting downvoted, but that's r/television for you. I've learned not to bring up representation issues on this sub anymore."
Future Diary,"I would bet it will be in a team, or they will reveal the character is gay in a sequel...that way people in China will already be invested.  Because you’re right....they want that China money badly. 


Wouldn’t it be a kick in the nuts to China if the wait until like Shang Chi 3 and reveal he was gay the whole time! Lmao. That could literally start a war!!"
Future Diary,"I feel like this'll be a big part of the Ashoka show, considering that she was still searching when we see her in The Mandolorian."
Future Diary,Thats not on Disney+ you 1 star fool.
Future Diary,That’s pathetic
Future Diary,I really don't like the sound of this. The whole point of the Ducks is that they are scrappy underdogs. Having them become what they played against feels kind of weird. And it's obviously gonna end with both Ducks teams playing against each other. It just sounds weird to me.
Future Diary,"They're going all in because they've lost all profits from Disney parks and tourism, 75% of their revenue.

Also why they gutted ESPN"
Future Diary,"Certainly, but was anyone really expecting that? Aside from Pixar, Disney hasn't done an original story in... I'm not sure. Possibly ever."
Future Diary,Pixar films are all new IPs lol
Future Diary,[deleted]
Future Diary,One Star Wars IP will drive more total interest than anything on HBO Max lmao
Future Diary,"Uh ""Win or Lose"" is a new IP."
Future Diary,"You are soo right. Marvel has been overdone, it's a stale medium at this point.  SW feels the same after the last 3 movies. Even Mando is aimless with no real main plotline.

It's so formulaic it isn't appealing.

Will smith movie,
Cars tv show, 
SW, SW, SW, SW, SW
Marvel movies or shows of all side movie characters, because why not saturate the market with bland superheros"
Future Diary,"Yeah. Did anyone really expect Disney to do something genuinely new? Aside from Pixar, which still has very niche content, I can't remember the last time Disney did an actually new story. 

It's one of the reasons this obsession people on here have with D+ ""killing"" Netflix is so silly."
Future Diary,Well original content in this context means content that is developed specificity for the platform and is owned by Disney
Future Diary,"
>Daredevil was hinted at strongly for SheHulk...

That doesn't excite me...  I don't see Daredevil remaining dark and gritty if placed in She-Hulk.  SH over the years has been more of a fun loving character."
Future Diary,"It's going to be interesting to see how Tim Roth plays his take on Mark Ruffalo.

Future Diary,"It's a Disney property.

They a announced it today, as well.

It actually appears on traditional broadcast television, anyone who can't see this **IS A SAVAGE AND AN IDIOT**.

Stoked about almost all of these, though."
Future Diary,Most of these projects are planned before the COVID
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"Friends was a big hit. Later, The Office was a big hit."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"Taxi, Cheers, MASH, Murphy Brown, Alice, Welcome Back Kotter, Night Court.

The workplace sitcom has been a staple for decades."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"There is just far far less community now and sitcoms tend to reflect situations that are relatable to people. 

The sad fact is since the 80s the copper wire has been stripped out of the walls with regular people having to do more to keep the dysfunctional economy going. More people will be able to relate to workplace situations than having a group of friends at this point.

Hell look at the front page of reddit where there normally is a thread on how to make friends as an adult. We're just a desocialised society"
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"The dominant sitcom up to about five years ago was The Big Bang Theory, which was a Friends knockoff. There was also How I Met Your Mother, which copied a lot from Friends. The dominant single camera show was Modern Family, which was certainly on the ""hanging  out"" tree. And then there's Curb, where all Larry does is wander around."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"Interesting that you mentioned Brooklyn 99 since it always felt like an updated version of Barney Miller to me. I think its more of a cyclical thing. The work place sitcom is not a new thing, there's been things like Cheers, Mary Tyler Moore, Mash, Sports Night, News Radio, Taxi, Night Court, Murphy Brown etc there may be more of a concentration of them now. I have to admit i don't really keep up with modern comedies so i can't say for sure"
I Do Not Have Many Friends,Not even entirely joking here: people have less friends today. Most of their relationships outside of family now are workplace related.
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"There are broadly three types of sitcom. Family, friends and workplace. Every few years one those types gets into fashion usually pushed by a big hit."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"No I think the opposite is true.  Before Seinfeld, I can't think of any sitcom that was just friends hanging out.  As far as popular older shows like that, just that and Friends and the Friends clones like Caroline in the City, Two Guys and a Girl etc.  Pretty much every old sitcom was work or family based."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,bc all we do is work nowadays (when not busy side hustling)
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"Grand Crew is a sitcom about a group of friends.  Very much Friends except none of the Friends are white and they hang out in a wine bar instead of a coffee shop.  It's really good.

Ghosts is about a group of friends, they're just mostly dead."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,This thread is you bring outed by your selective viewing choices
I Do Not Have Many Friends,How do you count cheers?
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"I don't know, but sitcoms moved from ""just hanging"" to a more aggressive approach to comedy in the mid to late '90s - Seinfeld, Frasier, Friends. Shows naturally sped up as they went along even if they only briefly touched this period -- like Cheers. Arrested Development was one of the first to truly capitalise on this by moving at a quick clip, jam-packed with self-referential stuff. I far preferred the lazier early seasons of sitcoms pre-mid/late '90s."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"""Sitcoms about friends hanging out"" died in the 2010s because any show like that other than New Girl wasn't able to rake in multiple millions of viewers consistently. Pretty much all the big 
ones that premiered after New Girl failed. So Hollywood got scared out of making them. They'll come back eventually."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"New girl is just friends hanging out. It's from 2011.

Big bang theory, how I met your father, that 90s show, fresh of the boat, derry girls."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"Car 54 where are you

Gomer Pyle usmc

Mary Tyler Moore Show

and the nineties were full of them:

John Larroquette Show

many others"
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"I'd also argue it's the exact opposite. It's so much easier to meet people now than anytime in the past. Before you had people you went to school with, people you lived next to you, friends of the family, or colleagues. You had to be close to get to know people and keep in contact. Now people can have much more diverse friend groups through hobbies, by meeting online, have long distance friendships through texting or FaceTiming. Its easier to have a lot more acquaintances and keep in casual contact through social media than a handful of constant companions. You can fade in and out of people's lives and still keep track of them without spending all that time face to face. And if you don't like them, there are always hundreds, thousands, millions more people at your digital fingertips ready to meet and socialize with... like here on reddit, discord, etc. Before people kept hanging out with crappy friends that caused conflict because getting new ones was hard, and a shared history was enough to hold the group together. Now people have more discerning standards and a workplace is a much more convenient place to have chaos through forced proximity, which suits a sitcom situation. 

So many comedies back in the day were about toxic families that stayed together..... because??? That's just what they did, even when they were miserable. That was the whole joke of the show. Nowadays that dynamic would be considered borderline emotional and verbal abuse. Same with a lot of the shows with friend groups. They're practically bullies who constantly insult and undermine each other, or act as sponges who use each other.

In a workplace you're under no obligation to like each other and can have zero in common with those around you. Dynamics that wouldn't be tolerated in most friend groups. But because the characters work together they're forced to bear it and at least act polite, hence creating the situation for comedy."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"It's got to be cyclical.  How many places have you got a group of people who are routinely together?  Work, family or friends.  And if they are friends, it's a little easier if some of them are roommates.

*Seinfeld* stands out because it's a friends show, without them being roommates."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"WKRP, Wings. Before these, the military shows were also ""workplace"" shows."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,">Barney Miller

Yeah, I think they were directly inspired from that. At least I kinda remember that from the BTS of B99 video on youtube."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"How dare you forget about the Pizza Place. That's like talking about Zoe and forgetting about Duncan, Jack and Jane"
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"Golden Girls

Laverne and Shirley

Perfect Strangers"
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"Cheers was seen as a workplace show, following on Taxi."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,free association doesnt make community
I Do Not Have Many Friends,I think it's like the internet. Just because you have all this access and connection at your fingertips doesn't mean everyone is getting closer together. Quite the contrary in fact.
I Do Not Have Many Friends,I hadn't thought about that but it is different.
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"I didn't watch much of Wings, it may have played against something else. I remember watching WKRP with my dad as a kid. Both great shows."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"Sure but it's also how you use the internet. Introverted, shy, or awkward people were always going to have a hard time forming relationships, and shallow self centred people would have a hard time keeping them. But I've amassed friends in dozens of countries with relationships the have lasted more than a decade because we could keep in touch online. People that I met for a week when travelling have become lifelong friends because I can keep up to date with them, see photos of their lives, chat or message them multiple times a week on social media. Before that a couple random long distance calls or post cards would have never been possible to keep up that kind of connection. Through the pandemic I made more friends than ever on random discord servers for various creators and hobbies. I saw people fall in love and move across the country to be with the partners they met there, who they spent months talking to each other daily, or sharing late night watch parties, posting pics of their meals, sharing stories of their hardship, venting about work etc. I built connections with people who shared my interests and random obsessions. People that I never would have met before. Or never could have kept in contact with had we been relying on old school telephone calls or letters. These are all friends I could message day or night and who would be there for me whenever I needed. We've had multiple meetups irl, in multiple countries. Getting together to go to events or just so we could all hang out for real. 

People who feel a lack of connection 'because of the internet' were never going to put in the work to get to know or care about other people. They would only hang around people who were convenient and in close proximity. Which is exactly what I said in my last post. The internet is full of opportunities, but not everyone wants to take advantage of them. And that's their loss."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"Because the streaming services are rapidly becoming the primary vehicle for TV shows, and the later you get onboard the harder you're going to have to work to stand out. If they don't get a streaming channel going, they're at serious risk of becoming solely a production studio, and that has much more limited profit potential."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"Streaming is the future, the longer they wait, the harder it is to survive a fierce competition.

So they believe the current losses will be worth it. Will they actually be tho? Time will tell.  One of these streamers is in for a rude awakening."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"Because the way NBCUniversal, Disney, Paramount and Warner Bros Discovery (and the companies that these were formed from) have traditionally made a lot of money is affiliate fees and advertising from the paid TV bundle. 

Go back just 10 years ago and 100 million people had pay TV in the USA.  That's 100 million people paying at least $5+ dollars a month each to each of the cable channel owners before you add broadcast and regional sports channels.

With cable cutting even just 1 million people leaving is $60 million a year and we have seen paid TV subscribers drop by over 25 million and its accelerating.

That's a huge amount of revenue going away so the media companies started their own streaming services to replace that revenue but because they don't have the safety of the bundle and are instead competing they are spending vastly higher amounts on content for far less subscribers.

Disney+ is one of the most successful and it only has 46.6 million subscribers across the USA and Canada and Disney has to pay to deliver that content to each subscriber and has a much larger breadth of content on Disney+ than it ever did on any of its cable channels.

While with paid TV Disney would get $1.60 for the Disney Channel and $3-4 for ABC and another dollar for Freeform, Disney XD and Disney Junior from 100 million US customers plus advertising that's not including the goldmine of ESPN back in the day."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"When Netflix was practically the only game in town, these studios made money by licensing content to Netflix. A lot of them thought this was a raw deal to them (eg. Netflix was making way more money than what it cost for licensing), so they had the ""bright"" idea to make their own streaming service. The thought was to kill Netflix because the size of their own original content was much smaller.

They didn't realize that streaming is actually hard and costs a lot of money to maintain. In fact, the proper business decision should have been to raise the licensing price on Netflix. Now you have multiple studios (eg. Paramount, Discovery, etc) looking at multiple billons in losses with no clear path to profitability. You had middle managers who had incentives to juice subscriber numbers but not actually make any money. For 3rd tier streamers like Paramount+ with a tiny streaming audience and no real growth plan, they could have actually MADE money through licensing instead of pouring $1.5B down the drain.

Within a few years, many of these services are going to merge, and some will revert back to licensing to Netflix."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,">It's incredibly clear these newer streaming services are not profitable, and won't be in the near future.

compared to the traditional ""over the air"" model.. what *should* they do?

&#x200B;

continue to depend on the majority of television viewers to stop what they're doing and turn on the TV at 8 and suffer through ads so they can ""catch the latest episode""?

&#x200B;

> Isn't it easy money for them to just license their content to the big ones like Netflix, Hulu etc?

Ted Danson  
The show: “Cheers”  
How much he makes: $5 million per year"
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"The way I see it is some of these companies are trying to play catch-up and adapt to streaming content. 
They initially offered their streaming platforms for free, and while it was a huge incentive for people to start using it, it's not sustainable in the long run, so they had to start a paid subscription service. How many people quit watching those platforms that had previously been free?
On top of that, they are also dumping tons of money into creating new content, but the new content actually sucks and/or no one is watching it due to the subscription cost."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"Studios saw that Netflix started off small but were growing at a huge rate and they wanted to cut the middleman. But by the time they got their stuff up and running, netflix kinda hit a wall that suggests they might’ve peaked. 

Now they’re trying to figure out how to right the ship since they may never see the profitability they were promised. 

Netflix is raising prices, clamping down on account sharing, HBO is taking some of their old stuff and putting them on other platforms so they can get some short term money, canceling projects that will never be profitable, others are setting themselves up to sell to anyone interested and other such desperate measures. 

And in exchange for all of that, streaming also killed the DVD/blu ray market and hurt theatrical releases!"
I Do Not Have Many Friends,I wonder who will still be around after the shakeouts
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"1. Because the ones who want to be a streaming are already in the business of distributing content and they are adapting to the changing times of adapting the internet and the model that people prefer. For them to not have a streaming service means their multi billion dollar tv businesses would soon be multi million dollar businesses that they hope the streaming players choose to buy their stuff who also have an interest in being vertically integrated e.g. WBD or Netflix saves more money making content internally then paying UNIVERSAL TV or MTV Studios. Not that they won’t but they will prefer to. Why does Walmart want to compete with amazon when they could just sell their Great Value brand on Amazon? Because they don’t want to go from a big distributor who makes their own products to som one who just makes products.

2. Not being profitable at first is the expectation from these companies. Everybody who launched a streaming service told investors that they don’t expect to be profitable for N years until they get an expected XYZ. Most streamers are beating their streaming targets in subscribers the only thing that’s changed are macroeconomic factors. Factors such as inflation, lower spending, higher interest rates and so people are tightening the belt because it hurts more to build debt today than it did a year or two ago.

3. Most businesses in general do not make a profit in their first couple of years. These businesses were started during a time where losing money for hyper growth was normal and “encouraged”. There’s a bunch of multi billion dollar companies that exist today that never reported a profit. The industry/market is relatively new still and so people are just being competitive. These loses can likely be curbed if they grew slowly but growing too slowly is not competitive. Netflix been profitable for 20 years. But they were lucky to have 10 years of low competition to build up the crazy spending."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,That sounds like a question and the people running these studios don't like those.
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"Because it might work.

The danger of relying on say a Netflix deal without a back up plan, is that if Netflix opts out, the network/studio has nothing.

We will probably see consolidation in the future and only a few services will survive, but obviously every company hopes that they will be among the survivors.

NBC made a massive mistake by not entering the streaming market early, but that's another story.

It's easy to forget, but originally people assumed that people would only pay for movies and something like HBO."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"You are supposed to lose money in the beginning when you invest in a new business, for at least a few years, before breaking even. That's why some people get rich and some don't, because some are willing to take risks and some don't."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,Because they dont need to be profitable. They just need to outlast the other streaming services. If they can do that then they can gobble up all the other services content and then eventually wind up profitable when they are the only streaming option
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"Studios are merely one division of massive multinational corporations now. Companies that large rarely care about short term profit/loss. This is about controlling their intellectual property, and realizing that over the air and cable are going to die off relatively soon. Streaming will become the go to, and controlling their back catalogue will be crucial."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"That’s the cost of starting a new business.

It cost Netflix and Prime a ton of money too and despite the sink cost going into it, they are extremely popular and are a benefit to consumers over some monolithic service that, while paying the studios big money, would also charge consumers that difference.

It’ll all balance out although removing catalogue is not the way to do it."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"Greedy self-involved assholes fearing they'll lose out on ""their share."" Capitalism ruins everything eventually."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"Lose $2 billion a year, every year.

Yeah, but think of the profit potential!"
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"There is always going to be a huge risk with streaming services. Spend a hundred million on a new movie, see no significant growth in subscribers? well lets try again. Or, hey lets stop making new movies if they aren't making us any money. What's that we lost 5% of our subscribers. The model as it is cannot last, at least not if they continue putting so much into one project. Bring back mid budget cinema, less financial risk and more opportunity."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"What they should do is unite against Netflix and the tech companies. Paramount, Warner, NBC, Disney should all get together

Oh wait that was Hulu."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,I think they will all just go to Hulu.
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"Is it even legal for them to merge? Given monopolisation laws, Studios were forced to divest from cinemas once they effectively merged together to control them back in the 50's i think it was. could go the same way for streaming services. You'll have one major service that licences 90% of it's content like old school netflix. This whole thing is a giant fire pit that will ultimately result in a fuck ton of lost money and no change."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"Some combination of Disney+ and Hulu, and Amazon Prime. HBO is too busy being destroyed by the Discovery execs, Netflix is too busy speedrunning their own self destruction, Paramount doesn’t have anything other than Star Trek and reality reruns. Apple TV+ may stick around or just team up with someone."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"It’s a streaming war and battle of attrition.  

winner takes all."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"Rich people have literally nothing worth buying so they spend massive amounts of money on gambles hoping for a jackpot so they can ""win"" more bragging rights. 

I wish they'd get back into building pyramids or something."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"Alright do you want to pay 70 dollars a month for that service now? That was Hulu in 2008 when streaming was an afterthought and linear television was still growing and revenues were enormous. 

So either get a time machine and go back or understand what you’re talking about."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,Paramount plus has 77 million subscribers now. I don't know man
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"Everywhere but America, Hulu is just part of D+ already. Some shows are stuck elsewhere due to legacy contracts but all their news stuff goes straight on there."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"They're losing billions paying thousands of people to make art, and you want them to switch to building giant ugly useless tombs?"
I Do Not Have Many Friends,This is so stupid.
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"This is always what bothers me when people on here cheer for the collapse of various streamers and want everything on one service. 

The end result from that is either significantly less content or a much higher monthly fee. Most likely, it’s a combination of both.

This is what the A La carte services we were asking for looks like."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,They ran some completely insane lock in a 50% off price deal for life of the subscription in October to get that subscriber count boost. Even with that they’re still on track to lose like $2B
I Do Not Have Many Friends,People are anti-monopoly when they think about how Disney exerts control over movie theatres but completely forget about that and advocate for Netflix to have a monopoly when it comes to streaming.
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"It's always funny when I see ""the government must do something!"" when the topic of too many streaming services comes up. A pro monopoly commission? Mandatory mergers in a Pro-trust lawsuit?"

I Do Not Have Many Friends,"The basic idea with a long-running television series is that you will have one episode in pre-production, while another episode is filming, and a third episode is in post-production. Having a different director on each episode means you can have progress being made on three episodes at a time, as opposed to just one.

The basic idea with this is that you want directors who are going to be relatively safe and keeping to the same general style, but that it allows for a more streamlined production."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"TV directing is a little more just about the pure technical production than film directing, where the director has more or less all the control over the whole product.

In TV the showrunner is the person closest to the film director, and then a rotating staff of directors handle the nitty-gritty of on-set production."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"You’ll hear TV referred to a a writers medium for this reason. The Directors execute the showrunners (head writer/ep) vision, but the production process is generally too long for the same Director to work on back-to-back episodes."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,Just how tv is. It’s exhausting I’d imagine to direct so many episodes. A movie can be 2-3 hours. That’s way less run time. The show runner is kind of more of the overall director of the show anyway.
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"TV shows have a lot of content to get in a relatively short period of time and directing is an incredibly involved and exhausting job. The easiest way to accomplish this is to have multiple directors divide and conquer. Each director gets assigned an episode or two that they focus on for the season. The show runner will guide the directors in pre-production and often be on set to ensure the continuity of the look and feel of the show. TV directing is a somewhat different skill than directing features from that perspective. 

A similar arrangement is often made with the Director of Photography, but it's also common to see one Cinematographer on the whole show which also helps to create consistency in the look of the show. 

In my personal experience I've worked on shows that had multiple directors and multiple cinematographers. They would usual be paired up for their episodes. Often in these situations they had consistent camera operators across all of the episodes that ensured the visual language of the production was being maintained from a framing standpoint."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,Mostly logistics. Directors need more time for pre-and post shooting work and oversight. In a long form series with multiple episodes that has a faster turn around than a full length film it’s easier to split up the work.
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"Usually (though not always) the director is the main decision maker and planner, so their time scale of involvement is from the first day to the last day of the project.  Most other roles have a lot less time commitment.  

Having multiple directors lets 6, 8, 10 or more episodes be created in a given timeframe.  Director A can be actively shooting while director B can be in pre-prod and director C can be in post-prod.  And all kinds of permutations in between.  In planning terms we'd say the director is critical path.  

Sometimes people think the actors would be, but they're less involved for pre and post prod, so they can jump from director C's shoot straight to director A's and then to director B's.  Often it's not even that linear and there can be periods that overlap.

tl;dr: Directors are critical path, and using multiple directors allow a whole season to be shot without taking multiple years."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"""Random people"" eventually are big names you know. Look at Community or Arrested Development. Lots of episodes directed by the Russo Brothers who went on to do Avengers Infinity War & Endgame."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"So that the show can get made in a quick and timeline manner. If one person was doing everything, it would take forever."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"Most shows change directors every couple of episodes.  Film is a directors medium, television is a producers medium.  The person in charge is the showrunner."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"Traditionally, the speed with which TV episodes were produced was much faster than films. One person directing every episode of a weekly release, 22 episode series, would burn out instantly. Films have a much longer window to shoot compared to shows. These lines are blurring now with the death of network tv and the dominance of streaming, but this is the traditional reason."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"A rare example of a show having only one director is season one of True Detective with Cary Joji Fukunaga. You could really see the results, every episode is perfect. I’m surprised it hasn’t been done more after that success."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,Directing is a stressful job. I can’t even imagine having to be a director for an entire season. Give the reigns to someone else for a few episodes for the sake of my own mental health.
I Do Not Have Many Friends,Come back when you figure out why British actors only hang for like six or seven hours-run-time.
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"I'm assuming the rolling production is the main reason for this, as people have said. I think another part is also that a lot of television shows allow cast and crew members to direct episodes so they can get a director credit, which allows them to pursue other directing work through the union. This is why you often see that star actors in shows have also directed the odd episode. I might be talking complete bollocks, but I think this is a thing, if anyone in the know can confirm?"
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"I noticed this and my first thought was ""Is one in ten people in the world a director""?"
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"As mentioned, directors can work three weeks on a one-week show.  Creatively, directors on TV have limited input; they are hired hands (not true on every show, but most).

The best way to think about it is a quote from a biography I read: ""Television is a producer's medium; film is a director's medium.""  In television it is the producers who have the most creative control."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"Television used to be controlled by writers (I know, it's blasphemy 😤 but sometimes scripts matter). Unless directors were well known, they weren't considered as important as writers like they were in film where the writer doesn't matter once they get their hands on the script.

That changed with premium cable and HBO with things like The Knick and now Severance (on Apple) where there is a pretty good balance, but this is mostly due to writers wanting good directors I believe personally."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"The showrunner is the one in charge and sets the tone of the show. A director can come in and give a little bit of their own style, but not really stry to far from the tone the showrunner sets."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"So in reading all these answers I have a better understanding of the WHY... I feel like knowing this now, it almost takes away from the importance of the Director or the idea that the director is responsible for the vibe and end product that the viewers receive. I get that for a movie the director is everything in that they direct the entire product whereas with TV that's not the case.


I will say that Mike White from White Lotus writes and directs every single episode...and it's overwhelmingly obvious  in my opinion.


 Cary Joji Fukunaga also wrote and directed every episode of the first season of True Detective ."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"BB, BCS, and Ozark popularized this trend. Even some of the cast gets to try their hand at it. I'm genuinely surprised that there isn't more dysfunction and disconnect in the quality and cinematography from one episode to another."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"You might come to be surprised to learn that even the greatest artist of the Renaissance era didn’t create all their works. They guided the workers through the process that’s all. 

Makes it happen faster. 

Edit: referring to sculptors

I Do Not Have Many Friends,"Me being a tad cynical, I'd suggest the shows actors get paid extra if they're the director."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,It’s usually someone involved with the show at least right - so there’s some continuity
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"I've always thought it was strange that episodes would have different writers, meaning that the characters would feel slightly different (or drastically different) and with a different voice from episode to episode."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,Ya! And how is it almost always Bryan Cranston
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"Some shows' creators are more continually hands on - you won't have this particular complaint about any of Lindelof's shows, the Sopranos, the Wire, etc. Those are created in a similar vein to films where one director oversees pretty much everything, or enough of everything that you could call him/her the 'director' of said show if you wanted to. 

It just depends on the kinds of shows you watch. If you watch more episodic stuff or dime-a-dozen 20+ eps per season types of serialized shows whose main focus is on trying to get renewed, you'll have this issue frequently. Because they *do* often have different people direct and oversee episodes. But if you're watching shows that're more compact and/or have a clear singular vision, you'll be less irritated by this. Miniseries especially."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"I believe the director of the pilot usually sets the style for the series.

Also How I Met you mother is the rare show, where almost all episode are directed by the same person, Pamela Fryman."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"because guest directors get paid more than guys with year long contracts. same as actors. 

Heather Locklears agent was very smart. She got her credited as a guest star in every single episode of Melrose Place. She gets paid double what a regular would. And she can leave on a weeks notice if she wants out."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"I feel it’s a way to break in directors. If they pull off some good episodes they can later be trusted with a bigger budget movie or be a show runner.

No film festival or school really trains for show running or big budget movies"
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"Maybe because a long running TV show is like a daily job for the members. So someday someone is ill or busy with something else, another person takes charge. Kind of like when someone in our offices goes on a leave"
I Do Not Have Many Friends,If this is a concern for anyone I suggest the British TV series “SPACED”. Every episode is directed by Edgar Wright.
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"If you direct any episode you can join the Directors Union. In the US it is the Directors Guild of America.   That is why many ""Star Trek of any type had different directors (except Harry Kim for some reason)

It levels up your resume."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,Filming schedules.
I Do Not Have Many Friends,I work in film and I've seen productions that will shoot multiple episodes concurrently. Meaning that they'll be shooting episodes 3 and 4 and then the crew on episode 3 will move on to 5 and then 4 goes to 6 and so on. Not to mention that if you have a stunt heavy seqjence or an extended sequence with a whole seoerate group of actors you may want to bring in an additional unit with even more people.  It can be very easy for a film crew to balloon in size and need a bunch of directors concurrently if the producers and accountants agree this makes more financial sense.
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"Yep it's a logistics play.  The director is the manager of the episode and they need to be involved in all stages, so on a weekly drama they have a particular schedule to keep.  Everyone has their jobs but the manager has to rotate out."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"Fascinating, but I imagine this is less efficient when one of the cast member gets to direct an episode: Jason Bateman on Ozark."
I Do Not Have Many Friends,"This. But not just a long-running show, this is basically any show."
Strike the Blood,">The writers gave up on their ""anthology"" idea

I would include ""showrunners"" in this sentence, but I think this is what sunk Heroes more than anything. They saw how fans got attached to S1 characters, and decided they needed to keep all the fan favorites. And that meant not doing the anthology idea. Bad move."
Strike the Blood,The only think the Writers Strike probably did was keep Peter's Irish love interest stuck in an erased alternate fascist future.  And then Peter basically never mentions her again.  Which felt like.... a weird choice.
Strike the Blood,"The *idea* of Heroes was fantastic, it just didn't work to stretch over a 22-24 episode season and especially not multiple seasons.

Also, Breaking Bad is that old?"
Strike the Blood,"You're right. The writers managed to hold things together for the better part of the first season but the problems were there. 

The plotting makes it very transparent that they're moving characters around like chess pieces. Character motivations will turn on a dime and not make any real sense. They'll forget they have the ability to do something when it's convenient for the plot."
Strike the Blood,"The S1 ending was ruined by the network's last minute insistence that there be another season with same characters.  They weren't all supposed to survive.  S2 was going to follow an entirely different set of characters.   As a result, they had the S1 characters become too powerful too quickly, something they had to figure out how to undo in later seasons. 

Arguably, this is to blame as much as the writer's strike."
Strike the Blood,"It all goes back to the decision making about what season 2 would be.  A few characters like Claire could easily continue for multiple seasons.  But it was just so obvious that many of them wouldn't work for long run.  The whole season 1 plot was stopping Sylar.  Then in season 2 he's back but no one really knows what to do with him so he meanders around looking for a purpose.  Ditto Hiro and Peter, two characters so completely overpowered the writers had to tie themselves in knots to keep them from being a deus ex machina every episode.  Hiro could have worked as a recurring character the way future Hiro was depicted in that one season 1 episode - just dropping in a couple times a season trying to fix something, but mostly failing to take all the variables into account.  Instead, it was just ""lets find lots of ways to temporarily depower him and keep him removed from the main plot but still on the show.  They even felt the need to bring Nikki back.

It's hard to blame it all on the writers as it seems pretty clear the network mandated that everyone return, but even then, that doesn't explain why the reboot season was so weak.  Every time there's a reddit post about what show declined the most in quality from beginning to end, Heroes tops the comment section (usually followed closely by Sliders, which kind of had the opposite problem in that it kept jettisoning cast members)."
Strike the Blood,Heroes had no story after the origin.  And they committed the cardinal sin of making heroes too powerful without weakness.
Strike the Blood,"I think the issue is that many people don't understand that scripted production stopped during the writers strike, believing establiahed tv writers were simply replaced with randos. (And season 2 of Heroes is bad enough that it kinda supports that.)"
Strike the Blood,This is why ‘Lost’ has no reason to be as good as it was. Creating 24 episode seasons for a mythology series is almost impossible for a writers room.
Strike the Blood,"They lost Bryan Fuller, who has a proven record of being fired and that ruining a show."
Strike the Blood,"All the evidence you need is Heroes: Reborn

NBC gave him another chance with no real creative restrictions, and it’s even worse than the original was during the strike."
Strike the Blood,"I am actually 50/50 on this. I do think it got worse by writers strike, but it was never going to be any great show either. 

I kind of see this more of a case like Prison Break, where it was meant to be 1 season. Then the show got super popular and they just ran with ""whatever"". Which would also apply to the messier final episodes of season 1. They needed to quickly map themselves to s2 with some kind of cliffhanger bullshit. Prison Breaks mediocre seasons were just more fun than Heroes though. 


But yeah, I did not ever think this would become some great show after watching s1. I thought it would be enjoyable adventure, with some interesting characters. But it wasn't even that."
Strike the Blood,"100%.  The writers made the conscious choice to change the ending of 'Part Two' due to the strike so that part three was a fresh start rather than the second half of the virus storyline.  But that change was as much due to the poor reception of season two as a whole as anything-- if it was worth sticking with that story there was nothing stopping them from doing so.

The show was already bad by the time the writers strike happened.  The show was fundamentally flawed to begin with-- they created interesting and popular characters with powerful abilities that they did not have enough money to use to their potential on-screen, forcing them to rely heavily on copouts.  This was evident by the time the season 1 finale came around, and wasn't something they could fix without harming the show."
Strike the Blood,"Honestly I think you give season 1 too much credit. It all felt very formulaic and rote. And nothing ever made any sense. It felt very JJ Abrams ""mystery box"". Like they billed it as ""look how smart and clever we're being"" and then in the first episode there's a solar eclipse seen from every spot on the planet all at once that never has any impact on anything but the logo."
Strike the Blood,"I love the fact they saved the world and then had to save it from something worse

Nuke in Ny, then global plague and then i gave up mid way through season 3 but the glimpse hiro got it looked like the destruction of planet itself

Just should of let the cheerleader die"
Strike the Blood,Heroes needed the story planning to the same degree that dark had. But it changed to much mid course.
Strike the Blood,"The OP is doing gods work. Every single day (usually more than once a day) someone brings up the show Heroes. I’m just sick of all the real people who definitely exist trying to push their flawed narrative on me. It’s even more flawed than Sylar’s redemption arc.
I really hope the op takes down Kings next, that sacred cow is due."
Strike the Blood,"I 100% agree. Even the first season was bad. The constant switching of main characters between good and evil was lazy writing. The powers coming from an eclipse but then also from a genetic mutation made no sense. The inconsistent powers thing was super lazy (Hiro can stop time, teleport, and time travel, but only when it won't actually help the plot). The Hatian just made things super boring by canceling out other people's powers. Syler was a great villain, but he was the only interesting character on the show."
Strike the Blood,"Absolutely. Season two was actually not terrible, certainly not as great as the early part of season one and had a rushed ending, but certainly watchable.

Season 3 is some of the dumbest television I’ve watched and it was completely unencumbered by the writers strike."
Strike the Blood,I am still waiting to find out how saving the cheerleader will save the world.
Strike the Blood,"If it ended after season one it would have been  legendary and talked about for years along with the likes of Firefly ( still have not seen that ).   I was a huge fan of season 1 , but stopped watching after one or three episodes of season 2.  I did not even realize there was a season 3 or 4"
Strike the Blood,"the show was good during the introductory episodes, the easy part ; once the plot finally started it crumbled on itself"
Strike the Blood,"""Save the Cheerleader save the World!"""
Strike the Blood,They just *could not let go* of that fucking Sylar.
Strike the Blood,"As a massive Heroes fan I agree. Many years later I went to rewatch the series and after three or four episodes I just gave up and that was during its peak first season. The entire series is just an endless carrot on a stick of mysteries. Every episode ends with a stinger question which is solved in the next episode or two only for a new question to be posed. If you know the answers to all the mysteries then theres nothing there. It's just straight up boring. If the writers strike was to blame then it would have picked back up after it was done. Yeah we could say they needed time to recover, but it had years to do so and it never did. 

Heroes was a flash in the pan relic of its time."
Strike the Blood,"The biggest ""WTF"" moment I remember regarding the failure of Heroes is when Peter and his brother confronts Sylar in an office. It should have been a grand battle scene but then I believe Peter fucking slams door behind us and we never get to see the fight."
Strike the Blood,"Thank you!  
The writers strike only affected the season 2 finale where the virus was supposed to get out and they had to quarantine the city.  
The ireland plot sucked, the founders story was half thought out and ultimately pointless. Bringing Sylar back was a mistake, at least straight away. Hiro would be too overpowered so they had to send him to the past. Nobody knew what was going on with Nikki. The new orleans characters were cool and then never mentioned again...."
Strike the Blood,"I pin-pointed the exact moment the show jumped the shark - it's when HRG says his name is Noah. Last episode of season 1, right before they fail at killing Sylar, with his stupid spinach can. This was before the writer's strike so I agree with you."
Strike the Blood,Pushing Daisies was ruined by the writers’ strike
Strike the Blood,Heroes was one of those shows that did build up well and payoff poorly.
Strike the Blood,"You mean that in one of the first episodes when high schooler Claire goes to a party one night, falls and gets a stick jammed in her head and “dies,” wakes up on an autopsy table with the Y-incision done, pushes her chest back together and sneaks out of the morgue and shows up in the early morning hours at home by seemingly just being a few hours late was bad writing all along? No way!"
Strike the Blood,Exactly. I remember the finale was such a let down
Strike the Blood,"Ending was fine, the problem was bryan fuller leaving"
Strike the Blood,The season finale for the first episode of Heroes was one of the most disappointing finales I ever remember watching.
Strike the Blood,"you're 100% correct.

Heroes didn't even have a fully solid first season.  the first half was great: introduced a variety of characters with interesting powers discovering themselves and struggling to leave their mediocre lives to get wrapped up in a phenomenal adventure.  by the mid-season finale, we had the whole SAVE THE CHEERLEADER, SAVE THE WORLD mantra - and it was great!  suddenly our separate heroes were starting to cross paths and threads pointed towards potential team-ups and stuff -- similar to Stephen King's THE STAND.  --but then they all went back to their lives... the world had been saved.  the end.  ...and then shit started dragging on.  ...the second half of the season was lukewarm and directionless -- and that finale was the most disappointing episode of tv in history; you're right, two superpowered dudes just punch each other a bunch and one turns into a bug and escapes while everyone else just stands by and watches.  ...yawn.  


i watched half of season 2 and gave up.  fun characters, fun ideas, but just a meaningless show with no direction.  sleepy showrunner?  (i've little respect for jeph loeb)"
Strike the Blood,">The writers gave up on their ""anthology"" idea, and had no plan.

This. Although I don't think it was the writers who gave up on it, but rather the Network requiring it.

Even worse was keeping the Villain. He shouldn't have returned and they ran out of things to do with him pretty quickly."
Strike the Blood,That's the secret.  Heroes was never good.  Not the first season.  Not any season.
Strike the Blood,"The Writers Strike didn't make them constantly fudge the rules on healing and brain injuries.

It didn't cause them to write a plot where an eclipse gave people powers, even though they already established that wasn't what happened.

It didn't make them forget that Peter could walk through walls, and didn't need to rip a safe open with telekinesis."
Strike the Blood,Well thought out and spot on
Strike the Blood,"The ending of s1 where he gets away was bullshit and it was doomed from the start

there was clearly no plan and they were just doing more seasons for the sake of it"
Strike the Blood,"Totally agree. Tim Kring is one of those writers who has great ideas, great plot concepts, but then has absolutely no idea whatsoever on how to resolve those plots.

His follow up series with Keifer Sutherland (can't recall the title) had a similar lifecycle. Great high-concept, intriguing plot threads.....that never got resolved, the story became so self-referential it was literally up it's own arse, and the audience walked away.

I have a similar take on Lost but I won't hijack your thread for that. It'd be good to see more of these kind of threads in here, well reasoned arguments that go against the grain."
Strike the Blood,"> Heroes was a flash-in-the-pan BAD show

This is the correct take. Tim Kring makes nothing but shit. The first season of Heroes was an absolute outlier."
Strike the Blood,I agree. Season 1 was a ton of fun to watch. But the finale was a big let down. And seasons after the writer's strike still sucked.
Strike the Blood,"In my opinion

Season 1 &2 were mostly Perfect

season 3 had a Great start but the ending was just nothing special >!WOW Surprise Sylar again the main Season Finale Villain!<

Season 4 with the >!carnival !<was  a really good idea but the writers got carried away and did a lazy job   I don't mind the Bad Guy and the Story  the >!whole past of the  Founder of the Company and Carnival  !<but the implementation was bad"
Strike the Blood,"It remains that the writers’ strike marked a big shift in character motivations, plot threads, and quality. The whole pandemic thing suddenly went away, Peter completely forgot about the Irish woman that he left in the future, and many characters just felt very different. Sure, maybe the show wasn’t as good as it’s first season. But without the strike, I feel it may have remained fairly enjoyable for me as the quality petered off instead of dropping off a cliff like it did."
Strike the Blood,">other shows had phenomenal seasons that year, including LOST Season 4 and Breaking Bad Season 1.

Breaking Bad season 1 ending was famously impacted by the strike.  You cannot just use 2 of the most popular shows possible in the era as your comparison baseline."
Strike the Blood,It suffered from JJ Abrahams mystery box syndrome. No one cared to develop what’s inside the box.
Strike the Blood,"The writers strike made a bad problem *worse*.  


Heroes was never supposed to last beyond the first season.  They changed the ending to keep key characters alive and allow another season when it proved popular enough.  Problem of having way overpowered characters remained.  Those characters were nerfed to make writing less challenging but there was no recovery happening."
Strike the Blood,"Honest question but how old were you during the writers strike? Your post reads like someone who looked up the stats of a great athlete from before they were into sports and decided they knew everything about that player.

Did you have this opinion back then? I feel like seeing it happen in real time versus binging the series and deciding 15+ years later what happened is different."
Strike the Blood,Did this really needs its own post?
Strike the Blood,[deleted]
Strike the Blood,"Wasn't this the show that started with an eclipse visible everywhere on earth?

So, in effect, flat earth?"
Strike the Blood,Lost started spiraling season 4.  IMO its when it really became clear they might know what they are doing and are just throwing out more mysteries that won't be solved.
Strike the Blood,"No

Season 3 wasn't perfect, but it was a million times better than season 2, which ridiculously bad."
Strike the Blood,"The movie ""Push"" is what Heroes should have been.  Do a time jump and have people on the run and in hiding from Govt. orgs all over that want to weaponize the people with powers, as it is all out in the open now."
Strike the Blood,"I quite enjoyed heroes. This is why i never bother with reviews of movies or tv shows. 

100% of the time (yes 100%) i see someone bash a show or movie it's always something I've seen and everything they blabble on about is their opinion and their opinion only. I wish other people would do the same. Maybe some of these obscure movies and shows will finally get some love."
Strike the Blood,"Nah. I was there. that show was alright for season 1. Writer's strike, and then it completely shit the bed."
Strike the Blood,"The few episodes of season 1 were not great, but they had so many ideas, characters and storylines floating around a pile up was bound to occur.  Especially if it makes it seem like was destiny or something.  Having time travel in a story can be a dangerous thing, I have seen done badly so often."
Strike the Blood,This was a show that needed to be one and done. Maybe it was possible to get another few episodes out without tanking the premise. But in the end it was a closed story from the start.
Strike the Blood,I rewatch season 1 every so often and it really does fall apart in the finale.
Strike the Blood,"Was the first season good?  Seriously, I remember it being just okay. Haven't seen it since in first aired, but I just remember a lot of lazy storytelling and the cheapness... iirc the finale was during a prom and had 5 people in the whole thing.  Their budget for extras must been nil."
Strike the Blood,I have tried at least 4 times to get through the show but hit a wall around season 2 episode 4 I came to the conclusion that the show just want for me.
Strike the Blood,I think the show would have been excellent if it had to work with 10 episode seasons.
Strike the Blood,"Agree it wasn't all the strike, that couldn't have helped though.

Seems like more an issue of direction.  When they decided to keep all the characters that became popular, things got messy.  Plus, going full fledge time travel will always break plots."
Strike the Blood,"I just rewatched the first season and pretty much agree with this. I loved Heroes because it clearly came from a love of comic books and comic characters. I even like the seasons past season 1 just because they’re silly, melodramatic, and take themselves far too seriously. After watching the “good” season again, it did have all the things people seem to dislike about the the later episodes, just with slightly better writing. It’s not the masterpiece everyone seems to think it was, but I still love it for what it is."
Strike the Blood,"Yeah, the WGA strike didn't ruin it, it just cut the 2nd season massively. If they had a good idea they could've just continued with what they were going to do.


If they had stuck with the anthology idea, sure - but they didn't



The WGA strike **did** fuck over Pushing Daisies, though."
Strike the Blood,It’s not like season 1 was that great
Strike the Blood,The average redditor doesn't seem to have any clue what the writer's strike was and how it affected television.
Strike the Blood,"I watched the first season, it started great, but towards the end it declined quite rappidly. Keep people dead, regardless their popt. 

And can somebody please explain to me why the cheerleader needed to be saved?"
Strike the Blood,"Excellent post, and I agree 100%. 

But you forgot to list the most important point of evidence: the writers' strike occurred at the end of the writing of season 2 and before season 3, and **not** between the production of seasons 1 and 2 as most people who spread the myth believe."
Strike the Blood,They should have stuck to their original plan and killed off all the season 1 characters in the finale
Strike the Blood,Thats debateable but it did change the path of the season and who knows what different stories could have come from that
Strike the Blood,"I never watched Heroes, but you have a very well written argument, so I believe you."
Strike the Blood,"I don't remember it in a lot of detail, but I thought season 1 was really great.  I don't recall being too disappointed in the last episode but I don't recall being blown away either.  I don't think I even made it through season 2 it just got bad and uninteresting after season 1."
Strike the Blood,"Heroes should have ended at end of S2, everything else was unnecessary."
Strike the Blood,S1 was good....S2 did indeed feel like the SAME shit. After that I just lost interest. You could just tell that they had no real overarching plot from season to season.
Strike the Blood,"I liked most of the show tbh, it wasn't the greatest but probably gets more hate than it deserves. Maybe just because there was less content then."
Strike the Blood,Even season 1 had cracks in its plot. Remember the nuclear guy who everyone thought was going to blow up the New York. He was shot by Company agent who was working for people who were plotting for nuclear detonation in New York. Then why did company agent tried to kill the key person for the plot?
Strike the Blood,I think what really hurt them was losing Bryan Fuller.  When he came back for a couple of episodes in season 3 those were just so much better than the rest of the episodes.
Strike the Blood,"> While the second season WAS disrupted by the Strike, other shows had phenomenal seasons that year, including LOST Season 4 and Breaking Bad Season 1.

Wait, I'm sorry, in my mind Breaking Bad and Heroes are from two completely distant and separate eras of my life and my brain is having a really hard time wrapping itself around this."
Strike the Blood,Save the cheerleader save the planet.
Strike the Blood,"I think it would be a whole lot better if it debuted today, to rival “The Boys” and was just 8 - 1 hour long episodes per season."
Strike the Blood,They only had one season in the can. After that they were scrambling when it became a hit. so many shows fall into the sophomore slump
Strike the Blood,"Man that first season of Heroes, especially those first few episode just something else man. I remember being very excited every week when new episode releases. Save the cheerleader save the world."
Strike the Blood,"I watched the season 1 finale and said out loud ""oh never season is going to be bad."""
Strike the Blood,Season 3 was a masterclass in batshit. Delightfully insane and incoherent. The Television Without Pity forums and Topless Robot reviews for that season deserve to be in the MoMA.
Strike the Blood,"The problem was that it was a huge hit.  This meant they had to keep that going instead of just making good television.  So they had to come up with convoluted ways to keep the same audience-favorite characters around, and somehow keep them saving the world every season even though they already saved the world.  That's all.

The first season was great, and the rest could have been great, but success changes the mission.  There were some decent elements here and there early on, but it just fell into the same soap opera trap as Once Upon a Time and so many other dramas that go on too long without being willing to change."
Strike the Blood,In my opinion the major problem was that it couldn't get pass Season 1 premise and Season 2 wasn't just a repeat of Season 1 but also a poorly written show. Reborn was just terrible and had crappy CG.
Strike the Blood,"The original idea was to have an anthology series with each season disjoint from the previous but sharing the same universe. 

I have no idea how the writer's strike could affect not implementing that idea."
Strike the Blood,"TV shows for some reason during that time were actually quite good. It was films to me that seemed to be exact copy and paste of each other, with dull dialogue and plots.

Even though the Writers Strike was specifically TV writers, during that time to me, I noticed it was mostly films suffering with quality, while TV shows were delayed."
Strike the Blood,"The funniest part to me is how every single week there would be promos for the next episode that were so dramatic, like it was the second coming of Jesus Christ every week. It was like they were trying to outdo themselves but most of the time what they were hyping up was pretty insignificant or downright meaningless."
Strike the Blood,"I don’t know, the fact that we are still talking about it in 2022 proves it’s impact. There are so many more shows that got so many more seasons that I don’t think are good. We should just enjoy it for what it was and wait for the eventual reboot."
Strike the Blood,"The dumb thing was they sort of gave up on the idea... and they sort of didn't.  They kept all the characters from the first season (even ones they could've easily killed off like Peter and Sylar) and didn't do the anthology, but then they still added a new slate of characters as if they *were* doing an anthology - Maya & Alejandro, Adam, Monica, etc.

It just created this dynamic where they introduced all these new characters, but you didn't care about them, because you wanted to keep watching those fan favorites."
Strike the Blood,"Yeah I don't think we can attribute that to the writers, they just write what they're told."
Strike the Blood,"But also didn't advance any of the characters either. Just Flanderised them.

Hiro was the worst. We see cool future him. But present him just became an increasingly bad punchline."
Strike the Blood,"That was the network's call, not the showrunner's.  They had to change the last episode in post-production."
Strike the Blood,"Thing is, they could have kept Hiro since he was THE fan favorite or cycled individual characters in an anthology while focusing on new ones.  The only real problems were power creep with Peter and Sylar.

On a related note, Sylar is a fantastic concept for a super villain"
Strike the Blood,"Fair enough!

My primary criticism is aimed at Kring."
Strike the Blood,"Making it an anthology would have been terrible, though. All of the excitement of the first season came from the anticipation of watching these characters gradually discover their powers and come together. We don't want to see a reset when the first chapter ends, we want to see them team up and fight crime or do whatever. Heroes was a 'mystery' show more than a superhero show, but you can't just throw away the characters."
Strike the Blood,"I’d want to pin it on executives above the show runners. You want to throw all these characters out  after we spent a season establishing them, we can’t possibly do that is a quintessential executive decision"

Non Non Biyori,"It's Troy and Abed in the comments

I really like how Troy starts as the classical highschool bully and lets himself be through his friendship with Abed, and then changes and looks for something else. They fight, go on their own adventures, and eventually Troy leaves

I know Glover wanted to leave, it's ok, but that last episode is so well done. The fantasy really had to end eventually"
Non Non Biyori,"Garak and Bashir had something interesting in DS9.

Sometimes it was spy-vs-spy, or master and apprentice, other times a deep bromance.

Actually, thinking about it there were quite a few in DS9. E.g. Odo and Quark"
Non Non Biyori,I was going to give the obvious answer of Tom and Greg from Succession but then I realized you asked for non-romantic.
Non Non Biyori,"The relationship between The Doctor and Donna Noble in season 4 of the Doctor Who revival is one of my favourite on screen friendships. 

After 2 seasons of romantic interest from Rose and Martha it was so refreshing to have a companion who wasn’t remotely interested in The Doctor in that way, they were just truly best friends and Donna was exactly what he needed, and she also challenged him in ways his previous companions didn’t."
Non Non Biyori,Jed Bartlet and Leo McGarry
Non Non Biyori,"Mal & Zoe from Firefly definitely springs to mind.

They have such a great relationship and will always have each others backs."
Non Non Biyori,Al Swearingen and Seth Bullock in Deadwood.
Non Non Biyori,Monarch and 21 from Venture Bros. The total transformation that occurs from Season 1 all the way to the most recent episode is such an interesting relationship of Villain and Hench. How Monarch comes to totally lean on 21 and 21 finds purpose in life just from Monarch's passion. The episode Saphrax Protocol is such an amazing culmination to their story.
Non Non Biyori,"Martin, Frasier and Niles Crane on Frasier. The show really managed to be a lot of things, but one of those was a wonderful rendition of the relationships between a father and two sons- whether as a unit (and as a unit minus their missing wife/mother) or two brothers together or a father and each one of his sons. I love Niles/Daphne but the scenes and episodes that really make me cry are the Crane family ones."

Non Non Biyori,"Burton Guster and Shawn Spencer.  Best friends, business partners and frequent co-conspirators that will be exasperated, infuriated or outright disdainful of, or with, the other, but will drop everything to help at a moments notice.  In my opinion it's the best tv example of real, life-long friendship of the highest order.  Not to mention that Dule Hill and James Roday really seemed to have fun with their parts and enjoy spending time with each other, which I feel was necessary to make the characters work."
Non Non Biyori,Elliot and Margo from The Magicians. They're basically platonic soulmates

Non Non Biyori,"This is a bit of a trick answer as it is romantic. However it's a relation that's centered on a romance that can never really happen for many different reasons. It creates very bittersweet tension as they carry out their typical duties throughout the show. 

Jean-Luc Picard and Beverly Crusher. 

I find this unique. Typically when you see this scenario, the characters give in and find a way to be with each other anyway.

Non Non Biyori,"Dutch and Claudette from the Shield. Interesting dynamic where the two really challenge each other and make each other better detectives. Outside forces tug on their morality at different points, given they're in a corrupt police department in a corrupt city, but it seems like those two were always able to hold each other up to a higher standard. 

Cameron and Donna from Halt and Catch Fire. Two seemingly polar opposites at first (one being the punk, rebel young programming phenom and one being a prissy veteran of the industry who kind of lost her spark and is living a cozy life). Constantly starting brilliant projects together, losing they way due to their egos and splitting up, fucking each other over, finding each other again. They kind of echo Cameron and Joe--which was a romantic relationship--in that they always find their way back to each other, yet it seems inevitable that it won't last, but while they're together it's beautiful."

To see it start with her bringing him to the football club only because she intended to destroy the club and hurt her ex-husband, and then to now where they are besties. It's one of those onscreen friendships that I genuinely smiled at every time they interacted because I got to see the journey of them getting to a place of affection for each other that feels genuine and loving without a need for romance."

I haven’t seen it yet but I did read the book and the source material is the definition of mediocre wine mom schlock. Chill the fuck out you fucking weirdos, there’s no sacred ground to trample here."
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,"5 f*cking days. That's how long it's been out. Chill. Wtf. Literally just heard about it 3 days ago. People have lives, we can't binge everything the moment it comes out. Entire series' can not be consumed and discussed ad naseum in one news cycle or you end up Kaleidoscope. Yeah remember that one? The one everybody watched but no one has mentioned in over a month?"
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,"I see this show has been getting lukewarm reviews, but I absolutely love it."
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,"The critic ends with this: ""Sure people will watch, but we’re not getting the adaptation we deserve.""  

Who deserves what? It's like reddit wanting things to be the way they expect. Overcome.  Don't watch. Nobody cares. As has been said, people will watch. End. The rest is nonsense from people who value their own opinion too much. That's why everyone is seeing Yellowstone around."
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,"I *really* like this show. I loved the book.

Here's what I like about the show: adjusted for the 1970s era, it feels like a really accurate portrayal of a group of musicians and an good snapshot of that time. I doesn't feel like a fictional story. Daisy Jones reminds me a great deal of a current musician I know. Billy Dunne reminds me of a few people: now hitting middle age and reflecting on their musical careers. The casting and acting is good. It feels like a genuine human story to me, especially as I know the twist that is coming. I love Last Of Us, but I don't need every series I watch to be an epic."
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,"We've seen pretty much this same story play out the same way in so many movies, TV shows, etc. I didn't read the book, but none of the plot turns in the three episodes I've seen so far were in any way surprising or unexpected."

Like, there’s no sleepy drone footage of the protagonists hometown accompanied by slightly tense piano music to slowly set the mood, the first episode is an interview of one of his victims crying and describing being raped.

I think it speaks to how important the producer felt telling the story was and how much built up energy and oppression JMS created over the past few decades."

The doc used full footage of the victims naked and did not blur out an parts. It just felt like re-taking advantage of women that were brain washed and cult abused. I had to end it."
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,Is this a good documentary? I added it to my list because I've never watched a documentary in another language and I watched so many KDramas.
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,Cool now do the Catholics of America
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,The only thing crazier than Korean Catholicism is American evangelism.
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,Do jehovah's witnesses next
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,Religious people be like: “come to our church so we can molest u”
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,IMHO I can’t wait for all organized religion to die…. The harm it’s caused far outweighs any good.
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,Why are Koreans so prone to cults?? I can kindda see why the Chinese government ban religious cults the likes of falungong from arising.
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,Don't have religion where you idolize the leaders. Having religion could even apply to those who claim to believe in science. The scientific methodology is one where you test to determine if a hypothesis is false or not false. Because it isn't false doesn't make it true. Science is akin to forever chipping away at a slab of marble to determine the sculpture underneath. True science can only determine correlation and not causality. Statements of absolute causality are not statements of science but of religion.
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,Will this involves the moonies?
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,Every single religion has coverups rarely do they self report!
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,All religions are a sex and money scam. Every single one.
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,Anywhere else to watch it? Canceled Netflix due to the new password restrictions
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,"Cool.

Now do Evangelicals in the US.

EDIT: To be clear, I think this is a great documentary and I'm glad they won the right to air it.  I'm saying I'd like to see this trend of exposing gross religious organizations by documentaries funded and platformed by major media companies continue on."
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,Unrelated to the film itself but I wish it had either been titled *In the Name of God* or *A Holy Betrayal*.
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,Man Koreans are not gonna like this one lmao
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,how about a documentary on american religious leaders?
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,If any of those guys are gay they are probably only into white guys
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,"How about sticking it to Scientology? Or the fundamentalist Mormons, et al. I don’t care about some “leaders” in Korea. Go after the predators at home and I might be impressed."
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,Netflix sucks haha
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,[removed]
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,"Good news, for sure, though I started watching this earlier this week and the production struck me as super odd. Might be a cultural thing, but the set design and editing is incongruous given the subject matter. 

Disclaimer: I only watched the first 15 mins of the opening episode."
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,"Religion doing what religion does.  But people want to be lied to, so on it goes."
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,The world is really fucked up.
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,">3rd March

btw"
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,"Yep. Was part of this cult before here in one their American branch and knew they we’re sketch since the beginning. Definitely members would manipulate to “evangelize” people. It’s flat out sad how many people are brainwashed and devoted to this cult and the leader. Insiders think that the media is just persecuting him and acting as a “devil” to bring down the “will of God”. His 10 years of imprisonment acts as Jesus dying on the cross to save us from our sins. His sermons are so boring and majority of the time, he just talks about himself."
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,"LPT: don't join cults, especially ones where the leader claims to be be God or claims to be speaking for God. Actually, just don't join any fucking cults."
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,"Oh some one sued to stop it. I wouldn't have watched it otherwise but now, straight on to the list."
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,Seriously though. Are there any NON religious sex cults?
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,I hope this series continues to expose more cults in Korea.
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,"I just want to ask if anyone else felt like this was fake or dramatized when first watching it? 

Not trying to be offensive because I watch sooo much true crime, something about this felt a bit staged (the interview, having the victim play an iPad video, film stalkers outside a hotel). I just didn’t want to get duped with a horrific story but being told by actors. Again, I am not saying the story isn’t true - it’s disgusting and I fucking hate religion. I especially seek out religious docs as I was brainwashed southern baptist as a kid. I hate to hear these stories! 

Just a vibe and didn’t see anyone else mention it."
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,"r/Shincheonji_Korea
It’s a place to discuss about cults in Korea including JMS"
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,"I still don't understand why the mother in episode 6 ""Baby Garden of Death"" didn't say her son was murdered in court, and still stuck to his heart failing? What was the point when the case had gotten that far and lied just to hate herself and wish death upon herself everyday? Did I miss something?"
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,"After having just read the Pope John Paul II and the sex abuse cover-ups, I was really hoping it would be the Catholic Church."
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,I would subscribe to a series where they did an in depth dive into every sect. If they find no evidence of a particular group they name drop them. I guess that would be an evolving form of journalism.
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,"I say, do the USA next!"
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,I know its a messed up system there and you only get real time if you dont have money in korea
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,"religion is the only part of society that coddles adults for submitting their critical faculties to a cult and wailing on about how more important their imaginary stories are than anything else going on in the objective reality we share. And you wonder how this hasn't been a magnet and cesspool for literal millenia, grifting entire societies for private ""sacred"" time with the children of the community, huddled around a bunch of decrepit old perverts.  Theism is child abuse, pure and simple. You want to con junkies and people who are at the bottom of their lives and have had all their defenses beaten out of them? That's one thing. Indoctrinating children before they've developed any cognitive defenses against shitty iron-aged emotional injunctions can fuck. right. off."
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,Reminds me of “silenced” about the sexual abuse and Kentucky sentences at a Korean school for the deaf.
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,Do they have any history of this sort of thing?
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,"Even though some viewers criticized JMS episodes for being too explicit, but in fact, those episodes were somewhat censored by the production team themselves. According to the director of the series, what was captured in those first three episodes was only about a tenth of what the victims actually suffered.


He said one of the reasons they brought the project to Netflix was to expose reality of those crimes. But even for Netflix, he had to watered down description of sexual assaults of JMS cause it was too upsetting for the viewers. Some of crew memebers suffered traumas for days after covering the case he said."
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,"The first thing you hear in the documentary is an audio recording of a rape in mid-intercourse, with some old man voice asking if the victim had an orgasm.  I did see the first minute or so of the interview, but I decided I didn't really want to see how far it was going to go after that."
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,"I was kind shocked they showed video of nude girls with blurred faces and unblurred bodies right after the stories of how he was raping teenagers. Aside from not being sure how old any of those girls were, it seems extremely exploitative of Netflix to just expose that to the public. It's fresh victimization even if only a handful of people know who they are."
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,"I have friends who turned to them and haven't heard from them in years. After joining they only ever wanted to hang out with me at their church events -> indoctrinate me.

Oddly enough they also said that Catholicism was satan or something. I also remember them believing that the end of the world is soon."
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,"I dated a woman for a short time who was a member of one of these cults in CA, only I didn't know it until I looked up the name of her ""pastor.""

Her ideas about certain things were just bizarre and didn't make sense with my understanding of most sects of Christianity."
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,i did too! weird way to grow up eh! there were some good times though. i think about the people a lot.
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,Midnight Mass on Netflix was a documentary 😌
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,"You will find predators in every system, willing and able to abuse their power dynamics."
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,"Religion is just a medium.  You can look at all the things that happened in Hollywood, that have nothing to do with religion to see that all it takes is generic promises from someone who appears to hold power to get some people to do things.

This isn't excusing people using religion in such a manner, just showing that religion is method, not the base reason these things happen."
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,"its literally built off that. The entire premise is that you must believe something without evidence, without understanding even. simple blind faith is required at the root of every religion.

anyone willing to believe in that is obv going to be more susceptible to other ideas with no proof, esp when they believe these orders are coming from God. Even easier if you can justify any of your ideas with weird interpretations of a text like the bible. And once you get some believers, their entire families usually get brought in"
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,"For real. Over the last 10 years I've noticed more and more how awful religions can be. People use this *coughChristianscough* as an excuse to do awful and hateful things. I get it that not all religious folks are bad, but it's difficult to not be jaded."
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,An extra pernicious part is how religion will make a point to call the parts of you they use to exploit as a “virtue”
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,"Reminds me of Tool’s song, ‘Opiate’"
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,If anyone prefaces their morality with religion.  There is zero morality.
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,Name?
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,Is this related to the unity Church?
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,"You can change it to Korean audio with subtitles, but yeah it's annoying because then any English audio will be in Korean if there is any."
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,just put the CC on then
Nagi-Asu: A Lull in the Sea,"You can change this in the audio settings, FYI."
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,The series finale has the best written ending I have ever seen. ❤️
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"*Six Feet Under* is one of my all-time favourite TV shows. *SFU*’s final episode gets so much praise and love (deservedly so, in my opinion), but the show overall is consistently well written and emotionally engaging (barring a certain questionable season 4 subplot, which I’m not a fan of).

I often have chills running down my spine whenever I recall a scene that occurred early in season 4, when Nate is next to a tree and screams at the sky during a sunrise. That scene really gets to me."
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"Six Feet Under is my absolute favourite TV show of all time. It's definitely an interesting experience describing the series to someone who's never heard of it (""so it's set in Los Angeles and follows this family that runs a funeral home..."") but once I get going listing the ways in which I adore virtually every aspect of it, I can simply go on forever which only works to enhance my appreciation for it. 

A few years ago, [a thread was posted on the SFU sub](https://old.reddit.com/r/SixFeetUnder/comments/8nsaji/powerful_moments_in_the_show/) where people discussed some of the show's most powerful moments and reading through it again is making me an emotional wreck :')

I mentioned this in the above thread but I also always have to bring up my favourite quote from a TV show whenever SFU is mentioned:

> ***Brenda:*** ""You know what I find interesting? If you lose a spouse, you're called a widow, or a widower. If you're a child and you lose your parents, then you're an orphan. But what's the word to describe a parent who loses a child? I guess that's just too fucking awful to even have a name."""
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"David is simply gay.

What David is Not:  David is not comic relief.  David's homosexuality is not a plot device to divide the family.  David is not a tool for other people to grow.

David is simply gay in the same way Nate is simply straight.

That is what I want of society.  

It was the first time I ever saw homosexuality portrayed like that on TV."
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"Yes! Watched all seasons around the time they aired. Had a huge crush on the main brother character, not the one who now portrays Dexter, the other actor. And yes, there's been no other show like it, great acting, like you said, a lot of emotional highs & lows And some strange characters also! First time I saw Rainn Wilson act, way before The Office. I knew he had a ""weird"" something special

I remember the last episode, I thought it was mostly very sad, but a good example of how to end a series."
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,i’m right there with you - favorite show of all-time and best finale ever
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,The saga with Lisa (?) missing was so good. The way Nate had steadily a nervous breakdown over the course of days was so realistic
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"Six feet under was VERY early in the prestige TV era, but managed to still be one of the best examples of it."
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"SPOILERS

In the first few episodes, they wrote a lot of characters who were the dead, talking to the people handling their bodies in the mortuary. Those were my favorite scenes, simply because they were so well written."
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"I love watching it every 5 years or so.

Started off relating hard to Claire first run through at 17. 

5 years later and I couldn't stand her and related to Nate

Another 5 years and I feel like David.

I've heard the show described as 40+ hours of therapy with the Fisher family and it's very accurate. The show 100% changed the way I viewed death and I think the last 10 years would of been much harder without it.

Also that cougar death scene is fucking gold.

EDIT: I really needed reminded of this show thank you. Currently remember David and his Father's talk in the rain and appreciating life a bit more."
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"I'll write this in basically every Six Feet Under post in here:

There's a companion book titled ""Six Feet Under: Better Living Through Death"", that's absolutely worth a buy if you love the show.

It contains tons upon tons of extra material, and it's all in-universe, so to speak, all specifically written for this book. Handwritten letters from characters, excerpts from various books that are written or mentioned in the show, simple things like Claire's doodles from school or her ""contract"" with her father upon getting the hearse or love letters between Ruth and Nathaniel while he was in Vietnam.

It's all written by the show's writers, and every page is like this little treasure trove of things that are relevant to the show, or were mentioned at some point, giving all the characters some extra depth (as if they need that).

I've never seen a companion book that had this much effort and thought put into it."
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"I get why people enjoy it and am glad you loved it so much. Just to provide another view point for anyone who is thinking about watching, it’s a long show that I personally didn’t think was worth the amount of time I put into it. The finale was good, but it was so hyped up that it didn’t quite hit that high note for me.

It sounds like a lot of people love it though so worth giving a shot and seeing how you like it."
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"Pretty much my favorite series ever. And, unlike lots of other shows, it has aged VERY well. Still feels as current and relevant when watching today as it did two decades ago. That's the sign of serious quality."
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,Which streaming thing is this on again?
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,I  finished a rewatch just last month. It's a wonderful series.  Certainly belongs to one of the last era's of well written shows.
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"Claire and Ruth are the greatest parent/child relationship ever put to screen. The way it develops is wonderful and Frances Conroy is a hell of an actress.

The seen with Ruth singing Joni Mitchell's *Woodstock* gives me chills. Claire sees/hears her from the stairs as she very quietly shows a piece of herself and who she was when she was her daughter's age."
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,If tried to watch this show 3-4 times now and can’t get past the first 4-5 episodes. It’s just so boring (to me at least). I guess it’s just not for me.
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"I hated it for killing an actor I love so early. Like oh wow, he's in this. They did what?

But it was a good show. I'll just never forgive it for that."
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"Weird, we started watching it again yesterday. Do you know how much the check from Kroeners was."
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,One of my favorite shows of all time. I rewatched the first few seasons a few years ago and noticed that while in high school I thought Nate/Brenda were super hot and romantic & seeing it in my 30s it just felt so toxic from ep 1. So fucking good tho.
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,Watched the first episode like 2 years ago and wasnt that impressed. I know I should give it at least 4 episodes. But is it just about them having drama in the family and running that funeral home? Cuz that doesn't really entice me much tbh
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"I'm really due for a rewatch too, i've seen it maybe 15 years ago at this point, only remember the very broad plot points.  
What i still know is that if i listen to 'breathe me' i get emotional to a large degree though. Ofc the song itself is emotional itself, but it's the context of sfu which really does it for me. So yeah, incredible show."
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"For me, the show is just OK. Something to watch when there isn’t much else on. I need a show where I care about the characters successes and failures, and I just wasn’t rooting for (or against) anyone in sfu. 

But I l don’t like The Expanse either and that’s also an unpopular opinion."
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"Always heard good things about the show but what's it really about?   I know that it's about a family running a funeral home but just to have more details.

Also is it constantly about death and losing loved ones? Because for personal reasons, I don't think I can handle that"
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"I need to give that show a try again. I watched a few episodes, wasn't really hooked, and I just moved on to other shows. But I feel like I'm ready to try again."
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"Finale is great.
 
Brenda almost made me stop watching."
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"My favorite of all time too. I saw it as it aired and I still think about it regularly in 2022. ""Newsflash, other people exist!"""
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,I started it again too. I’m really enjoying this even more than in my 20s
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"One of the best shows. It feels like it I actually know the characters from my real life, like a collage friend or something. Never saw anything like it"
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"Amazing show. Worth it just for davids talk with his dad on his balcony, and the last few minutes. Perfect."
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,I completely agree!!
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,It’s that and Star Trek TNG for me. Both magical and brilliant.
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"It's top 3 of all time.

I'm not saying that there's 2 better, I'm just acknowledging that I haven't seen everything, but there's no way there's more than 2 better series finales out there"
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,100%
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"Indeed.  The one show to truly tie everything together in a semi-neat bow. 
This show bowed out at the right time, before jumping the shark."
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"I've been dying for another show like this that I may have to start up SFU again this week. Good solid dramas like this are missing in the streaming age: SFU, Sopranos, Mad Men, Friday Night Lights. Does anyone have recommendation for shows similar to these? I love me some Squid Game to House of Dragon to Andor... but they don't come close to the power of those Golden Age dramas."
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,Haha that season 4 subplot is all I remember unfortunately.
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"In 2022, David is still the most fully realized gay character I’ve ever come across."
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"Yes, my wife and I adored Rainn Wilson’s Arthur character.  A brilliant piece of acting, real charm."
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,[deleted]
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,God that season had me so uncomfortable and so angry at Lisa.
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"Those were cool scenes. I dislike that they didn't keep that up, but I guess they wanted to route the show more in reality."
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"I am currently watching it. I think my wife and I have realized that we like shows where the characters are working toward some overarching goal rather than just watching dramatic people's lives move forward through time. Many of the characters have quite frustrating qualities to the point that I would never want any of them to be my colleague let alone my friend. The show is very well acted, but I generally agree with you.

I have a hard time watching a show where I don't have someone I can unequivocally root for. I can do it with a book since it doesn't consume as much of my time, but with a 40+ hour TV show, it is hard to consume and not come to develop an intense dislike of each of the characters. Some of the characters, like Claire, become more tolerable through the course of the show, and some of them keep circling back to their crappy behavior and absolutely shit communication skills"
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,HBO. So damn good.
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"What was boring about it

I never watched it and I wanted your critique since everyone else was gushing over it 

What show would you compare it to as being similar to it?"
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,Not everything is for everyone.
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,Which character?
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,How much?
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"It gets SO much better after the first episode. Hell, after the first season. Watching one episode and abandoning it isn't putting in much effort."
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"Death, birth, relationships, cheating, homosexuality, teenage rebellion. It's a slow about literally anything"
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,what others would you put in that top 3 (or are in contention)?
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"Have you seen *Halt and Catch Fire*? It’s an AMC show, and it started off as a kinda *Mad Men* 2.0 wannabe, but set in the 1980s about the rise of tech and the internet during that decade.

After its first season, *Halt and Catch Fire* starts developing its own identity and coming into its own (mostly by changing the focus from the Don Draper-esque character Joe and centring more on the female characters, their relationships as friends, business partners, rivals, etc). *Halt and Catch Fire* arguably gets better with every season, culminating in its phenomenal and emotionally powerful fourth and final season, which is also my favourite final season of any TV show ever. I would highly recommend *HacF*."
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"I have not watched the series since it aired, so I don’t remember, what was the season 4 plot?"
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,I see what you did there.
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"And Dirty Sexy Money, Parenthood and even the The Catch. I'll watch him on anything!"
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,Thanks!
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"Cool premise, good writing and very good acting, but…

If you like watching privileged, sheltered saps constantly shooting themselves in the foot and you can feel sympathy for pampered self-destructive idiots, then this is your jam.

The finale only works if you give a shit about these people. When you don’t, it’s not really anything special."
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"What the other guy said applies. But really it’s just slow and barely happens. Plus all of the characters are assholes, and imo not very interesting. Think of succession but way slower, less tension and worse characters."
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"For me, the stakes are not high enough for me to tolerate such cantankerous personalities. It's a drama where you are watching dramatic people with poor communication skills live their lives and run a business."
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,The father.
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,There is an offer but I didn't see it was.
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"Top 3 for me would be:

Six feet Under    
Star Trek:  The Next Generation   
The Shield"
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,I did watch the first season way back and enjoyed the Texas Silicon Prairie setting but it did feel as you call it a Mad Men clone. Never got around to the next season even though I keep hearing great things about it. Going to give it another spin now!
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,">!Lisa’s affair with her brother-in-law Hoyt, leading to her death. I’m just not sure I’m convinced it was consistent with her character, but people can act in odd ways sometimes, and truth can be stranger than fiction, so who knows?!<"
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,[deleted]
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,I remember Dirty Sexy Money! I was really getting into the show and they cancelled it.
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"None of them are privileged kids. Tree family owns a funeral home, none of them are rolling in cash. All the characters has their highs and lows in my opinion"
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"Not Cheers, Friends, MASH or Sopranos?"
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"Yeah, *Halt and Catch Fire* improves dramatically after its first season. Also, have you seen *The Americans* and/or *The Leftovers*? They’re excellent TV shows on a similar level of quality to that of the prestige dramas you mentioned in your earlier comment. I’d be happy to go into more detail into either show if you want more info. 😊"
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"Okay, I haven't see that movie in forever and I didn't even know he was in it!"
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,Me too! How disappointing!
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"Seriously? Claire is the fucking definition of white privilege. All she ever did was repeatedly catastrophically shoot herself in the foot. She always had the family safety net under her.

I also lmmfao every time someone references the series finale and her finally entering the world as a fucking adult. “Oh, the spoiled little pampered princess is going to actually venture into the world. That’s so incredibly brave and amazing?”"
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"MASH is up there, but not in my top 3.  I didn't watch Cheers or Friends, and I think Sopranos finale was a cheap copout not worthy of the show."
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"Loved both of those. The Leftovers was bewildering and gut wrenching in a way that no other show will ever be. The Americans had a span of episodes in season 4 from Nina's death to the desperate attempt to take Martha to safety that I can replay in my mind with the same thrill each time.

Wonder if we'll ever go back to those type of shows? Sort of family and character dramas first, then their scifi/gangster/workplace toppings second. Now it feels like it's the other way around, if there's even a strong character component at all."
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,[deleted]
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"Dude, give her a break. She was a high school kid when the show started while others are grown adults."
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"So my next recommendation is my favourite TV show of all time, but it’s not a live-action prestige drama. It’s *Avatar: The Last Airbender*, the animated fantasy show. Have you seen it?"
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,Here I was about to fire it up *wink wink*
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,She effectively remained a high school kid throughout the whole series until the finale. Care to guess how?
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"Yup! Yip yip. On Book 3, at the big battle two parter. Waiting for the holidays when I can rip through to the end all at once. Could use another animated recommendation as well. I watch anime but totally slept on ATLA until now; was surprised at how much a western animated series (from Nick of all places!) grabbed me."
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,did you ever watch Sports Night? Now he is GREAT in that show! /late comment
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,Did you even watch the series?
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"Do you mean you’re on the 2-part episode “The Day of Black Sun”, or you’re about to watch the 4-episode series finale? Either way, I hope you enjoy the rest of the show! 😁

As for another animated recommendation, I’d recommend *Justice League Unlimited*, which is my #5 favourite TV show of all time. It’s a direct continuation of the first *Justice League* cartoon, which began in 2001. Those shows are the concluding series of the DC Animated Universe, which started with *Batman: The Animated Series* back in the 1990s (I would also highly recommend *B:TAS* if you haven’t seen it).

If you want a better understanding of my TV tastes, my top 5 favourite TV shows are as follows:

1. *Avatar: The Last Airbender*
2. *Mad Men*
3. *The Sopranos*
4. *The Wire*
5. *Justice League Unlimited*

If you want me to give you more detail on *Justice League Unlimited* and/or why I love that show so much, just ask and I’ll be happy to oblige 😊"
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,No! But I was interested in that one! I should try and find it.
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"Regrettably, yes. Stuck through it begrudgingly to see “the greatest series finale of all time.” You know, the incredibly emotional one where she finally grew up and left the incredibly sheltered nest."
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"Haha, I will take you up on that some day. I've watched a random assortment of Justice League and Young Justice but never in the appropriate manner. YJ was another high quality show I wasn't prepared for in the few episodes I caught. I suppose it's time to watch the whole shebang properly staring with JL. That'll be my next animated series after ATLA.

Would like to hear about your appreciation for Avatar if you've got the time. Paused at Day of the Black Sun atm but I was pulled into its orbit for a bit - listening to the soundtrack nightly to relax, looking for Northern Shaolin and Baguazhang classes in my area... so I'm quite hyped for the final stretch of episodes."
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"I’ve seen many highly acclaimed and beloved TV shows, from *Mad Men*, *The Wire* and *The Sopranos* to *Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood*, *Monster* and *Batman: The Animated Series*.

Even after watching all those brilliant shows, I still think that *Avatar: The Last Airbender* is my favourite TV show ever. I distinguish between ‘favourite’ and ‘best’, because I would say *Mad Men* is the best TV show of all time, although *The Wire* and *The Sopranos* are both very strong contenders for that title as well.

So if I would say that the likes of *The Wire* and *Mad Men* are better on a technical/overall level, why is *Avatar: The Last Airbender* my favourite TV show of all time? Because despite its flaws, *A:TLA* is very well written and can be appreciated on multiple levels, by both children and adults alike.

The worldbuilding in this series is vibrant and alive, feeling fresh while still inspired by real-life Asian locations and cultures to give it a realistic and relatable feel. The magic system is easy to understand, in addition to being excellent in its execution and its applicability not only to combat, but also to the show’s society as a whole (in the workforce, as entertainment, etc).

On the subject of *A:TLA*’s combat, the fight scenes are tense, exhilarating and really well choreographed, drawing upon real-life martial arts. The show’s quiet moments have displays of tender friendship and humorous scenes that are hilarious. The pacing is very well handled, especially in season 2 onwards. *A:TLA*’s philosophical and spiritual underpinnings (inspired by Taoism and Hinduism) also make the series more thought-provoking and engaging than your standard Saturday morning cartoon. And that’s before we even get to how consistent in quality *A:TLA* is - in fact, one could argue that the series actually improves as it goes on, all the way up to the show’s satisfying and fitting final episode.

*A:TLA*’s greatest strength, however, is its extremely well-fleshed-out and loveable characters. The characterisation for even secondary characters is brilliant, and you really get to understand and know the main characters very well: their thoughts and actions consistently make sense. And the character development in this show is phenomenal - the character development of >!Zuko!< is the best I have ever seen in any type of media, let alone in a TV show. The characters (and >!Zuko’s!< character arc in particular) resonate with me in such a powerful and unforgettable way."
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"Incredible write up! Thanks for sharing. Ranking A:TLA above the golden age triumvirate of MM, Sopranos, The Wire is sacrilegious but there really is no other show like it and there may never be one to match it. Agree 100% with the depth and development of the characters, the worldbuilding, the whimsical and visceral martial arts, the relationships and humor. Especially the philosophical and spiritual aspects - there's a 'essentialness' that is both more rich and profound to our lives in a way that other more dense and complex anime shows can't be. Didn't think I'd be going from asking about Six Feet Under to A:TLA... but it happened! And somehow all fits."
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"I mean, I still think *Mad Men*, *The Sopranos* and *The Wire* are all better than *Avatar: The Last Airbender* when viewing those shows critically, but that’s why I make a distinction between “best” and “favourite”: the latter simply means that something means more to me personally, even with its flaws, whereas a TV show I regard as the “best” is arguably the most well written with in-depth themes, all while maintaining a consistent level of quality and entertainment throughout its entire run.

I did grow up watching *Avatar: The Last Airbender* from when it started when I was 10 years old, to when it ended when I was 13 years old. And I do think it’s a show that holds up very well into adulthood without my having rose-tinted nostalgia goggles - for instance, you’ve been really liking *A:TLA* on your first time watching it, and you’re a grown adult. 😁"
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"Part of the fun is seeing other giant works influencing the show: Bebop, Miyazaki, Star Wars... especially FLCL and Shaolin Soccer! As well as the blend of East Asian and Southeast Asian cultures as you mentioned  - it's so seamless to the story while at the same giving voice to looked over ethnicities."
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"Also, one of the greatest series finales of all time."
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,The show was outstanding. Probably the best written tv show of all time . The show had probably the best cast. Michael C Hall was outstanding and deserved an Emmy for his portrayal as David Fisher
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,I mean I dont wanna shill for HBO but their shows are on a whole different level. I'll watch anything on HBO
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,It was ahead of its time in a lot of way. Loved watching it with my family every week during its original run (as fucked up as it got!)
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"I completely agree! I think what differentiates a good show from an iconic one is character development. I loved the characters so much on Six feet Under. I remember when it was airing trying to convince my friends to watch it. I also feel it was such a pioneer for depicting realistic gay and interracial relationships. 

I was so sad when it ended."
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,The one episode I still remember vividly so many years later is when David is kidnapped.
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"The perfect ending didn't exist before 6 feet under. 

You want closure on a character? Watch the finale."
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,"The original premium quality HBO show along with Oz. Good enough that when anyone asks whether they should give it a try, I say just watch the pilot. That's all it takes."
A Corpse Is Buried Under Sakurakos Feet,Please watch The Leftovers

A Certain Magical Index,"This show really missed the mark for me. Willow was a movie that Millennials grew up with but this was clearly geared to gen z who, I think, mostly don't care about the IP. Willow got sidelined as a character and the story felt like an incredibly generic YA fantasy plotline with Willow stamped on it. I had the same complaint about Wednesday but that at least kept the Tim Burton AF vibe through a lot of it, and who doesn't love Danny Elfman covering Metallica? Willow seemed to try too hard and then give up entirely. Watching Davis step back into the role was a treat but they... Fuck I'm not gonna say it.... Okay fuck it. They shortchanged him bad. And I say that with all respect to a living legend. His scenes, especially about his and Sorcha's history, were great. Everything else felt like Disney said ""How old could Millennials be? 10 years?"""
A Certain Magical Index,"I tried to do some research into viewership, and it was obviously not particularly conclusive, but certainly pointing towards lower viewership then required for a sequel series if the show didn't pick up a lot more viewers in later works. The bad word of mouth/user ratings probably didn't help.

https://medium.com/@plumresearch/willow-on-disney-b702a8874c74#"
A Certain Magical Index,"""Did he get EP?“

""He did.""

""Good for him!"""
A Certain Magical Index,"I think they really missed the mark with casting, script, and music selection. So many ridiculous lines, delivery, and terrible covers broke the immersion constantly."
A Certain Magical Index,"I liked the series enough. The one thing I didn't particularly care for, and I must be in the minority since I haven't seen it voiced elsewhere, was that it felt more of an ensemble, and that Willow was just a supporting character. I was really hoping for Warwick Davis to shine, and I think he can definitely carry a show."
A Certain Magical Index,They never made a legitimate season 1.
A Certain Magical Index,"If you didn't want to end up hemming and hawing about sequel possibilities, you should have made sure the people in charge had the property's legacy in mind when developing it, as opposed to their own personal checklist."
A Certain Magical Index,"Man is a legend, and genuinely a nice guy. I noticed him while traveling through Italy and he actually greeted me!!!!"
A Certain Magical Index,"I really enjoyed Willow. Here are the main things that bugged me: costumes were too modern, as was the language (including, but not limited to, swears). Most of all, though, was the modern music that ended most episodes and sometimes was played during the episodes proper. Why did the season end with “Money for Nothing”? Best I could figure was because, if there is a second season, the characters will find themselves in Dire Straits."
A Certain Magical Index,If season 2 is more like episodes 6-8 than 1-5 I’m in.
A Certain Magical Index,"Show sucks.  So.  Bad.

Could've been handled smartly, wasn't.  Shame."
A Certain Magical Index,"Yeah I doubt it, even though they definitely aimed for at least another season or two.

* The show was weirdly paced, with some parts aiming to be slow paced while others are cut too quickly to compensate for list time. 

* The atmosphere jumps back and forth between being a YA CW show to a gritty fantasy. It's pretty odd jumping back and forth between characters making immature jokes and a plot significant character dying suddenly. I think we lost a third of the cast by EP 3 for... Dramatic impact? I barely even got attached to them.

* i'm not gonna pretend the original Willow was Shakespeare, but the dialogue was irritating in how modern it was. At least pretend you're in a fantasy setting.

* Every character quips like they're in a Joss Whedon production. At certain moments I'd beg the characters to STOP. TALKING.

* Story is for the most part predictable and dull.

* Character dynamics are forced. There's 0 chemistry between the cast, and Kit is the most insufferable, with Boorman taking second place for the most cliche quip-slinging scoundrel.

* Was it just me or Warwick Davis' didn't even try acting?"
A Certain Magical Index,This show was… not good.
A Certain Magical Index,I don't think it makes it to season 2.
A Certain Magical Index,"If it actually gets renewed, please hire new writers."
A Certain Magical Index,They had a sequel book series called shadow moon that honestly would have been a better path for them to take.
A Certain Magical Index,"Being Gen X - I watched the Willow movie probably more than Star Wars New Hope. 

This show was not Willow - it was not the world of Willow. What was the scene with the 1800s frontier people all about? And don’t get me started on the trolls.

The show reeks of nepotism - Jonathan Kasdan does not have the talent of his father, nor the voice of his generation. Yet, time and again, he is given these huge projects because of his relation to his father.

I have little hope for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.

Maybe I would’ve enjoyed it more if it didn’t have the “Willow” label.

I laughed a bit and thought there were good moments. But it didn’t feed off the world the original movie built.

I’m all for growing audience awareness and presenting new opportunities for people to become a part of a treasured franchise - some traditions need breaking down, but this series tore down the original foundation the movie built that endeared us to it years ago.

I just can’t believe people signed off after reading the scripts - especially the first one - just bad."
A Certain Magical Index,"It was … ok. Pretty trope-y YA stuff. Felt like they robbed pretty heavily from everything.  Multiple times it felt like Harry Potter meets LotR meets Fantasy Star Wars, but it was decent for what it was.  Would I ever re-watch or recommend though?  Nope."
A Certain Magical Index,But it’s so awful
A Certain Magical Index,"So did they finish the story arc, or is this something else I shouldn't start watching only to be disappointed in a cliffhanger"
A Certain Magical Index,(Insert Arrested Development reference here)
A Certain Magical Index,Won’t cry when they cancel it. It’s like the Disney Channel tried to re-imagine Game of Thrones.
A Certain Magical Index,"I wanted so bad to love this series.  I will do anything to support Warwick Davis, as he's legitimately one of my favorite people on this damn planet.  I LOVE the Willow movie.  I love love love the movie.  I do not subscribe to any streaming services, so when the show was announced, I figured I would be buying Disney+ for a month to watch it, but I was able to watch the first episode at my mom's house.

The first ep is all Ive watched still.  I just couldn't really get  into it.  It didnt grab me like the movie.  It felt *too new* and too unfamiliar.  I still loved seeing Warwick, I still love him as an actor and I know it mustve been so special for him to play Willow again, but Im struggling to get into it and it makes me feel bad."
A Certain Magical Index,I read that in the Arrested Development narrator's voice.
A Certain Magical Index,I didn’t even make it past the first episode.
A Certain Magical Index,"My kids and I loved it, started out a bit rough, but definitely got better. I hope it gets one more roll."
A Certain Magical Index,I wouldn't bet on it.
A Certain Magical Index,The story was ok but the dialogue was just awful. It was like watching a bad CW show
A Certain Magical Index,"I say this as someone who grew up with the movie and still quotes it to this day with friends: this is a truly terrible series. Atrocious writing, editing, casting and acting. From the top down, this production is full of baffling decisions. I would not let Kasdan near another franchise."
A Certain Magical Index,Let’s do a Legend series instead
A Certain Magical Index,"Was a fun and funny show, felt like a good d&d campaign or something. I hope they get renewed."
A Certain Magical Index,"Watched 2 episodes and gave up. The show sucked on so many levels, annoying characters with zero charisma. And how the hell is Davis not the main character. Movie is not that good to begin with, and the show just shat all over the nostalgia it had build up through the years"
A Certain Magical Index,"I looked forward to this show so much. And I haven’t felt so betrayed since..the last time they revived a franchise Millenials and Xers and Boomers loved and just made it for what old people think Gen Z will like. Horrific writing, editing, production, everything. Why would you do this. We waited forty years and this is what you do? Why, why, why?"
A Certain Magical Index,"I liked it, it was fun and didn't take itself seriously with some refreshing trope subversions. Would definitely watch a second and third season, as a show it's a nice palate cleanser fom all the other grimdark series."
A Certain Magical Index,"I just finished it.

I thought it was a limited series.

I thought it was far better than Reddit indicated to me lol.

I was not a fan of the film and so enjoyed this more."
A Certain Magical Index,"I was sooo disappointed by this series..

The terrible dialogue


The ""princess is a lesbian"" trope


The one good written character arc dying (to free princess from marriage obligations)


Willow just being mopey half the time

Me and wife loved the film and were giddy to see this show.. wife thinks they tried to force too much modern society into a fantasy story, and I just watched it to see if maybe it got better.. it didnt"
A Certain Magical Index,"The show wasn't great, but it was decent in spots. I actually enjoyed the anachronistic needle drops everyone else seemed bothered by."
A Certain Magical Index,I'm sure the hundreds of people watching will be eagerly awaiting a second season.
A Certain Magical Index,Season 2? Most people have never seen episode two
A Certain Magical Index,Please focus on editing and writing. I really liked some of the themes and visuals especially towards the end but new shows now have this amateurish feel to them.
A Certain Magical Index,I dropped this series after episode five because it jumped the shark.  Episode five was beyond awful.
A Certain Magical Index,This needs to be cancelled.
A Certain Magical Index,I loved it. To be honest I only watched it after having a few on my day off and strictly as a comedy. But I liked it a lot.
A Certain Magical Index,"""more story to tell"", there was barely any story in this season.
This show was just not good at all. Doesn't  feel anything like the original film."
A Certain Magical Index,"Willow was extremely derivative and by-the-numbers 90s nostalgia pandering, and I loved every minute of it."
A Certain Magical Index,"I was a bit irritated by the way they introduced the “Women aren’t accepted as fighters/knights,” thing. In OG Willow, Sorsha was a badass; they could easily have made the setting accepting of women warriors. This made a lot of the conflict in the first episode feel really contrived to me."
A Certain Magical Index,"I named my kid after something in this amazing movie from my youth and now I am embarrassed because of the show.  I’m sorry kid, I guess I should have named you “Maze Runner Divergent.”"
A Certain Magical Index,"I had such high hopes for this man, so much hope and then Disney pissed all over it.

Terrible costumes, terrible script, mind numbing dialogue, incoherent and utterly baffling story.

Fucking hell"
A Certain Magical Index,"I liked it a lot, hope it gets a second season"
A Certain Magical Index,"I was 5 when the movie came out and my dad watched it on VHS all the time, he loved that movie. I thought it was good, but was never a super fan. I went in having zero expectations and I enjoyed it - mostly for its comedy and it felt like a D&D campaign. I didn’t rewatch the movie beforehand so it’s probably been 15 years since I’ve seen the movie, but I did appreciate the cameos from the movie. There was definitely some random “wtf” moments - but overall I enjoyed it considering how low my expectations were. I feel like they were trying to capture the same kind of audience Netflix gets from Stranger Things."
A Certain Magical Index,After watching episodes 1-2 I felt the need to watch it all the way through just to see if it could get worse and it did. Was really excited when I heard about the project but that show was bad.
A Certain Magical Index,"I was looking forward to this the teaser interview with warrick and cast was funny but the show was a train wreck, tone was all over the place. The orginal was average back in the day but had its moments but this was cringy as hell. Still better that the rings of power snooze fest"
A Certain Magical Index,"this show is very much like the witcher, were the main character has become a support character.  that said, i only watched 2 episodes then i bailed out, because the whole show looked like a bad cosplay. 

and the fun part is we all made fun of sony how they screwed up constantly, yet with the last of us they did everything right. stay close to the source material and let joel and ellie be the main cast.

it is really easy actually, give the fans what they want, instead coming up with your own imagination of how things should be."
A Certain Magical Index,"Willow is trash, forget about it."
A Certain Magical Index,Unfortunately the show is flaming hog wart dung
A Certain Magical Index,"For me, Willow was quite atrocious. 

The acting, delivery, music choice. I literally only like 2 of the characters, I hated Willow himself with a passion and to me, his acting was incredibly subpar. There were a couple of scenes that I enjoyed, but I won’t shed a tear if the show doesn’t get renewed. It was overall quite bad."
A Certain Magical Index,"It is a fun fantasy. An enjoyable mixture of action, romance and drama, with plenty of jokes. It seems like a three season arc is planned, if the Disney plus drops it, I would like to see it completed in comics or novels."
A Certain Magical Index,Can't wait to see the new adventures of Strong Female Character and Ginger Plank of Wood..Riveting stuff!
A Certain Magical Index,If there was ever a show that SHOULD be cancelled it’s Willow.
A Certain Magical Index,"Willow is horrible. I hope fantasy/scifi shows like this keep failing, while more shows like Andor and HoTD succeed. Course correction is needed."
A Certain Magical Index,"Willow was always a classic

couldn't stomach more then 3 episodes of that dog shit

wow"
A Certain Magical Index,This was another huge misfire. Identity politics is all these people care about. They latch onto an existing IP like leeches and then bastardize it.
A Certain Magical Index,this show needs to not be renewed.
A Certain Magical Index,"To people who actually finish it, was it good?  I only made it to episode two and had to turn it off."
A Certain Magical Index,The last two episodes of the first season were so bad that I don't feel like Season 2 anymore
A Certain Magical Index,This was awful. Such a disappointment. I stopped watching. Shame
A Certain Magical Index,Ron howard produced this fucking trash?
A Certain Magical Index,"I loved the hell out of this show.
Willow was one of my childhood favorites, because it was so weird and wonky but fun and adventurous.
I still remember picking up sticks in high school and saying “uuuussse theee waaaaaand Willow!” to make people laugh. 
Hope it gets a second season."
A Certain Magical Index,"I forgave everything about the series until Money for Nothing kicked in. Great song , terrible choice."
A Certain Magical Index,I really disliked the first episodes and then someone told me to change the perspective. Since then I think of it as the attempt from a GM to run a Grimdark adventure and the players having other ideas. After that change I enjoyed it really
A Certain Magical Index,"Hey Ron:  Maybe make season two of ""Willow"" be about *Willow*."
A Certain Magical Index,Haha. Shoulda made a good show if you wanted to keep this job Ronnie.
A Certain Magical Index,"I am sure that a majority of the people saying that they didn’t like the series genuinely didn’t like it based on their perception of its merits or lack there of

However I think it should be kept in mind that a large minority of the people saying that they didn’t like the series are saying that because a large part of the story was dedicated to a lesbian romance

Due to that one fact alone most conservative people are not going to like this series but few of them will come right out and admit that that is a reason for them not liking it"
A Certain Magical Index,"There’s either a ton of shills or bots in this thread, I can’t quite figure out which."
A Certain Magical Index,I really enjoyed the series. I rooted for the characters. It garnered my full attention.
A Certain Magical Index,I saw the trailer & knew I would actively avoid it. Then I hear it’s obsessed with modern politics over story once it’s out & count my blessings I never wasted the time.  A damn shame as fond memories of the original.
A Certain Magical Index,"The Wheel of Time, Lotr and now Willow. All terrible adaptations. We are truly living in the dark ages of fantasy genre on TV."
A Certain Magical Index,"The show was trash.

Bunch of annoying brats."
A Certain Magical Index,Narrator: There was no hope or plan but no one bothered to tell Gob .
A Certain Magical Index,"A Willow TV show is a cool concept, but this tv show doesn’t meet expectations. The problem with the first season is that it shoe horns the distopian fantasy genre into Willow and it feels kinda hallow and lacks the worldbuilding the movie had. The film was also more of an epic fantasy."
A Certain Magical Index,"I really get baffled when I see the critiques of this show on reddit. I had never seen the movie so I watched it before jumping into the show. If you saw the movie, you knew Willow was a bit of a misfit and the show itself is a band of misfits that both equally get themselves into and out of trouble through both their strengths and weaknesses. Do I think the pacing was off in some episodes? Absolutely. But the people basically expecting Disney Lord of The Rings or Game of Thrones clearly never saw the movie and are just offering extreme critiques for the sake of offering extreme critiques."
A Certain Magical Index,A no for me. Not after you convince the Former CEO to cancel the Owl House for this.
A Certain Magical Index,"Shit, I better go watch it so they know I like it!"
A Certain Magical Index,"The show was just ok, but it felt like it just wasn’t that great.  It felt like it was maybe catering to the wrong audience, instead of focusing on making a great show."
A Certain Magical Index,"Is it bad if, at this point, if I see Erin Kellyman I just assume it's going to be bad? Not sure why, but she's basically an albatross for Disney shows and movies."
A Certain Magical Index,Good luck with that Ron.
A Certain Magical Index,I didn’t enjoy it at all. The writing was terrible and the acting subpar.
A Certain Magical Index,"My favorite movie growing up and I watched every episode of the show. I can see why people don't like it because it has weird edits and abrupt plot stuff, but I don't think the show took itself too seriously so I didn't either."
A Certain Magical Index,It’s an incredibly bad show. Shockingly poor.
A Certain Magical Index,"Wow what a disgrace to your legacy to put your name attached to this project, Ron"
A Certain Magical Index,Why are the heroes in today's series always women? Really boring. And unrealistic
A Certain Magical Index,"I managed to watch the entirety of She Hulk so I thought hey, I can watch this, plus top bloke Warwick is always a bonus. nope, an absolute dumpster fire, left midway episode 4, shows where literally everything in it is shit are a sight to behold but even such a sight has its limits"
A Certain Magical Index,"Fugghedaboutit. 

I bet the ratings are terrible right now and I hardly hear anyone praise it. Even those who ""kind of like it"" warn you it's boring and slow."
A Certain Magical Index,"I hope not, a real disappointment"
A Certain Magical Index,I definitely needed more LGBTQ drama in my Willow reboot
A Certain Magical Index,"Hmmm... So i've been reading some of the responses here - I can totally see why people were a bit ""disappointed""  and maybe I have low expectations (For instance, I liked Rings of Power and hope to get more seasons of that)  

Willow, which I have not finished yet!  On episode... 7 - but Willow... Has been a bit of a rollercoaster.  Semi slow start, gets really dark and entertaining, but have some slow episodes in between.  The episode I'm watching now has taken me a few days to complete haha, but I enjoy it so far.  I want to see more.  I think there definitely can be improvements.  

I'm recommending it to everyone even though I know they'll never watch it, just like I did with Patriot (And now that show is canceled because of my stupid friends and coworkers not taking my advice to watch grrrrr)"
A Certain Magical Index,"I hope not. This is the series literally no one wanted. It's so fucking bad.  Like dragon ball evolution and Velma bad.

Edit: You people's taste in entertainment scares me."
A Certain Magical Index,Does he have COVID?
A Certain Magical Index,I can't be the only one who doesn't give a shit about old 80's/90's re-hashes of barely popular movies. Let's get over this whole nostalgia phase and get some original content for once.
A Certain Magical Index,Renew Willow and drop that garbage show they call national treasure.
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,"Lucky Star was my favourite growing up, and it's still up in my top 5 easily.

Really cute slice of life story that I would highly recommend.

I can't even begin to imagine what would drive someone to do something so horrible."
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,"Takemoto also directed Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu, which to me, something like fifteen years after I first watched it, is still one of the funniest series I’ve ever seen in my life. The comedic timing is so perfect and exquisite. I’m incredibly sad for his family and friends."
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,"The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya is probably one of my top five anime movies. Well made and has [one of my favorite movie moments](https://youtu.be/bLea0MTifwo) 

I’m sad to see this happen."
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,RIP
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,What a tragic loss. The guy created absolute home runs.
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,"Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid was one of the most charming animes I have ever seen, in fact I had just bought the series on blu-ray a few days before the fire. Such a shame, it had just gotten renewed for a new season too. If they decide to go along with the second season without him, then I hope what they come up with would have made him proud. May he rest in peace."
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,"If you guys love the anime style storytelling, go and check out Hyouka. In my opinion, the art-style is beautiful, but direction in particular something truly great and creative."
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,"I enjoyed Lucky Star greatly. Disappearance was also a fantastic follow up to Haruhi franchise, and I'd love for someone to pick up the torch and keep running.

His work will always be remembered. Rest in peace and I hope his family willl find justice in the coming weeks."
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,;-;
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,"It's so terrible man, just such a senseless crime. A studio that did nothing but create beautiful things. They did nothing but add to the world and the human race and one shit stain that doesn't even deserved to be called human takes away so much life. All of those people will live on through their work but it's just so damn sad that it had to end like this."
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,The Full Metal Panic seasons he worked on are some of the best mecha shows you can watch. Horrible loss.
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,Aww man. This hurts a lot.
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,[deleted]
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,"Kobayashi is by far my favorite slice of life anime. I fell in love with the music, the comedy, and the heartfelt moments. Rest in peace Yasuhiro Takemoto. Your work has left a wonderful impact in my life."
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,An amazing talent. Gone far too soon. Rest easy and thank you for all you've created.
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,R.I.P. Thank you for everything you did.
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,RIP
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,F. Really liked Dragon Maid.
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,"Whey, glad that pedo is finally dead"

The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,Can someone confirm that his death was caused by the arson attack at Kyoto Animation or unrelated?
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,It’s the Seinfeld of anime.
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,Lucky Star is the best anime you can't tell anyone about.
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,I'd also recommend nichijou if you enjoyed lucky star. Also done by kyoani.
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,"It was the show that started me on anime... 

God... It hurts my heart to know that the director of not just this, but *so many* shows that I loved so dearly was killed in this."
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,Best comedy ever. Nothing even comes close.
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,I concur. I was blown away at the time. Beautiful movie. The only one that topped it was Your Name.
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,"Can you not at least take the time to write out ""rest in peace"" at such times? 

The internet doesn't charge by the letter

EDIT: Wow so many downvotes for suggesting someone take 3 extra seconds to write something out properly  when someone has passed away. It really shows so much respect for the deceased when all you can bother to write is an acronym instead of the phase. 

No no no ""RIP"" will do, that's all that needs to be said, I'm too FAR TOO busy to write out it out correctly. /s"

The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,may i sugggest  **Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid** . i might watch again this weekend and have some whiskey in his honor...
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,You might like hyouka
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,I cant believe you said irregardless.
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,"FYI, you don't need to add the prefix ""ir"" to regardless."
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,"Director change can already happen. KyoAni nurtured a lot of talents in their studio that can take up the directors mantle.

That said, it's insensitive of you to put the focus there right now. They're just identified all the victims and are only now getting to assessing the damage in the material. Let's first worry about the people who are injured in the hospital and fighting to pull through, before we worry about anime sequels."
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,"Bruh

People fucking DIED. Show some respect."
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,It's a show about nothing?
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,"No, that would be Azumanga Daioh"
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,Why can’t you tell anyone about it
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,"Most of the best anime are anime you can't tell anyone about. Even the good shit is often embarrassing. Like Evangelion is a masterpiece and one of the greatest works in the history of television, up there with things like Band of Brothers and Kieslowski's Dekalog, but I don't tell anyone other than fellow nerds to watch it because it's also embarrassing as fuck."
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,No anime has made me laugh as much than the last episode of Fumoffu.
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,Do it yourself instead of bitching
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,They actually confirmed a season 2 some time ago. No idea what the fate of any of their plans are now though.
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,KyoAni have said they will continue their work. Though it will almost certainly be delayed by months or years.
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,Gross
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,"Well damn, I'm sold."
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,I've been wrong all my life.
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,Stop pretending you care.
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,"You know what, it kind of is."
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,"This is absolutely the perfect way to describe the show. There is no plot, stuff happens sometimes, the characters are loveable, and you suddenly realize you’ve binge watched the whole thing and Motteke Sailor Fuku is forever burnt into you brain. 



Thoroughly recommend it."
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,"1) Watch the opening.

2) Show said opening to any adult.

3) Try to convince them you're not a pedophile."
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,"A season 2 was confirmed, it was never confirmed KyoAni was doing it.

Shows change studios all the time when new seasons come out, for example, One Punch Man."
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,I meant specifically the studio. We know a season 2 is in production. But there was no confirmation it was KyoAni doing the project.
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,"I would say anything ""confirmed"" is probably stalled now unless they convince another studio to pick up the slack"
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,"As stated lower in the comments, we have no idea which studio is making S2 of Dragon Maid. It could not be KyoAni"
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,"I dont like hyouka as is (I think it could have been so much better than it was given the themes and characters it offered) but that scene where he first meets Chitanda is just fucking magic. Easily one of my top favorite scenes in all of entertainment. 

The only episode i genuinley enjoyed was this one about various club activities while the MC looked over a ""booth"" by himself."
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,"Yeah the reason why it's one of the few grammar mistakes I actually correct people on is most people who do it have no idea that it's wrong, unlike when people who know their grammar is bad but don't care enough to do anything about it."
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,I watched the series somewhat recently and didn't think the opening was weird or anything. *shrug*
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,"They confirmed having a Dragon Maid panel at their event a while ago.  
http://kyoanido-event.com/enjoy/stage/"
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,"It would be very unusual for it not to be Kyoani. The only time I can think of that Kyoani has started a series and then another company has continued it would be Haruhi, and that was for a spinoff some 8 years after the original series (The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki)."
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,"Personally I appreciate it, regardless of how disliked my opinion may be. Cheers stranger!"
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,[deleted]
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,"So are there any actual implications or are people just jumping to call out anything innocent again?

I thought the whole show was relatively innocent, except for the part with the dad, lol. It was just a cute, funny, and often wholesome series to me.

Edit: Just saw some comments and I still don't understand it, honestly. Not that I'd go around showing people that opening, but not that I'd do that for any other anime opening regardless."
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,"No it's just people joking around lol. If people can't see that then I don't know what to say lol, maybe people wanna take these things less seriously?"
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,"Because its about ""high school girls"" the general consensus is that as an adult (especially man) This is not something you should be watching. 

Which fails completely when you realise who the target audience is and the tags lucky star fall under. You can watch a live concert of the opening theme and it will by 90% men."
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,"I can sort of see where that's coming from at a surface level. Anyone who watches it will instantly know how clever the show is and has so many little meaningless interactions that anyone does in life(how people eat certain food, etc)."
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,This is a joke right? 
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,"Which rock song in a show is better?

There are better openings and stuff but in terms of actually in a show?

Anyways, the Regular Show song got like a million upvotes yesterday and that was empirically terrible"
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,"This terrible too man, I agree regular show was too, but this....this is no better, sound like it was recorded in a garage by a 12 year old Japanese band. Not good sorry.. And this guy above you with the long emotional comment, ummmm sure man. "
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,"It's not great quality cause it's ripped and put on YouTube lol

The song itself is pretty good though

What other rock songs in a tv show would you put forward?"
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,The Pit - Mouse Rat
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,"I mean... it's one chord and no lyrics.

To each their own, I guess"
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,"I don’t really care either way, but it’s really bizarre that Joel and Ellie come across, I think, 0 infected after KC."
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,They didn't need tons of infected just a spattering like when Ellie meets David. I feel like that whole interaction would have been better if there was some infected so it's more of a trusting moment for her like in the game
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,[removed]
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,[removed]
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya," I missed Ellie fighting infected with David. It made more sense in the game that he wanted to “partner” with her after seeing how useful she was. In the show it felt like we skipped a beat and his fascination with her felt less earned.

The other action sequence I missed was the fight/escape at the university. It didn’t need to be as big as in the game and Joel could still get stabbed by a bat but I missed the suspense of Joel hobbling out as Ellie has to be the protector for the first time. Felt rushed in the show."
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,They got it backwards. Infected are way more critical to the first story than the second.
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,"I get where they are coming from but I think they overcorrected to the point where you're questioning why a vaccine is needed.

The series is probably 1-2 episodes light."
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,The real issue is it only being 9 episodes. 2 of those episodes were back stories and the rest had to also build up other characters.
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,"I do think there should have been more. The story is of course about the characters, and their relationships... But the infected felt completely shunted to the side in the second half of the story. Joel and Ellie run into, what, 1 after Sam? There are opportunities to make them more influential. You don't have to cut every single action sequence."
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,"It's so weird that people see this argument as binary.

Either ""the story isn't about the infected! it's about J and E and their relationship! more would ruin it!"" or ""there was no infected at all! total lack of action! so boring!""

There's a fucking middle ground, people. They could totally have added *some* more infected without killing the story, without making people bored of the violence. No one is asking for 30 minutes of non-stop infected killing every episode. No one wants TWD again. But yes, a *little* more of infected would have been great, and I look forward to a *little* more of them in season 2."
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,"I definitely think 9 episodes was way too short, and am surprised that they didn’t at least go to say, 12 episodes, to flesh out some of the conflicts and characters. But, maybe that’s all that was greenlit and now they are going to get way more leeway to stretch things out and give some storylines some air. Here’s hoping at least."
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,It did feel like they stripped a little too much from the game
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,Rat King is coming
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,"There were two weird uses of the Infected. 1) that the world wide cordyceps web never came back beyond the episode it was referenced in feels like a miss, and 2) the Tress death kiss is still super weird

Other than that, I don’t think it was over or under done. There was a whole scene where the earth opened and a Belcher showed up"
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,Translation: “The Last of Us” will have a shitload more money in the budget for effects.
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,Balance fixes for next patch. Nice!
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,Epic series. They need to turn it into a video game.
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,"It was a serious flaw for me. The story starts on top of a serious,cataclysmic threat and sticks to it for 2 episodes. We see infected again once after that. It's a great story but they travel around freely never having to deal with infected again. Ellie's importance fades. I watched the middle episodes thinking ""oh shit!! they're going to have to enter the buildings"" but no infected anywhere. They have to use the tunnels, no infected, they travel through forests, no infected. They travel to a university then to an empty town and enter a home with no infected anywhere again. The last batch of episodes I basically told myself the infected aren't a danger I guess. I dont see it as a necessity to have the story we got. It's still top tier TV but the show kinda shifts into a generic post apocalypse rather than the world it started off as. Games need high numbers of encounters to keep engagement but this goes hard the opposite direction."
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,"Its weird. The show has really driven home to me how little the infected actually have to do with the plot, but still their absence makes them feel like less a part of traversing the world. I didn’t mind them not being around much, I expected it, but it almost seems backwards to commit to more of them in season 2 by when there’ll be Scars and the WLF to represent now as well."
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,"For me, without infected the relationship between Joel and Ellie fell a little flat because their bond felt somewhat unearned. In the game they are pushed to the limits and that experience makes their bond so much stronger. So maybe an episode or two were missing with more action between them and infected."
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,It's a good show but it just feels like blander more watered down version of the game. The show is just missing that constant tension and feeling that anything could happen at any time.
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,"The show is probably one of the greatest game adaptations ever. It's amazing how similar they kept a lot of set pieces and dialog. Amazing work.

However, as a show, it's really not that compelling and very boring. You miss out on a lot of key moments and growth between characters because the story moves at a quick pace. The episode where Ellie meets David would have been much better if they included them fighting the infected together. Stuff like that is missing greatly."
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,They are blazing through the story and skipping all the big action sequences.
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,"I mostly enjoyed the show but I would say pacing and choosing which storylines to focus on more, was the biggest issue of season 1. Also the finale was a bit short and disappointing, ngl"
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,"This show has been so strange to me! I loved Last of Us the game... and I love the show... but it feels like they should have had 3 more episodes. The story beats were there but it felt kind of forced, the father/daughter relationship between Joel and Ellie. Like we didn't get enough time with them to develop that relationship in the show with all the side stories (episode 3 is an absolute masterpiece in storytelling). I haven't watched the final episode yet but I dunno... 12 episodes would have been great."

Old Money,I’m here for yet another astounding Carrie Coon role. No performance of hers has ever been bad.
Old Money,My body is ready for more Julian Fellows period dramas.
Old Money,"My father is as proudly middle-of-the-road in taste as you can get. His ideal movie is a tentpole action comedy: to this day he still swears Armie Hammer's ""Lone Ranger"" is his ideal movie. He's not lowbrow, he just knows what he likes and what he likes is unwinding with some laughs, stunts and practical effects after a busy work week.

That said, he was hooked on ""The Leftovers"" from episode one, and he believes Carrie Coon is the greatest actor of the century. He'll watch anything she's in, so when I was describing this to him, he immediately perked up at her name."
Old Money,Oh your father should watch her theatre roles then.
Old Money,[The Bob Newhart Show](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068049/) was pretty good.
Old Money,"If you liked MTM, you had a couple places to go from there. There's the Rhoda spin-off, and the Lou Grant spin-off.

Lou Grant was an hourlong drama, though.

I see The Bob Newhart Show and Newhart have both been mentioned. Those two were also produced by Mary Tyler Moore's production company, as were Rhoda and Lou.

And one more total classic that happened to be produced by MTM, WKRP in Cincinnati. Great show. Music rights have virtually disappeared it in the last 20 years, but the Shout Factory DVDs have restored about 85% of the music. And honestly, if I hadn't just told you, you'd probably not even have ever known about the music issues.

Outside of MTM Productions, check out Taxi. Danny DeVito, Tony Danza, Christopher Lloyd, helluva cast."
Old Money,"CBS's Saturday night lineup for the 1973–74 season is often considered the best ever TV lineup:

8:00 All in the Family

8:30 M\*A\*S\*H

9:00 Mary Tyler Moore

9:30 Bob Newhart

10:00 Carol Burnett"
Old Money,You might want to try News Radio
Old Money,Carol Burnett Show
Old Money,"Ever watch All in the Family. Great show I watched as a kid with my dad. Funny as hell. Still holds well. Cheers is an old favorite. And the A Team, damn I loved that show."
Old Money,Get smart
Old Money,"Cheers  
All in the Family   
M*A*S*H   
WKRP in Cincinnati  
 
Cheers holds up very well. Highly recommended."
Old Money,"That Girl, Laverne and Shirley, The Monkees, I Dream of Jeannie, Bewitched."
Old Money,"Those two, All in the Family and I Love Lucy have all aged amazingly. Even Alice is a fairly good one (based on the Scorsese movie of all things). 

I remember that one where they think the cabin his haunted is surprisingly creepy for it being a 60 year old sitcom too. And the naked painting one is so funny. Too many good ones to list."
Old Money,I absolutely loved the initial interview in the MTM show pilot with Mary and Lou Grant.  It shows the quality of the writing that we came to expect.
Old Money,"You are talking about two of the greatest sitcoms ever, rewarded with countless Emmy Awards, with dream casts and writers and directors and creators, the best of the best. 

So really anything else will pale in comparison. For me, one of the most interesting things about them was that they never seemed to be in a rush, never seemed to be pushing, but instead let the comedy happen, with impeccable timing, making it funnier. These days, everything seems so abrupt, with punch line after punch line not landing. There are exceptions of course, but comedy is just different today."
Old Money,"""WKRP in Cincinnati"" is very good"
Old Money,"MASH, Barney Miller, both Newhart shows, Andy Griffith Show"
Old Money,"Yay classic TV! Lots of my favorites have been mentioned, Cheers, Newhart, Get Smart, The Monkees, I Dream of Jeanie. Other favorites: Green Acres, Our Miss Brooks, Sanford and Son, The Lucy Show (what she did after I Love Lucy), Dobie Gillis, The Jeffersons, Car 54 Where Are You, Good Times, Sergeant Bilko/The Phil Silvers Show, and others I’m sure I’m forgetting. haha And The Golden Girls is a classic, but assuming most people have seen it even now days. Oh, and not as old, but Wings is another favorite.

If you want to browse classic TV shows, besides paid streamers like Hulu and Paramount+, there’s a ton of channels that show old shows on free apps like PlutoTV, Tubi, and Classix, and then there’s MeTV, Antenna TV, Decades, and some other over the air TV stations!"
Old Money,That Girl!
Old Money,"Try Sports Night, great cast and good dialogue."
Old Money,The Odd Couple. Great show.
Old Money,"Lots of great suggestions here from Rhoda, to Taxi, to Laverne and Shirley. I’ll throw in Murphy Brown."
Old Money,Mad About You
Old Money,"I've not watched DVD but I have watched all of MTM (once as a teenager about 20 years ago and also more recently) and it holds up very, very well."
Old Money,Cheers
Old Money,"Happy Days, Laverne & Shirley, Morke & Mindy, Cheers, Taxi, All in the family, The Jefferson’s, Maude, Gillighans Island, Three’s Company, Fraser, Family Ties, Growing Pains, MASH."
Old Money,Taxi! Wkrp! Laverne and shirley.
Old Money,"They’re mentioned here already, but just because I love them so much:

“I Love Lucy” and “The Jeffersons”"
Old Money,"If you want an unofficial sequel to the Mary Tyler Moore show, I would highly recommend Lou Grant.  There are 5 seasons on Youtube that you can watch.  Kind of like the Newsroom but from the late 1970s."
Old Money,"They are two of the gold standard for TV sitcoms. They both have incredible writing and strong casts. So happy to hear when people discover them. Rhoda Phyllis are offshoots of Mary but personally, I didn't think they can hold a candle. (Lou Grant's a drama and is good but MTM's St Elsewhere and Hill Street Blues are the drama standouts from MTM.)

Bob Newhart is very good, as is Taxi. All in the Family is both dated and groundbreaking still. Barney Miller is wonderful.

If you haven't tried Cheers, give that a shot. The Charles Bros and James Burrows created it and they came out of Taxi and the MTM school of comedy. Though I like Cheers, I think its spinoff, Frasier, is better and holds up well today. Amazing cast and witty writing. The pilot is one of the best there is. So smart.

Also, if you've never seen Bilko and like comedy, I don't think you'll regret giving that a shot. It's dated but Phil Silvers is a master. He's so quick on his feet, it's amazing. Check out The Court Martial episode on YouTube and watch him ad lib when the chimpanzee decides to do his own thing.

I have a great love for the sitcom Soap. It's a little harder to find but is worth it. Parts are dated but the cast and writing are amazing. Hilarious one minute, incredibly poignant the next. Susan Harris created it and essentially wrote the first two seasons herself. Harris later created Golden Girls and wrote some of the best episodes of All in the Family (her first writing job!) as well as the abortion episodes for Maude. Soap, like AitF, was groundbreaking for its time and caused protests before it even aired. It's crazy to think that networks probably wouldn't have the guts to make this 45 year old show today."
Old Money,I unironically love Ozzie and Harriet
Old Money,"Rhoda from MTM had a spinoff named Rhoda.  The actor who voices Marge Simpson plays her sister, IIRC."
Old Money,The Wonder Years (both original and new versions are good).
Old Money,I fire!
Old Money,"I grew up watching Nick at Nite, and MTM was one of my favorites on there. Great characters, great chemistry between the actors (Lou and Ted’s dynamic especially was always hilarious) and a few of the most iconic moments in sitcom history (RIP >!Chuckles!<). Even major characters like Rhoda and Phyllis being spun off into their own shows didn’t slow it down much, because then you had Betty White added to the cast in the later seasons. 

I’m glad to see that you enjoyed Taxi as well, that might be my actual favorite from that era of sitcoms, and it’s still a pretty underrated show imo."
Old Money,I watched Mary Tyler Moore and then went on to Designing Women. I find the vibe similar.
Old Money,Murphy Brown although that show starts to Peter out towards the end
Old Money,Check out The Andy Griffith Show and That Girl. Both are pretty similar and hold up pretty well.
Old Money,This was on my short list so happy to see it recommended as the very first comment!
Old Money,"Came here to say this. Thinking back to what shows of the era could compare to MTM, *The Bob Newhart Show* instantly came to mind."
Old Money,The show was co-created by the voice of Garfield! (and he wrote the great theme song with his wife)
Old Money,"The man had 3 different tv shows, and they are all called “The Bob Newhart Show”"
Old Money,"I actually binged Taxi first, i cant believe i forgot to mention that one! Loved it so much. I unfortunately did not love Rhoda, but to be fair i only watched the first 3-4 episodes so maybe i didnt give it enough time.  Phyllis is also a spinoff but she was my least favorite character so i don’t think ill ever watch that one. Is Lou Grant worth it? The hour long drama has been what’s stopped me from watching that one - different vibe but willing to try."
Old Money,"Amen on WKRP. ""As God is my witness I thought turkeys could fly"". Or the episode as to how quickly alcohol affected reaction time with Johnny and Venus - Johnny getting better with every shot. Classic."
Old Money,I loved Rhoda's sister.
Old Money,"Boy, this takes me back. I was just seven, but have core memories of each of these shows. (CST, though.)"
Old Money,"Wow, no clue they put those shows on Saturday night back then!"
Old Money,That intro alone
Old Money,ughhh not if you want to avoid Bro Rogan
Old Money,Ooh I forgot about that. She is so talented!!
Old Money,Cheers is on the short list too. I’ve definitely seen a few episodes here or there throughout my life but never watched the series through. Love me some Ted Danson.
Old Money,"This is still probably my favorite TV show. Watched it with my dad as well growing up, and it would go from making me laugh my ass off, to being almost scarred with some of their heavy episodes such as Edith's rapist or the one where Edith's cross-dressing friend got murdered. 

Show was top quality for its entire run. Even when they brought on that little girl."
Old Money,"People still mention I Love Lucy, but rarely mention the Honeymooners anymore."
Old Money,These are the ones!
Old Money,Excellent list!
Old Money,Just finished a watch of Sports Night. The first season was excellent. Dan’s speech about his brother was delivered so perfectly. Didn’t love the second season. The whole go date other people plot genuinely made me mad.
Old Money,"Yes, and the Bob Newhart Show.  Fully worthy of your next two binges"
Old Money,"Shame this reached so late in the thread - excellent post! As you point out, you can often see the creative personnel moving from one quality show to another."
Old Money,"It's taken 20 years, but MPI is slamming those suckers onto disc. They started last summer, seasons 9 and 10 are due out on Tuesday, the entire series will probably be out by summer.

But if you don't want to wait, I believe the new HD masters that UCLA and Sam Nelson had made are all available on various streaming platforms."
Old Money,Been watching this for work and actually liking it.
Old Money,"Yeah, I checked it out but I didn’t love it. Which is too bad because I absolutely loved Rhoda on Mary Tyler Moore. I was shocked when I recognize the voice though. I had no idea the sister was Marge."
Old Money,Any clue what's going on with the second season of the new version?
Old Money,Also “Newhart” was was a funny series.
Old Money,"It's not a slap-stick comedy, it's more orientated toward relationship humour and weird or awkward situations and interactions, but it's also not afraid to get completely silly sometimes. Worth a watch. Bob Newhart was a king of dry humour."
Old Money,"The Bob Newhart Show (variety), The Bob Newhart Show (sitcom), Newhart, Bob"
Old Money,You have to at least go back and watch Rhoda’s Wedding!
Old Money,"Lou Grant is worth it, but probably not for your purposes at this time.

It's very issues driven. Today it would be lambasted by a certain crowd for its handling of various issues, especially since the show was canceled not because of ratings, but because Ed Asner criticized something the Reagan administration was doing and that pissed someone at CBS off.

But if you ever want to get into a deeper show, try it."
Old Money,Fish Story is the one with Venus and Johnny drinking. It's my fave!
Old Money,She's Marge in a the Simpsons.
Old Money,"My parents got married the summer of '74 (same day that All the President's Men was published), and watching these shows is part of their courtship story. I've only ever seen them on Nick at Night or DVD."
Old Money,"During the first oil embargo of the 1970s, gas got very expensive and for a little while it actually got fashionable to stay home and watch TV on Saturday nights."
Old Money,"Yeah, he's in there. But News Radio was a master class in using an ensemble cast, and in using... Limited actors to their best.

It has fuckin Andy Dick and he's funny and generally not annoying. The writers were magicians."
Old Money,Barney Miller was also fun.
Old Money,"Oh, then from my similar experience recently Cheers is exactly what you’re looking for. Even if you weren’t familiar with the characters the pilot lays it out in a smart, warm and clean way, and the show retains that vibe for 11 years, with a few exceptions"
Old Money,"I'm watching through cheers right now!

It's still great. Dated, yes. But overall great. I plan to go right into fraiser when I finish."
Old Money,Watch it! I love the shows you mentioned and Cheers is so enjoyable! And as a bonus it's fun to watch Frasier after if you haven't seen that show.
Old Money,"To tie in with Cheers, Frasier to my is one of the best shows and knowledge of Cheers is not fully needed."
Old Money,Because it aged much worse.
Old Money,Oh I knew I was forgetting one.
Old Money,Thanks! 📺👍
Old Money,"It a solid show, but definitely have to be in to Aaron Sorkin’s style for sure.  Agree S1>S2, but I enjoyed the addition of William H. Macy."
Old Money,At least you saw it. :)
Old Money,YES
Old Money,It's going to air this summer. ABC has four spots for comedies these days and too many shows.
Old Money,"I’m Larry, this is my brother Darryl, and this is my other brother Darryl"
Old Money,Has to be watched to the *end* after the first series.
Old Money,"I rewatched some early seasons of Bob Newhart not long ago, and I had almost forgotten just how delightfully dry and snarky Suzanne Pleshette could be as well. Bob and Emily were pretty much made for each other.

Edit: also, Chicagoans are apparently still going “WTF even is this commute” to the [opening credits](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=V-PLEhiOeVA) to this day."
Old Money,"Oh, you’re right. The third show was just “Newhart”."
Old Money,The more you know! 🌈
Old Money,Phil Hartman alone makes up for Rogan's modern day douchebaggery.
Old Money,"To this day people still use the ""fat ignorant husband married to hot thin smart woman"" trope that that show established."
Old Money,"Four spots for comedies. Ouch, that hurts my soul. And NBC didn’t even have a fall comedy I think a couple years ago. I hate this!"
Old Money,Best TV series finale ever!
Old Money,I mean I never said it wasn't influential. Just said it hasn't aged super well compared to a lot of other shows.
Old Money,"Fall 2021. It was the first time, I believe, in the history of NBC. They just can't get it together when it comes to comedies. They haven't had a hit comedy in years."
Old Money,"I don't need them to have hits though. It sucks that the system works like that.  The Good Place was one of the best comedies/shows of the last decade, Superstore deserved more love, etc."
Old Money,I get it but it is a business after all. That's why they don't have more on the schedule. The ideal would be to have successful shows that are good too. :)
Old Money,[deleted]
Old Money,"Great write up!


I'm not familiar with most of these, and I watch a shit-ton of TV and movies. I really like the effort, and the writeups are perfect in length.


Again, not knowing these a lot, is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show? (Nothing against non English speakers of course) 


Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.


Totally agree with the couple from White Lotus being great characters, I much preferred season 1 (which seems like a hot take) but those two, specifically the woman, were very interesting characters to me."
Be with You,I love that abed says he’s moving to LA to work on a show set in a video game studio all the way back in 2015
Be with You,"My favorite part of that episode is the [post credits scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMW58MiSLe0).  It's absolutely the perfect way to wrap up this show.  That being said, #andamovie"
Be with You,That second hug between Jeff and Abed is a great moment.
Be with You,"I can't watch the finale, it's really good but it just makes me so sad."
Be with You,Joel really improved as a dramatic actor as the show went on - really impressive work from him.
Be with You,Where is my movie though?!
Be with You,I just watched this half an hour ago cos I made [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/community/comments/p27mqs/what_a_dynamite_episode_of_television/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) last night.
Be with You,Good timing for me- I just finished my third watch-through last night (my roommate's first time watching the show). This wasn't one of the best finales out there but it was good. The only thing that would have made it absolutely perfect was Troy coming back - even if just for a minute. I remember the collective disappointment that came at the time. I'm sure I wasn't the only one secretly hoping a cameo had been arranged at the last minute.
Be with You,Loved this show. Wish everyone could let it go.
Be with You,I’m so gay for this ending….i can’t.
Be with You,Mind blown.

Be with You,Wow that Chuck Lorre rip was Chef’s Kiss.
Be with You,[deleted]
Be with You,"He honestly has never achieved some of the depth he has here, even in more dramatic roles. Either the directors on community got a lot out of him or it was very personal."
Be with You,Damn I wanted to upvote your post but it won't let me!
Be with You,"Its the TV show he's on now IRL. Mythic Quest, it's co-created by a Community writing alum."
Be with You,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythic_Quest#Cast_and_characters
Be with You,And ends with Dan Harmon acknowledging that he loves the audience. Ugh. I fucking can't stand how much I love community. And Rick and Morty. That broken man is a goddamn mega-genius.
Be with You,The funniest thing is that while being a rip on Lorre it is also 100% a rip on Harmon himself. I love Dan.
Be with You,Leeeegit gay. For reals gay
Be with You,"I mean, imagine being an actor on a show like Community for 6 years, how close I'm sure they became. The last season they knew it was the end, so they were also sort of saying goodbye to coworkers and close friends. It'd be easy to nail those kinds of scenes when you're feeling the exact emotions yourself that your character also feels.

if I got that out right. sorry, just got baked for the first time in months."
Be with You,I think he just really loved working with everyone on set
Be with You,I'm just sad that I can't find Great Minds anywhere to stream online anymore except for [1 episode](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4jh8em)
Be with You,"I remember just a few months after great minds came out you could find it on YouTube, but then they removed the whole series"

Be with You,It’s appropriate they announced this on a FRI-DAY NIGHT
Be with You,"Best news I’ve got all week

Gimme dat!"
Be with You,"Have you been the victim of unfair treatment by a business or a corporation? Has this ever happened to you? You bought a house, it was not disclosed to you that there was a termite infestation in the walls and in the moldings? So you have to take it upon yourself to call your own termite extermination company. But when the guys show up they immediately ask if they can use your bathroom.  Then for over two hours, they take turns going in and out of there taking huge mud pies and over flushing. Then they go in there TOGETHER and you hear a bunch of ScRoUnGiNg around and then you hear a bunch of YELLING and on of them is standing in the bathroom doorway shouting at you that his friends foot stuck in the toilet. And he says, ""help him, you gotta help him!"" and when you go in there to help him, he just pulls it out easily, and laughs 'cause his foot wAsN'T stuck. It wasn't stuck at all he was just faking it. And then they get REALLY serious, they say, ""IT'S TURBO TIME!"" and they both start running around the house as FaSt as they can and jumping over the couches. But when YOU try and jump in, they yell at you and they say ""YOU'RE NOT PART OF THE TURBO TEAM, DON'T RUN, DON'T RUN WITH US, WE'RE THE ONES WHO RUN! UNTIL YOU'RE APART OF THIS TURBO TEAM, WALK SLOWLY!"" 
So, you go and lay down to be by yourself and read your art books. But then the next day you went into the bathroom and it looked like the hole in your toilet had shrunked and you said, ""how could that be? There's no way they could have shrunk the toilet"" But then you saw in the trash, a receipt from Home Depot for a toilet, the exact same size as yours but with a JoKe HoLe ThAt""S JuSt FoR FaRtS. They replaced your real toilet with a fart toilet! And now you can't take a dump in your house 'CAUSE YOUR TOILET CAN'T SUCK'EM DOWN AND YOU FEEL SICK TO YOUR STOMACH!

Be with You,What a CROP. That's a CROP.
Be with You,"I’ve struggled to articulate why I find this show so funny, but the best way I could describe it is that all the jokes and characters are coming from a place that just barely makes sense. It’s teetering on the edge of nonsense.

Steven Universe,"I have my opinions about how off the rails they went after Change Your Mind (Even a slight reworking of Reunited to tie up some loose ends really would make a good finale) but the show at its peak really meant the world to me for awhile and a special room in my heart is reserved for SU at its best. 

Like I'm actually *not* a fan of how hindsight makes Pearl seem like a codependent mess here as opposed to someone who suffered a genuine loss that stings all the more because her feelings were unrequited, but as the latter it really is top notch. I was *heartbroken* for her when I first saw this, and Mr. Greg is still my favorite episode."
Steven Universe,"It's such a complex situation... Most shows couldn't do it well, if they dared even touch it... Most viewers probably haven't experienced anything like it. I certainly haven't. 

And along comes this kids cartoon that absolutely nails it with a 2.5 minute song and dance number. Wow. This episode gave me a whole new appreciation of Pearl. 

I almost decided not to watch the show at the last minute because it looked too childish. It's one of the best things I've ever seen."
Steven Universe,"That is my favourite episode. Live the entire show and future especially, but It's Over, Isn't It broke me. Outstanding song."
Steven Universe,"Def one of the most adult moments I can recall in a family cartoon, up to the Adventure Time Alzheimer’s allegory and Hey Arnold’s parental neglect in Helga’s therapy episode. This was the height of SU as a show, and was a major tearjerker in the context of the show."
Steven Universe,"My friend showed me this once, and having never seen the show, I had zero context for this song. And yet it still brought a tear to my eye. There was no way I was gonna pass on the show after that."
Steven Universe,That show as full of banger songs tbh.
Steven Universe,"What makes it worse is that she didn't really die, she's technically still there, just changed beyond recognition. This means Pearl has never been able to properly mourn or let go. Maybe she'd been hoping she'd come back some day, but every time she'd look at Steven all she could see was the crystal that used to be her friend."
Steven Universe,Wow. Never seen the show but this makes me want to watch. This is beautifully melancholy.
Steven Universe,It's my second favorite SU song. Pearl is so raw and real and open about how she feels. My heart hurt so bad for Greg and Steven but Pearl.... They had thousands of years together and then Rose was just gone and all that was left was little Steven. And despite all the pain Pearl was there for her son. Fricking love Pearl and Steven Universe.
Steven Universe,"“Now I have to be there for her son”

That line always hit hard. Even in normal humans, that situation would be tough. In Steven/Rose’s case, I can’t even imagine."
Steven Universe,I'm sad this era of animation is over thanks to HBO.
Steven Universe,I would like to point out that later episodes show that Pearl was literally Roses slave. So it’s a slave having feelings for her master and she’s so devoted to rose even after death and can’t get over it cause rose asked her to never stop feeling for her. I wouldn’t call any of this a good thing. I’m hindsight it makes this song seem really hollow.
Steven Universe,peak CN was dexters/cow/jhonny/pp girls/courage/eds not this
Steven Universe,"Steven Universe and it's sequel Steven Universe Future was quite possibly the most emotionally mature show in TV. Cartoon or live action included. It handled some incredibly deep issues so well that kis and their parents can both enjoy. 

The episodes of Steven Universe Future with the ""Steven Tag"" was heartbreaking from a parent's perspective and their kids growing up but was so good."
Steven Universe,"Wow, a lot wrong here.

First if all, it wasn't an unrequited love, they were together for thousands of years. Rose would love humans from time to time but eventually  she'd move on (or they'd die) and she'd be with Pearl again, as Pearl and Rose were effectively (barring an accident or murder) immortal.

Secondly, part of the uncertainty (""It's over isn't it? Isn't it? isn't it over?"") Comes from the uncertain status. Rose gave up her existence to create Steven, but is that absolutely the end? Might she return again, perhaps after Steven's life, if he proves mortal?

Died in childbirth and Pearl's love for Rose being unrequited, did you just watch like...that one episode?"
Steven Universe,Pink/Rose really messed Pearl up. Just so much damage and none of it hashed out before Steven was born. Poor soul.
Steven Universe,This show sucks.
Steven Universe,"Err... Pearl is a born slave with a toxic, almost pathetically dependent one-way relationship with a childish space Nazi. Steven Universe is a dark, inappropriate for children mess. The song is fine (some of them are good tbf), but Sugar's show is not okay in many ways. When Season 2 ended, it took an immediate nosedive. The series finale was the rotten cherry on top with the one-episode redemption arc of a genocidal villain.

Also... if fusion is meant to represent an... *intimate* bond between two or more Gems, what is going on between Steven and Connie (two underage kids) and Steven and Greg (father and son) when they fuse? ☠💀

EDIT: People downvoting en masse, but no one really seems to argue against my points mentioned here. Weird. :^)"
Steven Universe,I can't bring myself to watch Steven Universe after Steven implies that the Diamonds are family to him
Steven Universe,[deleted]
Steven Universe,CN stopped having any peaks about 2008
Steven Universe,[removed]
Steven Universe,"A pretty good quartet sang a pretty good arrangement of this at our international contest [this past summer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiChRPulzdc). 

I still haven't seen Steven Universe, so at the time I had no idea what it was from, or that it was even from anything, but the lyrics are so heartbreaking even without context."
Steven Universe,"Honestly the last moment I remember being impressed and moved by Steven Universe. I dropped it soon after this episode, it was just really starting to make me sad. It's plot had run it's course, the 10 minute long episode runtimes were killing it, and I just didn't think it was as good anymore. But there were some really amazing episodes, mostly focused on Pearl, Rose and Greg, that I'll always hold close to my heart."
Steven Universe,This episode fucked me up for a while- because it made me realize i was hanging onto a past relationship. Im happy to say i was able to move on and find new relationships. But i still think about that person everyday like the one that got away.
Steven Universe,"I swear I have some kind of misophonia variant. Musicals and such irrationally irritate me. I like music (particularly early 90s grunge), but when a song becomes part of the plot of something, I can't bear it."
Steven Universe,"Didn't like how From Here to Homeworld played out so fast, but the ending of the SU movie and Future left a satisfied taste in my mouth.

Wait, hang on...bit of phrasing there."
Steven Universe,"I remember my father, brother and I were having a conversation while I was trying to watch this episode. We all got quiet when this part came on. I was on the verge of tears, and then the conversation picked up like normal. The power of art."
Steven Universe,"Well, I think Pearl IS a codependent mess.  After all, she's a pearl, ""bred"" to be obedient to her diamond. Love came into play for Pearl, which just made kind of a mess of her head.  Part love, part obedient servant."
Steven Universe,"I have no context for anything you’ve just said, but your description of its effect upon you has left me wanting to give this series a try."
Steven Universe,"Future was fucking stupid in how in sets up a bunch of new plotlines that dont get resolved. 

Volleyball was a super important Pearl development and then she disappears. 

Bluebird was a random ass new threat that just disappears after vowing to kill Steven. 

PERIDOT AND LAPIS DON’T HAVE ANY DIALOGUE TOGETHER. Don’t know what the fuck Sugar was thinking"
Steven Universe,Help an ignorant and dumb man understand. What is this dynamic she’s singing about because I am way off with my guessing.
Steven Universe,"The big ""reveal"" with Steven at the end of the show in front of the diamonds legit makes me tear up every time I see it

The show gets a lot of flak, but it's really really solid"
Steven Universe,They also had to redraw the animation for Pearl because the voice actress put so much emotion into it. Epic acting move.
Steven Universe,"Steven Universe is a show just full of those.  One of my favorites, and that's coming from someone who was already grey of hair when he saw the first episode.

I do have to admit it took a while to grow on me, and for a long time it was just background noise I'd occasionally overhear around the younger folks. But then I caught little glimpses of the end of season 1 and got hooked."
Steven Universe,">Def one of the most adult moments I can recall in a family cartoon.

Then we get to ""Steven Universe: Future.""

That whole series fucked me up, man."
Steven Universe,"Oof, coming to realize later that Helga's mom was an alcoholic, her dad was a workaholic, and the favored child Olga was always on the bring of breaking because she felt so much pressure on her.

Helga woulda been the most relatable if she didn't have the creepy Arnold statue made of gum in the closet thing."
Steven Universe,Regular Show also did a good job with this. Mordecai spent the entire 8 seasons chasing Margaret before realizing it was just a silly crush and that they are better as friends than lovers and that he needed to move on.
Steven Universe,They did do that in a later episode when Steven was a baby and she tried taking his gem out. Shit got dark.
Steven Universe,"Season 1 is a bit wonky, a little too childish, but it gets going by season 2. Season 1 is instrumental for certain things to be meaningful later (most notably the Steven/Connie relationship, fusion and what the monsters they fight actually *are*, Greg's lack of wealth until this very episode, etc.). But you could start with a hand-selected list of episodes, a bigger fan will probably tell you it's *all* important but you can skip around season 1 and watch maybe 10 of its 52 episodes. Just watch in order by the time you get to season 1 finale."
Steven Universe,"The emotional intelligence of this ""kids show"" is staggering. Made me cry more than once."
Steven Universe,"I've heard one other song from this show and it was pretty damn good but I still can't separate the knowledge I have of the fandom from the show itself. Every time I think about watching the show I just get echoes of ""you're whitewashing this character that we decided is POC-coded because she's purrrrrrppppplllllleeeee"""
Steven Universe,*Discovery
Steven Universe,"You're correct. I loved SU at its peak but they really dropped the ball with the ending. You can't make the villains fascist mass-murderers and just redeem them at the end ""bEcAuse thEy'Re fAmiLy"". It's why I don't recommend the series to friends."
Steven Universe,"Regular Show, Adventure Time, Over the Garden Wall, etc. all received near-universal acclaim throughout their runs. It petered out a bit for me by the time OK KO came out (I really hate its animation style) but I watched these as a teenager and in college, give them a shot. CN Real was a dumb experiment and Adventure Time in particular revived the network in the public consciousness. I remember seeing the t-shirts throughout high school and not just by the nerdy kids.

HBO Max's desire to kill its staggering animation history makes it all the sadder that the last real CN show for kids *and* adults, Infinity Train, is only available on iTunes now and a persona non grata to David Zaslav due to residuals to animators."
Steven Universe,"Lol but it's fitting for SU....loads of double entendre in it.

But it's precisely the movie and Future I don't like....but then anything doubling down on the anti Rose agenda and leaving the Diamonds unshattered/unpunished would've left me fuming. Oh well, I am glad the other half of the fanbase enjoys."
Steven Universe,"Your people gave SU at least a few moments of their time?!

I can't get anyone in my circle to, but still I aspire to it one day. That sounds like a perfect moment."
Steven Universe,"Yeah I feel like people forget that the gems have some pretty stringent programming in the back of their minds that is shown to still be extremely present throughout characters we know.

“Do it for her” is still a massive demonstration of this she conveys all her feelings about obligation to rose and her willingness to disregard her own safety and to die to protect her and try’s to transfer all of that baggage onto Connie who she sees as the equivalent for Steven. 

And those things are conveyed much earlier than it’s over isn’t it.

Most of pearls arc throughout the show is learning to be her own person with her own needs, wants and desires instead of the ‘servant’ for rose(as was her original programming) and a ton of that requires her breaking out from that dependence on rose"
Steven Universe,"My issue I suppose is the show reinforcing anything done on Rose's part to make her feel that way, which makes it seem worse, more noticeable, and invalidating of the love she feels. Now We're Only Falling Apart should've been the final word on Rose's feelings on it, where she's depicted as being extremely uncomfortable with it and tries to shut it down at every turn. 

Yes any leaning into those feelings is suggestive of her ""purpose"" and how much she needs to move away from it, but I like the greater mix earlier parts of the show had where the love feels genuine and something you can root for, but not the subservience. Taking into account the show as a whole it's made it seem *all* subservience and I just think this song is less tragic that way, more ""pathetic,"" and I don't like it.

Do It For Her has been mentioned but it's brilliant because it can be read multiple ways. People who didn't literally serve a loved one in real life would still die for them if they needed to and we don't call that unhealthy, and by that point in the show you feel Rose would too if Pearl would allow it, and speaking for her is the problem rather than her dedication to her. This plays out with Steven aka Rose herself in a sense where he doesn't want to stop Connie from having his back, but wants to fight alongside her. 

This part of the show depicts Pearl's relationship with Rose as complicated, but coming from a place of real love and clarity. Those ""silly games"" with Greg mentioned shows real capacity for self-reflection so she knows deep down she has issues, but maybe casting the sum total of her feelings as the issue weakens the power of It's Over Isn't It. Just my two cents."
Steven Universe,"If you do end up enjoying it, remember to shoot me a message if you want, I'd really like to hear about it. :)"
Steven Universe,"Its a very long story.  Trying to keep it as short as I can, she was the right-hand to Rose Quartz and she developed feelings for her.  However, Rose Quartz eventually developed feelings for a human (Greg, Steven's father) and, in order for them to have a kid, Rose had to give up her 'gem' to her child, which means her death. Pearl (and the other crystal gems) also had to raise Steven afterwards as they had no idea what a Human/Gem hybrid could end up like.

Rose and Pearl were together a long time.  So the song is about her still trying to move on from Rose's passing, as well as her jealousy towards Greg."
Steven Universe,"She dedicated and changed her entire life for a woman she loved only to have her fall for someone else. But because she loved her so much, she dedicated herself to her love’s son after she died. Steven is a constant reminder that Rose is gone forever and a testament to what Pearl lost when Rose died."
Steven Universe,"I love Steven Universe: Future so much. It's so rare we ever get to see cartoon characters age (anything more than a one-off scene in the future is almost non existent), and it really allowed us to explore Steven's life from a new perspective. I feel like the main show was very heavily focused on the story of a child learning about the failings of his seemingly-perfect mother and having to right her wrongs, while Future really started letting Steven become his own person. The updates in character designs and behaviors were just the cherry on top"
Steven Universe,"Oh yeah, and what would you make the statue out of huh? Ramen?"
Steven Universe,Broken people becoming obsessed with someone they view as successful and can solve all of their problems is incredibly relatable.
Steven Universe,"I can't comment about any race related aspect of the show, but I rarely hear good things about the fandom.

They even bullied a fellow fan-artist into attempting suicide."
Steven Universe,This era ended even before AT&T even involved.
Steven Universe,I mean you gotta admit that is all very much in brand for who stevens character is.
Steven Universe,The end shows that the diamonds are all working hard to be better. They're not just magically forgiven now.
Steven Universe,"I mean, it’s also pretty easy to recommend the show up through the wedding with the caveat that everything after doesn’t handle the antagonists well 🤷‍♂️"
Steven Universe,While it may not have been as satisfying for you you have to admit that Steven forgiving and rehabilitating the diamonds is 100% on brand for him.
Steven Universe,"The show had just reached its half-way point when it was cancelled following the wedding episode, everything else was concessions Sugar was able to get from Cartoon Network to wrap up loose ends.  They had no choice but to wrap it up fast :(

As for the anti Rose agenda, something they never got the chance to explore was how Steven had been learning about his mom's life in reverse, from how she was right before he was born to the spoiled monster she was when she was very young.  She had a fantastic character arc, just told in reverse.  I think there would have been an episode about realizing and grappling with this.  His mom was a wonderful person deep down, she just had to break from her toxic childhood household to become that.

Im super happy to see that the show has touched so many people, even when they didnt super enjoy the post-cancel stuff"
Steven Universe,"Yeah, I think when you include the movie and Future the show ends up having pretty great pacing.  Starts slow, builds in bursts of  expanded lore mixed with periods of downtime, suddenly you are going through a resolution you didn't expect, but then there's time to grow into it and move on."
Steven Universe,"I just found it this year, is there any other shows you’d recommend?"
Steven Universe,"I can't get over that the show's premise hinges on the fact that essentially a woman committed suicide in order to have a baby so the love of her life could be a single father, rather than just not doing that so they could live together as a couple. 

Like... does it make more sense in the show?"
Steven Universe,"I'm not sure about ""developed feelings for her"" is right. Because one of the problems of the show is that Pearl was specifically designed to obey her superior. In this case, Pearl was always supposed to be kinda obssesed with RQ/PD. By default, she was always gonna be by Rose's side no matter what. I think this is why some fans were upset by the big reveal."
Steven Universe,"So she’s Snape 2.0?

I feel like I’m right but Steven Universe Stan’s can’t take the comparison, oh noooo it wasn’t a totally original idea"
Steven Universe,Oh shit I had it right. That is a pretty complicated character for 2010 cartoon.
Steven Universe,Snape vibes.
Steven Universe,"I think the ending was fitting, but the way it was done in the ""shippuden"" was not great, also the villain of the movie was kinda reviving a plot that was already finished, which seemed like a ""do it for money"" type of movie."
Steven Universe,"I'm not sure if there would've been that episode or not, but I did notice the reason Steven and so many fans who eat up anything vilifying Rose is because her story was told backwards. But Greg nailed it when he said at some point, I forget when exactly in the story, that who she was then doesn't matter, it's who she was when they met that counted. I feel like more characters, including Steven and including Sapphire when she and Ruby split apart, should've taken that to heart more quickly.

But I'm not judging by the show by what they should've done or perhaps would've done, it's just I hate where they leave us with Rose. Big swatches of the early emotional thrusts in the series mean less when that person is depicted as being as bad as they would later treat her. Your last bit is spot on though, for my gripes and for how imperfect I feel the show is as a whole, it does mean a lot to me."
Steven Universe,"She-Ra definitely (Reboot), and Infinity Train. :)"
Steven Universe,"I second Reboot She-Ra.

Also the Owl House and Gravity Falls.  All 3 of these has some similar emotionally heavy themes as Steven Universe,  especially Owl House. These are shoes that both adults and kids love and get different things out of. 

Also another surprisingly emotionally mature cartoon is Helluva Boss and Hazbin Hotel on YouTube. The are adults only due to themes and language but are surprisingly emotionally mature in ways that adult shows like Family Guy are not."
Steven Universe,"BoJack Horseman.  Adventure Time. 

And Yes! Love for Infinity Train!!"
Steven Universe,"It does with...later revelations.

>!Rose Quartz wasn't actually who she said she was. She was actually Pink Diamond and was tasked with colonizing the earth for Gem kind...by wiping out all organic life. She refused and created an alter ego (Rose) to lead a rebellion (the Crystal Gems) against...well, against herself. She was playing both sides. Eventually she faked her death by making it look like Rose killed Pink. She figured the other Diamonds wouldn't care, and she could now live in peace on earth as Rose Quartz!<

>!Bad news. The other Diamonds *did* care. They launched an attack on earth that drove 99% of the Crystal Gems mad, turning them into mindless monsters. Only Rose and a couple others survived. For thousands of years they've been fighting these monsters, their own fallen comrades, to protect earth. And ""Rose"" knows that she's responsible for all of it. Giving up her life to create someone new, someone who can live free on earth as she wanted to, but without the centuries of guilt and trauma, is her way of finally achieving peace!<

Yeah, it's pretty heavy stuff for a kids show."
Steven Universe,"Rose's feelings for Greg are questionable. She doesn't ever really understand human love.  Her love for Greg at least on screen is more of a fascination, like an alien studying what humans are like. She is an alien after all. 

She falls in love with Earth and the human race's ability to grow and change, since gems are born for a single purpose and are not meant to change. A human being growing and changing is the greatest thing she had ever seen, and that's what she wanted to experience and give to Greg and Steven."
Steven Universe,Yea I mean. I think rose knew that her cause was best represented and achieved by a half human half gem who is raised surrounded by love. She believed he could do what she couldn’t.
Steven Universe,"Just saying, some women go through delicate pregnancies, so this situation is very real, idk why you would think it's nonsensical."
Steven Universe,Except Pearl tale care of steven after the death of Rose
Steven Universe,"She was also created to be a slave and given to Rose (a member of the monarchy) who started encouraging her to have her own thoughts and feelings and talking to her like a friend... but still very much treated Pearl like her sidekick and assumed Pearl would do what she said. Most prominently and horribly when she made Pearl participate in faking Rose's murder, and gave a magically compelling order for it to be kept secret which was still in effect thousands of years later, even after Rose's death - like, we eventually see Pearl trying to break the order and tell Steven what happened, and she's repeatedly forced to shut herself up. It's kind of disturbing.

Pearl's love for Rose was all mixed up with the servant role she was created to play, and as much as she missed and grieved Rose, I also don't think their relationship was healthy and equal, or that she really got to be her own independant person until after Rose died."
Steven Universe,"Except Pearl doesn't go around abusing children, and convincing Steven she hates him."
Steven Universe,"Damn, that's some real heavy shit right there."
Steven Universe,Holy fuck that’s indeed a show worthy of the praise it gets then. I always thought it was one of those things the internet gets insanely attached to for no apparent reason but that summary changed my mind.
Steven Universe,The sucky thing is Steven ended up inheriting all those problems.
Steven Universe,"I've seen enough anime to know this is not the most traumatic thing shown to kids through animation by a long shot 

But that's an interesting plot"
Steven Universe,Didn't Snape do the same of Harry after Lily's death?
Steven Universe,Sweet Jebus.
Steven Universe,">Except Pearl doesn't go around abusing children

Not intentionally, hard to argue her training of Connie didn't at least border on abuse"
Steven Universe,"""Dang Steven, when did you get so mature?""

""Right around the time I learned my mom was a war criminal."""
Steven Universe,To be fair its not a perfect show. Pacing is off and too many deux ex machinas. But the plot and world building is fascinating.
Steven Universe,"The show really throws out conventional storytelling structure for a kids fantasy show (the central mystery of the show revolves around a deceased character who we only ever learn about from the incomplete pov of other characters revealed and foreshadowed across five seasons, and that’s just one story thread) and I think it mostly but not entirely succeeds."
Steven Universe,One thing I really appreciate is they don't shy away from how awful Rose often was. But it's not like you find out she was secretly a villain or something. She's just a very complex sometimes very selfish person.
Steven Universe,Generational trauma is a bitch.
Steven Universe,"Taking care as in building a house,living with and raising Steven."
Steven Universe,"No, she actually becomes one of his primary caretakers, the episode this song is from is also all about her bonding over shared grief with Greg, Steven's father who rose ""left"" Pearl for"
Steven Universe,Isn't this literally dialogue from the show?
Steven Universe,"It definitely isn't a perfect show, but also to be fair CN didn't exactly make it easy for them to manage their pacing"
Steven Universe,"Rose isn’t awful, she was a messed up child who rebelled and ran away from her family as a teenager and grew up to be a loving but flawed and regretful adult. She just lived in a society with no concept of childhood or growing up. Actually, now that I think about it, Greg had a pretty similar relationship with his parents (overbearing, ran away, estranged), just without the cosmic consequences, but it makes it more obvious why they made sense together."
Steven Universe,"Yes, hence the quotes."
Marvels Luke Cage,***Sweeeeeet Christmas***
Marvels Luke Cage,I'm really excited for this show. Netflix marvel shows have killed it so far.
Marvels Luke Cage,Wonder who his main villain is gonna be. Both of the ones so far were phenomenal. 
Marvels Luke Cage,"Luke Cage is going to be a great opportunity to show one of the best black superheroes on his own terms.  I'm really looking forward to this, especially after his portrayal in JJ."
Marvels Luke Cage,"I can't wait. I am assuming we will see Iron Fist and Jessica Jones S2 in 2017, then finally get Defenders in early 2018."
Marvels Luke Cage,More like Locke Cage. 
Marvels Luke Cage,He's gonna go all Lexington Steele on Jessica Jones
Marvels Luke Cage,"I'm getting married that day. Need to figure a way out of it, I guess."
Marvels Luke Cage,Spartan Locke reporting for duty!
Marvels Luke Cage,What are the differences between Luke Cage's powers vs Jessica Jones'?
Marvels Luke Cage,Terry Crews wanted to be Luke Cage. :(
Marvels Luke Cage,Hopefully the fight scenes are better than Jessica Jones
Marvels Luke Cage,I just need some more sweet sweet (Christmas) Jessica Jones.
Marvels Luke Cage,I'm pumped for Luke Cage but I'm curious how they'll make Luke Cage S1 not seem like Jessica Jones S2. 
Marvels Luke Cage,Spartan Locke versus Cage. Go! 
Marvels Luke Cage,Marvel take over is real
Marvels Luke Cage,"1975 Cincinnati Ohio I was in 4th grade in an all white elementary school.  I discovered comic books and avidly read iron man and spiderman...and then I came across Lucas Cage...purple pants, yellow shirt, blaxploitation speak, obsessed with getting paid, punchin out ""suckas"".  I thought it was awesome and wished I was black so I could be that cool.

I think the TV show might shy away from the Lucas Cage that I loved..."
Marvels Luke Cage,"Come on I mean I can't be the only guy who found the potrayal and the character really stiff and boring. I'm not familiar with the comic character, although what I got off Jessica Jones, he doesn't seem that complex or troubled to provide an exciting premise for a whole show only based on him."
Marvels Luke Cage,"Any website with any type of automatic overlay (ad or autoplay), video or image, I instantly hit back and I will never go to that site again."
Marvels Luke Cage,Since Nicolas Cage named himself after Luke Cage I really wish he was offered a part in the show. Missed opportunity. 
Marvels Luke Cage,I don't think this will be better than the other two shows but I still think it will be a solid show.
Marvels Luke Cage,This is going to be amazing.  And now this means we will see Jessica Jones earlier than we would have otherwise. 
Marvels Luke Cage,"Apparently Mahershala Ali is in this. He's such a good actor and it's nice to see him get some bigger roles (Hunger Games, House of Cards)"
Marvels Luke Cage,"That's awesome news, I was expecting a November release like JJ. If they keep this rate up we could see The Defenders in the summer 2017."
Marvels Luke Cage,"I'm going to try to only watch one Daredevil episode per day... But who am I kidding, I'll probably watch the whole thing in 2 days."
Marvels Luke Cage,Damn that's fast. It's a great year to be looking forward to
Marvels Luke Cage,"I was a bit cool on the idea of this show in general, but after a great showing in Jessica Jones, I'm really looking forward to seeing what happens next with Luke Cage. It might be my favourite iteration of the character so far."
Marvels Luke Cage,Someone do math! When can we expect to see a trailer?
Marvels Luke Cage,"Sweet, right when Twitchcon is happening, should be good times."
Marvels Luke Cage,"Netflix makes sense as the newest platform for comic books. Damn, comic books have gotten fancy!"
Marvels Luke Cage,They just finished wrapping up a fight scene in my neighborhood of bedstuy Brooklyn. Sadly I couldn't get close to the set :(
Marvels Luke Cage,"I sincerely hope that Jessica Jones spends as much time in this series as Luke spent in her series -- the two characters are as important together as they are apart. 

In fact, I rather like the idea of thinking of the two series as a single series, just with a little more screen time for the title character. "
Marvels Luke Cage,I NEED some Danny Rand in my life. Marvel/Netflix PLEASE!!!
Marvels Luke Cage,"Really excited for this. Can we move the release date up? Wait. Let me finish Jessica Jones, and Dare Devil first. I can wait. "
Marvels Luke Cage,"Perhaps someone familiar with the series can chime in. Is Luke Cage going to be one of those shows with huge drawn out fights that seem to last forever? or more like jessica jones?

Part of the reason I loved jessica jones was because it didn't feel all super heroey with 10 minutes long fights and people getting hit over and over and over and over. While there was still a little bit of that in jessica jones, it seemed very well done and didn't seem to the be focal point."
Marvels Luke Cage,Am I alone in thinking this guy was terrible in Jessica Jones?  His character could have been cool and he made it look so silly.    
Marvels Luke Cage,"I can't say I'm super excited about this. I'll obviously give him a shot but I thought his actor especially was really boring, bland and one dimensional in Jessica Jones. Every time it cut away from Jessica and Kilgrave I would get bored immediately. I even found the blond and the cops relationship more interesting. But hey he didn't really have much development in JJ though so I'll hold onto a little hope."
Marvels Luke Cage,i hope its better than jj
Marvels Luke Cage,"I am looking forward to this, although I like disco Luke Cage better!"
Marvels Luke Cage,C'mon people let's get a squirrel girl cameo.
Marvels Luke Cage,"I'm so really thankful and grateful to have made it this far in my life for me to be living in a sort of golden age where everything comic book related is coming to life on the silver screen or at home. Next week I'm watching Daredevil S2 and the week after BvS in imax, by myself of course cos I haven't met anyone who I can discuss with on a deeper level further than the primitive talk about who would win in a fight. I'm grateful for reddit cos my double life as I call it haha gets to come out and nerd all over these type of news and trailers. "
Marvels Luke Cage,Am I the only one suffering from comic book show overload? 
Marvels Luke Cage,"Some of these comments are astoundingly moronic, even for Reddit."
Marvels Luke Cage,"Man, I don't hate Luke Cage, he was fine as a guest star on JJ but as a main character, I just don't think his character could drive a whole show. "
Marvels Luke Cage,"But why? Skin color aside, he's a completely uninteresting and generic character."
Marvels Luke Cage,Oh fuck yes. I don't know much about Cage outside of the last ten years and that makes me very curious for this show. 
Marvels Luke Cage,"Might be going against the grain here... Luke was a terrible actor and I really didnt find his character interesting at all. Then again, its pretty hard to top the amazingness that is David Tennants Killgrave"
Marvels Luke Cage,A Warcraft expansion AND LUKE Cage in September ? RIP college GPA
Marvels Luke Cage,Alfre Woodard as Black Mariah?!?! How did I not know this. She's a badass. 
Marvels Luke Cage,Anyone here know if there are plans to bring the Avengers/Defenders universes together in any meaningful way? A defenders appearance would be badass in one of the upcoming movies but I would understand if they wanted to keep them mostly seperate
Marvels Luke Cage,"I might as well quit my job right now, I'm never going to leave my house at this point "
Marvels Luke Cage,Nick Cage's son?
Marvels Luke Cage,"So he's super strong and indestructible like the Hulk, but sane and reasonable. Who are his enemies?"
Marvels Luke Cage,"DC responds with serialized ""Nic Cage"" show. "
Marvels Luke Cage,I bet Nicolas Cage is excited
Marvels Luke Cage,Dr. Luke's Cage ?
Marvels Luke Cage,"They have been frequently filming near our apt, usually on Lenox btw 119 and 121, and usually at night "
Marvels Luke Cage,Happy birthday to me. I get a big black guy. 
Marvels Luke Cage,Out of all the Marvel TV series I'm just not interested in this one at all. Is the character really interesting enough to have his own series??
Marvels Luke Cage,Thank you for making my friday enjoyable 
Marvels Luke Cage,Can't wait to see him take some bullets in stride and tag some more hot white girls.
Marvels Luke Cage,Freakin' motherlover
Marvels Luke Cage,They were filming in my nabe a couple of weeks ago. Super short scene but now I gotta watch the whole series to see the bodega I go to all the time on my way to work. 
Marvels Luke Cage,What an amazing birthday present for me!
Marvels Luke Cage,i guess a white actor wasn't good enough to play this its racist 
Marvels Luke Cage,Way to make a front page post out of the top comment of the day lol
Marvels Luke Cage,Yes! I remember using Luke Cage in MUA games.
Marvels Luke Cage,[deleted]
Marvels Luke Cage,Interesting to see yet another series taking place in Hell's Kitchen. The MCU is growing
Marvels Luke Cage,I'm a littler more than halfway into daredevil and I have to say I don't really get all the love. It's an okay show but it's not terrific on any level. I'm hoping Jessica Jones is better
Marvels Luke Cage,"Though the quality of the final products is debatable, the film industry is getting REAL DAMN GOOD at casting actors as superheroes/villains that really ""look the part."" Heath Ledger, Henry Cavill, Tom Hardy, Ben Affleck, Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, Stephen Amell, and now Michael Colter. 

If only someone would just as perfectly cast a Spiderman, I could be at peace.
"
Marvels Luke Cage,*sigh* I was really hoping for Michael Jai White.
Marvels Luke Cage,I would like to see Kilgrave have his own show. 
Marvels Luke Cage,"I have to say, this guy was the one thing that I didn't like about Jessica Jones. The actor is no where near Hell's Kitchen street enough to play Luke Cage imo. Far too Hollywood."
Marvels Luke Cage,"I feel like luke, at least how he was portrayed in Jessica Jones is too shallow a character to make a show over. Id expect a better superhero shoe from Trish Parker if im honest..."
Marvels Luke Cage,i hope the costume reveal isn't nearly as bad as daredevil's
Marvels Luke Cage,"Hell yeah, Jessica Jones was fucking epic. This is going to be epic too. "
Marvels Luke Cage,"About time!!!  Jessica jones was great and all, but as soon as i realized luke cage was in the show I was like ""WTF didn't they make it a luke cage show."" Super excited. "
Marvels Luke Cage,They better hire an Asian actor to play Luke.
Marvels Luke Cage,"I hope it's better than Jessica Jones. I didn't like that one, but I have peculiar fears, and it managed to hit some of the biggest ones."
Marvels Luke Cage,Day after my birthday! Presents for me?
Marvels Luke Cage,"I hope there's a villain that's more interesting/better actor than Donofrio. 

goddamn that was a terrible Kingpin"
Marvels Luke Cage,Jessica Jones sucked and this will be awful. 
Marvels Luke Cage,Why?
Marvels Luke Cage,hopefully it isn't complete garbage like jessica jones
Marvels Luke Cage,[deleted]
Marvels Luke Cage,"Hell yes! I really enjoyed the character in Jessica Jones, which was just awesome to begin with."
Marvels Luke Cage,Yessss I'm so excited!! Loved his character in JJ
Marvels Luke Cage,I did not expect to enjoy his character nearly as much as I did in Jessica Jones. I'm highly anticipating this now.
Marvels Luke Cage,Why is this on /r/television? :P 
Marvels Luke Cage,Well that was quick
Marvels Luke Cage,Will he be naked?
Marvels Luke Cage,will the superhero movies/tv go the way of the westerns already!!! 
Marvels Luke Cage,Wait why does he have to be played by a black actor? Why can't an Asian play that role? This shit is making me disgusted. 
Marvels Luke Cage,"Why does the article refer to him as an ex con?  They don't mention that in the show, it'd be great if the big scary black man wasn't a convict....or moving to Harlem.   It'd probably be good, just sounds like a blaxploitation plot when you say it like that.  Maybe he quit the CIA to be a pimp?
"
Marvels Luke Cage,Halo 5 kind of ruined that actor for me. Every time he showed up on Jessica Jones I would cringe just because of how bad his character was in that game.
Marvels Luke Cage,I hope it is better than that overrated piece of shit Jessica jones nonsense. 
Marvels Luke Cage,Awesome!  Who is Luke Cage?
Marvels Luke Cage,"I have a feeling the comic book thing will go out as quickly as it came in, and soon"
Marvels Luke Cage,I look forward to a lot of ethnic humor.  
High School DxD,"There is good American animation and there is bad American animation. There is good Japanese animation and bad Japanese animation. The best American animation is comparable to the best Japanese animation, and the worst American animation is comparable to the worst Japanese animation. You can't really generalize."
High School DxD,"Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo have some of my favorite animation ever.  Meanwhile near the end Dragon Ball Super had no issue with shoving thirty people on the screen and have all of them but the one talking be COMPLETELY MOTIONLESS for entire conversations, or having a ""fight"" scene that is just the same three frames of Goku looped over and over and over.

Trying to encapsulate ""anime"" in to one thing that can be declared good or bad is ridiculous."
High School DxD,"yeah it's bullshit, Quality varies in both anime and western animation, even Disney who are thought to be high quality have blatently recycled animation in the past:

High School DxD,*Ned's Declassified* was basically a kid-friendly version of *Scrubs*. I hope Devon gets more consistent work because he was always funny on his show.
High School DxD,"He sounds like he has a good head on his shoulders. I loved his show, I hope he finds his way...perhaps outside of Hollywood."
High School DxD,"I loved (and still do) Ned’s Declassified when I was a preteen, and thought Devon had potential as a decent actor. I had wondered what became of him after the show ended and am surprised to hear he’s been floating around without much direction. I’m close to his age and am also trying to find my place in my career, so I identify with him. 

At least he’s in a much better place than the actors who go nuts and destroy their lives with drugs and scandals. He just needs some direction and training, it seems, but I think he’d do well. He seems like a decent person."
High School DxD,"i was a little too old when they came out, but i caught maybe 5-8 episodes here and there and everytime I saw it, it was hilarious. Like, they'd play random 20 second songs out of no where. Like P Cookie: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/3Jaajq-DHTE

or even the like 5 second songs like when they decide to wear disguises for some reason and then to cuts to them walking with a song going ""we got disguises! what!? you can't recognize me! yeah!"""
High School DxD,Interesting story but it is essentially an ad for his podcast.
High School DxD,"Suzie Crabgrass was one of my childhood crushes 🤣. But for real, Ned's Declassified was such a good show."
High School DxD,"The fact that the main trio, hell, all the sctors didn't go big is a damn shame, everyone was so freaking funny in that show.

C'mon Paramount+, do a revival with them surviving adulthood."
High School DxD,"Ned's Declassified Adult Survival Guide maybe? If so please send me a copy.   


There is a bunch of kid actor's who I thought for sure would have great adult careers but haven't. I do wonder why that is. It probably hasn't helped a lot has changed on TV and movies where the number comedies has decreased while the number of superhero and dramas has increased. They may have to look to someone like Chris Pratt who transformed themselves to get those bigger and better roles."
High School DxD,"Live action shows on Nick without a laugh track are usually so much better.

Pete & Pete, The Secret World of Alex Mack, Salute Your Shorts, The Troop, Mr. Meaty, Big Time Rush, Ned's Declassified, Supah Ninjas."
High School DxD,"""Adulting"""
High School DxD,"Meanwhile, Suzie Crabgrass went on to kill a bunch of zombies."
High School DxD,I loved this show as a kid and tbh I’m surprised his career didn’t take off. He was in Greek for a bit I remember later. And I saw him in some random Netflix film too with King Bach a couple years ago.
High School DxD,Id be down to watch a Ned's declassified life survival guide
High School DxD,"They should make ""Ned's declassified life survival guide."""
High School DxD,I loved that show and watched it with my daughter! “Cowboy Cookie” still cracks me up!
High School DxD,Dude should take a page from that kid from A Christmas Story and become a producer.
High School DxD,I watched this show. Always enjoyed an episode. 😁❤️👍🏾
High School DxD,"I mean, how many people really have successful acting careers, even after having had one or two parts in mainstream productions? Very few people are movie stars. It's a pretty small club, and just being in one show or movie is no guarantee of further success."
High School DxD,"He sounds just like the rest of us. Check back in at 35 and tell me how it’s panning out, guy. I wish you luck. 👍🏽"
High School DxD,As a kid I had no experience with acting and still don't but when they did the casting for the show my mom forced me to try out a role as the bully. I was a socially awkward kid lol so I obviously didn't get the part but I remember seeing the actor that later portrayed him which was neat.
High School DxD,"If I never hear the word ""adulting"" again, it will be too soon."
High School DxD,I would watch a Ned's declassified Adult survival guide.
High School DxD,Ned's Declassified Workplace Survival Guide
High School DxD,Ned’s Declassified Adult Survival Guide anyone?
High School DxD,as a nonactor me too.
High School DxD,"Huh, I remember that show. I used to watch it after school when it was in rotation"
High School DxD,I had a bit of a crush on him back in the day hehe
High School DxD,"First failure: saying ""adulting"" unironically. Anyone who says that shit is verifiably not an adult."
High School DxD,there’s also that actress who was a part of it who’s like huge in porn now
High School DxD,"Nickelodeon shows rarely lead to long-term careers, which is much better than Disney shows which often lead to pornography and several stints in rehab."
High School DxD,Show creator Scott Fellows should revive the series since he already revived Johnny Test on Netflix.
High School DxD,Doesn’t realized he pitched a brilliant tv series by accident just by saying that.
High School DxD,The entertainment and film industry is really difficult to grow up in.
High School DxD,"I would love a reboot of this one, way more than most other reboots we’ve got."
High School DxD,"Ned’s Declassified Adult Survival Guide 

Bring the cast back, I’d gladly watch"
High School DxD,"I always compare it more to Community. But yeah, I agree. I’d love to see him back in something zany like that."
High School DxD,"He should take a page from Zach Braff and get into film production to make his own work.  It'll be starting off in Indie, which is to put it lightly *rough*.  However, he is a minor celebrity.  I am sure he can make it work compared to most of us in film/tv who are trying our best and only really being creative in *indie filmmaking.*"
High School DxD,"There was a period of my life where if you had put the Janitors from both shows side by side, I would not have been able to tell you which one was which."
High School DxD,I had a preference for Cowboy Cookie.
High School DxD,The sound effects department worked overtime in that show
High School DxD,This whole sub has just become ads lol
High School DxD,"If you are seeing an interview with some celebrity that you haven’t heard about in a while or have never heard about 9.5 times out of 10 it is just a PR piece for some new project. Usually it’s an article about some story of theirs that can be connected to current event/news or social trend and then their new project.

Edited typos/grammar"
High School DxD,That’s how PR works. You attach your brand to a compelling story and send it to the press.
High School DxD,"Also a way for Business Insider to squeeze in 10 other articles on this interview even remotely similar to what Devon was talking about (several of them old), from Georgia being a favorable movie production state (summer 2019), Devon reuniting with his NDSSG costars Lindsey Shaw & Daniel Curtis Lee for a TikTok video a month ago (December 2022), some Nickelodeon stars struggling to find work unlike other breakout stars/alumni on the network (January 2023), and actors getting paid little to nothing for their famous work in general (May 2021).

Kind of the same thing how daytime (or night time) talk shows have famous people on almost every day of the week. High certainty they’re on to plug their next project, a new book/podcast, or perform live (singers/band) rather than talk about their favorite foods or opining about their personal life. PR teams work wonders, and whether Devon has one or struck lucky to pitch this himself for BI to pick this up, at least we’ve read/talked about it. Probably would give his podcast a try."
High School DxD,"Yep, most shows don't need podcasts"
High School DxD,"i mean, she did age well, proff can be found in TWD"
High School DxD,"The actress Lindsey Shaw went on to do the series adaptation of 10 things I hate about you as well as become a recurring character on Pretty Little Liars.

Edit: she was moze on the show"
High School DxD,The actress who played Susie Crabgrass went on to play a fairly big role in The Walking Dead iirc
High School DxD,Lindsey Shaw has constantly been in loooooooooooooooooots of stuff
High School DxD,"Austin Butler (Elvis) was in the show too, as Zippy Brewster or something, a background character, but he went on to do really well as Elvis"
High School DxD,The original cast has tried to pitch this to Nickelodeon but they don’t own the rights to the show and Nick passed on the idea
High School DxD,"Ok, I’m not saying that I want this show, but I do want to say that if they do it, and they don’t give Coconut Head the best glow-up ever, I don’t want to watch it."
High School DxD,This idea is brilliant. Just like with grade school there is so much absurdity in adult life that kind of gets pushed under the rug. I think it could be interesting to have a similar framework as the original show to play with that in a more direct and constructive way than most sitcoms.
High School DxD,"""Cooper Barrett's Guide to Surviving Life"" was essential adult Neds Declassified, but it got cancelled after one season."
High School DxD,Drake Bell doesn't care for an adult version.
High School DxD,You forgot *Hey Dude*
High School DxD,Definitely ready for that word to die.
High School DxD,yippee yippee yeehaw!!!
High School DxD,"And they always mean incredibly basic things like doing laundry and paying bills. Never the tough things like fighting with the insurance company to cover cancer treatment, trying to get speech therapy for your kid, or caring for a disabled parent."
High School DxD,It's the seventh commandment for a reason people
High School DxD,Normally I find these takes kind of lame but I have such an irrational hatred for that word that I'm right there with you
High School DxD,I’m glad someone said it.
High School DxD,Coconut Head?
High School DxD,Who?
High School DxD,posting this and not saying the name?
High School DxD,Yeah I had always thought of community as Ned's declassified but for adults.
High School DxD,"Yeah I think the biggest issue for him would funding, Zach Braff was making at one point $350,000 per episode of scrubs, so he had the capital of a few million bucks of his own to spend on production. Not to say that indie filmmakers don’t have it tough, but Zach at least had the cash to spend"
High School DxD,"The sound departament was on point, the cherry on the top for sure."
High School DxD,The Internet is ads

Spice and Wolf,I hated this character right up until this very scene and then I was blown away by this performance. The writing and directing just added to how good it is. I think it's got to be up there with some of the best stuff we've seen in Star Trek.
Spice and Wolf,"Man, did they replace the entire writing team or something? The difference between this season and the first two is night and day.

For a while now, I've thought it was kind of weird for Michael Chabon of all people to be involved with this show. I've enjoyed several of his novels, and he does have numerous writing credits on other projects, but it always seemed like an odd fit to me. Did he approach them or did they approach him?

My personal theory is that, as a veteran writer and screenwriter, Michael Chabon was there specifically to take everyone else's spontaneous and somewhat conflicting ideas and somehow help develop that hodge-podge amalgamation into something that made sense. Which sounds like a miserable nightmare. The show had ""too many cooks"" written all over it."
Spice and Wolf,Star Trek: Picard is a true successor to TNG in the sense that we had to wait until season 3 for it to get really good.
Spice and Wolf,"The actor playing shaw is really good.

They can definitely do a series with shaw and seven continuing the journey on the titan"
Spice and Wolf,"Could somebody please, **please** buy the production a f-ing light-bulb? Is that part of the legally-mandated-percent-difference in a contract somewhere? Are they trying to hide terrible sets?"
Spice and Wolf,"Shaw is the most understandable asshole I've seen on television in awhile. He's been right every step of the way while Picard and Riker kept fucking up. The first two seasons of Picard are unwatchable* trash, but this one has been surprisingly good."
Spice and Wolf,"“I’m sorry I tried to kill you, I was possessed by an evil alien entity at the time” is such a common apology in Star Trek there’s probably a section at Hallmark. No one is blaming Keiko O’Brien for trying to murder the Prophets while possessed by a Pah Wraith, we didn’t spend weeks on the Voyager tiptoeing around Kes because she might try to conquer the galaxy again like when she was being mind controlled by a dead dictator, and none of the people possessed by an ancient mask with the power to reshape their surroundings into an ancient temple got thrown in the brig for nearly killing everyone.  Why does Picard get so much shit for the time the Borg used him as a hand puppet?"
Spice and Wolf,Can this season be watched without seeing the previous 2?  I bailed s1e2.
Spice and Wolf,"wow, first time i've seen a nuTrek clip kind of trend. 👏"
Spice and Wolf,"I'd really love a Shaw series, most boring explorative mission in the history of Starfleet"
Spice and Wolf,You knows it’s good when even those schlubs over at RLM liked it.
Spice and Wolf,"""The only Borg so deadly the gave him a goddamn name"" is not one of my favorite Star Trek lines, just under ""Its a cellular peptide cake, with mint frosting"""
Spice and Wolf,I enjoyed the first season. I stopped watching season 2 after the third or fourth episode. I’m liking the new season
Spice and Wolf,[Now I know why they named him Shaw.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9S41Kplsbs)
Spice and Wolf,Why is it so dark in Star Trek now.
Spice and Wolf,He can not hate Picard more then Picard hates himself for his failure on that day and allowing himself to become a Borg. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuzoxcErOc8
Spice and Wolf,"This is good. I liked the episode.
But this is borrowed. We've already seen a captain (commander at the time) having an issue with Picard because of Wolf 359. I wish Trek would do something new. They keep referencing things over and over."
Spice and Wolf,"Wolf 359 is, of course, the darkly destructive planet that evolved as the result of a scientific experiment in season 2 episode 8 of the old ""The Outer Limits"" TV show."
Spice and Wolf,"I mean yeah, the backstory explains his behavior, but to me that didn’t excuse him from being an asshat.  :)"
Spice and Wolf,"I know this is nu-trek and I have to adjust my expectations of what a show with Star Trek in the title is BUT…everyone, without exception, is a *violent, emotional idiot*. 

I felt the entire character is so hacky and forced. 

Taking capt sisko’s backstory and giving it to another character was pretty lame. At least change the details a little! 

And sisko had more depth. There was the overdone survivor guilt angle, but also his desire to protect his remaining family and *leaving starfleet*

If you’re still *that* bitter 20+ years after the fact *and* still in the same organization that overwhelmingly praises the man that you solely blame for a significantly tragic moment in your life….how did this man reach captain? Oh right…you have to a violent emotional idiot to be a starfleet officer

This is not even close to what Star Trek is for me. But, unlike previous seasons/shows, at least it’s watchable. Is that what people are excited about?"
Spice and Wolf,Not a very captainly acting character. He's been a tantrum throwing bitch the whole season.
Spice and Wolf,I would have understood if the encounter with Picard had triggered PTSD or something. But that looks more like open resentment. Even though it was the Borg and not Picard himself. A distinction a Starfleet Captain should be able to make.
Spice and Wolf,"I'm sorry but this is still the same shit as the first two seasons. There's no difference between Admiral Hubris and Shaw. They're their just to berate and admonish Picard, Shaw will be doing it season long though (as Raffi did in S1 incidentally cause they can't write different characters).

Crusher introfuced exacrly as Seven was in S1&2, both guncrazed for some reason.

Worf is just Elnor now.

It also looks really bad. Why would I want to watch into something so dark, literally?"
Spice and Wolf,They pulled a Captain Jellico. Shaw is a terrific character.
Spice and Wolf,"Oh, I loved his character since the first scene. His lambasting of Riker and Picard is priceless, and in the end he places them in the lower decks! Yes he was an asshole, but a master-level one. 

Starfleet is usually too nice and clean and with too many heroic figures, so I like when the occasional deeply flawed - but still competent in the end - character shows up. Another example of that, with a personality kind of opposite to Shaw, is Barclay."
Spice and Wolf,"I skipped season 1 and 2, so if Captain Shaw was introduced there, I missed it.  In episode 1, I didn't like Shaw, but it was clear that he's trying to be a company man.  It was impressive that he wasn't evil or a megalomaniac, just doing what he thought he was supposed to do.

I haven't watched episode 4 yet, but this season is really shaping up."
Spice and Wolf,"as a lover of 12 monkeys
I am loving that Terry matalas is getting his due and he bought in a 12 monkeys actor and let him shine too"
Spice and Wolf,"The first 4 episodes of Picard feel like a lost Star trek Movie. Multiple great character arcs with proper setup and payoff. The ending is classic Trek, they remember that they are supposed to be scientists, diplomats and explorers, not action heroes."
Spice and Wolf,Haven't watched the past 2 seasons but that reminds me of the actors role in 12 monkeys show (also written/co written by matalas).
Spice and Wolf,"Chabon has talked about how much he loved Star Trek so he might have approached then. 

I absolutely love his novels, so I was very disappointed in how godawful S1 of Picard. The show violated Chekov's Gun rule and the producer has a Pulitzer Prize. Incredible. 

Also, someone loved Mass Effect,  because entire scenes and ideas were lifted from the game."
Spice and Wolf,"I think they had close to *twenty* producers in the credits. 

The first two seasons were all over the fucking place, with just random shit thrown in that never pays off. A major part of the first season was this Borg cube, which gets reactivated…then the Borg just get blown into space, and cube crashes, and that’s it. 

The second season just had the most kind-numbing my stupid ideas anyone could conceive of. 

It’s like someone in the writers’ room was like “We should have a storyline addressing immigration,” and someone else decided the most efficient way of doing that would be to travel back in time to the present day, have one of the characters get arrested by ICE, and get beat up by an ICE officer. 

Like…this is science fiction. One of the main benefits is you’re able to use allegory and get people to look at their world in a different way. 

And don’t even get me started on Q. Someone just said “Let’s have Q back!” Then all the writers cheered. And someone said “Oh, and let’s have him be *sick* and then he can *die.*”

Nevermind the fact that it’s not explained and has absolutely nothing to do with any of the other storylines. Like the one where Picard has been sad his whole life because his mom hanged herself."
Spice and Wolf,Terry Matalas is the new Showrunner. Michael Chabon has left completely along with Akiva Goldsman.
Spice and Wolf,"TNG season 1 and 2 were not mind-mindbogglingly horrendous. They're very much watchable; they just found their groove with season 3. Picard season 3 feels more like ""Welp, we can't come up with any good new ideas, so let's just use old ones because they worked."""
Spice and Wolf,"This season is what season one should have been from the get go. Just like the original run, it took until season 3 to find its footing and Riker growing the beard.

Unfortunately it’s reading like this will be the last."
Spice and Wolf,"Can't argue with that. A pity that it took so long though, you would have thought that with the rich source of material they had to reference it wouldn't have taken so long."
Spice and Wolf,can you just start watching season 3? i don't want to watch 2 seasons of trash to get to the good.
Spice and Wolf,Oof
Spice and Wolf,I think he's the best thing about Picard season 3 so far - an interesting character who is very well acted by Todd Stashwick.
Spice and Wolf,The showrunner tweeted that it’s some kind of bug for that episode and that they fixed it. It wasn’t supposed to be that dim.
Spice and Wolf,Strange New Worlds spent the light bulb budget for Star Trek...
Spice and Wolf,That's sadly been the norm for quite a few years now.
Spice and Wolf,"First season was at least watchable. Second was pure shit.

Third is what it should have been all along."
Spice and Wolf,Yes Picard is the badmiral to Shaw
Spice and Wolf,He's the Larry David of Star trek.
Spice and Wolf,"> The first two seasons of Picard are unwatacle trash,

Hard disagree."
Spice and Wolf,"> Why does Picard get so much shit for the time the Borg used him as a hand puppet?

Because logic doesn't override PTSD. 

Yes, Picard had no choice about being assimilated, or about leading the Borg assault on the fleet at Wolf 359. But he was still the face of that, he was the voice of that, and Locutus executed his job with apparent relish, to the point of tweaking Riker using Picard's own words. 

That's going to be remembered by Ben Sisko, who lost his wife at Wolf 359. It's going to be remembered by Shaw, who lost his friends and was then forced into a nightmarish choice. Those are events that leave powerful, fundamental marks on a person. And being able to think rationally that Picard had his mind taken over isn't going to stop the emotional feeling that he was somehow complicit, or that he could have done something more to resist, and maybe your loved ones would still be alive."
Spice and Wolf,"[This gets a bit long, so there is a broad-strokes summary at the end]

I agree that the various shows almost never properly explore the long-term consequences of a lot of the stuff that happens, and are very selective in who is treated as culpable for certain things, but none of the examples you list are really comparable in the least. Keiko did not actually succeed, neither did Kes (though the Voyager crew did actually become more wary of her as time went on, and with good cause), and nothing permanently bad happened at all because of the masks -- just another weird day at the office. The only of these three that actually killed anyone was Kes, and in ""Warlord"" most of the people directly affected by her possession are confined to one community in the Delta Quadrant. I can well imagine that Ensign Martin's friends or family would harbour a grudge about this (the only Starfleet officer killed in that incident, if I recall correctly), but Kes is no longer around and it's all a moot point.

On the other side of this comparison, the cube at Wolf 359 -- evidently with the help of insights shared by Picard while enslaved as Locutus -- killed some 11,000 Starfleet personnel, almost all of them probably with surviving friends, family, or colleagues who had a good chance of still being alive over the ensuing decades. This is a wound that cuts deep, with many open nerves still exposed, and the people most affected are all in locations that Picard is likely to visit or at least in which he is likely to be known and spoken of. It probably hurts a great deal to keep seeing headlines like ""Picard saves the day again"" or ""Picard brokers peace between X and Y at last"" or whatever, month after month, when all you can experience when you sleep is the fire in the black and that green glow and the screams being torn out of your friends' lungs as the bulkheads decompressed.

Beyond all this, the fact that Picard was enslaved by the Borg at the time may mean less to people now than it used to. That it would have been a traumatic experience is not something many would doubt, but at least he got to come back from it -- unlike so many others. Even then, as the UFP has encountered a wider and wider variety of Borg and learned more about how the Collective works / worked, many may now reasonably wonder just how totally a ""puppet"" he was during these events. There's like a whole civil rights campaign about how Borg drones can actually maintain their individuality and ""selves"" in spite of assimilation, with some even managing to reassert these aspects of their identity even before being liberated from the Collective. If they could do it, why not Picard? Did he not try hard enough? 

All of this, too, is happening within the context of a broad realignment of UFP policy about the Borg to begin with. Lots of people are trying to take a more conciliatory tack, studying and working with the X-Bs at the Artifact and now trying to form an alliance of sorts with Jurati's Legion, or whatever they're calling it. Lots of people must be pretty unhappy about this, given how many UFP people the Borg have killed on multiple occasions, so it is quite possible that some people are not ready to just treat everything as though it's water under the bridge.

**In summary:** For good or for bad, much as was the case with his role AS Locutus in the first place, Picard is the visible face of a nightmare from which many UFP people still cannot awaken. Even if the Borg were ultimately prevented from conquering the Alpha Quadrant, they still killed thousands with Locutus' help. It is worth remembering that Wolf 359 was likely one of the most traumatic events in Starfleet history for a generation, up to that point -- not only the fact of so many dead at once, but with no hope at all of defending themselves. It was a complete unsettling of certainty and security, comparable to something like the [Battle of Isandlwana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Isandlwana) during the Anglo-Zulu War. Maybe it's unfair that the pain generated by this kind of loss has been displaced onto Picard, but it should not at all be surprising or inexplicable."
Spice and Wolf,"Picard as Locutus didn't just try to kill people, he did. 11,000 people and almost 40 starships died at the Borg's hands, ""led"" by Locutus and if it wasn't for the crew of E-D, Earth would have been absolutely devastated. Before the Dominion War it might have been the single biggest loss of life in Starfleet's history, almost certainly certainly the biggest in the previous 100 years.

Wolf 359 was basically the Federation's equivalent to 9/11."
Spice and Wolf,Because he was so good at it?
Spice and Wolf,"> Why does Picard get so much shit for the time the Borg used him as a hand puppet?

Bad Writing.

> “I’m sorry I tried to kill you, I was possessed by an evil alien entity at the time” is such a common apology in Star Trek there’s probably a section at Hallmark.

This gets funnier the more I think about it. I regret I have but one upvote to give."
Spice and Wolf,">No one is blaming Keiko O’Brien for trying to murder the Prophets

ugg please don't remind me of that episode."
Spice and Wolf,"Yeah you can just start with this one, it's basically a reboot. Only one new character from the first two seasons is still around."
Spice and Wolf,"Yes, thankfully you can ignore seasons 1 and 2. They are pits of despair due to a lot of atrocious writing."
Spice and Wolf,"Yeah, I think there might be one fact from season 1 you'd want to know but it hasn't played a big role in season 3 so far, just maybe one minor mention.  Season 2 is utterly forgettable and garbage."
Spice and Wolf,"Yes. But you're cheating yourself if you don't at least watch S1. It starts a little slow, but it's worth it."
Spice and Wolf,Not the first one. I've seen quite a few Strange New Worlds posts getting upvoted.
Spice and Wolf,"It's also true. Man. 

https://www.britannica.com/topic/USS-Indianapolis"
Spice and Wolf,In the future electricity costs even more than it does now.
Spice and Wolf,Most if the power was going to life-support! All the ships in this season are almost on the verge of exploding... Except The Shrike but it's mandatory for the bad guys' ships to be dim and dark.
Spice and Wolf,"Strange New Worlds must have stolen all the lightbulbs, because that show is definitely brightly lit."
Spice and Wolf,"Well, alternatively, why was TNG and TOS so bright? I think it's fair to reason that they shot so much on a small budget that it was easier to just keep the set brightly lit all the time. VOY, ENT and DS9 are better compromises with the lighting IMO."
Spice and Wolf,"To be fair, it has been awhile since we saw such an interaction…and Shaw’s monologue is way more harsh / bitter than the one given by Sisko, which was buried, but still respectful anger."
Spice and Wolf,Hack writers can't move past Wrath of Kahn and the Borg.
Spice and Wolf,"Can you accept that everyone is going to have a different reaction to Picard's role in the Battle of Wolf 359?

Most of the younger officers revere Picard as a legendary decorated Starfleet officer. We've seen them reverently asking Picard for his personal view on events. We've also seen Titan's bridge crew hesitate when Shaw gave the order to leave Picard to his fate.

So far, we have only seen two officers who hated Picard's role at Wolf 359 - Sisko and Shaw. Both of them are also survivors of Wolf 359. I'm sure there are more, but given the statistical sampling we have been given, Sisko and Shaw are in the minority. 

This fits reality quite well. Not every hero is going to be viewed as one by everybody. Shaw's survivor's guilt has delayed his career, taking him a full 30+ years to painfully work his way up to the rank of captain. Surely you can allow for one man to not be aligned with the rest of Starfleet where Picard is concerned?"
Spice and Wolf,"> everyone, without exception, is a violent, emotional idiot.

When was Shaw Violent?"
Spice and Wolf,"> you have to a violent emotional idiot to be a starfleet officer

It worked for Kirk.   j/k"
Spice and Wolf,"First they took his hobby of cooking, since Pike does that now, and now they’re taking his tragic origin story"
Spice and Wolf,He used his engineering to follow the protocols exactly throughout his career and landed the Titan in the vacuum of Riker leaving. We only saw him while stuck with a former Borg first officer and seeing the man he blames for his cripplng survivors guilt. Definitely an ass but I bet he has more to show still.
Spice and Wolf,Survivors guilt seemed to be a major factor too. He survived by shear luck. So from then on he followed all protocol to a t.
Spice and Wolf,[removed]
Spice and Wolf,"I'd say he honestly works better than Jellico. Jellico came into his story throwing his weight around for no good reason. Shaw was even more of a jerk, but he has an entirely legitimate and traumatic reason for that behavior when faced with Picard and Seven at the same time. You can imagine Shaw probably being a pretty normal Captain removed from the biggest traumatic trigger he could imagine, meanwhile I can only assume Jellico was a control freak in every command he ever had including ones where he was only stepping in on a temporary basis as the ""supply captain""."
Spice and Wolf,"The first scene with Seven cemented it for me, yes the OPs scene they’ve linked was fantastic but that scene was just great.

“Hey Hanson, bang up job your heroes are doing with my ship, love the view”

Lifetime fan of the character after that line 😂"
Spice and Wolf,"All if Star Trek now is basically bad people and flawed characters to be edgy. It's bullshit, unoriginal and lazy. There is very little of the new shows that is Star Trek and they could work as a new standalone big budget sci-fi franchise"
Spice and Wolf,Shaw is fresh for this season. Enjoy
Spice and Wolf,The first 4 episodes basically serve as a first act. If you took out the stuff with Raffi and Worf it could easily work as a standalone movie with threads left dangling for the sequel. I'm very impressed so far.
Spice and Wolf,Deacon was a crucial part of the 12 Monkeys mix. The yin to Dr Jones' yang.
Spice and Wolf,"Star Trek: Discovery also had an obscene number of production credits. It's like, okay, I get it, all that movie-grade CGI isn't cheap. That series always looked pretty impressive for a TV show. A lot of the time, someone will be credited as a producer when all they really did the whole time was contribute money. But there's always the possibility that they might have also demanded some amount of creative input in exchange for doing that."
Spice and Wolf,"> The first two seasons were all over the fucking place, with just random shit thrown in that never pays off.

My pet theory has always been that season 2 came about when those twenty producers all got *really* drunk at a bar together one night and scrawled a bunch of incoherent random nonsense about Star Trek and other various unrelated topics on a bunch of cocktail napkins, then the next morning at the studio they gave each napkin to a different intern and demanded an episode script based on it by the end of the day."
Spice and Wolf,"S1 at least was bleeding awful early on. Like, people couldn't deliver lines ( Patrick Stewart to the side ). I do not recall S2 that much. 

My understanding is that things improved after they got Roddenberry less involved. 

> Picard season 3 feels more like ""Welp, we can't come up with any good new ideas, so let's just use old ones because they worked.""

TOS started in *1967*. The whole thing is a massive legacy property."
Spice and Wolf,"I don’t agree. I thought the first two seasons were boring and miserable.


Edit: apologies for any confusion. I was referring to Picard"
Spice and Wolf,TNG seasons 1 and 2 were like Hamlet compared to PIC seasons 1 and 2 lol
Spice and Wolf,"I'm just hoping it leads to a spin-off with Shaw, Seven, and the Titan. Maybe some other old cast (like Frakes\Dorn) stick around even if Patrick Stewart is done."
Spice and Wolf,">True, but bad as seasons 1 and 2 of TNG were they had some good, even great, episodes as well. I also have to say that even a bad episode of those seasons is better than the best episode of Picard seasons 1 and 2. 
>
>Also, even when it was bad, TNG was always fun, something that Picard seasons 1 and 2 forgot about (they are either too 'dark' or very clumsily go in the opposite direction and end up stupidly goofy).

We're talking about season 3 though, not rehashing older bad seasons to keep your hate boners erect."
Spice and Wolf,I'd say for most part yes. There are some call backs mostly as quick close offs or quick jokes so don't think you'll miss those. One of the characters has developed quite a bit in the intervening 20 years so that might be jarring. You'll be a little behind there but don't think it will hurt story.
Spice and Wolf,"If you know TNG and remember Seven from VOY, you should be good. Only one or two new characters (one having only a minor role for this season so far) from the first 2 seasons appeared only in Picard, and you'll manage. 

If you know nothing about the TNG era and the major story points and characters, I am not sure the series would work. (Even though they'll get you some basics for the major story threads, the characters and the story just won't have the impact.)"
Spice and Wolf,"You would miss one of the best ones, 2x9, the measure of a man. One of my all time favorites, there were some good episodes in season 2."
Spice and Wolf,">Oof

oof"
Spice and Wolf,"I think that's only half the issue. The showrunner was talking about more of a contrast/compression issue on streaming which kinda made things look muddled, but their lighting choices are also just on the dark and dim side. I don't mind it that much, but I think I would prefer just a little more warmth in the lighting like in the TOS films or SNW."
Spice and Wolf,But it's been every episode this season. I feel like no one on that ship can see a frickin thing!
Spice and Wolf,"Wasn’t there a “bug” the week before where everything was horribly oversaturated?

How is it possible to have a “bug” like this? They’re spending *millions of dollars* on every episode, then someone just uses the wrong settings when they export or upload the video?

And no one bothers to check it ahead of time?"
Spice and Wolf,"And they do a REALLY bad job of hiding the fact that they are up to some sketchy stuff. ""Oh yes, we'll just fly off to this random system in the opposite direction of our destination. It will impress people, or something."""
Spice and Wolf,"I think with Sisko the context is also important. It’s three years after he lost his wife and the mother of his child as well as his ship and presumably friends. He put his life on hold for those three years at Utopia Planetia then his first mission back out he runs into a Picard who has no idea who he is and even starts smiling when he realises Sisko knows him, mistakenly thinking he’s forgotten them meeting before.

Now that’s the setup for it, but by the end of the episode Sisko is far more at peace having processed some of his feelings in the episode and is far less hostile to Picard.

EDIT: Also for context for anyone not familiar with it, Wolf 359 was likely the single most destructive loss in the Federation's history. By the time of Wolf 359 the Federation had become accustomed to having amongst the most powerful starships in the quadrant with very little able to assail them directly. Wolf 359 saw thirty nine vessels destroyed in a battle with a single Borg cube; an unprecedented loss to a single vessel, of which the Borg have a large but indeterminate number. That cube then took a run at Earth and made it into the Solar system before being deactivated by fluke; a unique connection between the then recovered Locutus and the vessel itself. This was very much the Federation's 9/11 and their reaction to it was based on the horror that a probing attack by a single Borg vessel had nearly beaten the Federation.

EDIT 2: Also I suspect Locutus wasn't named because he was deadly, Locutus is slightly fluffed latin that seems intended to translate as 'speaker'. Locutus is fundamentally a borg/human diplomat designed to ease the Federation into assimilation. When Locutus says 'I am Locutus of Borg' he means he's the Borg's spokesman."
Spice and Wolf,There is also probably a hypospray they can give you that just removes the biological effects of PTSD.
Spice and Wolf,"Wow. Wow. Wow. Everything I just read makes me super super glad I stopped watching Picard halfway through the first season. That is all so dumb. I’m so amazingly dumb. I thought Voyager ruined the Borg, but fuck it seems like this show done *ruined* the Borg.  Fair enough. I concede that this dude in this stupid ass timeline where the Borg are no longer the Borg, may have a valid complaint."
Spice and Wolf,"Yup.  Wolf 359 changed the entire tone of the franchise going forward: Federation officers got more militaristic and rivals like the Cardassians got bolder.

Then that all started to spiral with the Maquis and later the Dominion - the next big cultural upset for the Federation."
Spice and Wolf,"lol

they just said fuck it and threw out the garbage huh"
Spice and Wolf,And that character wasn't even in this episode.
Spice and Wolf,But then you wont know why Picard is making out with someone that could be his granddaughter in the first episode!
Spice and Wolf,"> but it's worth it.

No it's not. Both S1 and S2 are a disaster."
Spice and Wolf,"Picard is literally some of the worst TV I’ve ever seen, made me want to scratch my own eyes out of my sockets as the pain from that experience would be more enjoyable than what I was being forced to watch

No one should EVER watch Picard 1 and 2. EVER"
The Grinder,Thought I was the only person who loved this show. The opening scenes with the family watching Grinder episodes are so funny
The Grinder,Tim olyphant was great in it too
The Grinder,but ... *what if it didn't*
The Grinder,Brother and brother. Grinding together.
The Grinder,"RIP Mitchard Grinder. Although I do like that the series ends with Dean saying ""now we know this can go on for years"" and Fred Savage and his wife are just sitting there like ""uhhhhhhh..."""
The Grinder,"I really liked The Grinder, I thought Fred Savage was great, dude has been an actor his whole life and has tons of talent, he’s been directing mostly as an adult on a lot of shows so it was cool to see him in front of the camera again 

Rob Lowe was coming off his great run on Parks and Rec and he was really good basically playing every stereotype of a Hollywood actor, I loved how they used Timothy Olyphant who has great comedic skills, Mary Elizabeth Ellis (the waitress from its always sunny) was really good in this show too. A show that was critically acclaimed and just needed time to find its audience imo one season is too quick to kill it, if they canceled Parks and Rec in season one it wouldn’t be remembered fondly because that was its worst season. Sometimes shows just need time 

Fun fact: Timothy Olyphant, Mary Elizabeth Ellis and Natalie Morales who plays Claire in The Grinder were all in Santa Clarita Diet together after this show was canceled, another comedy I felt was pretty good and deserved to keep going"
The Grinder,Perfection!
The Grinder,"Yup, that was a really funny show. The waitress from Sunny was the wife, right?"
The Grinder,"This, Trial and Error, and Great News are shows that came out around the same time, were absolutely hilarious, and got canceled way before their time. No idea why they didn’t take off and I’m still mad about all three of them to this day."
The Grinder,Fred Savage played the straight man so well.  He and Lowe had great chemistry.
The Grinder,"The guy who was Kenny Powers' friend was also awesome in this show. 

I loved how Mary Elizabeth Ellis' character seemed very normal and gradually showed slices of insanity as the season went on. Really fun to watch."
The Grinder,"There were a few shows from around this time that just never got their dues. A few years earlier, they'd have probably sold it off to Netflix where it could have found an audience. Yet this was the time they knew they needed their own streaming platform, yet didn't have one yet."
The Grinder,For justice
The Grinder,"For those interested in a original (and better) version of this show, have a look at Rake (2010) ~~produced by~~ first aired on Australian Broadcasting Corporation 'ABC'."
The Grinder,"I love how they’re all under the spell except for Fred’s character, how he’s just confused how nobody else thinks the show is insane.  😂"
The Grinder,"Oh I forgot he’s in it!  I just started rewatching it, so I’m trying to save episodes.  Only back up to number 5 or 6."
The Grinder,great now you reminded me about how they cancelled Santa Clarita Diet on a cliffhanger
The Grinder,So many 4th wall jokes!
The Grinder,Thanks for the recommendation (SCD)- I will check it out!
The Grinder,"I don’t think so, though they look similar.

Edit: my bad, I was thinking of Katie Olsen.  I fell off of Sunny years ago so my bad."
The Grinder,"I’ve never heard of those other two, so maybe all three just had terrible advertising?  🤷‍♂️😕"
The Grinder,Grat News was amazing!  John MIchael Higgins was perfect as the aging newsman who was out of tough. The episode where they thought he was going to jump off the roof was brilliant.
The Grinder,"For 20 minutes at a time, I was convinced that they were truly brothers."
The Grinder,"Steve I think his name was- yeah, dude plays that character well!  😂

I just started rewatching so looking forward to the wife acting a bit crazy."
The Grinder,"Yeah, I definitely would have checked this out if it came out now.  I was always terrible at watching shows at set times in the evening, and I haven’t had cable in around 12+ years so I only watch ones that are already wrapped up or on a streaming platform."
The Grinder,"Thanks, I will check it out.  

Why do you think it’s better, out of curiosity?"
The Grinder,You are not alone! It was a very fun show.
The Grinder,"Great News was basically going to be the next 30 Rock but set in a news station. Tina Fey produced and even guest starred. 

Trial and Error had Parks and Rec vibes and was about a big city lawyer solving a murder in a small backwards town. 

Both had so much potential and I think the advertising was the downfall. Definitely worth watching regardless!"
The Grinder,"""Murder Board"" and ""Lady Driver"" are two catchphrases my wife and I still use all the time."
The Grinder,What if they didn't?
The Grinder,"Damn! The one show on the bubble I wanted renewed. It was smart and funny, week reviewed, but just couldn't catch on."
The Grinder,This one stings.
The Grinder,"Damnit. Todd will forever hold a place in my heart.



""I was so damn psyched to achieve and maintain an erection with you."""
The Grinder,"The Grinder rests, in peace."
The Grinder,Netflix should pick it up.  Good show.
The Grinder,"Ugh, this sucks. Such a good show with such a great cast. I hope Fred Savage picks up another starring role. "
The Grinder,"The Grinder was one of the best comedies to come out of network television in years. I'm genuinely shocked, surprised, and pissed. With the quality of comedy they delivered week after week, I thought it was a sure thing for renewal. I'm devastated."
The Grinder,[deleted]
The Grinder,you know this is Zadak's fault right?
The Grinder,"The Grinder was a show I was super impressed with at how good it was in its first season, it's a real shame there won't be a second as I reckon it could have ended up in conversations among the best, much like Parks & Rec, Community and Arrested Development."
The Grinder,Really don't care about the other tv shows  getting cancelled but this is really disappointing to here.
The Grinder,This fucking sucks. The Grinder was the best new comedy this season. Really funny and unlike any other show currently airing.
The Grinder,"It's too bad, but at least the show had a really strong finale. "
The Grinder,Damn it! This show was good. This is the reason I've mostly stopped watching network TV shows... You get invested in something good and they take it away from you so they can make the next thing that will be less creative but have more viewers. 
The Grinder,"WHAT THE FUCK FOX. This show was SOO good and had potential to grow tremendously. It was such a smart comedy and one of the few I still looked forward to each week. The cast and writing were incredible. 

This is so disappointing."
The Grinder,They literally canceled the Grinder. 
The Grinder,"Wow, this sucks. I loved the chemistry between Savage and Lowe and the rest of the cast was fantastic. FOX screws the pooch once again. "
The Grinder,2 broke girls goes on years without one funny line and crappy acting and this gets canceled. Network TV sucks
The Grinder,But what if it came back?
The Grinder,"I feel like this will get an online renewal. Mindy had similar ratings and buzz and now is Hulu's biggest show. 

Watched the first episode today. It's pretty funny. "
The Grinder,"Such a great show, I totally expected them to renew it hoping word would spread."
The Grinder,How can we grind FOX?  This show is too damn good to not come back.
The Grinder,"On /r/television :

Ctrl + F ""cancel""

11 hits."
The Grinder,Nooooo!!! Why do they cancel quality shows and keep crap on TV
The Grinder,"Give Fox credit. Most networks would have pulled it after 6 episodes. They gave it a full year, promoted it, and didn't constantly change its schedule."
The Grinder,Or did they?
The Grinder,"Guys, guys, guys. They're just changing the city. We're getting The Grinder: Poughkeepsie."
The Grinder,Noooooooo... I...must....continue..to... Grind... 
The Grinder,but what if it wasn't :'(
The Grinder,"I remember hearing about this show over the summer and thinking ""that doesn't really sound that interesting"" and then watching the first episode of the series on a plane before it had aired on TV and just loving it.  Sad to see it go, glad we at least had one fantastic season.  Also, damn, I feel bad for Mary Elizabeth Ellis and Natalie Morales, they're hilarious but they can't seem to hold on to a show for more than a season :("
The Grinder,"What the fuck, no. This was the consistently best new comedy airing on television. Such a shame."
The Grinder,"Now did Grandfathered get renewed? That show was so awful they had to sandwich it between 2 episodes of New Girl to try to get people to watch.
The Grinder was an amazing show, funniest I've seen in a while. If Grandfathered gets to keep going and The Grinder doesnt, then this is the most ridiculous "
The Grinder,noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo^^^^O
The Grinder,Not surprised. Still really bummed. The Grinder rests... :(
The Grinder,Hope Rob Lowe's beautiful face gets another show soon.
The Grinder,Noooooo. This is the one comedy I like right now. Fingers crossed that Hulu or something will pick it up 
The Grinder,"Well, now Rob Lowe can go join his brother's law firm."
The Grinder,This was probably the best of last years new shows. It was really well done. Nielsen does it again!
The Grinder,"Oh thank god, I thought you were talking about grindr"
The Grinder,"Just caught the finale yesterday. So much meta humor. I'm miss it, for the most part, but there were some parts I won't miss. Namely, everyone's (but especially the dad's) favoritism of Dean, Dean sexually harassing Claire, and Todd. All of Todd.

I WILL miss the lovely cameos and Grinder cold opens, the music that plays whenever Dean is having a dramatic moment, Stewart and Deb's relationship, Zadak, Timothy Olyphant in Grinder NOLA, and the sheer, indulgent insanity of it all. 

Hope someone else picks it up..."
The Grinder,"I'm so pissed at America for not giving this show a chance. Seriously one of the best written comedies on network television in years. Oh well, at least we still have TBBT and Modern Family *gunshot*"
The Grinder,"I really didn't want to like this show for some reason. It just sounded kind of stupid and it came out at the same time as Grandfathered, which looked terrible and I associated them together. 

But dammit The Grinder was good. It totally won me over. "
The Grinder,"It seems im in the minority here but this is just my opinion. 

I didnt really enjoy the show that much. You know when you empathetically cringe when you watch a show. I did that a lot while watching this show and it made zone out of it to much to pay attention to it.

I wanted to enjoy it as i like the actors and my DVR still has it set to record but I just can't bring myself to enjoy it. "
The Grinder,....this show was actually pretty good. Is there at least some level of closure? I got too busy to keep watching
The Grinder,Anyone surprised? Fox always cancels good shows.
The Grinder,"I'm just going to say my piece and then be done.

""Original"" and ""Good"" are two very separate ideas, especially in television. ""Smart"" and ""Talented"" are also very separate ideas and also do not mean the same thing as ""Good"". These buzz words are used far too frequently to describe shows and they are used as if they are full blown arguments for the quality of the show. I've seen a lot of SyFy tv shows that could definitely be considered ""original"", ""smart"", and ""funny"" but not a single one of those shows were ""good"". Even ""talent"" doesn't live up to anything at this point. The Last Man on Earth definitely has some very talented individuals but there is a lot of that show that most would consider a waste of air time."
The Grinder,I was interested in seeing the show from watching the promos but never knew what day and time it was on. I just found out though.
The Grinder,"/u/thedevast8or !!!!

Say it isn't so!!"
The Grinder,No
The Grinder,Where will I get my insatiable grind for justice?
The Grinder,"The only solace I can find is the potential for a West Wing reboot, the entire cast except CJ is available."
The Grinder,"Wow... I was just talking to someone today about all the ways they could make this show last 4 or 5 seasons, trying to outline where the plots and relationships could go, and I literally didn't even consider it might end on someone else's terms. "
The Grinder,I never watched this show but the two or three episodes I saw were pretty good. 
The Grinder,My mom is gonna be choked!
The Grinder,[Feelsbadman](https://openclipart.org/image/2400px/svg_to_png/222252/feels.png)
The Grinder,Man that sucks...
The Grinder,"Fred Savage was so great in this show. His constant ""am I taking crazy pills?"" demeanor while everyone else is stuck in Mitch's vortex of insanity was my favorite part. God damn it sucks they cancelled this. 

And how about the father? He was one of the best ""backdrop Dad"" characters ever, IMO. "
The Grinder,The only *possible* good thing to come out of this is it could free Rob Lowe for a new West Wing miniseries. 
The Grinder,Fox doesn't know a good show if it hit them in the head. 
The Grinder,Rob Lowe gives no fucks.
The Grinder,"Can we have a spoiler alert, this ruins the first episode."
The Grinder,"A year ago, Rob Lowe had three tv shows (The Grinder; Moonbeam City; You, Me, and the Apocalypse), and now all three have been cancelled. Such a shame. "
The Grinder,"What a shame, I can't say I loved it, but it was very solid."
The Grinder,"I really liked that show.  Rob Lowe was great in it.

I hope netflix or hulu picks it up"
The Grinder,"This saddened me the most.  I've been catching up on Hulu and this show has me laugh out loud more than once per episode.  The chemistry, the stories, everything about it was perfect.  I really hope that this can get picked up somewhere.  It'd fit in really well with Netflix's lineup."
The Grinder,"This was a really good show, a bit different to the usual sitcoms that come out every season, all the same

Sad to see it go"
The Grinder,Everytime i hear about that show i think about the gay ap which makes me not want to watch it.
The Grinder,"**FUCK!** This was an amazing show and fuck Fox for canceling it.

What was it costing you Fox? Was it really too expensive for all the goodwill you were building with fans of actual comedy? 

You short sighted ass-clowns, you goddamn fuckwits. "
The Grinder,"God damn it. The Grinder was favorite new show. So funny and so ridicules, but clever at the same time. How can this get canceled and Brooklyn 99 still air? "
The Grinder,"I liked this show, but... It's not Arrested Development or Party Down. I can't work up any indignant rage over out of touch network execs for this."
My Hero Academia,"Good show, but it would have worked better if Midoriya had remained powerless and used his strategy and intellect to become the greatest hero, as he's implied to become."
My Hero Academia,"That was the premise of the original pilot manga for this series. I think the manga-ka realized it'd be really tough to keep Midoriya powerless the entire way through given many of the quirks in MHA, at least not without having to go through lengths to contrive Izuku winning fights."
My Hero Academia,That's really interesting. I'm having trouble finding that in any interviews. Mind sharing a link or source? I believe you; just want to share it with friends.
My Hero Academia,"Well, the thing about Horikoshi thinking it'd be tough to implement is my own guess. 

I'll see if I can find a link to the pilot manga. I believe it's called My Hero, and Midoriya is an adult office worker with no powers."
My Hero Academia,Shinso's back!
My Hero Academia,"i wanna know how people felt about last season. ive got a couple of episodes left, but i cant compel myself to finish it. halfway through the season i just stopped enjoying it."
My Hero Academia,Not particularly looking forward to this. This is the manga arc where the series just starts to drag.
My Hero Academia,[deleted]
My Hero Academia,[removed]
My Hero Academia,"Ehh, I’d rank it as 3rd or 4th among the rest of the seasons. I wasn’t a fan of the villains in the second cour, but I did like Overhaul- although that seems like an unpopular opinion here. The last couple episodes are pretty important to the series though"
My Hero Academia,"I thought it was ok. I don't like the Overhaul Arc but I liked the Gentle Criminal Arc. I enjoyed Heroes: Rising way more though than the overall season. The final couple of episodes (which cover the Pro Hero Arc) are worth it though (the final episode has some of the show's best animation).

Season 5 will be great though."
My Hero Academia,Overhaul arc was animated decently. The latter half has some major character moments and is more slice of life/actual school type stuff with some super heroics in between. And the final three episodes are a fantastic lead in for the next season. None of it is filler since this anime series follows the manga almost exactly. And some of the details come back later and are important as well. But the latter half's character developments are really great
My Hero Academia,The end of the season is really great with the Cultural Festival ending and a big battle well animated.
My Hero Academia,It is amazing when it’s good but pretty bleh when it’s bad. I found the Overhaul arc and the final episode to be brilliant but the Gentle Criminal stuff was dragged out imo
My Hero Academia,I was very bored with all things related to the festival/performing as a band but other than that I enjoyed it quite a bit.
My Hero Academia,I gave up after four episodes of Deku and TinTin-face apologizing for not kidnapping the little girl.  It never ended.  All that stupid atonement bowing shit. I just wanna watch a DBZ.  Make them shout some nonsense about breaking through limits and punch the shit out of each other.
My Hero Academia,"I liked it overall more than season three but the first two seasons were better. The final episode of season four is phenomenal though, easily top three in the series imo."
My Hero Academia,Whoa I didn’t know people disliked it before coming into this thread. I think it’s probably my favourite so far tbh
My Hero Academia,"Overhaul arc was good. I predicted what was going to happen with Le million but didn't think it the aftermath would be the same. I have two episodes left after they paused the dub due to the Chinese plague. The festival arc has been so bad so far I thought it was filler and haven't found the will to finish it, if the dubs even come out yet."
My Hero Academia,"I skipped a lot of the filler, but generally I enjoyed it."
My Hero Academia,Personally I enjoyed the arc but it was definitely polarizing. I’ve never seen MHA fans fight so much. At least the second half of the season should get people hyped. That arc was pretty universally praised.
My Hero Academia,"The Joint Training arc dragged, but I think part of it was because of the release schedule combined with a lot of very short chapters. I imagine the pace will pick up a little when converted to a 22 minute TV show aired weekly."
My Hero Academia,"I enjoy the arcs that this anime is going to cover, but I feel like the show is going to lose a lot of people. It's likely that half to a little over half of this season will pull the action away from some of our favorite characters and it will probably lead to very polarizing reception."
My Hero Academia,"Haven't read the manga but the series had surprisingly good pacing, for a shonen anime, to me. Didn't start to drag until the second half of season 4 during the extended festival setup episodes. Kinda scared for Season 5 at this point."
My Hero Academia,"As much as i like MHA i have to agree; the first half of S5 won't have a lot going on aside from some cool fights; it's pretty slow. The second half thought, i'm REALLY looking foward to that one"
My Hero Academia,"I mean, it's in profile and blocked by everyone else, so that's not exactly easy"
My Hero Academia,Damn we had the complete opposite opinion on that season haha. I thought the overhaul arc was the best of the whole show and I hated absolutely everything about the Gentle Criminal arc.
My Hero Academia,Keep watching. There’s some DBZ flying and transformation type stuff later in the series.
My Hero Academia,Same. I saw a lot of hate for it online. I loved it personally.
My Hero Academia,I enjoyed the Joint Exercises arc. I don't know how you do the arc after without either a lot of filler or somehow just having it happen at the same time as the JE/Training with Endeavor arcs due to it's focus and length.
My Hero Academia,"Yeah, I'm not going to get into a spoilery discussion here, but I didn't much care for the arc to follow either. The former was boring, but the latter just felt totally unearned."
My Hero Academia,"It's the natural progression of any shonen anime (more characters, more storylines, the story gets too big and starts focusing in a lot of characters aside from the main cast). The story is still as good as it was thought, just a little more slow which i don't think is a deal-breaker"
My Hero Academia,"Yeah there's a reason they cut it because Author probably realized shit they figured it out too soon. 


[Here's the manga panel of that scene from the anime.](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/bokunoheroacademia/images/c/c4/Users_of_One_For_All_Full.png/revision/latest?cb=20181204214409)

And [of course the spoiler for those too curious.](https://64.media.tumblr.com/5ae6231ff629577fc08c0ff16a4d0837/tumblr_inline_pcwbc0Idsa1rqppcu_1280.png) 

Yep."
My Hero Academia,"Personally, having read the manga first, I *thought* the Overhaul arc was gonna be my favorite part and Gentle Criminal was gonna be okay. For some reason, the adaptation didn’t come through for me and it ended up being the reverse."
My Hero Academia,"Same, i enjoyed the overhaul arc thoroughly. Shed tears in that music festival tho, no shame about it."
My Hero Academia,I think after all that GC was needed for everyone to breathe. I loved overhaul but it was a little too much
My Hero Academia,"I’m sure it does I just wasn’t willing to sit through all the Japanese “solving the issue is secondary to finding someone to take the blame so we can shun them” bullshit they just kept piling on.

Plus the blue girl who’s power seems to be “showing underboob while being tickled in an overtly sexual way by her boss/teacher” is just too sexist for me to deal with, and I sat through three seasons of My Hero Academia so my tolerance for that stuff isn’t exactly low."
My Hero Academia,"I’m a dumb dumb, could you explain how it could be that person?"
My Hero Academia,"B-but the music during the scene where Eri leaps into Deku’s arms...... And the part where Deku tells Eri she isn’t a curse, like how All Might told Deku he isn’t useless...."
My Hero Academia,"Oh ya I'd forgotten that part, it definitely was strange for a childrens cartoon.

Her whole attire of her pants coming down is strange as well."
My Hero Academia,"Couldn't see the screen I was crying so hard at those parts. And no spoilers, but right now, the manga has me in tears in like every freaking chapter, but ina a great way."
My Hero Academia,[Subtitled version](https://twitter.com/aitaikimochi/status/1140257861051670528?s=19)
My Hero Academia,"I had zero interest in MHA at first, I couldn't understand what all the hype was about and why the episode discussion threads were so huge.
  
I was stupid.  It's awesome."
My Hero Academia,MIRIO!!! LEMILLION should be the Pillar of Justice!
My Hero Academia,"I just binged the first 3 seasons (and the movie) a month or two ago and thoroughly enjoyed it. I really like anime like this, in which there is interweaving of gaining power with the story. 

I am actually open to anyone who has suggestions of similar anime. I am already a big DBZ fan, but I think Hunter X Hunter is probably the best example of what I mean by having a powerful story to go along with characters gaining power."
My Hero Academia,"This is probably my favourite arc of the series so far. 

Definitely looking forward to seeing it animated"
My Hero Academia,If they adapt the manga right it’s definitely gonna be one of the best seasons
My Hero Academia,Mirio is a fucking treasure and I'm not ready for this season.
My Hero Academia,"For those who need a fix while they wait, check out [Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba](https://myanimelist.net/anime/38000/Kimetsu_no_Yaiba). It's currently airing, and is the next shounen masterpiece."
My Hero Academia,"Do they finally get rid of that purple pervy pimple? Please tell me they are finally getting rid of that purple pervy pimple.

Anyway, can't wait."
My Hero Academia,Very excited about this season....the show really surprised me
My Hero Academia,That is so far away! We could all be dead!
My Hero Academia,"\*offers arm, slaps a vein\*

Alright, let's do it. Shoot me up already."
My Hero Academia,I am a bit hyped!
My Hero Academia,I just got into this show pretty recently. Do we get the episodes after they premiere on hulu or not until the season is over?
My Hero Academia,[deleted]
My Hero Academia,"I'm so excited. I'm finally caught up, so I'll be watching it live."
My Hero Academia,Can't wait for my boy Mirio!
My Hero Academia,This is gonna be the High End arc?
My Hero Academia,anyone who can recommend me a good VPN that works with netflix and/or cruncyroll?
My Hero Academia,Sky high for weebs
My Hero Academia,Midoriya finding out he's quirkless .... such a soul crushing moment. This anime does 0% new for the Genre but does everything 120% right.
My Hero Academia,[deleted]
My Hero Academia,Lets fucking get there!
My Hero Academia,Last season was so boring hope it picks up
My Hero Academia,"Anime is not television anime is streaming service  and or pirated off the internet... ""conventional pirate Arrrrr for effect"""
My Hero Academia,zzz
My Hero Academia,">[Subtitled version](https://twitter.com/aitaikimochi/status/1140257861051670528?s=19)

Cheers"
My Hero Academia,Thanks for the subbed version !
My Hero Academia,I’m not saying you are a hero. But you are basically All Might for this
My Hero Academia,"Someone told me to watch _my hero academia_ and I didn't understand the name. When I heard the name it sounded really strange, I thought it was about someone who has a hero and their hero's name is _academia_??.   
I don't watch anime so I googled the show mostly to see what the name meant and what the show is about. I saw that it was on hulu so I thought _screw it_ and watched the first episode. 

I finished season 3 today. It is totally awesome. I've pretty much loved every episode and the movie. The climax of season 2 is some of the most fun I've had watching TV. 

I guess I watch anime now :/"
My Hero Academia,Yeah I was also not sold at first.  Superheros isnt my favorite subject.  But I loved the show and wish I had tried it soner.  Its also has awsome animation.
My Hero Academia,KIRISHIMA!!! RED RIOT should be the Unbreakable Man!
My Hero Academia,[removed]
My Hero Academia,It's not your typical 'gain power' type of Shonen but check out Haikyuu. It's fantastic.
My Hero Academia,[removed]
My Hero Academia,One Punch Man
My Hero Academia,"Naruto, One piece, Bleach and fairy tale are probably the best examples. They're all shonen anime that follow the same basic structure of my hero academia (large cast, with a hero who starts out weak-ish and gets stronger/more popular etc). There are a ton of other examples, but those have a closer tone to my hero."
My Hero Academia,Naruto if you haven't seen it (probably have).
My Hero Academia,"One Piece I think is the best example of that genre so far.  Luffy starts out completely undrerpowered and in the course of hundreds of episodes his moves change a lot.  And apart from some of the filler added by the anime(anything with Davyback should just be skipped), the content has remained pretty good.

If you want something much shorter, either Gurren Lagann or Kill La Kill make for excellent anime’s where the MC gets massively more powerful."
My Hero Academia,Try Black Clover
My Hero Academia,"For shonen like anime I suggest three titles.  

1) Black Clover is really interesting and has a pretty good story. The main character is a lot like Gohn where he learns, improves and gets better. It also by far has the best supporting cast of characters that are interesting with good backstories that don’t take too long to explain and that you end up caring about

2) Haiyku is a sports anime based on volleyball. At first I was like no way I like this. Put it this way - it’s the most happily surprised I’ve ever been about an anime. It’s just really really good. 

3) Food Wars. I’m not a big fan of cooking but this show at first is a little much than toned it down. And it is basically about an academy based on cooking. It has interesting characters but more importantly a great setting and a fun story. This doesn’t necessarily fit your guidelines but give it a chance it’s a gem.  

4) Is it wrong to try to pick up girls in a dungeon- it’s similar to most anime where characters power up. What sets this aside is the world around the main character."
My Hero Academia,"BNHA is often derided for being a Naruto clone, and the mangaka himself has claimed that as his biggest influence and favorite manga ever so that's probably the one you want to go next.

Otherwise, not exactly the same but there is Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood."
My Hero Academia,Magi is 100% what you're looking for then. The first arc is pretty slow and kinda not representative of the quality is reaches though. The character and power growth is huge though.
My Hero Academia,Bones has been hella faithful with it so far. I'm already hyped as hell.
My Hero Academia,The newest arc of the manga is really adding a ton more depth to the already-amazing villains.
My Hero Academia,"For those who read the manga, is there a plan for a conclusion? I mean, are we building toward something, or is this just going to go on forever until the author runs out of ideas? I love the show so far and have never read any of the manga. Just hope there’s a plan for an ending and am curious."
My Hero Academia,This is already one of (if not *the*) best Shonen animes ever made.
My Hero Academia,"I mean I've heard good things about it and it might be more traditional shounen to succed

But I'd guess The Promised Neverland is likely to be better and possibly more popular. It at least the first season is amazing, future seasons may have difficulty keeping up the quality"
My Hero Academia,"I laughed, sorry you're getting downvoted lol."
My Hero Academia,He'll have significantly less screen time for this season.
My Hero Academia,Nah. He's the staple pervy character for the Manga. He gets toned down quite a bit later on with fewer pervy outbursts. he's a little more subtle about things.
My Hero Academia,I actually don't hate Mineta.  Maybe it's because I only watch the dub.  I've heard the english voice makes him more tolerable.
My Hero Academia,"Funimation has a deal with Hulu now, so they might be up same day on Hulu."
My Hero Academia,"Hulu has dubs which I think come out later

I think the subs are available at an earlier date elsewhere (legally)"
My Hero Academia,"There’s also *Hunter x Hunter (2011)* and *Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood* - both series tend to be more mature and well written than those shows you just mentioned. 

I’d argue that *HxH (2011)* and *FMA:B* are great TV shows in their own right that far surpass the majority of their genre peers."
My Hero Academia,"What about AoT makes it feel slow for you?  I don't feel that way, but am curious why you think so."
My Hero Academia,One Piece has great worldbuilding though
My Hero Academia,I've never watched AoT but I read the manga up until about 6 months ago... and the general art and character design is so damn bad.....
My Hero Academia,"No that's season 5. This season's gonna cover Overhaul, Bakugou and Todoroki's exam, and the Cultural Festival"
People Just Do Nothing,BANG! Lyrical blow to the jaw
People Just Do Nothing,"I have my T-shirt business, I have my internet cabin cafe business. But the hardest business to manage is the business of love, you know?"
People Just Do Nothing,"Love this show.

They have a new one out called The Curse which was pretty fun as well."
People Just Do Nothing,"I dont have a problem with drugs, I have no problem with drugs at all. - Steves"
People Just Do Nothing,Anyone have a link to some peanut dust?
People Just Do Nothing,Bunch of complete techheads. Absolutely loved this show
People Just Do Nothing,"Love the show, loved the film."
People Just Do Nothing,"70 quid, no problem mate, I can do that for you"
People Just Do Nothing,Theres a film!?
People Just Do Nothing,"This is set in Brentford, I used to live in Brentford. Kept seeing this / shots of Brentford on Netflix recommended so decided to watch to see if I could spot local places. Ended up being one of the funniest new UK shows if I've seen in a while. Started recommending it to everyone"
People Just Do Nothing,My brother has seen them perform live as Kurupt FM a bunch and claims they outperform serious acts every single time.
People Just Do Nothing,"Love this show and their commitment to the characters outside the show, that's what really set them apart from other mockumentaries. 

Their new show **The Curse** is great, I hope we get a season 2"
People Just Do Nothing,T - Audi TT!!! Love this show!
People Just Do Nothing,"Throw up your Ks.
F Netflix for removing it."
People Just Do Nothing,"I tried watching the first episode and found the accents really hard to understand, which is not normally a problem I have with British TV. Should I give it another try or is it a lost cause?"
People Just Do Nothing,So… Seinfeld?
People Just Do Nothing,Leaving every MC down on the floor.
People Just Do Nothing,Who’s that standing above him….?… M….C GrINDahHhhhHhh
People Just Do Nothing,What's the show about
People Just Do Nothing,Drugs actually reward my brain
People Just Do Nothing,There is a film. Next to impossible to see if you’re in the US.
People Just Do Nothing,"I saw them on their most recent tour just to see what they're like live. The music isn't really my cup of tea but they're clearly very, very good."
People Just Do Nothing,"Let me guess, you read the title and made the assumption the show was about nothing?"
People Just Do Nothing,"Call 999 it's an emergency, Beats and Grindah killed an MC"
People Just Do Nothing,Set in 80s. A small group of friends decide to rob a warehouse were some money is. Then then figuring out how to get rid of what they stole
People Just Do Nothing,You can find it on the high seas of you get my drift
People Just Do Nothing,"It has it's moments but it is like most TV comedy movie spin-offs, not great."
People Just Do Nothing,"Yup!  Exactly. Got a chuckle from the headline and moved on. 

And while I presume the downvotes are folks virtue signaling one shouldn’t make judgements based only on headlines, and they’d be right when it comes to forming positions on serious matters, I’m a firm believer that some things just get taken far to seriously and people need to relax and laugh a little…. Life’s better that way."
People Just Do Nothing,I get you!
People Just Do Nothing,"No. The downvotes are because you’re completely wrong, and your post brought nothing new to the table. (Shrugs)"
People Just Do Nothing,"I'm so excited, I had no idea!"
People Just Do Nothing,"Holy shit, Grinder looks so different."
People Just Do Nothing,This sounds like it could actually be quite good if Tom Davis isn’t over acting in it.
People Just Do Nothing,"Been waiting for this impatiently since I first read about it. A huge fan of People just do Nothing, and Stamp, Mustafa, and Chegwin work so well together as always and retain their roles and relationships from that series in this 80&#39;s East End small time gangster heist caper.

The East End settings, the 80&#39;s fashions, vehicles, language, smoky pubs are really well done. And a superb soundtrack. 

All the characters have depth and the plot is fairly bog standard..ill conceived heist gets out of hand and the twists and turns are predictable but in no way tiresome. Hints of Lock Stock and other Guy Ritchie tropes throughout.

I&#39;ve just sat through all six episodes back to back despite having to be up for work tomorrow.

Excellent supporting actors, as well as the lead roles, and some truly memorable set pieces.

Enjoyed it massively, but knew I would, and will be rewatching this week with my son.

Summary: Brilliant casting, excellent writing, highly recommended."
People Just Do Nothing,Grinder out here looking like Bob Belcher.
People Just Do Nothing,Is it any good?
People Just Do Nothing,This series is excellent!!!
People Just Do Nothing,now I'm intrigued with no way to watch
People Just Do Nothing,"It's about time they stuck the entire back catalogue of '24 Hours In Police Custody' on there. The odd ep isn't good enough. Will check this out later, tho

*missed a word"
People Just Do Nothing,"i never known anyone lose as much weight as beats, and yet still look 10 years older.

this is awful, its like what they would of done before pjdn, before they figured out what they wanted to do in life."
People Just Do Nothing,[deleted]
People Just Do Nothing,Thanks. Definitely going to give this a watch.
People Just Do Nothing,And DJ Beats is hardly recognisable.
People Just Do Nothing,He is massively overacting but it is massively successful.
People Just Do Nothing,"Yes, it's hilarious, wasn't what I was expecting, kind of inbetweeners meets Snatch"
People Just Do Nothing,?
People Just Do Nothing,"I'm on episode 2, he's awful.

Honestly every scene he's in is unwatchable"
People Just Do Nothing,Cool ill give it a watch then :)
People Just Do Nothing,[deleted]
People Just Do Nothing,What does your comment have to do with this thread?
People Just Do Nothing,[deleted]
People Just Do Nothing,Were you replying to a different thread?
People Just Do Nothing,Hold tight my Selectas!
People Just Do Nothing,Sounds perfect for peckish.
People Just Do Nothing,so just the show but not split into episodes?
People Just Do Nothing,"This is a documentary special, not a mockumentary special, according to the article. The show is a mockumentary."
People Just Do Nothing,"Neat, a documentary on the US Congress.  Should be interesting."
People Just Do Nothing,More Chabuddy and Peanut Dust
People Just Do Nothing,Get in! Brilliant show. Also can't wait for the movie they were supposed to be doing.
People Just Do Nothing,May contain nuts and glass
People Just Do Nothing,That’s why it’s Special.
People Just Do Nothing,"American raver, I found it extremely funny and it's definitely one of my top 3 British sitcoms along with Peep Show and probably Toast of London. I'm quite sad that the American remake with a focus on genres more popular here than Grime/Garage didn't end up working out but perhaps that's for the best, super excited for the movie.

Re:your whole translate to non-Brits thing, as I basically just said Stateside very few people ever cared about grime or garage (hence why the failed American version was gonna focus on different electronic genres) but the whole ""outdated musicians want to be big"" thing mixed with the Office-esque vibe I think is pretty universal."
People Just Do Nothing,"One of my favorite shows, the characters are still somewhat relatable. Everyone has a Steves but the show is hysterical with just the right touch of sadness too. I can’t wait for the movie!"
People Just Do Nothing,"Brit here, so can't answer your question, but just thought you should know that they've just announced a PJDN movie coming out in August. Trailer dropping tomorrow."
People Just Do Nothing,I ordered some vodka from Chabuddy G. but haven't received my product yet.
People Just Do Nothing,From the states and I think its absolutely hilarious and I can’t wait for the movie to come out.
People Just Do Nothing,"Seems like everyone here loves it so I hope I don't get downvoted for having a dissenting opinion, but I'm really not a fan. I found the characters more annoying than humorous, which built into an immense disliking of the show due to an English flatmate who would watch it on repeat non stop. I don't think there's much in it for people who aren't aware or invested in the subculture they're parodying, as a lot of the characters seem to be written to be unlikable people."
People Just Do Nothing,"Huge fan, show is absolutely hilarious. I'm an American but very into various different styles of UK EDM, and many others, so this show was right up my alley."
People Just Do Nothing,I randomly found this show on Netflix 2 years ago and instantly fell in love with it
People Just Do Nothing,I love it.
People Just Do Nothing,"I love it. Probably there are some aspects that are a bit lost on me, as I don't ever see anything and think, ""Oh, I know people who act *exactly* like that,"" but the humour still works fine even when you can't relate to it.

The shirts for Angel's baptism that make it look like she's dead, Miche not knowing what lavender is, Steves being amazed at how Fantasy asked for an orange.. that shit's just funny no matter where you're from."
People Just Do Nothing,"I love it, I have to watch with subtitles though!"
People Just Do Nothing,"I watched all of it, I'm a big fan of British comedies and mockumentarys to begin with so not sure if that's what you looking for."
People Just Do Nothing,"I'm Irish, I'm a gigantic fan it. What makes it better is the way the actors embraced the characters on social media. It helps keep the characters alive. 

I'm excited for the movie!"
People Just Do Nothing,I enjoyed it
People Just Do Nothing,I loved it!
People Just Do Nothing,"I think this is one of the funniest British shows ever. I've known more than a few wannabe rappers in my time, so it strikes a particularly hilarious chord with me."
People Just Do Nothing,"Randomly turned it on one day and it hooked me. Hilarious show, I love it. ""I've got a job interview at Tie One...
Not the country"" I was dying when I heard heard that."
People Just Do Nothing,"I only watched one and a half episodes but I really didn't find it funny at all. I've seen a decent amount of UK comedy, but this wasn't for me. The characters were annoying rather than funny to me. 

I don't have a high tolerance for annoying characters, nothing to do with the quality of the show."
People Just Do Nothing,I’m Canadian and I loved it. It was one of those “if you liked this (Derry Girls) you might like this...” suggestions. It’s such a funny show.
People Just Do Nothing,Canadian here. Summer heights high/angry boys > Hardy Bucks > People Just Do Nothing > Trailer Park Boys
People Just Do Nothing,"Absolutely love it. Up there with Peep Show, The Inbetweeners, Fresh Meat, and Gavin and Stacey for me. MC Griiiinnndaaaaaah......"
People Just Do Nothing,Greatest show. Cracked my top 5 comedy. The Office. 30 Rock. South Park. Simpsons. PJDN.
People Just Do Nothing,"I did not know that, thanks"
People Just Do Nothing,"He can get you a deal on peanut dust, just ask him."
People Just Do Nothing,It is kind of like Trailer Park Boys set in London but everyone is Jroc.
People Just Do Nothing,"Peanut dust, perfect for peckish, Peanut dust, perfect for your wife. 
Check out the clip where they visit Post Malone to give him some tips."
People Just Do Nothing,"I adore this show and it seems to be more popular amongst family/friends that I recommend it to than my usual taste of weird sadcoms and [adult swim] shows, but it is about a rather niche topic if you're from the States, Garage and Grime never really took off here.

They're supposed to be making a US adaptation about EDM instead, which could be great or terrible."
People Just Do Nothing,"It's always one I recommend. But I'm a Londoner, so I wonder if it doesn't translate as well to those that aren't."
People Just Do Nothing,It's almost as if they're just doing nothing.
People Just Do Nothing,I stumbled on it by accident and loved it!
People Just Do Nothing,BANG lyrical blow to the jaw BANG
People Just Do Nothing,"[""Hair blowing in the wind, shitting in a bucket...](https://youtu.be/u-CdPSE4Lcg)"
People Just Do Nothing,"I recommend this show to everyone I can.

This and ""this country"" are 2 of the most underrated comedies out right now."
People Just Do Nothing,"Sounds like they are shooting a movie.

the “dry” cheeseburgers are hilarious   Steves marathon set where he explains the different types of garage was great"
People Just Do Nothing,"What’s it about? I looked up trailers in YouTube and I’m not sure if I’m looking at the right trailer
Thanks"
People Just Do Nothing,I love it so much. I'm so excited for the movie!
People Just Do Nothing,"I'm following their playlist on Spotify, lol."
People Just Do Nothing,[deleted]
People Just Do Nothing,Lmaooo pretty spot on
Leyla and Mecnun,follow up question - where can you find episodes online?
Leyla and Mecnun,I think it's a really popular Turkish soap opera.
Leyla and Mecnun,"It can be a pain to figure out IMDB ratings, one thing I try to do is is click on the ratings and look at what the [top 1000 raters have given it and the IMDB staff ratings.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1831164/ratings?ref_=tt_ov_rt) Also in this case its worth pointing out the US user ratings as well.

Aside from that there isn't a lot to go on for this show. the IMDB reviews seem to be very biased if not vote rigged.

Along with checking IMDB I usually look at Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic, and avclub, to vet a possible new show but thats not an option for this one apparently."
Scream Queens,"I actually started rewatching it!  I think it was the first episode, during the murder scene with the texting and then posting on Twitter/FB or whatever that she needed help while being murdered--I always forget how much I love that scene."
Scream Queens,Chad radwell is hysterical and I’m glad Glen Powell is starting to get more roles
Scream Queens,Denise Hemphill is a goated tv character
Scream Queens,I loved this show when it came out! Season one was such a fun ride and had so many quotable moments. I did never finish season 2 but maybe nows the time to try it again.
Scream Queens,Just started watching it for the first time! Is it true you should stop after the first season? That’s what a roommate told me a few years ago anyways
Scream Queens,Season 1 chad (played by Glenn Powell of Top Gun Maverick) was AMAZING
Scream Queens,"Chanel-O-Ween is the most brilliant parody ever.

[Clip.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc6IziijhBI)
[And the follow up.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t62_hlRQepU)"
Scream Queens,I loved this show. Billie Lourd’s Chanel 3 was my favorite Chanel.
Scream Queens,Agreed! I wish there was more - I just keep rewatching the two seasons there are haha
Scream Queens,That theme song is a straight up Halloween jam.
Scream Queens,I watch it every Halloween. It’s great.
Scream Queens,"I don't know how he did it but this is somehow Ryan Murphy's most consistent show, in the sense that the endings actually line up with the tone of how the show started and the writing doesn't get any more or less insane than how it started out. Which makes it one of the only of his shows I've been able to enjoy the entire season of."
Scream Queens,"A season 3 would have been so interesting after the reveal in season 2 that >!grace, the protagonist of the first season, went insane after the events of the first season and the dad, seeking revenge in the 2nd season against chanel, died doing so so seeing grace, a protagonist, return in a hypothetical S3 as the villain would've been neat!<."
Scream Queens,Season 1 was so much fun. One of the few times all of the Ryan Murphy hallmarks really worked for me. Season 2 was unfortunately a downgrade that I never got around to finishing.
Scream Queens,"Rewatched it a couple of months ago, top notch stuff indeed. S2 took quite a hit when they benched two of the best characters for some god forsaken reason."
Scream Queens,"I used to love that show when I was 16, maybe I should rewatch it."
Scream Queens,I thought this show was hilarious
Scream Queens,First season is iconic. Don’t watch the second one though
Scream Queens,The first season is great but the second one is trash
Scream Queens,There’s only a handful of times I’ve ever laughed so hard while watching TV as I did when I first saw [that scene.](https://youtu.be/op3H5DY8nXw?t=02m46s)
Scream Queens,The backstreet boys hunt scene is one of my all time faves scenes. [ghetto code](https://youtu.be/nHUYc4HJNYw)
Scream Queens,The fact that she refers to Zayday Williams by her full name always kills me
Scream Queens,"If you watch the first and love it, watch the second. It’s a little worse but still pretty fun. If you watch the first and just mildly enjoyed it… nah, probably skip the second. It isn’t gonna improve the experience."
Scream Queens,"Like most Ryan Murphy shows, all of the really great ideas are used in season 1. I never finished 2 but it's hardly a disaster, just a pretty big step down. Everyone is still having fun and there's still good moments."
Scream Queens,"Second season isn't nearly as good as the first and kills off some characters that probably would have been better to keep on, but it's still mostly fun overall. Deciding to just let the show be a one season thing is a good idea as it lets you leave the show with it feeling like a completed thing. But there's still enjoyment to be found in Season 2 even though it ends on more of an unresolved note than the first season."
Scream Queens,"No, the first season is better but the second season is super fun too"
Scream Queens,I loved the first season and the second one made me so bored I was thinking about dropping the dhow altogether.
Scream Queens,Nope.
Scream Queens,"YES! It was such stupid, campy, hilarious, fun!"
Scream Queens,"I finished the second season! It was hilarious the whole way through! And if I didn’t watch the last 30 seconds could have been a good closing to the series ha, but I’ll just pretend cliffhanger was an open ending/didn’t happen ha"
Scream Queens,Ok thanks for the feedback! I will plan on watching it in full then! Emma Roberts kills in her Mean Girl role ;)
Scream Queens,"I finished the second season! It was hilarious the whole way through! And if I didn’t watch the last 30 seconds could have been a good closing to the series ha, but I’ll just pretend cliffhanger was an open ending/didn’t happen ha"

Scream Queens,"I finished the second season! It was hilarious the whole way through! And if I didn’t watch the last 30 seconds could have been a good closing to the series ha, but I’ll just pretend cliffhanger was an open ending/didn’t happen ha"
Scream Queens,Chad Radwell is a Top 5 Ryan Murphy character. Literally everything he did or said was funny.
Scream Queens,"Season 1 was soooo good!  Oof, did that show go downhill quickly after that."
Scream Queens,New interview with me confirms I'm interested in Emma Roberts interest in a Scream Queens revival.
Scream Queens,"S1 was fucking hilarious. S2 was fine, not as bad as most say but id 100% be down for a revival."
Scream Queens,"Isn't Emma Roberts a giant piece of shit who's a well known domestic abuser? That abused Evan Peters so much that she left him bloody but had mentally destroyed him so much that he decided to not press charges? Yes, yes she is. Also abused people tend to stay with their abusers for an entirely too long of a time sadly and somehow that makes people think that it's somehow acceptable to be abusers."
Scream Queens,"When the show was good, it was great. But when the show was bad, it was Ryan Murphy disastrous.

Too inconsistent for me."
Scream Queens,Wasn’t she arrested for beating her boyfriend? Not cool
Scream Queens,[deleted]
Scream Queens,If she’s smart she’ll audition for the rumored Harley role in Matt Reeves’ Arkham series. Especially since she turned down the role in Suicide Squad to do Scream Queens. Second chance if I’ve ever heard of one…
Scream Queens,"[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t62_hlRQepU) was Scream Queens at its best.  Also, casting Jamie Lee Curtis was a coup."
Scream Queens,**Yes please.** I unironically loved that show. **Both seasons don't @ me.**
Scream Queens,"I mean, I would too if I'd played the only character that seemed any fun to play."
Scream Queens,"I never gave this show much though coz I’m a guy and (caveman voice) me no like girly shows oo-oo, but my housemate was watching it in the background and I found myself really enjoying it. Ended up binging all of it. The acting is really solid, the writing is great - it’s a really fun watch so this could be good news!"
Scream Queens,A Final Girls movie sequel first please.
Scream Queens,Finally watched it last Halloweeny kinda time and it was surprisingly good.
Scream Queens,Yes please. This show was really underrated.
Scream Queens,Good! I LOVED this show!
Scream Queens,Dont be talkin bout it ….Do it !!!
Scream Queens,Yes!!!!!!!!! I’m so happy
Scream Queens,"I really wanted to like it, but I didn’t get the humor. It was different…"
Scream Queens,[deleted]
Scream Queens,Scream Queens was the epitome or the whole isn't as great as the sum of its parts. Maybe they'll learn from their missteps.
Scream Queens,"""Interview with local tradesman confirms he's interested in more work and therefore more money, shocking stuff, more at 11!"""
Scream Queens,Domestic abuser Emma Roberts?
Scream Queens,Make it happen!
Scream Queens,Breaking news: actress interested in making money
Scream Queens,She needs a job!
Scream Queens,I dated a girl who liked this show. I gotta say this seems like a show for straight psychopaths.
Scream Queens,[deleted]
Scream Queens,"Hey, another abuser."
Scream Queens,[deleted]
Scream Queens,Oh god please no.
Scream Queens,Was she the character who always wore earmuffs?
Scream Queens,[deleted]
Scream Queens,I knew Glen Powell had a career ahead of him after watching him as Chad.
Scream Queens,"""I had my first boner watching Faces of Death"" is one of my favorite line ever"
Scream Queens,Chanel Oberlin is a Top 1 Ryan Murphy character!
Scream Queens,Denise Hemphill for me
Scream Queens,So underrated!
Scream Queens,Killing Chad Radwell was when it really dropped off for me. Heart and soul of the show.
Scream Queens,"I recently rewatched and ended up liking season 2 a lot more than I originally did. It's definitely less satire and more straight up comedy and parody but a thought a lot of the jokes were pretty clever and I appreciated how fucking insane it went without a care.

I'd love a season 3 or some sort of revival, so much has happened in entertainment and the world at large since it was canceled I think they could find lots of ideas to work with."
Scream Queens,I liked it all just fine. I'd like to see more.
Scream Queens,You can describe literally every Ryan Murphy show that lasted 2+ seasons with this comment.
Scream Queens,They blew their budget on Stamos. I don’t even know what a new season would be about.
Scream Queens,is this for real?
Scream Queens,Yup that’s always the hardest part of Scream 4 for me :(
Scream Queens,"Not excusing her behavior but when your father goes away on drug charges for a long time, that can fuck up a kid real bad. It messed with her so bad that she never visited him behind bars."
Scream Queens,Why isn’t she blacklisted like Johnny Depp?
Scream Queens,"Seems like she's got about 5 movies coming out soon, nothing major but billed with big name actors. She's never exactly been A-List herself."
Scream Queens,One that she only got on because of nepotism. the whole cast really (the girls)
Scream Queens,[deleted]
Scream Queens,Whaaaaat? Did she have the role locked above Margot?
Scream Queens,Thought it was going to be the chainsaw fight.
Scream Queens,"There are dozens of us!

I rewatched the show maybe 2 months ago and both seasons really do hold up. Season 2 is noticeably worse though because of the staggering decision to remove 2 out of the top 3 characters, Denise and Chad."
Scream Queens,what makes you think she had mentally destroyed him so much that he decided to not press charges?
Scream Queens,"Yes but wasn't Evan Abusive to her too? I remember reading things got physical on both their ends, but I could be wrong"
Scream Queens,not sure how you could know about the last part of your comment also I think they were still together for 7 years after that incident
Scream Queens,I’m not calling for it but I’d watch it.
Scream Queens,"No, that was Billie Lourd, Carrie Fisher's daughter. Emma Roberts played Chanel Oberlin/#1."
Scream Queens,"how do you know that she had  mentally destroyed him so much that he decided to not press charges?

and they were still together for like maybe 7 or 8 years after that"
Scream Queens,He was also great in Top Gun: Maverick.
Scream Queens,Couldn't agree more.  Chad was the best character.  Chanel #3 and Denise Hemphill were a close 2nd and 3rd!
Scream Queens,And Denise 😏
Scream Queens,Not ‚pose‘
Scream Queens,"Yes, the police was there to confirm,  its not a he said she said situation. 
Its straight up known.

(The assault part, the 'mentally destroyed' part is speculation. )"
Scream Queens,"Yes

Designated Survivor,First season is great. After that it just doesn’t hold up.
Designated Survivor,"I wasn't able to get past the first episode, where they pretend Iran moving destroyers to the Strait of Hormuz is some major crisis, but the protagonist defuses it by calling in the Iranian ambassador and talking tough to him.

- The Strait of Hormuz is international waters and in Iran's backyard, their navy moves through there all the time.

- The Iranian Navy is a joke, the last time the US tangled with them we nearly wiped it out, and our only loss was a helicopter the Iranians claim to have shot down but most likely crashed due to pilot error.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Praying_Mantis

- If Iran really wanted to create a crisis in the SoH, they would use naval mines and missiles, not destroyers.

- There is no Iranian ambassador to the US.  Its sorta the foundational issue for our relations with the Islamic Republic, ever since they attacked our embassy in Tehran and took our diplomatic staff hostage."
Designated Survivor,Would have been a great miniseries
Designated Survivor,"Holy cow, what is this writing?"
Designated Survivor,I wouldn't recommend it. The writing is bad and the characters are cartoonist.
Designated Survivor,"I think it probably would have best served as maybe a mini series or a locked 2 season show.

It tried to be too many things, house of cards, family drama, west wing, lost/mystery show…there are also plot points that just could not happen…and the bigger questions at play (like how you could replace all of Congress, and judicial branch all at once) are given less time than say…daddy issues."
Designated Survivor,"I think it's an original show.

I liked it but often the show didn't live up to the interesting premise."
Designated Survivor,"We liked it but lost interest after the original plotline (the fallout from the disaster) was resolved.

I guess... compare Prison Break or (in this case, either) House of Cards, shows that are ostensibly about a single plotline that was resolved early on but kept on going anyway. Personally, some of what Prison Break did next was quite memorable (that hell hole prison in, I forget where) but much of it wasn't. British House of Cards' is probably at its best in To Play The King but there's a reason they call it a trilogy... through the judicious use of time skips, it's able to put Urquhart in two new situations that evoke the original. American House of Cards' second arc was fine-ish but it was floundering after that."
Designated Survivor,Cool concept with bad execution. It was something where you could get really detail oriented and make it very authentic because the strength of the premise is so apparent…. But then they opted for mundane regularly tv drama with it
Designated Survivor,"I made it further this 2nd round somewhere in s2 maybe after a certain tragedy . Then I dropped it as I didn't find the politicking appealing .

Still better than when it aired live and I made it 3 episodes in  ...

I hope to finish it some day if the mood is right ."
Designated Survivor,"I think this show should have been a limited series. Have what happened and uncover the conspiracy and then end it. Instead, it dragged. I think it's a really cool concept but something that shouldn't be a multi-season show.

There were times where his experience in HUD was actually showcased to help him and that was interesting.

As for the bipartisan aspect. He is an independent. Sometimes they will remind you he is independent and promote the idea of other independents. But most of the time he seems like a Democrat.

I didn't watch when it moved to Netflix so perhaps he seems more independent there?"
Designated Survivor,"Well, what do you think?"
Designated Survivor,It is a shitty TV show.
Designated Survivor,"I enjoyed the first half of season one, but it started faltering by the end.  I got about halfway through season 2 then I gave up.  It didn't know what it was.  Political drama?  Spy thriller?   Something else."
Designated Survivor,it's awful
Designated Survivor,Does it do a good job of being bipartisan
Designated Survivor,I have to write a hundred charecters when I just wanted to ask one question
Designated Survivor,">like how you could replace all of Congress, and judicial branch all at once

out of curiosity, do the justices show up in the state of the union? wouldn't that mean all branches were lost that day?"
Designated Survivor,">that hell hole prison in, I forget where)

Panama"
Designated Survivor,What does that even mean?
Designated Survivor,"I meant the run-on sentence, lol."
Designated Survivor,"It doesn't try to appeal too conservative or liberal

What's with the downvotes"
Designated Survivor,Yes it absolutely does that and it's really for the worse.
Designated Survivor,Can you elaborate please
Designated Survivor,One of the worst deaths for one of the worst FBI agents ever written. Seems fitting.
Designated Survivor,"Semi-unrelated but I’d be down with CTU agent Maggie Q. 

GIVE ME MORE 24"
Designated Survivor,I actually liked season 3.  >!He becomes the thing he detested.  A true politician.  Corrupted and all that.!<
Designated Survivor,"What a wasted potential of a series.

They could've made a show about a potential American Civil War but instead it became another poor West Wing clone."
Designated Survivor,It's a one season concept.  It would only work if they could somehow turn it into another 24 with a new storyline each season or put it on a more premium network with fewer episodes per season.
Designated Survivor,"I stopped watching that show early in season 2. It's like once they used up the brilliant premise of the show for that first season they didn't know how to continue, so they just threw everything at the wall to see what stuck. I don't know if the third season had this but when the second started they kept adding these horribly unfunny jokes everywhere, like the show was all of the sudden a badly written dramady."
Designated Survivor,">- The sudden disappearance of half of the cast with no explanation whatsoever. Some were minor characters, but quite a few had major roles and had actually become some of my favorite characters on the show. Where the hell did Mike go?

I started following LaMonica Garrett after he was on CW, and saw that he mentioned he was not asked to return to DS because of the budget. So, that's where he went. 

I don't watch Designated Survivor but I saw a lot of people were mad about this when S3 came out."
Designated Survivor,"It should have just been a film. Sometimes ideas only work as one thing. This had a great premise, but not for a TV show. I wonder why it was never developed as a film. It would have made a great political / spy thriller."
Designated Survivor,"So I couldnt last through season 1 of this version, however I did stumble upon the Korean version of this series, which had the same big story beats and found that I liked the characters a lot better. Also they planned it only being a single series long, so everything ties up nicely. If anyone really liked the concept of Designated Survivor, id give it a shot. It worked for me. (You can find it on netflix)"
Designated Survivor,[deleted]
Designated Survivor,I haven't watched the show but everyone I know who watched the show trashed that season so hard
Designated Survivor,"Maggie q needs another series, preferably action"
Designated Survivor,"That show had an identity crisis after the main storyline from season 1 was resolved. It couldn't decide whether or not it wanted to be a weak West Wing copy or a 24/Nikita copy. Then when season 3 started, they completely forgot Maggie Q was in the cast and gave her some meaningless side story to follow until she was unceremoniously killed off."
Designated Survivor,I stopped watching when his wife died.
Designated Survivor,"I think the part I gave up on was when NASA consulted *him* for help with a space mission emergency. 

The first season was great, but if your premise is a novice president thrown into it unwillingly, getting reelected for a second term is a series ender whether you knew to do that or not."
Designated Survivor,"I'm with you on this one. I really liked season 1, thought S2 was OK, but still had potential, but I couldn't even finish season three for pretty much all the reasons you pointed out. 

They kept saying how he was a Centralist president, but it didn't actually show up in the show. I'm not sure he had any conservative views to decisions. The fact that they were pushing an agenda became pretty obvious once they captioned the reaction videos in the show with ""actual footage from real Americans"" or however they phrased it."
Designated Survivor,"I really wanted to like that show. It had an interesting premise, but ended up being a watered-down West Wing more often than not."
Designated Survivor,"I was told just to watch Season 1 and stop there, so that's what I did."
Designated Survivor,Haven't watched this show but did you see what they did to game of thrones?
Designated Survivor,I agree. House or Cards too tho...
Designated Survivor,"Loved season 1 but they had no where to go in season 2

Never watched season 3

This is the problem I have with network television that put out 16-20+ episodes which kills most shows in the long run unless they have  a good script and story to tell. 

This would have  done better with 8 -10 episodes per season for 3-4 seasons run."
Designated Survivor,Give us one more season of Jack Bauer please Keifer
Designated Survivor,Try the Korean version.
Designated Survivor,Agree with much of what was said... but I really did like the ending were he pretty much became everything he hated.  A lying politician.
Designated Survivor,"Precisely--good summing up. Except maybe you were too soft on the show, and the wokes who right now are saying ""What do you mean, man—Season 3 was great! Finally, a show that addresses The Issues!"" 

Season 3 was ***so*** bad, people tend to forget it was already dumb & getting dumber, more implausible and overly woke in each preceding season. My family & I would laugh at how Kirkman's supposedly this independent ""centrist""--but all the issues he's centrist about are things conservatives would want; the evil, unreasonable extremist senators he has to outmaneuver are always Republican, and the wise compromises he enforces are always Democratic positions!"
Designated Survivor,"I only saw tidbits from when my parents were watching but wasn't there that Republican candidate who was implicated in a bioterrorist plot, but then a character found a phone call that showed he was outraged by the plot, the only problem being the same character had already been filmed telling a bunch of white Republicans that demographic trends showed whites becoming minorities? Also, that scene were his chief of staff or whoever gets the Dems and Repubs and tells them ""people are tired of your politics, they want someone in the middle"". As a New Zealander (a country where our PM literally declined to get treatment for his colon cancer so he could devote his time to winning a mandate for universal healthcare and the welfare state in the fucking 1930s) that made me lol"
Designated Survivor,"I liked season 3.  They gave a good storyline to the FBI/DHS agent, who always was a grafted plotline in the previous seasons.

> What about Hannah's dependable sidekick Chuck?

She wasn't working FBI/White House security, so why would she still have the same co-worker?

> The WAY over the top liberal agenda.

I think they wanted to pivot future seasons of DS as a modern reboot of the West Wing.  Personally, I miss the notion of using the US government to actually attempt to do something constructive for the nation.

>  Probably the most egregious crime committed in season 3 was taking one of the best main characters and killing her off without any sort of fanfare whatsoever.

I'm a big supporter in the credible, unhappy ending.  If DS was going WW, they had no use for SA Hannah anyway."
Designated Survivor,"Man, I thought Dexter season 8 was bad. I mean it was, but still."
Designated Survivor,"I totally agree. That first episode was fantastic, and set up a really intriguing premise that was exciting to think about. I don't think they knew where to go in season 2, and leaned into the political drama rather than the action and potential of civil war. Shame."
Designated Survivor,"> It's like once they used up the brilliant premise of the show for that first season they didn't know how to continue

They did.  They should have done it as a miniseries and ended it definitively with the season 1 finale instead of going with the standard ""but wait, there's a bigger conspiracy""."
Designated Survivor,"That's really the unfortunate part of the show. The premise is spectacular. They just made it continue for longer than the premise could support so it turned into a hybrid political drama/FBI thriller and wasn't all that great at either (although I loved the Michael J. Fox storyline).

I kind wish it had been done as a limited series instead. 8, maybe 10, hour long episodes. Unravel the mystery, seal up the story, and just let it go. Instead, it got 53 episodes and most of it was filler or mindless plotlines to make it into an action thriller and give Maggie Q something to do."
Designated Survivor,"I stopped at the same time. I did enjoy the Korean version, though."
Designated Survivor,Same. Early season 2 is where I lost interest. I feel like everyone has that same view. It's a great premise that they wasted and and just tried to keep changing the show into different things to see what works
Designated Survivor,Man same situation here after he appeared as the Monitor haha. LaMonica is such a nice Instagram follow. Guy really cares about interacting with fans which I find really cool.
Designated Survivor,Apparently a reason it got canceled was because contract negotiations failed
Designated Survivor,"Interesting, I'll have to check that out."
Designated Survivor,"Yep, up until then it actually felt like a nice modern replacement for 24 (Kiefer Sutherland and all). After that it really lost it's footing."
Designated Survivor,I completely agree the first half of the season was drawn out way too much and then we get to the aforementioned episode and so much shit goes down with an actually shocking ending then it slowly fizzles out and somehow they kill off the instigator of the entire plot a few episodes into season 2.
Designated Survivor,She's the best
Designated Survivor,"Exactly. You could go back and delete all of Hannah's scenes from season 3 and it would make no difference to the main story. I don't think they knew what to do with her character, but they still wanted her involved so they could add the 'cool spy' aspect to the show. It was just a mess."
Designated Survivor,"Don't forget the president's son pretty much disappeared in the middle of season 2. He luckily jumped ship on to another series, Cobra Kai lol."
Designated Survivor,"The wife died? Eh, no big loss, all she ever did was be the ""supportive wife"" cliche."
Designated Survivor,"I knew someone would bring this up, and I guess the last season of GoT (and maybe the last season of Dexter) would ACTUALLY be the worst season in the history of television, but this is a fresh wound for me and I needed to get it off my chest."
Designated Survivor,"Honestly I feel it should have been a mini series. Maybe even a movie. I loved the first episode but didn't even make it through the first season. 

The premise was cool but there just wasn't enough meat on the bone to carry 20-episode seasons imo"
Designated Survivor,"Yeah, when I first heard about the premise of the show, I was like, 'wow, that's brilliant, but there's no way that works for more than a season.""  I felt the same about Homeland, but I was clearly wrong about that."
Designated Survivor,I wouldn't  necessarily say they wasted the premise. That first season really was amazing TV all around.  They just didn't know when to stop.
Designated Survivor,I did not like Nikita that much but always got into it when she had a fight scene
Designated Survivor,"Dexter can at least say that while the finale was a shitshow, the entire last season wasn't wall-to-wall bad.  If they re-wrote the last 2 episodes and had season 9, it would not have the reputation it does.  It was no Season 1-4, but it was better than Designated Survivor 3 for sure."
Designated Survivor,"I feel your pain though, there's hope for dexter now at least"
Designated Survivor,"GOT is just very disappointing. Massive drop in quality between S6 and S8. 

But man it’s not even below average when compared to other shows. Especially shows that last 8 years."
Designated Survivor,"Homeland had the same issues in the mid seasons though, but strong writing and a change in direction helped redeem it in later seasons."
Designated Survivor,"I disagree about that. I feel like the first season could've been so much better. Going into season 2, I had the mindset of yeah that was decent but the next season better improve on it."
Designated Survivor,"I stopped watching at the end of the first season, or maybe I watched the first episode of season 2 and then stopped. Once Brody stopped himself from being a tool of terrorists I felt that was the end of the premise and there was no reason for the show to continue."
Designated Survivor,"Homeland thankfully shifted and adapted to telling stories in self-contained seasons. The Brody thing gets dragged out until Season 3, but after that each season is more standalone.

I suggest you keep watching because they managed to produce some really great seasons and they absolutely knocked it out of the park for the final episode. Just know that Seasons 2 and 3 get pretty bumpy."
Designated Survivor,"5 showrunners in over 3 seasons, yikes. "
Designated Survivor,"I guess with House of Cards ending, Netflix needs another political thriller.


And I am pretty surprised they picked it up. Haven't seen the show yet (loved the premise and trailer), but I read disappointment from people expecting Kiefer Sutherland to be the usual ""24-esque"" action hero. I think the POTUS personally going around shooting terrorists would be a huge tonal shift lol.

With Netflix picking it up, I might as well binge the show once it arrives."
Designated Survivor,This years cancellation season has got to be the weirdest one of all time. So many shows were cancelled and so many were revived. 
Designated Survivor,News of a cancelled show being revived has never been as boring.
Designated Survivor,"This is all gossip I've heard on other sets here in Toronto (so don't take anything I say as gospel) but...

The main reason it was cancelled by ABC was because there was a clause (or something to that effect) that if it was picked up for a third season, production would move to Los Angeles.  Basically, Keifer has been away from his home in California for most of the last four years and wants to go home.  Also, there was a disconnect between the writers in LA and production in Toronto, leading to a giant dip in quality in the second season.  Ultimately, the ratings on ABC did not justify the extra cost of the move.  With Netflix picking it up, production will likely stay in Toronto.

(Unconfirmed) tidbit: After its cancellation, its sets were purchased by someone and effectively destroyed (Whoops!)"
Designated Survivor,"Looks like Maggie Q is not returning.

>The core cast of the series, including Sutherland, Kal Penn, Adan Canto and Italia Ricci, are set to return.

https://deadline.com/2018/09/designated-survivor-saved-netflix-season-3-pickup-abc-cancellation-fake-news-kiefer-sutherland-1202418300/

EDIT: She is ""in talks"" to return"
Designated Survivor,Good. I like this show. Maggie Q alone is worth it.
Designated Survivor,"Netflix is really weird when it comes to the shows they decide to revive and those they cancel.

I’m still catching up on the first season of this show and I wouldn’t consider it to be must-watch, but it’s easy to follow along while playing in the background. 

I do hope they stretch the creative boundaries a bit more than allowed on ABC. "
Designated Survivor,[deleted]
Designated Survivor,Can Netflix revive Dirk Gently next?
Designated Survivor,"Oh i can't wait to hear what fake middle eastern country names they come up with this time!

this show is a joke, fun to watch because of how ridiculous it is, though. Plus we also will undoubtedly get the totally non-cliche Agent Hannah Wells back in her black baseball cap tactical outfit! That will be fun. lol"
Designated Survivor,"YEEESSSSSSS.

Ending on that cliff hanger was going to piss me off. "
Designated Survivor,This show would have been 1000x better if they downplayed the espionage and focused on the politics of a guy who should never have been president being thrown into office. I still haven’t finished the second season because all the plot about the secret society an their plot to take down America just put me to sleep. 
Designated Survivor,"If they can make it a cable style drama, that would fix it. No concerns about censorship, of any kind. 

Season 2 was mostly disappointing, especially as the season headed to its end. 
"
Designated Survivor,"I'm glad it's getting revived. With a 10 episode order, the story will be tighter and hopefully more intriguing."
Designated Survivor,"Eh, fuck it, I'm excited for this. I'm behind on the show, but I liked what I saw

I *would* rather have more Jack Bauer, though. And some more Kate Morgan (Yvonne Strahovski)"
Designated Survivor,Hopefully it goes back to being a political thriller and stops trying to be a new The West Wing.
Designated Survivor,"And, yet, Dark Matter was not revived.  I'm not sure I care enough to start back up with a new season of Designated Survivor when I gave up halfway through season 2."
Designated Survivor,Jesus fucking Christ they receive this shit but not So of Zorn or Colony 
Designated Survivor,[deleted]
Designated Survivor,Reading this thread: OMG this show sucks Netflix why would you pick this up and not _____ (insert favorite show here) 
Designated Survivor,"It was canceled? Not really surprised.

This show was really great in the first season, I couldn't wait for each episode. Then season 2 just dragged on so much with very little happening in each episode that I stopped watching. 

Hopefully they bring in some better writers than whoever was responsible for season 2."
Easy,4 8 15 16 23 42
Easy,"Ben Linus actor was also great in Person of Interest and currently as the bad guy in Evil. If you’re down for a more dark mystery show, check out Evil."
Easy,I live on the island where it was filmed. The shell of the plane was sitting up on the North Shore for a long time. I loved trying to guess if they were on a sound stage or actually out at a spot I was familiar with.
Easy,"I agree. Honestly, people are too harsh with Lost imo.

The show started a whole trend of mystery shows, it wasn't afraid of thinking outside the box; maybe it strayed a little too far from the box, but this doesn't erase all the good things about it: fresh storytelling, engaging mystery plot, iconic scenes and dialogues/lines, complex and multilayered characters, themes that are properly conveyed through both symbolisms and dialogues, plot twists that were actually surprising and, least but not least, it knew how to deliver a good emotional punch right in the feels. 

I'm not saying it's perfect (cause I would be straight up lying), there were plenty of things that pissed me off too, and I did notice a decline in the writing on my rewatch, but a lot of people here act like the bad outweights the good; and this is where I disagree. Like it or hate it, Lost meant a lot for television. I mean, there is a reason why even today people are so desperate to find ""the new Lost"".

(Hated the Nikki and Paulo's episode though, I'm ready to fight. I still think those two probably had some connections with the people in charge and that's how they ended up getting their own episode, no one can change my mind)"
Easy,"Lost is really one of those ""the journey, not the destination, is the reward"" sort of shows.  Its easy to think the whole thing or the ending sucked because some mysteries had lame answers or weren't answered at all.  But if you can manage to accept that the mysteries were never going to get good answers anyway, the ending was really, really well done and beautiful, I think."
Easy,"I’m about as big of a Lostie as there ever was and I always love to see a post like this. I personally think there are two episodes I could qualify as at least borderline bad. “Fire + Water” “Stranger in a Strange Land” and maybe “Par Avion” too.  They’re all just wastes of time. And at 122 hours while attempting to satiate fans while also make money and serve the network, that’s pretty good damn good."
Easy,"> I do miss not being part of the early shows.

It was a mixed bag.  Much of the disappointment from fans at the time came not from the show itself, but from all the stuff around the show.  The constant media presence from the creators promising things that were never going to happen, or did not live up to the hype, soured a lot of people.  It added a layer to the show you don't get watching it years later, but not everything in that extra layer was a positive.  In many ways, watching it without all the extra stuff is a better way to watch it.  The show gets to stand, or fall, on its own."
Easy,"Lost was an incredible show start to finish if you simply embrace it was about the character and just accept they didn't have a plot from the beginning. The last few seasons  of the show are actually \*about\* this fact.

The thing that I've almost never seen anyone write about lost is that the writers were very, very, very aware they were making shit up, and they built it into the storyline. The more you learn about Jacob and TMIB, the show explicitely tell you that these are two fucking idiots who are making shit up as they go along for no good reason. And the characters in the show assume there's a grand plan and it ruins them. It's explicit! It's the text! And its OBVIOUSLY an allegory for the show itself - Jacob and TMIB are the writers, and the characters are the viewers. They are laying it out there. And I thought it was brilliant.

People also never give Lost credit for answering basically every question they ever raised. All the little mysteries? Answered. People get upset at Lost for not answering big questions that are fundamentally not answerable; they basically wanted the writers of Lost to explain things like God and the supernatural, things which have no explanation. 

If you are someone who simply cannot get over the fact that back in 2004 they didn't have a fully planned out 6 season arc, well, then you just won't ever get over that. Sorry. But that's not what the show was."
Easy,"Just rewatched for the billionth time with a roommate who had never seen it. God, it's such good fun. Not close to a perfect show or a perfect ending for sure, but a blast. 

Something I really appreciate on a rewatch is the various transformations the show takes. S1 is very much a survivor drama with mystery sprinkled in. By the time S5 comes around and we're deep in the time travel aspects, it's like holy shit wtf? On this rewatch, I fell by behind by half a season and went from Dharma stuff to popping in on the episode where Jack is teaming up with the smoke monster. It's a wild jump to take, but I love it. I can see how that aspect of the plot is probably bad to people, but to each there own. I love it. There's something for everyone; a man of science or a man a faith or a casual viewer or a TV sleuth, everyone has a season or a plot thread to enjoy."
Easy,I will never get over the Cain and Abel nonsense they put in there with the Man in Black and his brother in white.
Easy,"I guess this is truly one of my only unpopular opinions. I recently watched all of lost with my boyfriend for the first time (it was his pick, he watched it growing up and I’m convinced that the memory/sentiment of the show is why he’s so attached to it). It was actually painful and I was so annoyed that I got emotionally invested in any of it, because it was that disappointing. Eventually I learned not to pay too much attention to the side plots and ultimately the main plot, because they were just never returned to and irrelevant, like most of the show"
Easy,"I re-watched a few months ago after many years, and loved it all over again. I slowed down as my interest waned in season 3, but picked up steam again in seasons 4 and 5. I really loved season 5 this time around. That being said, season 6 is just awful. So much wasted potential. I'm not one of those ""they were dead the whole time"" people. Clearly they were not. But I loved the flash sideways for further exploring season 1 character motivations, and rolling back character development. Telling the story of what happens if the plane made it was so much more interesting to me than the purgatory it turned out to be. The stuff on the island falls short too. 

Great show, I'll see you in another 10 years lost, I will eagerly await your return."
Easy,Lost was awesome but I do remember I got really annoyed with something and gave it a 2/10 in the end. I don't even remember why. Maybe I should rewatch it since my wife never seen it
Easy,"Lost is my favourite show of all time and I will die on this hill. No show will ever give me the feelings of excitement I had when Lost was airing. The theorizing and anticipation for each episode amongst me and my friends defined my entire high school experience and gives me fuzzy feelings of nostalgia to this day. My yearbooks are literally full of lost references, my 16th birthday cake was a dharma symbol, and all my old Facebook memories are Lost references and pictures of my favourite character, Ben Linus. To say I was obsessed is an understatement lol. For this reason, it holds a special place in my heart, despite its flaws."
Easy,"Yes. The binge watch response.  

The haters are mostly the people who had to dig deep through 8 years of waiting and false advertisements.  They would literally say “the answer is next week” in 24/7 commercials that ran and ran. 

For example, I bet that one episode with the couple that sucked and ended up buried alive was a fine distraction. That episode was the only new episode in the middle of a six week gap of episodes.  

If it took you a week or two to get through it I can see being more accepting of the flaws and the ending, but that last episode felt like a kick in the throat to people who waited 8 years for “the real treasure was the friends we made along the way”"
Easy,The flash sideways storyline then and now feels like wasted time
Easy,"I think the last season of Lost is a game of thrones level fumble. The finale and the Richard Alpert episode are good, but everything else about it is shit."
Easy,"Chronologically LOST is a fan edit that puts the entire series in chronological order, pretty fun to watch especially the beginning."
Easy,It’s honestly one of the greatest shows of all time. The high budget really paid off because the show looks exceptional for it’s age
Easy,"I think it's really not so. I look at it as one of the shows that's an indicator of how far TV has come since then, in fact. 

It's far too slow, the pacing has to be some of the worst for a big TV show ever. But more than anything, there's just a feeling that the writers didn't have a six season plan or even a 2 season plan for that matter. I don't have a problem with mystery box shows, but you have to be able to disguise it better."
Easy,"I actually think seasons 1-3 are the weakest because of them having to drag things out for 24 odd episodes (with the exception of s6, which is bogged down by the pressure of having to give too many answers that people might find disappointing). I find seasons 4 and 5 to be so much tighter since they are shorter and more focused. People jumped ship when they introduced the time travel, but that is my absolute favourite plot of the show."
Easy,"Yo I didn't like Nikki and Paulo 🤜


But it was a good episode anyway. Love Lost"
Easy,"The original was made better by the fan built Lostapedia , which was the fans trying to list all and track all the various references and how all different shows and films tied into the show.

The original wiki is now here https://lostpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lostpedia

Which may still be of some help and add to the show, but when it was being built, we were tracking everything, like the guns they had, what was in bunker(Swan Station) and what was lost to ""The Others"", what was gained,  charters alias decoding that staion map and all the clues as we got them.  The differences in The Looking station you saw from the Blueprint Schematics of it and so many red herrings and weird synchronicity for other books, series and films. Plus all the various websites and what you found exploring them and looking into the servers and sorting fan made fakes from real Show produced promotion urls for companies. Like Oceanic Airlines had website that had cancelled flights and then one was ""supposedly bookable"" that filled up and then was listed as late, missing as the show unfolded the plot.  There just was so much extra out there to find online in the early internet... This was the first show to have websites for the companies showed in series with show clues in them.  That was lost experience, I'm sorry you won't get.

Getting the season's DVD sets got you extra footage and facts that would be gone over and analyzed for details and anything hidden in the back shots.

It was stated that even the show writers would use it (occasionally participate in stealth with posting) to help keep track of everything."
Easy,Great story telling. The diverse cast felt authentic and allowed for very textured stories
Easy,"Ha! Locke stabbing Naomi was peak Lost, I nearly lost my shit when he did it, such a great season!"
Easy,I watched it again for the first time since its original run. I have to say I liked it more the second time.
Easy,WE HAVE TO GO BACK!!!
Easy,"Beside the CGI, which wasn't the norm for TV shows back then, the show holds up really well. 
I watched it for the first time a few years back & I was compelled throughout."
Easy,"Hey, a Lost thread, nice. First time here with having finished it first time last year.

It was fucking great. I binged it last year for 2 weeks and had the most great 7-8 hours a day in that year (wfh works its ways!) and while it was popular, I was fortunate to not be spoiled by anything at all. 

Favorite parts were it was revealed JL was a cripple, press-the-button-or-not arc, the time travel and the we-have-to-go-back arc. I got giddy when it got to the time travel part and it was so surprising to me but I loved it and as a sci-fi lover it was the best surprise!

Anyway, I'm trying a schedule for a rewatch this year with like 3-4 episodes a day at most and this is my first thread for reaction in the series."
Easy,"I watched Lost front to back when it was first on TV, then every deployment overseas in 2015,2017 and 2019. It became my “thing” to keep me distracted. 

I am now watching it again on Hulu and I’m almost done Season 3. Never gets old to me!"
Easy,It’s ironic because I think Lost gets a bad rep now because it’s a “JJ Abrams show” when literally all he did was direct the pilot and influence some of the early Season 1 concepts.
Easy,"I disagree, but I'm glad you enjoyed it."
Easy,"I really enjoyed Lost.  

The ending kind of disappointed me though, it kept building up to some huge mystery, again and again it got more complex, more interesting, I was desperate to know “what’s next?!” 

Then it just ended…..I don’t feel like a lot of the “mysteries” got a proper explanation…..in fact I actually do t remember how it ended but I remember plenty of details from throughout the series. 


At the very end, it could have just been Hurley waking up from a bad dream on the plane, and I would consider that an equally disappointing ending.   

(It’s been years since I binge watched the show btw)"
Easy,"ITT: Lots of smart-asses with the benefit of 15 years of debate, analysis and interviews with the creators all over youtube, acting as if the meaning of it all was very obvious and all the other dum-dums just didn't get it."
Easy,"Be sure to watch ""The New Man In Charge"" epilogue. It ""ties up a few loose ends"", so to speak.  And it's on YouTube!"
Easy,"It was and still remains an amazing show. If you think about the fact they had to work within the classic network system and produce many episodes every year (24 even in the first 3 seasons), it's incredible what they pulled off. The network was expecting them to go 10 full seasons, but they managed to talk them down to six, and essentially got renewed for three seasons during season three with the endpoint confirmed, which was unheard of at the time. 

While it does have its low points, the characterisation and overall mythology is so well done. I didn't really like the flash sideways stuff in season 6 but can appreciate what they were going for. They had an ending in mind and they went for it. 

Also, people always shit on many things not being explained, but I just don't agree with that. Pretty much everything was explained. Some people just didn't get it or didn't like it and thought of it as a non-explanation. Check out [this video ](https://youtu.be/YaDeJCT4ejY) and [this playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5iTj9psbPrPEzwYsy0Rz1ImSo9lCqytm) where this guy does a real good job of laying out all the answers."
Easy,"I've never seen someone write using ""but"" so much. You should take time to learn how to process your thoughts this was a hard read that could have essentially just said, ""as an average viewer Lost holds up""."
Easy,"I LOVE Lost! I was in a lonely time in my life and it made me so happy! The characters, the mystery, the humour, the exotic island.

I started watching it right before season 4 started. I was living in a College dorms and this one website had high-quality streaming of the first 3 seasons, so I watched them back to back over a few weeks on my laptop. Then when new episodes came out I’d reserve the (usually empty) party room & watch it on the set there.

I’ve been afraid to go back & rewatch because sometimes shows just don’t hold up to the original memory.

Also fun story: Legend has it that Lost was filming in Hawaii at the same time as Dante’s Cove (a sort-of soft core witch soap opera). Apparently the cast of both shows went skinny dipping together in a secluded jungle pond."
Easy,"If you like being lied to, sure.
Nothing means anything.
The mysteries go nowhere and mean nothing.
It's stylish and well shot drivel."
Easy,"Not all of it, but it is still a very god and rewatch-able  show with an ending that got unjustifiably trashed."
Easy,"I'm here to downvote the ""They were dead the whole time"" crowd."
Easy,"It was the watercooler show Game of Thrones could only dream of. One of the biggest and most influential modern tv shows ever, and it's quite exceptional that there's has not been any kind of spin off/ revival attempt."
Easy,I just rewatched for the 1st time since the finale aired live in 2010. I enjoyed the hell out of it. I was so disappointed with the finale I couldn't bring myself to watch it again. After this rewatch I'm much more at peace with the way it ended. It really confirmed for me that its the best show ever made.
Easy,"It should have been 3 seasons. There’s A LOT of filler. That said, the first 2 seasons were mostly brilliant and as good as television can get"
Easy,"Is Ben the antagonist?  His character seems to change depending on what the story needed that week.  Sometimes he’s pure evil and sometimes he’s mostly good.  I know I know that’s why he couldn’t get into Heaven in the end, but come on you have to admit the whole show doesn’t fit together seamlessly."
Easy,Glad to hear. I'm going to start my rewatch on Monday. Just finished Halt and Catch Fire and it's still amazing too
Easy,">So I missed out on Lost when it first came out. I was a snotty shitty teenager who thought it just looked dumb

A whole new world opened up to me once I stopped being a cultural elitist and realized that sometimes what the dirty masses are enjoying can be (sometimes) really good and worth checking out."

Easy,"I tried to watch Lost three times now but I just can't get over how amateur it looks, how 'network tv' it looks. It's just bad. The writing, the acting, the feel of the show, the sfx. I just can't get past three or four episodes.

I feel like this is more of a nostalgic show for people who grew up with it than it actually being a good show."
Easy,I think the show would have been perfect if it ended with season 3. How great would a series finale have been with the final words being “we need to go back”
Easy,Except that Jack sucks and the show clearly wants us to like him.
Easy,Around season 3 or 4 I think... the creator's said they were not in purgatory.
Easy,"Never watched.  Seemed lije,a lot od drama with no real reveal.  Just red herrings over and over."
Easy,Fringe even more so
Easy,I missed all of lost but I remember a lot of loud complaints about the ending which stopped me investigating it later.
Easy,"I just want the video of the Monkey explaining everything the produces promise they had in the safe in case the show was canceled early and/or something happened to them  to answer all the questions/mysteries.

Don't let them keep the monkey video hidden from the fanbase! They promised it existed as a fail safe in case the show or the writers had something happen, so we wouldn't be left hanging.

 I wanna see the Monkey!"
Easy,"Clearly, and thank you, thread, I need to re-watch Lost."
Easy,Love this show so much
Easy,[deleted]
Easy,"I’m still angry all these years later at watching all these seasons.
Fringe had a much better payoff."
Easy,"I don’t hate the Nikki and Paolo episode either but I wonder if that’s because we binged it instead of watching week to week.

But yeah I agree overall. I’ve watched it maaany times over the years and I still think it’s really well done for what it is. Plus you can’t beat the score, it’s beautiful."
Easy,I watched LOST during quarantine for the 1st time and absolutely LOVED it. I can definitely see where though when the series was on why people were pissed with the ending but I enjoyed it. Is it weird though I personally liked Sawyer and Juliet A-LOT MORE than Jack and Kate??
Easy,"Yeah, as much as i hate last 2 seasons, i rewatch Lost once in 2-3 years. It's highly rewatchable and enjoyable no matter what."
Easy,Those are bad why would you type that?
Easy,"Love Michael Emerson in all three shows. He's great in *PoI*, and his character in *Evil* gives me the genuine creeps."
Easy,"Literally, I think 75% of the reason that I watch Evil is for satanic Ben Linus. First season was the worst for me specifically because it took a while to get his character going. Current seasons, I'm always at my happiest when he's on screen."
Easy,How was season 3 of Evil? I felt like season 2 was a big step down in quality except for a couple of episodes (the earworm and the silent episodes). The show started to feel aimless. Does season 3 have more of a direction for the overarching plot?
Easy,I’ve not seen either but have been more interested in checking out person of interest
Easy,Definitely less on location filming it seemed later on. Some of the back drops now on me OLED stick out as looking off
Easy,I would be sneaking around spying on them
Easy,"The commentary on the Nikki/Paulo episode is really funny. They introduced these characters that were supposed to be background ""extras"" upgraded to the main cast but everyone hated them so they condensed their entire planned arc into one episode."
Easy,"IIRC, the Nikki and Paulo episode came about because some fans complained that we never got introduced or spent time with the “background characters” on the island during the first two seasons. So the creators tried to bump Nikki and Paulo into minor roles and, to no one’s surprise, fans hated it. 

So after the show came back from its mid season split, they killed them off. Which ironically is a very good standalone episode lol"
Easy,I think the biggest let down/miss in the series was just completely dropping the Walt and the unable to conceive children storylines.  I think if they would have resolved those two storylines which made up a huge part of the early seasons then people would be less sorrow on the show.
Easy,Have you tried From? It’s very much in the same vein
Easy,Nikki and Paulo might have had their episode just to give the rest of the crew a break.
Easy,"It did start a trend of mystery shows.
Empty mystery box shows.
That's not a good thing.
All of them were bad.
All of them empty and soulless with no actual plan.
Name one that was good."
Easy,I agree about the journey but at the time I was sure there was going to be a good explanation as the end.  I remember mid-series people were theorizing that they were in the afterlife possibly purgatory. The showrunners came out and specifically denied that possibility in mid-series.  I'm still mad about that. They should have kept quiet.
Easy,The dream sequence in Fire + Water is a highlight of the show for me though.  Rest of the episode is meeeeh.  At least Par Avion resolved a Christian Shephard mystery.  Stranger in a Strange Land has almost 0 positives.
Easy,"I'm inclined to agree with you simply because even though I haven't watched more than a couple episodes of the show in over a decade, I know what 2 of the 3 episodes you're talking about are right away and LOST wasn't even a show that put the episode titles onscreen. IIRC the ""Jack's tattoos"" episode was the writers being meta to the network about getting an end date like ""if you want 10 seasons of this with no wrap up this is the shit you're gonna get"""
Easy,">  “Par Avion”

Wasn't that the one we got see the young Goth'ed out Clare in. That made watchable or was that episode about Shannon, in which case it agree. I remember the episode name for reason I can't recall, so it was ether something interesting or bad."
Easy,"I’d throw in “Further Instructions,” where Locke builds a sweat lodge, Eko gets randomly kidnapped by a polar bear, and in the flashback, Locke lives in a commune that grows pot."
Easy,"It’s a show that benefits quite a lot from the lowered expectations of a  contemporary binge watcher, in large part, because it has such a strong start that the momentum helps carry a binge watcher all the way to the end.

People probably hate to hear this, but there’s going to be a raft of posts and discussions in about 10 or 15 years from people who never watched Game of Thrones when it aired, binged it straight through with all the momentum of the early seasons sliding into the blinding spectacle of the last seasons and want everyone to know they don’t get the hate."
Easy,"never thought of it like this!, you could be on to something,

 the first couple of episodes ( lets be generous and say the first season) were ok, >!the flashback thing, the monster, people on the other side of the island, the whispers, the strange science people on the tapes!<, but somehow they never commited to any of the story lines besides the romance angle, for me it turned into a soap about 3 seasons in.

but your theory about the writers is intriguing, maybe i should rewatch some of the later seasons."
Easy,"I agree, it’s the best tv show of all time"
Easy,"I didn't care for the flash sideways until the Desmond episode, and then everything that happened in the finale involving it was absolutely tearjerking."
Easy,"Nah, I think it's the only time I've seen old, and dead, characters get an emotional resolution with the surviving characters.

I think it was genius.

Easy,"Eh I disagree. I thought it was at first but when I rewatched w my SO, I was actually surprised how much the flash sideways storylines work in S6. They arguably carry some of the episodes w weaker on-island plots"
Easy,"Even if Desmond hadn’t connected it, it’s still a worthwhile “what-if” character study."
Easy,"Agreed. I did a rewatch of Lost last year and tapped out before the flash sideways stuff. I loved everything before that, though, just as much as the first time around. Maybe even more so, since the first time watching the show we had to deal with long breaks and reruns in-between that could make following along kind of confusing sometimes."
Easy,I liked it and thought it was interesting.
Easy,"I wouldn't go as far as the GOT finale, but it's definitely a big step down, especially since I really liked season 5. It went from like a 9/10 to maybe a 6.5/10 in the final season imo. It's kind of funny how Lost is remembered for a shitty finale, when really I think (like you mentioned) the finale was one of the best parts of the season."
Easy,"We are halfway through the last season and I can’t decide if I should just push through to finish it to the end or call it now. Such a disappointment from the earlier ones where I couldn’t wait to watch the next one. I watched it when it was on tv but hardly remember it, but do vaguely remember being disappointed in the last season then too"
Easy,The one about Jacob was pretty good too.
Easy,"Yeah, they just proved what many were suspecting before: They were just pulling
mysteries out of their ass, without ever giving two thoughts about their answer."
Easy,"There was a writers strike at the time of the last 3 seasons. That's why the seasons were noticably shorter. The network, ABC, wanted more seasons because it was MASSIVE when it was airing. I agree it does seem long but not by the writers initial plan. I could see it being 4 seasons of a solid show...maybe 5."
Easy,"Same here, LOST is amazing and seasons 4-5 are my fav"
Easy,It gets a bad rep because the ending fucking sucked.
Easy,"Yeah, hard disagree on rewatch.  Acting is poor and once you know where it goes it falls flat on a second watch."
Easy,Hard hitting analysis right there
Easy,Which mysteries do you think didn’t get explained?
