TV Show,Comment
Nuestra Lucha Libre,This looks a bit like a G rated Lucha Underground.
Nuestra Lucha Libre,Looks fun. The marvel inspired luchador costumes are pretty decent.
Nuestra Lucha Libre,"AAA has fumbled the bag so badly with the Marvel Lucha Libre stuff that I'm not expecting too much with this, I hope it works out but they've treated it like such an afterthought despite using some of the most famous characters on Earth."
Nuestra Lucha Libre,"I remember being so excited to watch Lucha Underground, but then I saw just how boring the wrestling part of it was. I’ll still check this out but I’m not expecting anything different."
Nuestra Lucha Libre,u/savevideobot
Nuestra Lucha Libre,Is this satire ? I can’t tell lol
Nuestra Lucha Libre,Bruh lucha underground was a GEM. It was either so blatantly fake that it was beyond hilarious or it was them actually smacking the living shit out of each other. Either way it was a spectacle to behold.
Nuestra Lucha Libre,Pretty sure I saw it somewhere described as trying to be Lucha Underground
Nuestra Lucha Libre,How can you find LU boring from a wrestling standpoint?
Nuestra Lucha Libre,I think I find all wrestling boring. Throwing someone to the ropes and doing moves which look weak just isn’t entertaining to me. I would rather watch a wrestling anime like Ultimate Muscle.
Nuestra Lucha Libre,"So then you don't like wrestling. That's ok as it's not for everyone. Lucha Underground had a hybrid comic book/telenovela style of presentation for their vignettes. Since it was taped and had a special studio for the wrestling, the in ring product was heavily edited and could seem a little disjointed at times but the action itself was great"
The Creative Indians,"Just cancel it. Don't ruin the momentum of the franchise before it even begins. Let the films come out, really sit down and plan out a cohesive vision for expansion if needed. 

Brian Herbert's involvement is already a red flag."
The Creative Indians,The spice must *not* flow!
The Creative Indians,Feels like every time I hear about this show is about someone leaving.
The Creative Indians,Maybe not every property needs to be turned into an expanded universe with a ton of spin offs?
The Creative Indians,"Can't say I'm very interested in this series now. Rough enough with the showrunner switches, now both a director and main actress are leaving."
The Creative Indians,"HBO:

>""As Dune: The Sisterhood has entered a pre-scheduled hiatus, there are some creative changes being made to the production in an effort to create the best series possible and stay true to the source material. Johan Renck has completed his work on the series and a new director will be brought on; through mutual agreement, Johan is moving on to pursue other projects. Additionally, Shirley Henderson will be exiting the series and will no longer be playing Tula Harkonnen.”

Filming is reportedly on pause for at least 7 months."
The Creative Indians,"So they screwed up the beginning.  Pay attention to your source material, folks:

""A beginning is the time for taking the most delicate care that the balances are correct. This every sister of the Bene Gesserit knows."" --Frank Herbert, Dune"
The Creative Indians,I always found it odd that THIS was what they chose to be the first Dune spin off.
The Creative Indians,"just make Spice World 2 already, damn."
The Creative Indians,Renck was originally supposed to direct episodes of The Last of Us as well. Sucks to lose out on two great franchises.
The Creative Indians,They fired them. Just say it. People get fired in the early stages of show production
The Creative Indians,Shirley Henderson is awesome.
The Creative Indians,always a good sign
The Creative Indians,"looks like brian herbert and anderson are still on board in some capacity, so it's gonna be just as shitty as the trash they ruined frank herbert's universe with. a quick look at the wiki told me they're *still* writing trilogies about every fucking thing, it's insane. means there must be a market, somebody's actually buying them."
The Creative Indians,Money.  The great creator and destroyer of all good things.
The Creative Indians,The next Nevers
The Creative Indians,"It takes place 10,000 years before Paul Atreides?

In other words it’s a bunch of nonsense that has nothing to do with Dune."
The Creative Indians,"*It is unclear whether Henderson’s departure is related to the creative changes, Renck’s exit or the new start of production but we hear the delay is wreaking havoc on actors’ schedules, creating potential conflicts that may lead to more exits and recastings.*

Oof. Let’s be real; this show is dead. They will quietly pull the plug on it in whichever quarter the write off works best for the financials. 

This show dying was probably why we got the recent news they ordered the It spin-off show."
The Creative Indians,Sad to hear. After Chernobyl I’ll watch anything Johan makes.
The Creative Indians,"None of the names in this article are anything to be excited about and the lone show runner left seems to have a knack for getting involved with shows right when they start to suck(Lost and Altered Carbon).

No great loss imo since this show most likely was, and is going to suck anyways."
The Creative Indians,"Oh wow, the showrunner for this show has some pretty questionable credit under her belt:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alison_Schapker

Most notably she was showrunner for Altered Carbon... but only on the second season (taking over for show creator  Laeta Kalogridis) that was laughable worse in every aspect compared to season 1."
The Creative Indians,"A lot of you didn’t read the article and shows they said the show was a departure from Dune and Villeneuve vision so I think this is a good decision on their part. Rather have look and feel like the 2020 film.

“We hear Renck’s auteur approach did not jibe with the streamer’s vision for the series and was a departure from the look of Denis Villeneuve’s films, which led to his departure”."
The Creative Indians,"Well at least if they keep imploding now they can cancel it now instead of after 1 season .. saving us  all having to wait a year .. **grrrr** Warner ...

&#x200B;

*le sigh*"
The Creative Indians,I still cannot believe that Warner just let Zaslav talk his way into merging the companies and raiding HBO.
The Creative Indians,Ya I’ll just be excited to see the second Dune movie. It doesn’t need a TV show.
The Creative Indians,"Dune isn't very cinematic. Dune Part 1 was fine but it essentially adapts the most cinematic portion of all six novels. Most of Dune is just people thinking and talking. 

The Lynch film includes all the thinking and it's awkward."
The Creative Indians,Who?
The Creative Indians,"It sounds like a half baked attempt to make a HASHTAG GIRL POWER series on the back of the show.


Don't fuck up the reboot.

Wait until the 2nd movie comes out, if its great go back to the drawing board."
The Creative Indians,godamn it :/
The Creative Indians,Filming is now on pause for 7 months. Wtf.
The Creative Indians,Shame. I really liked chernobyl
The Creative Indians,I saw the show on the title and automatically knew it was nothing good.
The Creative Indians,Ghast on plant
The Creative Indians,Never trust a man in that style of hat! Never!
The Creative Indians,Wow..
The Creative Indians,"Just cancel it and commission a series of anime shorts to fill in the backstories for the Guild, Bene Gesserit, and other factions of the imperium."
The Creative Indians,Wow. So this is gonna suck. When will studios learn that their involvement almost always makes it worse. Let the creatives do their thing and stay the fuck away.
The Creative Indians,"Please just cancel it. I'm new to the Dune universe, having only seen the new movie and read the first half of the first book (to not spoil the movie), but everything about this just screams like it will be horrible. If you wish to make Dune into a franchise, it should follow Denis Villeneuve's lead, not the people who ruined Altered Carbon, nor the ones that care so much about a character's sex or race."
The Creative Indians,"**The Dune universe is good, but that universe is not why the series is good. The series is good because of the philosophy, politics, and psychedelic sci-fi of Frank's six books.**

I fucking love Dune but I don't think spinoffs for it are a good idea, just in general. Dune is not made to be a universe ripe with spinoffs. The world-building is sparse, only there as much as is required to serve Frank's story. Anything that doesn't serve the story is only described very vaguely, if at all. It is not Star Wars. There's no mysterious mentions of Kessel Runs or Clone Wars. It isn't made to house endless side-stories. Telling more stories in that universe has a ""just for the sake of it"" feel to it, because the universe and lore was never the point. Don't treat Dune like Star Wars, where the universe and lore and history are the real focus. Dune is not that. 

**TL;DR** Dune is good because Frank Herbert had a message he wanted people to hear. Attempting to expand the universe that he used as his soapbox is missing the point."
The Creative Indians,"Its already canceled,  they just have not made it official yet."
The Creative Indians,"Are you fucking kidding me man

WB Discovery is a shitshow"
The Creative Indians,"It'll probably wind up getting cancelled. This show was never needed. Focus on just the movies and letting Denis Villeneuve create greatness.

Not every successful project needs to have someone kind of prequel/spin off series. I'm looking at you *Penguin* (spinoff of The Batman) as well as the Taylor Kitsch *Terminal List* prequel."
The Creative Indians,I agree. The source material for this show is really bottom of the barrel type stuff and I have no idea why it's being considered at the nascent stage of this franchise. This is schlock that comes out a few years after the final film is done and they need to churn something out to hold onto the rights. I don't think a lot of the book fans made it all the way to Chapterhouse let alone Heretics. I have an inkling why this show got greenlit and why they handed it to the person who ruined the second season of Altered Carbon and it was giving me strong vibes of being shitty like The Wheel of Time series.
The Creative Indians,"Brian Herbert's heavily involved in the entire franchise. Executive producer on the movie. Plus, Anderson is story consultant. He's basically to Dune what Leeland Chee is to Star Wars."
The Creative Indians,"Brian Herbert’s involved? Oh, yuck. I read two or three of his Dune universe books and they were all really awful. Not even just awful compared to Dune’s really high bar; awful in general. I wouldn’t have hope for anything he’s involved in."
The Creative Indians,"> Brian Herbert's involvement is already a red flag.

I am more concerned with that the showrunner is the woman that only showrunner credit is for Altered Carbon, but the second season that everybody (rightfully) hated after taking over duties from show creator Laeta Kalogridis). 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alison_Schapker"
The Creative Indians,And Kevin J Anderson as consultant. A damn hack who writes sub-subpar Star Wars fanboy novels.
The Creative Indians,"Yeah, I loved the first book but it became burdensome to finish the rest with the exception of Children of Dune. I started one of Brian's books and then checked out. I'd rather read the Wikipedia plot summary (it's better written) about the rest."
The Creative Indians,"Thank you. Like, don’t Disney Star Wars this."
The Creative Indians,Asking Warner/discovery and plan something cohesive sounds like a paradox.
The Creative Indians,"The thing is Dune as a franchise is probably never going anywhere outside of a movie based on the first book.  The first book is by far the best.

Granted, the Frank Herbert books are about a zillion times better than the trash put out by his son."
The Creative Indians,Lolol that's not how Hollywood operates
The Creative Indians,">Brian Herbert's involvement is already a red flag.

i mean he wrote the book didnt he"
The Creative Indians,"If that was a red flag all ya'll prequel haters should've never been on board for this in the first place. Anyone that's read even the original prequel trilogy would know roughly where this is going....

*edit* I agree fully they should let this project die, even though we don't agree on the books. The movie reboot is risky enough, and frankly I didn't even like it. =|"
The Creative Indians,"I’m not sure theres much momentum to be had.  Dune part 2 comes out this year, MAYBE you get Messiah, but the rest of the books are the definition of unfilmable without completely changing them.  

WB should be happy that they’re getting a prestige few films out of this and move on."
The Creative Indians,"Agreed. Longtime Dune fan, loved the new movie, eagerly awaiting part 2.  But, I really don't need a spinoff and would probably only watch if it gets rave reviews.  I am just so over spinoffs and having IPs stretched thin.  Just take your time and make great movies, and I will see them in theatres and buy the 4k.  I can't imagine a Bene Gesserit show driving subscriptions."
The Creative Indians,The Harkonnen won’t like that
The Creative Indians,"It’s been such a shitshow for years now. Multiple showrunners have come and gone, seems like Villenueve has lost interest in being involved, now they are shutting it down mid-production and starting over. As controversial as Zaslav’s bloodbath has been at Warner since taking over, I don’t see why this is something they are latching onto and dumping more money into. Hell, I don’t see why they are allowing this to go into production before seeing how the second movie does at the box-office. The first one did pretty well considering it was day and date on streaming, but it isn’t like this is a proven IP."
The Creative Indians,"Then how do we make a billion, asking for a corporation... I mean ""movie studio"""
The Creative Indians,"Dune is already that, though."
The Creative Indians,It might be for the better. Reports are their vision was straying away from the books
The Creative Indians,"Good.

Why launch it without the second half of the story in the movies?"
The Creative Indians,">Filming is reportedly on pause for at least 7 months.

Probably to see if Dune: Part Two is a success or not."
The Creative Indians,"Is the source material for Dune really worth sticking to? I think Dune and Dune: Messiah can translate well to film/TV with a fairly faithful reproduction, but beyond that... the good parts like God Emperor or Heretics are high concept weirdness, and the more straightforward stories like Brian Herbert's prequels are just garbage."
The Creative Indians,They should have just made the show about the Butlerian Jihad. The Bene Gesserit are so boring
The Creative Indians,"I’m intrigued to be honest but with it being set 10,000 years before Dune has be worried for some reason"
The Creative Indians,"the problem with these spinoffs not based on any source material is that they aren't organic, like it's not a writer with a really clear vision for a show or a breakout character getting a chance to be a lead, it's a ""we need synergy with a movie franchise"" decision. Seems like a process that inevitably leads to expensive, lackluster tv."
The Creative Indians,"I considered it a mistake, even when people were excited about it."
The Creative Indians,He’s probably the problem then lol.
The Creative Indians,"If it avoids the Rings of Power path , yeah"
The Creative Indians,theres A lot more dune books than there is dunes books with Paul as a main character. It’s just the most famous one.
The Creative Indians,Them wanting to keep the look of Denis is a red flag to me
The Creative Indians,At this point it feels like a years wait is short. All I am waiting for seems to take longer than a year to film a season.
The Creative Indians,"That’s not what happened at all? AT&T owned Warner Media and were drowning in debt. Discovery was interested in buying, so AT&T shuffled $50 billion of their debt over to Warner for the merger. AT&T would be bankrupt in a couple of years if they didn’t get rid of a shit ton of debt, and the easiest way to do that was getting rid of Warner Media with a lot of that debt attached. Discovery was the only company willing to inherit that kind of burden. If AT&T had not unloaded a lot of their debt into the company and were simply trying to sell it off, places like Apple or Amazon would have went to a bidding war for it. Apple has basically been picking up any HBO talent that leaves over the last few years. If things go south under Discovery, my money is on Apple buying up most of Warner and it’s subsidiaries for well below value when it all goes up for auction."
The Creative Indians,"Sure, nothing cinematic about a drug-fueled orgy, psychedelic visions of the future, riding massive beasts, a huge battle involving the universe's two most deadly armies, a fight to the death between two high profile combatants, and a child who can walk, talk and fight like an adult. You're right, part two is going to be boring as fuck."
The Creative Indians,"I hate this Dune isn’t very cinematic meme. Tell that to Jodorowski, in an ideal world we would have got his outrageous(ly) good version"
The Creative Indians,"> HASHTAG GIRL POWER

... because some of the main characters would be women in positions of power?"
The Creative Indians,What’s the inkling you have?
The Creative Indians,"I couldn’t finish Chapterhouse, very disappointing considering how amazing and interesting the universe is."
The Creative Indians,"Anderson’s involvement isn’t great news, either. Maybe he’s a canon keeper-like figure, but that’s because he made like half of it up himself. Badly."
The Creative Indians,"Executive producer is meaningless in terms of implying a degree of involvement. It's often just a name drop. Almost every author is an executive producer on movies/series based on their work, *unless* they have specifically disassociated themselves with it."
The Creative Indians,"No his father Frank did. 
The books with Brian’s name on them are written by Kevin J. Anderson and they are a massive step down in quality. More akin to the Star Wars legacy books in quality."
The Creative Indians,Villeneuve said in an interview he wants to do Dune Messiah and then move on.
The Creative Indians,"Zaslav wants the big IPs to be milked. It's why WB is doing another LotR trilogy with Embracer. He doesn't care about Raised by Wolves or some forgotten Michael Crichton movie. He cares about Harry Potter, LotR, Dune and Batman (presumably Aquaman too) until they stop making money."
The Creative Indians,"Dune is really a Legendary IP, and they are the production company behind this show. So it seems that some of the initial costs may not entirely be on Warner. Also Bloys said they are going to focus on all IP shows for Max, so there is some incentive to keep it. 

But yeah I agree they should kill this, it seems like a production disaster."
The Creative Indians,Is seems like Villeneuve is becoming a control freak and just kicking people out
The Creative Indians,"The concept is one that could be amazing, but many of the figures involved leaves me with very little hope. But there's honestly just way, way better ways to create a spin-off show in the universe, heck there's some... *Okay-ish* books you can base shows off of."
The Creative Indians,"It is possible to make billions without bloated universes. See LOTR, Potter, Pirates, Spider Man by Raimi. But it requires time and talent."
The Creative Indians,....arent the books they are basing this off terrible?
The Creative Indians,"This is the kind of thing I would only want launched ONLY after a faithful enough movie adaption of Children of Dune released, to be honest. 

Like, at least let Frank Herbert’s most familiar works be adapted before his son’s crappy work floods us all!"
The Creative Indians,"Never read Brian's stuff, but yeah I think the original 6 books are arguably all tough to bring to the big or little screen.  Too much internal thought from the characters instead of dialog.  Too many high-minded concepts that are difficult to do while still sticking to the old rule of ""show us, don't tell us"""
The Creative Indians,"The first book is by far the best and would make the best adaptation.

I'm not sure that even Dune Messiah would be something most people are interested in.

God Emperor of Dune was an interesting book - but it would be very, very difficult to adapt into something that would be commercially successful."
The Creative Indians,"The Bene Gesserit are cool in the books, I don't think they can make them look cool on the screen. The Butlerian Jihad though... You are right, that would be awesome to see."
The Creative Indians,"It feels like they are making the same mistake as the abortive Game Of Thrones spin-off ""Bloodmoon"". Setting the story thousands of years before all the interesting stuff happened."
The Creative Indians,Perhaps
The Creative Indians,"Unlikely. He has been an in-demand music video director for decades, making a few episodes here and there until Chernobyl. If he had been a dick, he wouldn’t have kept getting jobs, because he wasn’t a star TV director before Chernobyl (if he even is now)."
The Creative Indians,Yes i’ve read most of the sequels by Frank Herbert. But he didn’t write the prequels.
The Creative Indians,How??? It should look like the film the series and the films go hand in hand it makes sense he is even a producer on it
The Creative Indians,"Let's not keep the look of Best Cinematography winner ""Dune"""
The Creative Indians,"It’s a 7 month delay till production which will take close to a year, then another year for post, probably won’t see it till 2026"
Switched,"I mean this is a fairly pragmatic view point for the good of the many, but the entire point of the finale is to confront pragmatism and idealism. Joel would rather the Fireflies fail than Ellie die. His reasons are personal, but it makes no difference to him, he wouldn't sacrifice Ellie in the same way that I probably wouldn't have the strength of will to sacrifice my child, even if it was for a greater good.

It is a controversial story beat and the debate is great! Entirely intended. I don't see a problem with it."
Switched,"I'm having a hard time understanding the point of your argument. This nuance to the trolley problem has been a moral dilemma that folks struggle with since ancient times. 

Are you just saying you don't enjoy philosophy that much? Or are frustrated that people don't agree with your world view? I think, as a species, we enjoy finding hyper specific situations and then wondering if we would have done the same, or if actions taken in those moments were justified. I would go so far as to say this isn't a problem in fiction, debates like this happen all the time over history. See: The dropping of the atomic bombs for one easy example.

It's just a very human question, and there's no right or wrong answer. So we have fun talking about the situations where it comes into play"
Switched,"Are we talking about the season ending ep’s dilemma between the life of Ellie for the cure and Joel’s choosing to protect her over saving the world, supposedly?? 

I ask, because what struck me as so needless in this dilemma and portrayed disingenuously is…..no research doc worth their salt would go with an experimental cure and plan for it, and kill the only living patient they got their hands on if they were WRONG. 

They would absolutely be wanting to keep her alive if their first best estimate failed."
Switched,"Well, yeah, that's the idea, Joel loves Ellie and sees her as the daughter he lost. People felt that emotional connection and put them in the ""good"" category cause it's a nice trait that they want to have, and there can't be flaws in a role model.

Never.

So, yeah, AJ was a fucking dick, no discussion there.

Also unrelated but the ""arguments"" about the doctors not knowing what they were doing is dumb af. The show itself states that's the only possible way, a doctor in the show dies trying to keep Ellie on the operation table. But suddenly everyone is a neurologist and can refute the science of a fictional show that was surrounded by the infected for 20 years

That's, again, people rationalizing Joel's decision to absolve him from any wrongdoing so he can be the good guy again, and therefore the perfect role model"
Switched,">If the finale had been about the Fireflies needing to dissect Sam, and Joel still went on his rampage, you would not see the moralizing ""Joel the hero!"" posting you consistently see on this sub, you would see the constant ""sacrifices need to be made and sheltered Hollywood writers can't make hard choices"" posting you see everywhere on Reddit.

Uh... bullshit? Sam is just as innocent as Ellie. We may not cheer Joel on as hard, but swapping them out doesn't change the nature of the problem to any appreciable degree.

>If Game of Thrones presented the option that the Long Night had a chance of being averted if they burnt Olly at the stake, then everyone would want Olly burnt. 

Depends - is this before or after *he became the chief figure in a mutiny that got a beloved character and, in-universe, a competent leader killed*? If he had never become ""Fuck Olly"", then people wouldn't want to see him punished. Stannis' daughter was in the exact position you're talking about and the fanbase went fucking apeshit over her death.

>If the Sopranos presented the option that the gangs *might* leave Tony alone if he drowned AJ in the pool, everyone would want AJ drowned.

WTF? This is just wrong. Nobody has ever wanted Tony Soprano to be an even *bigger* asshole to his kids.

>This is why I think the creators got the exact reaction they wanted: When it is *demonstrably true* that fanbases will jump to immediate moralizing to defend a character they're attached to, then they're effectively in the exact same mindset as Joel. This is why I have issues with even engaging with fiction as I get older (especially in an age of anti-heroes), because at the core, the nature of media is an appeal to charisma and entertainment value.

You're talking as if the only reason people ever support anything is some kind of shallow popularity contest that they jump through hoops to justify. I wanted Joel to kill the Fireflies because they were liars who were about to do something apocalyptically stupid (kill the only known immune person on Earth) to someone without their full, informed consent. If Ellie had been told exactly what she was volunteering for and went ahead with it anyway, then it'd suck, but I wouldn't want Joel to gun down a whole hospital because it'd be objectively wrong. Hell, even the way he went about it was wrong because he didn't give Marlene the chance to wake Ellie up & come clean."
Switched,"Are you talking about the doctor, who had no problem killing a kid when neither he nor Firefly had any idea about the cure, into a saint that in the sequel rescues animal just to show how evil Joel is? They've made zero progress while investigating previous infected people. They apparently lost personnel at a previous research base when some idiot let infected monkeys out of the cage instead of destroying them, and the purpose of killing Ellie seems to be nothing more than getting better access to her infection on the assumption that something is different about the infection itself. 

That being a rather dubious line of reasoning they seem to have rushed into. You have the only immune human and instead of starting with things like blood tests, transfusions, they just go right to cutting out her brain. No extracting of cerebrospinal fluid, bone marrow, plasma, nothing, except a scan. Just carve up her brain growth and see what's up. Then the group rushes the experiment even before waking her up, not even letting Joel see her for the last time, or attempt at persuading Joel into see things from their perspective. [Watch Joseph Anderson's analysis to see how incompetent the Fireflies were.](https://youtu.be/ma4DJbvO84I?t=11151)

In retrospect, The Last of Us failed to convey two sides of hypothetical morality. The game presents an utterly incompetent group that is written like a bunch of assholes, yet it wants us to feel conflicted and bad about you going against them in the hosptial. *""Hey, we made you walk across the entire country with this girl that you'd inevitably grow close with, we didn't tell you that she was going to be disected at the end, nor are we planning on telling her. Instead we're basically gonna drug her, drug you and then cut her open and hope that we might get a functional cure... Also, we're not paying you and there's about a 60% chance that we're just gonna shoot you in the back once you leave.""* Like, how is this a conflicting choice. They are best described as untrustworthy and incapable, so even though Joel is acting for emotional reasons, the rational thing to do if you want to kill Ellie to develop a cure is to kill the Fireflies and take her elsewhere like FEDRA. There's not much of a dilemma.

The Fireflies is a shallowly written organization in terms of writing. They are not fleshed out or explored. Are you asking me to sympathize with the group because they are fighting FEDRA--the government we don't even see if they are tyrannical or not? No part of the story makes me think that maybe they’re good people forced to do morally questionable things for the betterment of humanity, especially when we barely get to know who even Marlene is. Compare this to Lady Eboshi and the Irontown from Princess Mononoke, which actually explored those two sides. Even if the story ultimately judges them to be in the wrong, it is not confused by what each side is trying to convey, how it's conveying that, and the pros and cons of each side's method.

And I had hoped they execute this part better in the show. Instead, they made them even dumber."
Switched,"I’m not defending Joel when I say people shouldn’t scoop a kids brains out without telling the kid and with no guarantee of success.

I probably wouldn’t go mass shooter since I wouldn’t know how, but one can easily side with the moral dilemma and not think Joel is a hero for the tough choice."
Switched,[removed]
Switched,"He was ultimately selfish, which makes him a realistic character. He has done bad things before sometimes to survive and perhaps even sometimes just for benefitting from it when he could have walked away, that's his character. he chose to save Elie because she gave him a reason to live beyond just survival.

He made the selfish choice to kill all of those people, and potentially humanity, over losing his ""daughter"" for his own benefit more so than for Ellies.. 

but pragmatically speaking the fireflies should have been impregnating women and getting them infected to recreate multiple Ellies rather than wait 14-16 years. Kind of bleak and morbid and evil to do, but pragmatically speaking it would have yielded better outcomes as I assume the virus being in a baby or a teenager would not matter. Again i know morbid and evil."
Switched,"It's not about the show, it's about the repetitive nature of the debate and the double standards applied over the course of an entire decade. I genuinely don't like engaging with it because I really get the sense that human beings only care about characters insomuch as they find them entertaining and charming, which is nihlistic in my view."
Switched,Well also you wouldn’t need to kill the patient to get the T cells needed for a vaccine
Switched,"Yeah, the Last of Us is not written super well at points. I said this when I was 14 and I still say this at age 24. But there's a difference between narrative execution and narrative intent. The idea presented within was supposed to be that Joel sacrificed a potential chance at a cure for (selfish) love, and for the audience to debate who they sympathize with in the scenario. Instead, the fanbase just debates semantics and moves goalposts. The line of defense in 2013 was

>oh, well, they're extremely vague about their methods of cure, so it won't work

And then the series explains the chemical messenger thing and the debate then shifts to

>well the Fireflies don't have access to infrastructure to build a cure so the whole thing's a bust"
Switched,"Oh my god I’m so glad someone said this. People critiquing the fireflies really bend over backwards and are suddenly medically trained professionals while ignoring that the information WE know from watching, is not what the world knows…. 

WE may know the cure probably wouldn’t have worked because WE saw the mycologist in episode 2 explain there is no vaccine for fungus. One lady in Jakarta who was bombed shortly after and didn’t get the chance to speak with anyone. Not to mention that so many of the medical breakthroughs of the last 20 years we know they went without. Time and knowledge stopped for them in 2003! Stop judging them by 2023 science!! 

THEN the fact that people think it was pointless because of the medical infrastructure. I’d hate to be in the apocalypse with those people because nothing would be good enough or worth trying since we don’t have creature comforts we’re used to anymore."
Switched,"> Uh... bullshit? Sam is just as innocent as Ellie. We may not cheer Joel on as hard, but swapping them out doesn't change the nature of the problem to any appreciable degree.

My point is that it absolutely would to 90% of the audience because they would sympathize with the Fireflies if you put Sam in Ellie's place and still had Joel do the same thing. You're making my argument for me by pointing out that it's the same scenario.

My argument with Olly can be substituted with Sweetrobin or Hot Pie, and I didn't use Shireen as an example because there was an entire subplot dedicated to making you attached to her.

Also literally look at any clip of Tony and AJ and it's nothing but people wanting Tony to kick the shit out of him.

Note how you didn't have a response to the Ben/Clem thing, because I feel like it outright proves my point."

Switched,"Yeah, I enjoyed the show, but I think the game benefitted from its limitations. Less is more, sometimes."
Switched,"They were never planning to wait 14 years. Joel kills their research scientist less than 9 months after anyone realizes Ellie is immune, no one knew she was until the Riley incident. For all we know, they were impregnating women and planning to do this, and decided to use Ellie because she was there before any baby and they weren’t sure infecting pregnant women would work — who knows what the time window has to be, after all? They don’t even know that’s the cause of Ellie’s immunity — Marlene was told Anna has already cut the umbilical cord before being bitten, so all they’ve got is a theory about what *maybe* happened, and if it happened *maybe* caused the immunity, and which *might* be reproducible, and no idea of how long they’d have to wait to cut the cord to get that effect. From a researcher’s POV it’s still definitely worth getting your hands on Ellie, who’s confirmed immune and can be examined right now."
Switched,"It's not characters, it's how people engage with the world in general. It's only natural for people to favor who they have emotional bonds with. We don't care about strangers or the harm that comes to them nearly as much. And of course there are double standards, humans are full of contradictions. Not just in fiction, but in life. We're not robots, everything we do is subjective and varies based on our feelings at any given moment. Sure, we try to be consistent, but often fall short of doing so. 

I guess I don't understand your comment and point further than ""I dislike prevalent human nature"""
Switched,"They weren’t looking for T cells tho. They are thinking the fungus primarily grows in the brain so to get it from her and synthesize they’d have to kill her to harvest her brain

But medically, this doesn’t hold up. and obviously being untried they’d wanna keep her alive to find another way if the first way didn’t pan out

Sry for typos. I have lost my reading glasses nd can’t replace them till tomorrow"
Switched,"Also, I didn’t take it Joel acted out of selfish love only. He has remarked with sadness she’s never had the chance to have a life. That’s thinking of her and what it’s like for her"
Switched,"I didn't have a response to Ben/Clem because I never played that far in those games, so I'm responding to the rest of the points you made because I'm familiar with them and wouldn't have to guess or be talking out of my ass.

Your overall point seems to be ""if anyone isn't completely in love with a character, they will act like total sociopaths towards them"" and that's horrifying.

>My point is that it absolutely would to 90% of the audience because they would sympathize with the Fireflies if you put Sam in Ellie's place and still had Joel do the same thing. You're making my argument for me by pointing out that it's the same scenario.

You're saying that the audience would support child murder simply because it's a different innocent kid with less character development. I know there's a subset of every fandom that is, shall we say, *more than amenable* to swapping a black boy for a white girl when the situation is life-threatening, but they're by no means a majority, especially not ""90%"".

>My argument with Olly can be substituted with Sweetrobin or Hot Pie, and I didn't use Shireen as an example because there was an entire subplot dedicated to making you attached to her.

Again, you're saying that we will be okay with *child murder* simply based on whether or not we have spent an arbitrary amount of time with the character and like them. You're stripping away and & all context except for whatever you need to twist to make your argument.

>Also literally look at any clip of Tony and AJ and it's nothing but people wanting Tony to kick the shit out of him.

There is a big difference between us wanting a father to make his son not be an insufferable asshole and us wanting him to literally kill him."
Switched,"There would be no reason to flesh it out imo.

It’s where they are at. 

The story is not meant to make our issues with the morality any easier. Nearly every big scene or conversation was in one way or another foreshadowing the fireflies, Joel, or Ellie.

I thought it was brilliant in how it made me remember other discussions."
Switched,[deleted]
Switched,"I guess it's ""I dislike a debate that is by its very nature a personal one that wouldn't be had about anyone besides this highly charismatic character being passed off as if it's a logical and/or moral one""."
Switched,"They could have set it up better. They needed at least an episode where the fireflies were being nice and running tests. They figure something out but determine she won’t survive the procedure. They lie to Joel and Ellie, but Joel figures it out and rescues her."
Switched,">There is a big difference between us wanting a father to make his son not be an insufferable asshole and us wanting him to literally kill him.

lol check out the comments on this vid

Switched,"I agree. I think people are unintentionally remembering the mycologist and how she said there is no cure for their arguments for Joel without realizing that’s only something WE the audience and her knew. That wasn’t common information to the world because they bombed her country shortly after. 

Saying “they should’ve known it wouldn’t work” makes no sense because they WOULDNT know. They were not privy to that discussion."
Switched,"In the cutscenes, dude. And I'm not saying that all video games are like this, just the Naughty Dog style of mission-based games. Also, the caveat is made for the talking head scenes of Joel and Ellie, which is the game's strength. I'm simply saying that actual *cutscenes* are by their nature quick and need to get exposition out ASAP."
Switched,"But it's not about putting different characters in Jole and Ellie's shoes. It's about if you were Joel, would you sacrafice or save Ellie l given the information you had. The debate is not about whether you would go on a rampage to save any old kid. The specifics of the situation matter. They're the only thing that matters. Change the situation, you have a different moral dilemma on your hands.

It's the personal nature that makes it worth investigating."
Switched,"I see a lot of people making fun of him for pretending to be a tough guy and then crying & pissing his pants when actually confronted with danger, but not a whole lot of ""I wish the bear woulda ate him!"" Are you getting this from somehow sorting your whole life by Controversial?"
Switched,[deleted]
Switched,"I *know*, reread my OP post, it's not about the game, it's about what the debate around it has effectively devolved into after a decade. You are preaching to the choir."
Switched,"Discussing limitations of a medium in which art is presented is not necessarily looking down upon said medium at all. I am a 24 year old zoomer, you don't need to tell me that video games are art, I can give you a whole dissertation. I'm generalizing for the sake of trying to explain why the scene of Joel being given the escort job is 2 minutes in the game vs 12 in the show (I highly prefer the game, btw).

I will edit my initial post, though."
Switched,"Your dislike for what the debate as devolved into reads like ""But if we change key elements of this problem, people's choice would be different, therefore there is no merit in the debate"" which seems nonsensical to me. It reads that your point is people are discussing their personal choice, but because there is no objective right choice, any discussion around it is pointless.

There is value in knowing where people's morals stand situationally. This is why we as a species talk about it when these moral grey areas come up. And if, on a wildly extrapolated, primal instinctual level, we view someone's personal choice to be a threat to the community, it makes sense to debate and try to get them to change their opinion. 

Maybe I'm still missing it, but my ultimate thought is it makes sense to debate personal choices, they're arguably the only thing worth debating about."
Switched,[deleted]
Switched,"I think that there's value in pointing out that, when a debate turns into moralizing, saying ""you would not have this debate about someone else"" effectively torpedos the supposed objectivity of the debate. When people consistently say ""Oh, well the Fireflies' plan wouldn't have worked cause yada yada yada"", I genuinely just don't believe they'd go through the effort of making the debate if it wasn't about someone they're emotionally attached to, which *removes the stance of objectivity that side is taking* and renders their point moot."
Switched,"No, I'm...speaking generally. You can *choose* to take my point as clearly intended, which is ""cutscene-based games with single mission campaigns often don't have time to have talking head segments explaining every little detail like HBO shows do"", but instead you're choosing to hyperfixate on my exact wording so you can pretend I'm looking down on video games."
Switched,"Just to make sure we keep on that same page, what I'm understanding is: 

People claim saving Ellie objectively the right thing to do. But that objectivity is contradictory because they would not do the same thing for another less liked character?

If that's your point...ok? People are really bad at terms and use ""objective truth"" to gain some sort of advantage in arguments all they time. They can squak about objective truth all they want, it doesn't make their pov objective. I dunno, my comment there is don't let poor use of terms ruin your fun debating, assuming you enjoy debating"
Switched,[deleted]
Switched,"It's not just use of terms, it's the existence of the debate in the first place and hyperfixation on details that wouldn't happen otherwise. I don't wanna keep explaining it, because I feel like you get my point, but you understand why 10 years of the same cyclical debate gets tiresome."
Switched,"Sure dude. Whatever you wanna believe I believe about video games. Please send me whatever ""It's Just a Game"" youtube video playlist you have that lets you feel like a victim."
Switched,"The frustration with the fixation on details is the part I don't get, and haven't gotten since the beginning. 

I feel there's a disconnect between what is actually being debated. Your stance is that fixating on these details is irrelevant or unjustified when they're actually **key**. The details define the situation. People aren't talking about the trolley problem, they're talking about in this specific circumstance, with this specific relationship, and this specific world, what would you do. 

It doesn't matter if people would make different choices if Ellie was a different character, or if the fireflies were more or less believable, or wouldn't care about x or y thing if she was less charismatic...that's not what people are talking about"
Switched,[deleted]
Switched,You are pushing me for answers over and over in a way that makes it seem like you feel insecure for liking video games while simultaneously feeling like I'm misrepresenting them when the reality is I *slightly* misspoke in a way that was trivial to my point.
Switched,">Director Greg Yaitanes, who helmed the 10th hour of the Game of Thrones prequel's premiere season, talked about a fun switcheroo they had to pull for filming due to a COVID-19 scare. Elliott contracted the virus during filming, forcing the production to find the next obvious replacement: his twin brother Luke.

>”There's that scene, that big scene where Corlys [Steve Toussaint] comes down and they're putting the markers on the table and the messenger comes in. It was a shot over two days and then one got COVID,"" he adds. ""[Elliott] got COVID, so we swapped him out with his brother.""

>Adding to the confusion were the names of the actors versus the characters. There's Luke Tittensor, the actor who plays Arryk, and then there's Luke Velaryon, the character played by actor Elliot Grihault opposite actor Elliott Tittensor, who plays Erryk. ""The way this came to me was the game of telephone,"" the director jokes.

>Yaitanes notes ""that would've killed us"" if Luke hadn't been able to step in. ""We were just about to do all Emma's coverage and he is standing right next to [them],"" he says."
Switched,[removed]
Switched,"Erryk's crown scene remains on the highlights of the show for me thus far, as a bookreader. 

The smuggling of the crown out of King's Landing is practically a footnote in the book; after all it is just a crown.

But the show really gives the moment its full gravitas. 

Ser Erryk didn't just give her a crown, he was truly the first to recognize Rhaenyra as the Queen, the first to bend the knee. The first to swear the holiest of oaths to her.

At her weakest moment, full of doubts and burying the daughter she would never hold again, he broke his oath and betrayed his own blood because he knew Rhaenyra to be the only person worth serving.

Criston Cole may be the Kingmaker, but Ser Erryk is just as much the Queenmaker.

I can't wait for the heartwrench when the twins meet once more."
Switched,"We've secretly replaced one of their regular Tittensor with Folgers Crystals, let's see if they notice."
Switched,"Until reading this headline, I had just assumed it was one guy playing both roles using camera tricks. I guess budget-wise this makes more sense"
Switched,"Honestly, switching around one Tittensor brother for another is just utterly Shameless..."
Switched,Only just realized that's Carl from Shameless!
Switched,"these two guys are one of the highlight of the last two episodes, which have been truly great compared to the slightly bumpy previous ones. They got the face, the physical presence and the attitude of real knights. MAN how I wanted Twin no.1 to kick fuckface Criston in the arse"
Switched,Like how they switched the Olsen twins in Full House? Splendid.
Switched,“This my brother Darryl and my other brother Darryl.”
Switched,This is why you always hire twins
Switched,Lmao!!!! I don’t know why this made me laugh so much but it did! Twins doing a Parent trap
Switched,"Ahahahaha! I knew it!

When he showed up with the crown, I asked my hubs, who read the book, if the twins swapped because that was the brother. He thought I was an idiot."
Switched,I thought this show time jumped into cancelation.
Switched,Why is does it seem like every headline in this sub is about this show
Switched,I didn't even notice that there were twins in the show.
Switched,So what they totally replaced other characters with people who look nothing like them. I’m out
Switched,[deleted]
Switched,"They switched the main characters out a few episodes in, which is where I stopped watching. It's like trying to watch GoT through my phone while my kids play with Snapchat filters."
Switched,"It's so weird how the upper class still treats COVID like the black plague when everyone has just accepted it as a part of our daily lives now.

Last time I had COVID my job actually told me to go home for the rest of the day but return back to work the next morning lol"
Switched,Who cares? It’s a shit show.
Switched,Two is one and one is none:)
Switched,lols
Switched,"Man, I finally watched the first episode. It is...definitely one of the shows of all time. I have no desire to watch any more. It's like the writers totally missed the point of GoT and thought the reason we liked the original show was because the gore made it edgy. Meanwhile everyone is telling me how awful Rings of Power is but I whipped through the first season in 3 days and want more."
Switched,"I really had to restrain myself from turning this show off, but forced my way through it.  Finally got interesting in the final episode.

That giant dragon reminded me of that scene in GoT when Euron's enormous ship appeared out of the darkness and destroyed everything when he captured Yara. HotD is no GoT, that's for sure."
Switched,Covid's still a thing in America?
Switched,"They did what?!?!?!   No, no, NO.   Not like this.   

(stews nefariously, rubbing hands together) I don’t quite know how, but those fuckers are about to pay…."
Switched,Who cares?!?
Switched,"Awful show, very very very underwhelming. Jesus fucking Christ."
Switched,Good thing the one who caught COVID had a copy lol
Switched,THEYRE TWO DUDES
Switched,I’ve been lied to!
Switched,I heard they did the same thing with the Lannnister twins. Talk about dedication and smart way around the issue.....lol
Switched,Reminds me of that chinese anime in which a guy performed at idol concerts in place of his twin sister.
Switched,An i thought they just got them mixed up. They should have waited casting was broken due to this.
Switched,"""Director Greg Yaitanes went on to say,  ""yeah so we got the idea from Back to the Future and Crispin Glover. Seemed like a good idea. """
Switched,Huh??? Smart choice 🤷‍♂️
Switched,fErryk conspiracy time baby!
Switched,They secretly switched those characters no one had met before and I had no idea who they were.
Switched,"This is really common with child actors, where twins will be cast in roles, especially infants and young children.

This is how the Olsen twins got started, both playing the same role in an 80's sitcom as toddlers."
Switched,"It's charming how the confusing naming of characters in the story came to life in the reality of putting the show on. 

If they hate this, they should stay away from Russian naming conventions in Tolstoy/Dostoyevsky. Soo many petroviches."
Switched,I wonder how often the twins did this in Harry Potter just for shits and giggles
Switched,"wow, now people will start hiring twins just to have a backup xD"
Switched,Vizzy T shall have your tongue!!
Switched,They pulled a Mary Kate & Ashley Olsen?
Switched,">There's Luke Tittensor, the actor who plays Arryk, and then there's Luke Velaryon, the character played by actor Elliot Grihault opposite actor Elliott Tittensor, who plays Erryk.

There has to have been a better way to structure this sentence. Lol."
Switched,"TIL they're actual twins and not one guy playing both roles

I don't know why I assumed it was the latter"
Switched,"That's really cool, though I have to ask-

Did Luke get paid for playing another character? I think the other brother didn't show up in that episode after all."
Switched,> COVID-19 scare
Switched,Did the director misgender them?
Switched,"Hey man, you try making a fantasy world as big as ASOIAF and come up with unique names for every single character."
Switched,"> That goes to naming the Tully characters Elmo, Kermit, Oscar and Grover, and then made them actually important in this upcoming war.

To be fair, [there is a version of the story where this is much more significant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhWUFXvaZjo)."
Switched,Wait till you hear about what names he picked for the characters in Elden Ring
Switched,"Over at /r/boxing, there's constant confusion between two world champion level boxers - Jermall and Jermell Charlo - [The Charlo brothers are identical twins too](https://media.gq.com/photos/5b61cd9ec3eb8e424afb7343/16:9/pass/jermall%20and%20jermell-gqstyle-fall-2018-00.jpg). 

&#x200B;

So yeah, every once in a while this does happen IRL haha. Now funnily enough, despite them being twins, one fights at Middleweight, and the other fights at light middleweight, so odds are the two won't ever face each other in a fight. But I really, really want to see that fight happen just to see the confusion."
Switched,"> That goes to naming the Tully characters  Elmo, Kermit, Oscar and Grover, and then made them actually important in this upcoming war.

i knew about the characters but didn't know they'd be important. that's fucking hilarious, can't wait to hear their names during some serious scene in the future.

so how long until the next season(s), people in other threads talking about a 2 year wait for the next one which is not good at all, like for the show."
Switched,They aren't even the only identical twins named [Erryk](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Erryk_(guard\)) & [Arryk](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Arryk_(guard\)) in the series lmao
Becoming Champions,"I've been watching. He is not just winning, but dominating. Very similar to James' run - wins the ring in and answers correctly on the majority of the questions. Therefore, finds most of the daily doubles and is fairly aggressive betting them. Last night, only finished with about $10k, but that's because he was so far ahead, he could afford to bet huge ($34k) on the final jeopardy. He missed it last night, otherwise would have had a huge $78k game.

It will likely take a lot of luck/chance to beat him - similar to James. It will take another player to find the doubles (keeping them from Matt), be able to bet big on them, and answer them, to have a chance. Cuz Matt is going to answer most of the questions on the board correctly.

Still, Ken Jennings winning streak was so impressive. He was much more conservative in his betting, but 74 straight games, wow."
Becoming Champions,What's Matt Amodio?
Becoming Champions,"The dude is a Double Jeopardy dowser. I mean, it helps that’s he’s lightning fast and gets most everything he answers correctly, so odds are he’ll be the one who finds them. Also, when you have such a commanding lead after the first round, you can breathe a little easier, and breeze into final with a runaway. He’s doing everything right and is brilliant on such a wide range of things. And his casual charisma is so much more relaxing to viewers than say Ken Jennings’ wide-eyed arrogance. Gilbert Gottfried could be the guest host, and I’d still tune in to watch Matt kick ass on a nightly basis."
Becoming Champions,"Yesterday, the dude lost 34,000 and still would have beat everyone else if they hadn't gotten the answer wrong too."
Becoming Champions,The social media dick measuring contest over the next jeopardy host is getting a little overworn
Becoming Champions,"On one hand, I hadn't heard he was doing this well, so there's something to it.

On the other . . . you know, I think he'll survive on his pile of money."
Becoming Champions,Joe Buck was also a surprisingly great host and it was his first try. Very natural up there and had great rapport with Matt probably since he buzzed in just about every time.
Becoming Champions,Matt is amazing!  It's been so much fun watching him play.
Becoming Champions,I feel like he's getting purely negative attention because of the way he answers
Becoming Champions,"He’s been on a roll, except for yesterday’s final jeopardy. That one hurt."
Becoming Champions,Like watching Watson and not in a good way.
Becoming Champions,He's a total nerd.
Becoming Champions,I'm impressed by dominant champions normally but this guy is straight using Jeopardy James strategy without adding anything to it. Someone is going to have to beat him at his own game just like they did James. I'm of the Alex Trebek mindset where starting at the bottom of the board and rapidly swapping categories isn't in the spirit of the game
Becoming Champions,"He's a great player, no doubt, but he's probably not the next Holtzhower."
Becoming Champions,[deleted]
Becoming Champions,"To be fair though, they've really matched him against some real lemons.  On his run he's really only faced maybe 2 legit players.  The lady last night didn't even ring in until after the first commercial.  The other guy rang in once...and got it wrong.

Not to take anything away from him, on his first day i turned to my gf and told her he was going to be trouble, and he's proved me right.  He's hella smart, i just wish they'd throw him someone that can at least be competitive."
Becoming Champions,"Hate him as a champion. Does the annoying fishing around for a daily double, and hasn't faced any real competition. Feels like the show is setting him up for a long streak with the lack of quality in his competitors.  Makes the show unwatchable in the second half due to the gimmicky play."
Becoming Champions,[removed]
Becoming Champions,He doesn't play right he goes out of order.
Becoming Champions,Eh who gives a shit. we saw that tournament of champions where jennings won. We’re set.
Becoming Champions,All the hunting for a new host just turned me off!  Let me know when they decide next year!
Becoming Champions,"I think the run is happening at a bad time. In August, it is still light outside at Jeopardy time so I am rarely in front of the TV."
Becoming Champions,"Guy is very bright, and very quick on the trigger. Wonder how long his run is going to be? Thought he might be in danger last night, as he got a DD incorrect, and then got the other DD on the next clue. If he'd made an error there, the game might have gone a different way, but he recovered nicely."
Becoming Champions,I can't remember what night but maybe thurs/fri last week. He didn't have to bet anything on final jeopardy. He auto won. But he bet like 60% worth and got it wrong. The 2nd place person also got it wrong but if she got it right she bet enough to beat him. I think he might lose on something like that. Too risky.
Becoming Champions,"What's Amodio....

He NEVER uses the full name!"
Becoming Champions,"Nothing, what’s Matt Amodio with you?"
Becoming Champions,Lmao that was bothering me so much. At least they clarified it.
Becoming Champions,I think he's doing it so he has one fewer thing to think about and also to disorient and annoy the other players.
Becoming Champions,I would love to see Gilbert Gottfried host...
Becoming Champions,"Yeah, if there’s something consistent I’ve noticed about his strategy, it’s that whenever he finds the single Daily Double clue in the first round (which he usually does since he keeps getting clues right and hanging on to the power to select the category and clue), he always bets it all.  When he succeeds (which is usually), I assume it has a psychological effect on the other contestants, who are now far behind in the four or three digits (or even negative scores) while he’s up in the five digits.  When he hits Daily Doubles in Double Jeopardy, his wagering is more conventional."
Becoming Champions,I watched him yesterday and he is nothing short of brilliant... fast as all hell too!
Becoming Champions,I guess everyone has been watching Jeopardy all this time JUST to watch the host read off a piece of paper and not to play along or root for contestants.
Becoming Champions,Yep. If I had to decide between being rich or being famous...I wouldn't answer because I'd be too busy counting all my moneys
Becoming Champions,"What's sad is he's a PHD student and this money so far will maybe just cover his tuition if he's lucky, but that's a great place to be of course.

EDIT: I see that he's a Computer Science student, NM he's fine."
Becoming Champions,Matt was geeking pretty hard on Buck's back and forth with him.
Becoming Champions,"My only qualm with Buck is that he's a few decibels louder than I'd prefer. But I'm still enjoying him more than a lot of other guest hosts they've had on. Like you said, he's really settled in quickly. Seems like he really came prepared and ready to go."
Becoming Champions,Hopefully nobody pretends to pull their pants down or Buck will have a meltdown.
Becoming Champions,But when does Hall of Famer Troy Aikman show up to host?
Becoming Champions,He suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucks. So annoying.
Becoming Champions,I feel like he'd take that as a compliment.
Becoming Champions,A guy winning a ton of money on a trivia game show is a nerd?
Becoming Champions,And you’re basing this on...? His 14 day streak of killing it? Holzhower went 33 days. This dude is already almost halfway there
Becoming Champions,Didn't he recently set a new record for the most amount of money lost on a single Final Jeopardy?
Becoming Champions,"i mean he's got the buzzer down pat. and the more he wins the better he will be at the timing. jeopardy isn't just about knowledge, it's a game of reaction speed too, and that is really what kept guys like ken and james on top, based on their own interviews."
Becoming Champions,[deleted]
Becoming Champions,"Thats exactly how James H. played and that got Jeopardy its highest ratings in years. Sooooo, if that bothers you, def maybe take a break for a while."
Becoming Champions,"Mike Richards is going to do everything he can to bulldoze his way into becoming the host unless the Price is Right allegations turn out to be true.

If we take Richards (and Ken Jennings) out of the equation, Katie Couric had the highest ratings. Jennings is the heir presumptive, but if his commitment to The Chase is real, then we won’t get him as the host. My favorite host has definitely been Aaron Rodgers, but I just don’t see it working out with him still being an active football player."
Becoming Champions,How does one play Jeopardy the right way?
Becoming Champions,"Long time viewer, agree on going in order.  A lot of nuance in how the categories are put together gets missed by viewers when a competitor skips around.  People here are too focused on wins and cash numbers, instead of the game itself."
Becoming Champions,"He's cut it really close a couple times, apparently trying to beat the daily record of anyone other than Holzhauer of $77000, but I'm pretty sure never enough to actually lose."
Becoming Champions,"There is no way this is correct, right? Why would he risk losing if he didnt even have to bet??"
Becoming Champions,"In today's episode, there was a clue that a normal person would have solved with ""What is the Ark of the Covenant?""

Matt just said, ""What's Ark?"""
Becoming Champions,"Which is the smarter way to do it, to be fair. Adding the first name is all risk and no benefit."
Becoming Champions,"I agree that giving minimum acceptable info is the smarter way to do it, and I don’t begrudge him for that. 

What I absolutely can’t stand about him is that he always phrases the question as “What’s <blank>”.

Never “who is” when he knows it’s a person. Never “what are” when the response is plural. 

Just really, really irritating to me for some reason."
Becoming Champions,#YOU *FOOL!*
Becoming Champions,"He's a PhD student in computer science, which means he is getting paid, not paying tuition."
Becoming Champions,"PhD students also often don’t pay tuition, it’s covered by the university."
Becoming Champions,"The dude's won over 400 grand. 

I'm sure he'll be fine."
Becoming Champions,"Yep, a separate volume control for Joe would be a god-send."
Becoming Champions,"Well, yeah. Not to be mean, or anything, but yeah, total nerd."
Becoming Champions,Why so confrontational? lol jeez
Becoming Champions,He did.
Becoming Champions,"No doubt, he's very good.  That doesn't change the fact that a lot of his opponents so far have been very very bad.  One of them broke the record for the lowest ever score, for Pete's sake!"
Becoming Champions,"No idea, nobody bothered to say why they thought i was wrong."
Becoming Champions,"I bet if Sony wanted Ken, they'd be willing to pay whatever fees whoever is behind The Chase wants - or schedule filming days of J! around it"
Becoming Champions,Top to bottom
Becoming Champions,"Its correct. I looked at my wife and said is my math right?? She said yeah I'm not sure why he would do that. I think he does get cocky sometimes and sometimes, to me at least, it doesn't seem like he cares if he loses.

Edit: it mightve been when was he was trying to win/bet the most on final jeopardy ever. so now that he did it he wont do it again."
Becoming Champions,"He doesn’t have to bet, but it looks like he’s trying to make as much money as he can, so he bets as much as he can so that he can lose the wager and still be out of reach of the Double Jeopardy second place finisher.  So no matter what he’ll still be champion, the difference is whether it’s a decent payday or an amazing payday.  And given that his responses are usually right, it’s been more often the latter."
Becoming Champions,That really grinds my wife's gears.
Becoming Champions,"Exactly. If you mispronounce the first name, you can get it wrong. Not worth it"
Becoming Champions,[deleted]
Becoming Champions,"For everyone!  My wife HATES it, and apparently so does Twitter. 

Jeopardy had to issue a reminder of the rules to say he was within his rights to do that.

Even Amodio apologized for annoying people, saying he is the biggest fan ever and did not mean to annoy, HA!"
Becoming Champions,"It bothered me a little at first, but I thought about it, and it’s one less thing you have to think about in a rapid-fire trivia setting if you always say “what’s” instead of tailoring it to the question. Can focus more on the correct answers"
Becoming Champions,"I don't even mind his clue reading volume. Like sure he's still loud then, but he's reading the clues very clearly, so it doesn't bother me. I'd certainly rather the host speak up than mumble the clues.

But then he calls on contestants and I'm just like ""Why are you shouting at them, Joe?"" It feels like he gets louder then."
Becoming Champions,"That's dumb. The right way to play is to make the most money as quickly as possible, and when the host doesn't have the right timing that means they have less time in each round. Jumping around the board is a good way to make a lot of money fast and to keep the other contestants from making money, and it also unnerves the other contestants. 

People are so weirdly snobby about this show."
Becoming Champions,"I just looked at the results from last week on this website and I don't see any Final cases where it was as you describe.

Unless im a dummy and looking at it wrong

https://thejeopardyfan.com/"
Becoming Champions,"Yeah I understand that basic logic, but the guy I responded was wrong in that he claimed that Matt bet so much that he put himself in a position to possibly lose."
Becoming Champions,When the question requires elaboration the judges will demand elaboration.
Becoming Champions,In the vast majority of cases there's only one person of that last name that it would make sense for you to be referring to. If there are multiple plausible answers with the same last name they would ask for clarification.
Becoming Champions,Its been the rule forever tho.
Becoming Champions,"Then why not just drop the whole “answer in the form of a question” conceit? Not saying they should necessarily penalize the guy for it and it’s certainly not a bad strategy, but Jeopardy has always prioritized form over function to some degree. It throws off the flow and doesn’t feel like Jeopardy when you have a contestant buzz in, reflexively puke out a “what’s”, take a split second to collect himself, and then just say “Copernicus”, or whatever."
Becoming Champions,"I am not dumb
U R dumb
Top to bottom. Hit the catagory you know best.
Go fast enough you will get all the money.
Always true daily double max amount.."
Becoming Champions,"Okay it was the august 3rd one and in fact, my math was wrong. =) Sorry."
Becoming Champions,Never used this site. Let me look.
Becoming Champions,"First president of the United States.

""Washington""

Specifically?

""...Denzel!"""
Becoming Champions,"As long as the reply is a valid question, they take it. Years ago, there was a contestant that would say the direct ""answer"" to the clue then make it a question with ""is what/who?"" -- Example: The first US president. Answer: Washington... is who? -- That was annoying too, but he technically answered in the form of a question. But at least he used the proper what/who and is/are for the clue, and also he didn't win, so we didn't have to go thru it over and over. Lol"
Becoming Champions,All good. I just knew something was off cause no way in hell a player that good would ever make that mistake hah
Becoming Champions,"Oh that would be way more annoying for sure. And sure I’m not arguing that what Matt does is or should be illegal, it just pisses me off haha. 

But I still long for the days when contestants would start at the top and rip straight through categories. It’s been shown that there are far better strategies and these folks are and should be playing to win, but it’s more satisfying as a viewer to focus on one category as the questions progressively get harder than to jump all over the board."
Becoming Champions,Agreed
Becoming Champions,The Americans is right up there with the best shows of the modern gold age of television. Incredibly compelling drama.
Becoming Champions,"Lol, the Americans is on Disney plus seems so weird.

I need to watch the last couple seasons. Great show"
Becoming Champions,"Loved that show so much.  It made me miss the cold war (I lived near DC as a teen and calculated that I’m one year older than Paige).  

Saddest for me was the woman bookkeeping at the mail robot repair shop whom Elizabeth forced to od on her heart medicine.  That episode destroyed me."
Becoming Champions,"Amazing write up OP. I definitely want to re-watch this again. My wife is going to love it.

Also obligatory:

With or without youuuuuuuuuuu"
Becoming Champions,"On the Stan point - I don't think it would be as bad for him (professionally, anyway) since he kept going to the CI people - while not even working there - and raising questions about the Jennings they dismissed. If anything, he'll be the ""I told you so"" one. Personally, yeah that's going to be rough - but there's an interesting fan theory that Renee was a spy, but for [Israeli Mossad not the KGB.](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheAmericans/comments/8odmov/theory_renee_was_sent_by_mossad_to_recon_philip/)"
Becoming Champions,"for all the brutality shown by the Russians, it was the Russian burger guy's demise at the hands of the Americans that hit me the most. I was not expecting that, it was a goddamned stone cold, and cruel,  execution"
Becoming Champions,One of the best season finales ever. Pretty much the opposite of game of thrones.
Becoming Champions,"It's an incredible show and I think it's one that gets a bit better with every rewatch. It does suffer a bit around season 4 or 5. It has such a high peak, and the weird thing is the peaks in The Americans don't always coincide with season endings.

I'm not sure season 6 is my favorite, though it's good. It's just so uncomfortable watching Elizabeth in it."
Becoming Champions,Might be the single most underrated show I can think of. It blows my mind I can't get anyone to watch it.
Becoming Champions,Best show of all time.
Becoming Champions,"I've been very critical of that show before... mostly because I like it. Wish they would have focused more on Dennis (Stan's partner) or Oleg rather than the characters they introduced that didn't pan out to anything. Watching it live during the last couple seasons was painful as it seemed to be going glacially slow, course binging might help in this respect. 

They seemed to be going into more thematic territory which is fine but I missed the suspense of the first few seasons. Also, they managed to be serial killers by the end, felt odd just how many people were killed in an otherwise somewhat realistic scenario. 

Its a really good show and I suppose time for a rewatch, I just have many complaints about some of the writing decisions but that's fine"
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"It's a long article, here's where it says the problems start:

>At some point during the third season of Rick and Morty, multiple sources say Roiland simply stopped showing up — and when he did turn up in the Burbank offices, he’d typically avoid the writers room. In fact, Roiland’s colleagues often knew he was there only because they could hear his dogs. Or they’d hear his remote-control toy car, which had a microphone on top of it, zooming around the office. At least once, Roiland sent it into the writers room, says a source. “You wouldn’t have seen him in weeks, and then you’d see the car come in, which was insane.” Roiland would make exceptions to bring through famous fans, of which Rick and Morty has legions; at various points, his visitors included Kanye West, the comedians on Impractical Jokers and porn star Riley Reid, who gifted the room a succulent.

 
>By that time, Roiland had a girlfriend, who became a fiancée, and he would talk openly about their penchant for threesomes. “It was something we just ignored because it was disgusting,” says an insider. Multiple sources say it was also during that period that Roiland sent a female employee a “really creepy” text, late at night, requesting that she come to his home (they declined to name the staffer). “She didn’t want to run it up the flagpole,” says one of the sources, “and then it was just this really fucked-up, awkward thing.”

His Relationship with Dan Harmon:

>In the meantime, the relationship between Harmon and Roiland had grown so acrimonious that the show brought in a mediator to try to salvage what was once an inspired partnership. And though those efforts were unsuccessful, the pair was able to put aside their differences enough to secure a massive, 70-episode renewal from Adult Swim in May 2018. The pact, which ensured that the show would run for several more seasons, appeared to reward Rick and Morty for its precedent-smashing ratings for Adult Swim; by season five, the Emmy-winning series was reportedly generating hundreds of millions in merchandise revenue alone.

>In the years since, Roiland’s involvement on Rick and Morty has largely been relegated to voicing characters, for which he’d take no direction and record from his home. In fact, it has been years since anyone can remember him stepping foot in the show’s writers room, even when it’s been virtual. Recently, a similar situation has occurred on both Solar Opposites and Koala Man, according to multiple sources. On the former, which he co-created, he had, until mid-January, voiced one of the show’s leads. “He knew the power of being the voices,” says a source, noting how Roiland had revealed early on that he believed securing key voice roles would safeguard him from being fired one day. On Koala Man, on which he’s simply an executive producer, he was given a character to voice in the show’s third episode but, per two sources, the writers almost blew their deadline waiting for him. The character was killed off at the end of the episode."
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,Who knew that Dan Harmon would turn out to be the affable one?
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"The Roiland and Harmon part was pretty interesting, had no clue they had such issues with each other. I wonder if there was a single event or just what was discussed in the article that strained it?"
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"Sounds like Rick and Morty losing Roiland is not really going to effect that much, get a new voice actor or two and maybe they’ll actually show up and take direction. Could overall be a net positive for the series."
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"I really, really want to know what I have to do to get a job where I…

- Make millions
- Surround myself with geniuses
- Win my industry’s most prestigious awards
- Gain an army of rabidly enthusiastic fans
- Get more responsibilities and opportunities

…while also…

- Rarely show up to work, FOR YEARS
- Be loud and derailing in meetings
- Sexually harass women the instant I gain professional access to them
- Blow company money at Toys-R-Us
- Make everyone around me look and feel bad

And literally not one person rats on me? Fires me? Blows my shit up? Not one?!

Like. How. Where. What do I have to do to get a life where I am coddled like a precious boy-king."
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,Why is he Sonic
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"The only time I've heard Justin Roiland speak (as himself) was an episode of Harmontown he appeared on. The dude seemed really out there. Like on drugs AND a crazy weirdo.  When listening I was thinking ""uh oh...he's one of those show runners. The kind who will be in the news eventually"""
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,So...like [John Kricfalusi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kricfalusi) and *Ren & Stimpy*?
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"A tale as old as time: “We were always aware of the unethical/illegal actions of this person who made all of us a lot of money, but didn’t want to say anything until the actions are already made known to the public.”"
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"It’s amazing how often this article repeats how Rolland is barely involved with Rick and Morty, as if to ensure it can continue on Adult Swim with minimal blowback.

That said, would Roiland still benefit from royalties even as he is cut off?"
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"I don't think Roiland was ever considered a genius, unlike Dan Harmon. He was funny, with a lot of energy, and was a big part of the show's success... but that's not genius territory."
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"I don't know about the rest of yall, but I never attributed R&M success to roiland, I always thought it was Harmon with a good writing room. I always assumed roiland was just voice work...and not good work at that. All his fucking voices sound damn near identical...except Rick IS unique compared to the rest."
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"Is it really a surprise that fans felt his career was ""suddenly derailed"" when the reason why was kept a secret up until just recently?"
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"Honestly I'm hopeful that the R&M writers will make the best of this. From this article and others it seems like Harmon and the other main show runners have been done with Roiland for a LONG time and he hasn't had meaningful creative input. Hopefully this is like a weight lifted for the rest of the writing staff.

The bigger unanswered question as I see it is what the next season will be like. Fairly sure it's already completely written (and maybe completely voiced too?) So do they rerecord Roiland's lines? And I feel like they'll have to add in at least a 30 second joke about the voice change. I hope the show carries on the same or better though 🤞"
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"As a fan of the show (who’s used to liking things with awful fan bases) I was always annoyed by roiland and thought that he was only around because the seed of the idea was his from back in channel 101 days… but it’s so obviously Dan harmon’s show and ideas.

edit: originally autocorrected fan bases to canvases lol"
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,Never meet your heroes
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"I'm reminded of what happened to Noel Clarke in the UK. BAFTA fellowship winner to career effectively over in under a week when 20 women came forward with claims of bullying, verbal abuse and sexual harassment. 

ITV had to pull the final episode of a ""stripped"" series from regular airing when the advertisers bailed, Sky had to cancel *Bulletproof* and BAFTA revoked his fellowship. No charges were filed due to lack of evidence, but he's done."
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,You either die a Morty or live long enough to to see yourself become the Rick ah geee
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"He always gave off a manchild vibe, like he never actually matured to adulthood. Good riddance, I suppose."
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,Clearly this is another example of sex addiction a disease that overwhelmingly affects rich and powerful men.
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"“More recently, multiple sources say that Roiland, other than voice work, has not had any meaningful creative presence on any of the series that bear his name. In fact, many of his former colleagues say they haven’t heard from him in years, and when they have, it’s been unpleasant.”

I have been theorizing this for YEARS and I’m not just saying that because this article is shitting on him. I’ve always felt like he’s been a hyped up voice actor, with the limit of his creativity in R&M being the designs of the characters and Ricks ship. I’d be curious to see what else he came up with, but it’s always seemed like he did barely enough to earn that co creator title with Dan Harmon, who actually writes it. Maybe Rolland came up with the idea, which would make him a creator, but that’s the bare minimum of what people consider a creator."
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,Can these people just stop being creeps so that shows/movies/music stop getting ruined
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"“I turned my self into a felon, Morty! I’m WIFE BEATER RIIICCKKKK!!”"
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"I had heard from a chick I knew, of his predilection. She said he was into 3 ways, but also mid teenage girls. Something like once he had some $ or any amount of power/fame he used it to hookup with the girls that wouldn't have given him the time of day when he was still a nobody."
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"The moment I heard that Justin Roiland and Alex Hirsch had been hanging out together a lot, I knew exactly what was wrong. This guy doesn’t show up to work and thinks he’s the hottest shit for the work he doesn’t show up to anymore"
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"I wish I was surprised by the fans' reaction, but I'm just not."
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,Imagine you're in a meeting and the boss drives a little R/C car in there with a microphone stuck on top and just parks it lol
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,Eerie similarities with John K. and how that sexual predator went down in flames.
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,It derailed before that. He was apparently a raging alcoholic. I hope he finds help.
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"I love how it's always ""quirky genius"" instead of ""fucking asshole"" until the appalling behavior comes to light."
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"Let's be real, who isn't really excited to see the next season now?

First you have two main characters getting recast and you know damn well they will find fantastic talent. Even if you can just barely hear a difference, I'm looking forward to that. And the obligatory meta scene about it. Hell make a whole episode plot about it!

Plus I always felt Harmon was the man behind the great story telling. And now this just confirms it. Without Roiland, I bet that Harmon won't be hindered by Justin's douchebagerry and we will see some of the
Best story telling the show has seen.

And there is a part of me that wants Roiland to watch R&M succeed even more so without him just so he can feel some negative emotions and knock that fucker down a few pegs."
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,Is there anyone here that remembers Bewitched?  One week they just replaced the dad and no one said a thing. I was confused but the new dad was a huge improvement from the old one.
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"Dude was never a genius. He was a drunk idiot who did funny voices and threw out ""lolsorandom"" ideas in the writers room at best. Guy cant write a story to save his life and the best thing hes ever come up with is Lemongrabs scream. He never has or could, so I never understand why people think just cause his names in the opening titles that hes actually making these stories. Every episode is writers + Harmon with random shit sprinkled in by Justin. Writers + Harmon alone will be fine and probably better as the weirdest fans of this show always seemed to be the ones on Roilands dick."
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,He sounds like an asshole who made something cool once or twice. R&M is hilarious.
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"I always scratch my head after reading a story like this, in which only one the interviewees is quoted as being concerned about whether this individual was inappropriate with a female colleague. Everyone else is worried about the prestige of their creative products. I’m not saying you can’t worry about that—of course, it’s natural—I’m saying…Roilands are everywhere, and they proliferate in part because most people do not care about the targets of their abuse until it becomes a larger issue."
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"I've heard from people who know him that he's a total dick. Like, obviously funny from afar, but insufferable if you have to interact with him."
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,I have a family member who works in the entertainment industry and they told me years ago that there’s been rumors of this stuff. Sucks to hear it’s true.
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,It would be great if his punishment could also somehow include McDonald's Szechuan Sauce.
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,Never go full John K
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"Following his Instagram years ago was what led to that realization for me. Getting that extra little look into how he is when he openly expresses himself quickly tipped me off that this guy just isn’t right. He really just comes off as this emotional immature, overly volatile person who can never identify when to stop. And that last one is a big sticking point"
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"Not a single person I know, fans included, were surprised by this"
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"It’s always great when the people in power who had the ability to call out shitty behavior years ago, all come out after the fact to say they knew about it. See Harvey Weinstein."
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,This was not shocking to me. Rick and Marty while intelligent is clearly a cry for help and the “method acting” behind the scenes video he put out of him getting drunk in the office back in like 2017 was the first indicator to me that he was unwell mentally in some capacity.
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,Quirky? I thought the mofo was just creepy
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"It's not a long list, but I've never found people who have to drink to be creative to be good people. It's well known that Justin and many of the other writers would get drunk in the writing room and Justin would get drunk to do his voice acting work.

Roosterteeth is another company that's going through some controversy now and has always had a pretty steep drink culture.

I say this as someone who drinks, and likes to get drunk when the mood is right. If you have to get shit-faced to make entertaining stuff you've got a problem."
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"Someday, maybe “colleagues” will speak up in these situations.  

Unless we want more George Santoses and Justin Rollandses?"
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"While interesting I'm kinda skeptical of tabloids after watching Harry & Meagan. But really does make you think, curious what Harmon's take on this guy is."
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,Can’t trust someone in thin glasses
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"""Suddenly derailed"" by charges from like two or three years ago 🤔"
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,Imagine being such a maniac that Dan Harmon is the adult in the room.
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"Not to downplay Roiland as being a massive creep, but I have to admit; I did get a bit of a chuckle out of the article's attempt to wring maximum salaciousness out of the Riley Reid angle by framing it as him ""parading a high-profile porn star"" around the writer's room as if he had her naked and filming a hardcore scene in front of everyone to their maximum discomfort, when apparently it sounds like it was actually one of the more wholesome parts of this whole affair. She bought them all a houseplant for heaven's sake!"
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,Seems to me they put this article out in an attempt to assuage fans of their fears that this guy leaving will destroy the show.  It’s no different from an advertisement in the form of an article.
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,You read the bizarre defenses of talking about threesomes in the workplace and then you understand why the Rick and Morty fanbase is considered so toxic.
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"All the people here saying ""I always thought Dan Harmon was the genius...not Justin Roiland"" are so full of shit. Some of us were here on Reddit when Rick and Morty originally dropped and y'all had Roilands cock so far down your throats."
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,Ah geez 😳
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"I am glad to hear he wasn't doing the writing. At least I know the show won't be missing that aspect and I don't care much if Morty changes a little. The only question is how much was riffing that I enjoyed in dialog, but I am sure an actual voice collaborator will make up for this."
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,100 years
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"Honestly not to sound judgmental but I wasn't surprised when it came out he had been messaging underage girls, the kind of ""jokes"" he was making a lot of the time on podcasts were in line with that."
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,I would be willing to bet a large sum of money that Dan Harmon has lots of sexual misconduct skeletons in his closet
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,It turns out the toxic fan base is recantation of Roiland himself
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"I guess it’s not surprising that Justin turned out to be pretty fucking weird and exploitive, given how his creative career started with insane shit like Doc and Mharti

Like, I’m pretty sure most people that weren’t totally disgusted by it were thinking “holy shit this guy is nuts, I wonder what would happen if he was given a real budget and a staff”. Fast forward and… he’s an abusive sociopath! Surprise!"
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"So he hasn't been involved in the show's writing room since season 2.

That's weird, everyone at /r/rickandmorty kept saying how essential he is to the future of the series."
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"I’ve suspected that the writers have long detected red flags with Roiland.

While these companies are free to work with anyone he and to a degree Harmon seem to be the type of people you should probably have a “parted ways” statement on standby."
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,How is this a surprise. He’s a POS and said some really weird stuff to minor girls through DMs. Doesn’t help how unfunny he is either; always the same stupid voice
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"How brave of these colleagues to speak up now after the crimes have been made public and their comments don’t impact their own ability to make money. 

True heroes."
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,But no one  still listens to Chris Brown right??
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"Justin Roiland's contributions weren't even really to writing. His idea of writing is just making up characters with silly names like ""Shploobie Bibbles"" and juvenile gross-out humor. 2 of his 5 writing credits over 6 seasons of R&M were inter dimensional cable, which we all know is largely improvised, and see my point above about Shploobie Bibbles. New voice for the titular characters will be the biggest change, and I doubt very many reasonable people will end up giving a fuck."
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,His behavior was troubling in public.  I listened to one episode of his podcast and felt like my soul needed a powerwashing afterwords.
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,Thumbnail at a glance makes him look like a bad Sonic the Hedgehog OC.
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,Lol I saw him as sonic in the thumbnail instead of Rick and was very confused
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,So all the people freaking out about Roiland's involvement blew it way out of the proportion outside or doing voices
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,But Elon Musk said he’s the heart of the show!
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,When did assholery become ok some might say. Others would say it’s always been. I’m sad for folks who he wronged. Feel stupid for finally getting to these shows and then this.
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,What a big dumb douchebaggy bag'a douche.
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"&#x200B;

Holy shit, the [tiny RC car with a camera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii6XuM187Zo) on it is real"
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"Amazingly well researched article. 

What a creepy fuck this Roiland turned out to be"
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,Next time they gonna say is that he started his own religion. Pigs are people.
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"If story accurate, all he did was make himself easy to replace. Never a good idea in any job. His role was get the ball rolling and voice work. Like any exec producer really.  

This is different then why most of us thought which was he was neck deep in the day to day work of getting the shows made and so his voice (literal and figuratively) were a critical component. That clearly isn’t the case.

If you think all those Steven Spielberg producing credits was him rolling up his sleeves and getting to work, you lost your minds. His roll was to pitch it, get the money on board and then sit back, let everyone do the actual work and reap the benefits.

After that the actual creatives did the heavy lifting of the writing, directing, animating while Roiland just did voice work from comfort of home. Not saying voice actors are not important, but unlike some live action shows, they can be replaced as there are many that can mimic the voice.

As for his silence, well duh. Even a first year law student will tell you to “shut the f—- up” when involved in criminal and civil cases. The worse thing he can do is say anything. Look at Adam Baldwin and his ill advised interview and how that is going to be used against him."
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"For a man who created Rick Sanchez, I'll say it again, I'm not that surprised."
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"Ahh yes, Hollywood reporter, they’re not bias or clickbaity."
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"It really sounds like roiland just kept being himself and the success made everyone else be more cautious and that just didnt vibe with the “we are successful now so we must change” turn everyone took

You know, excluding the abuse stuff which is obviously terrible"
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,Whoda thought that the alcoholic who disguises hedonism as “complex” nihilism is actually an annoying and crass human being.
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,Incoming netflix docuseries
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,Yoga
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,How is everyone in this comment section ignoring the fact that he's a huge pedo? That news is definitely what resulted in adult swim cutting ties.
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"so basically, everything was fine as long as he brought them fame and power? yeh, sounds bout right."
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,Roiland trying to be Rick in real life.
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,When I first saw Rick and Morty I thought it was funny. When I saw that everything he has ever done is the same damn voice and humor I found him way less funny.
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,It’s always guys like Roiland that try to get their reports to join them for a threesome. 🤢
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"An episode aired last night with the toxic versions of Rick and Morty and it never occurred to me that Morty seduced two grown ass women, until just then. Never really put much thought into some of the shit that happens in the show until this stuff started coming out."
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"I really like Solar Opposites, more than R and M. It’s a shame celebrities turn into raging douche canoes when they get a little money in the bank"
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"He’d get shitfaced drunk to record his lines for Rick, how anyone would be surprised that he isn’t an alcoholic piece of shit outside of the recording booth is beyond me."
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"Quirky genius? No, fuck that. 

I once pointed out awhile back, before the accusations began, that someone whose entire fame started with a BTTF parody in which Doc Brown wants Marty to suck him off, might not be the most stable guy in the room. I got downvoted to hell for it because you can't question the 'genius"" of some artists I guess. Those fans helped this guy gain his power, that he went on to abuse other creators and artists. They saw a guy who went through a lot of trouble to make the joke, ""a grown adult  wants oral sex from a teenager"" and said, ""shut up and take my money"" and he went on to become a grown adult trying to fuck teenagers. 

Who.

Fucking.

Knew."
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"They should just write in Morty going through a late puberty, hire an actor with a crazy deep voice and never mention it again"
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"Any true fan would have seen this coming a mile away, when I saw his method acting video like 4 years ago, I knew he had a lot of demons and trauma he wasn't able to deal with and his alcoholism was only going to get worse and get him into trouble."
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,He stopped showing up around the Third season? That’s when it all went downhill quality wise
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,This show is has been a minefield for its staff. I find it weird that few articles are mentioning the sexual harassment instances with Harmon as well.
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"I first became a fan of Justin’s when he started his podcast way back in 2010. Generally he came off as a good person, with a crazy sense of humor, quirky ideas, and love for his friends and fans. He’d even get deep talking about his childhood, sense of paranoia for the future, and depressive episodes. Sometimes he’d come off as somewhat controlling, but it was his show after all. Just like in Rick and Morty he also did characters that went on comedic rants that were over the top, overtly sexual, scatological (lol), and just straight up funny and weird. Even if he responded to fan mail as one of these characters going on a lewd rant, he’d come back as Justin and usually say it’s just for the shock comedy and he loves his fans. Fast-forward to today and I’m not sure how to feel about Justin… Worst case scenario, he was always an abuser deep down and it’s just finally come to light. Best case is he spiraled out of control under pressure becoming the personalities he always portrays in characters. Of course neither are excuses. I hope any victims get justice. I hope Justin gets therapy. And I hope the friends and family of everyone involved are doing ok."
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"TBH he kind of sucked and all his 'projects' were him just him riding the coat tails of Rick and Mortys success, and doing the same characters again and again."
Granblue Fantasy: The Animation,"Rick and Morty fan here, and I hope most other fans can agree with this next statement, fuck this guy, we don’t need him, just find other people to voice his characters."
Restaurant to Another World,Mel Brooks did an AMA here but Nick couldn’t get an intern to make 4 goddamn threads?
Restaurant to Another World,"The Hitler on Ice bit was pretty funny.  

USA:0, CHINA:0, USSR:0, CAN:0 UK:0, FRANCE:10, POLAND: FUCK YOU!


I was expecting this to be a dumber version of Drunk History, but was surprised by many of the bits."
Restaurant to Another World,"Karma souptra 

From soup to nuts

When I’m not slurp slurp slurp… I’m eating soup"
Restaurant to Another World,"I'm enjoying it.

Mel Brooks is always weird to me, because I find 90% of his humor to be the funniest I've ever seen and 10% insufferable. On net I think he's great, but all of his projects have a certain...point where it's actively anti-funny.

That's basically how I feel about History of the World Part 2.

*Most* of the sketches are pretty good. I don't feel like any overstay their welcome, although the Russian Revolution is dragging a bit. Once an episode there's an absolute dog of a sketch and there's a few I actively hate (I could have lived never seeing Alex Bell fuck a phone). 

But a lot of the stuff is actually smarter than I expected--having a ""committee"" write Shakespeare, along with a woman sneaking in dressed as a man, is pretty funny if you know much about him. 

I thought the Judas bit was going to suck at first but it ended up being my favorite.

It's weird reading these other comments. Mel Brooks comes from a heritage of comedians that basically boil down to ""throw a bunch of jokes at the wall and if enough of them stick it's a success."" It's kind of refreshing to see it again--yeah, not all the jokes are going to land, but at least some people are going to find something funny in even the lamest of jokes, and on net you're still getting an overall good amount of humor.

Edit: Now that I've seen all the episodes, my opinion hasn't changed much. *Most* sketches are good. Some are bad. And some have a great premise but don't go anywhere--Typhoid Mary hosting a youtube cooking channel is a funny concept, but you can tell they didn't bother writing too many jokes and just told the actress to improvise most of it. Thankfully, the whole thing moves quick so if there's a bad sketch it's done in a minute. If they had spent just a little bit longer firming up the sketches and maybe dialed back some of the recurring ones--Civil War, Shirley!, and the Russian Revolution aren't *bad*, but they run out of steam pretty quick. I still say it's worth watching even if it's not one of Brooks' best projects.

Basically, I'd watch Part III."
Restaurant to Another World,"I was surprised that Mel Brooks had an AMA earlier today, but this sub didn't even put up a discussion thread for premieres like they usually do. I'm just going to plagiarize my own comments from another post that didn't get any views.

It was a mixed bag for me. I hadn't watched the original in almost 20 years, but that was also imperfect and uneven, so at least it's not shitting on the legacy. I thought that the movie worked best in small doses (the Dawn of Man, Stone Age, Ten Commandments and of course the Eunuch test) but dragged along during the Roman Empire and French Revolution sections. This one also has some good stuff, but the recurring Civil War and Russian Revolution segments are similarly dragging.

Likes:

* The introduction with swole Mel was a great way to establish the tone
* They kept the original theme by John Morris!
* Humor is as irreverent as ever (for better or worse)
* I'm glad they brought Mel on as narrator, taking the place of Orson Welles. Seems fitting somehow
* The Kama Sutra short felt tonally consistent with the original material
* They also kept the musical element, which was a big part of the movie
* The parodies were all in my wheelhouse;
* [Jackrasp](https://www.reddit.com/r/jackass/comments/11k17zh/jackass_crew_in_history_of_the_world_part_2/) was really amusing to me. Never thought I'd see the crossover between Mel Brooks and Jackass
* [Curb Your Judaism](https://www.reddit.com/r/curb/comments/11k4h11/curb_your_judaism_from_history_of_the_world_part/) was pretty, *pretty* good
* Khan'd was also an amusing twist (loved the charcoal artists hiding)
* All the revolving guest stars are iconic and great
* Jack Black as singing Stalin
* Sigmund Freud's MasterClass
* Easter Bunny crossbreeding
* The Egyptian Pyramid scheme was good, though Fred Armisen reminded me strangely of Yogurt

Dislikes:

* My OCD would prefer if they kept the sketches in loose chronological order (following the movie), but I guess they're sticking with an 'episodic' quality, revisiting some of the same characters each episode
* No repeats! But they basically already did a version of ""the discovery of fire"" in the movie
* We finally got Hitler on Ice! But they essentially recycled the footage and then fumbled the ending
* The anachronistic quality seemed a bit overdone to me; the TV news crew, the Tik Tok makeup tutorial, the crew reflected in the glasses, etc. The original wasn't quite as heavy-handed about it
* Some of it just didn't work for me at all, like the Civil War, parts of the Russian Revolution and the Shirley! sitcom. I get the impression some of these storylines are going to end up merging at some point, similar to the movie
* Noah's Ark felt like a huge wasted opportunity

That's only my criticism of the first four episodes, but it seems like the previews have some more good stuff in store. I'm actually just tickled pink that they're continuing this after 42 years. That's got to count for something, so I'm trying to keep an open mind.

If nothing else, I'm glad it got me to revisit the original movie after all this time. I feel the same way about the Fawlty Towers revival; it gives me a great excuse to watch the originals again after so many years."
Restaurant to Another World,"The fact that they refer to West Virginia as part of the confederacy is driving me nuts. Other than that, I’ve had some laughs."
Restaurant to Another World,"I actually dig it. Nothing revolutionary but I think it's doing the TV version of what the movie did just fine. Although we *have* already seen this with Drunk History, more or less. 

Doesn't matter, I love Mel Brooks and may he live to be 2000 years old."
Restaurant to Another World,"I was also surprised there wasn't as much discussion here on this show, but to be hoenst I had the opposite impression. 

The first couple sketches were just not that funny. I can't tell if it's not that funny or my taste in comedy is different than it was when I first saw History of the World Part 1.

Most of the sketches reminded me of SNL, where the premise is pretty funny, but they either don't go anywhere good with the premise, or they drag the sketch on way too long.

Still worth a watch out of respect to Mel Brooks, and it's not completely iredeemable like some other streaming releases. That's why I was surprised there wasn't a discussion thread here."
Restaurant to Another World,"It’s hit and miss but when it hits I’m laughing pretty damn hard. Not bad at all in small doses less than 30 minutes.

I think the skits being shorter is better than the long drawn out Roman and French Revolution ones from the movie."
Restaurant to Another World,"Josh Gad as Shakespeare and Kroll as Judas are my favorites so far. I'd say only about every other sketch has worked so far but honestly the ones that did were really killer, IMO."
Restaurant to Another World,"I am highly disappointed. Just not funny, or even clever. I really enjoyed History Pt 1 but this… Maybe “the kids” or someone who never saw Pt 1 think it’s funny?"
Restaurant to Another World,"After 42 years, Jews in space had one hell of a payoff.

""Wanda, are you even allowed to be in this sketch?""
""I'm a producer.""
""Yeah, you're basically Jewish."""
Restaurant to Another World,"I am enjoying the show. I grew up loving Mel Brooks movies. Some of the sketches are meh and I’m quickly realizing this is the Nick Kroll show. But the best part for me is seeing all the actors I’m a fan of. Even if it’s not the best writing it’s still fun to watch them. 

The Kama Souptra one probably made me laugh the hardest. Kumail is great at that sort of deadpan delivery. He reminded me of his characters on Portlandia. 

I liked the “Get Back” parody but their inconsistent accents and parallels to the band made it a bit mid, like they’d only watched the previews for the documentary. 

And as I mentioned in other comments, Nick Kroll has always annoyed me and as this show goes on it becomes apparent that it’s the Nick Kroll show and it’s progressively irking me more. 

Overall, I’ll keep watching, and it’s entertaining. I didn’t know it was a thing until Mel’s AMA two days ago, so it’s been a nice surprise to have this week."
Restaurant to Another World,"Watched the first two episodes, not sure I laughed once. It says something that the funniest bit on the show is the one where they just took someone else's concept, Curb, and used it."
Restaurant to Another World,The judas version of curb your enthusiasm had me laughing hard
Restaurant to Another World,"As a huge Mel Brooks fan and someone who watches Part 1 often, Part 2 just isn’t good. I guess I expected so much from Mel Brooks finally doing a sequel. 

I suspect this is mostly written by others, like Nick Kroll, who is hardly funny."
Restaurant to Another World,"I loved the movie but after 4 episodes of this I had just a few little chuckles, I expected more, maybe a tighter movie without all the filler would have been better. #WarAndPeace."
Restaurant to Another World,I saw Nick Kroll on Colbert last night. The clip they showed did nothing for me. Just doesn't seem like it's all that funny or worth my time.
Restaurant to Another World,It really flew under the radar. Really bad promotion for it. Didn’t even know it existed until yesterday.
Restaurant to Another World,"For me it's more miss than hit... some jokes land perfectly, but most are just not funny.
Let's see how it develops."
Restaurant to Another World,I’ve watched the first 4 episodes and it kinda has the same hit or miss quality as the original movie. For some reason the gag of the guy literally blowing on Judas in the bathroom got me really hard
Restaurant to Another World,"I’m really liking it, but I had my expectations in check - 1) assuming that MB was guiding from a distance and, 2) I absolutely LOVE MB but a huge part of why I love his movies is Kahn, Feldman, Wilder, Korman, etc. A person can write the funniest lines but you have to have the comedic chops to deliver it. 

Which is why I will rewatch Part II a hundred more times, but I will fast-forward through the Schmuck Mudman scenes and most of the Kroll scenes every time. I love Nick Kroll, but I really tired of him quickly in this show (like half way through Ep. 1) . Also, I think Ike Barinholtz is the saving grace of this show, he’s somehow become the one consistent thread that gets it and is delivering it the way I expect in a MB production."
Restaurant to Another World,"I watched 3 episodes so far, there were some misses but most of them are hit, those sketches made me laugh, Anastasia Romanov (Dove Cameron) as influencer/beauty blogger was hilarious. I also did not expect Rasputin (Johnny Knoxville) did the Jackass, they even brought some of Jackass crew"
Restaurant to Another World,The Judas/Jesus bits got me
Restaurant to Another World,"I just don't find it to be very funny. I'm om episode 3 now and I've had a few smiles and a couple of chuckles, but most of it is just stupid. 

None of the sketches have any bite at all. It's all just, ""Here's some talented actors doing dumb shit. Please laugh."""
Restaurant to Another World,"I’m not not enjoying it, but I’m also not impressed. Im on episode 5, and so far there have been some good / comical segments but overall the show has been disappointing. 

A lot of the writing feels like it was done by a group of 13 year old boys who got the green light to swear and be obscene for the first time ever. It’s basically “we can swear, so let’s make sure we swear a lot. Let’s have him say the F word twice in each sentence, and make sure everyone talks about dicks, a lot.” It’s like the writers think swear words are hilarious and equate swearing to having done something of comedic value. 

For as many comedy centered actors and actresses this show has, it’s even more disappointing that it’s so unfunny and mediocre."
Restaurant to Another World,Just watched episode 7 and that was one of the unfunniest episodes of TV I've seen in a while. There was one maybe two sketches that were funny and that's it.
Restaurant to Another World,"It started pretty strong, but got progressively less entertaining, especially as some of the stories just would not end. Some of them should not have extended beyond two episodes. And why on earth did they decide to do two distinct Jesus-type parody stories? Pick either the Curb version or the Beatles version. Very odd choice."
Restaurant to Another World,"Disappointing.  Seems very bland and tame compared to the first one, which had some really shocking bits.

The Jackass part was amusing, and Hitler skating.  But a lot of this just seemed predictable and was forgettable."
Restaurant to Another World,It has its moments but a lot of the sketches drag unfortunately. Which sucks I’m a huge Mel Brooks fan was looking forward to this for years
Restaurant to Another World,"Can't stand Nick kroll. He's not funny. Hate how he also uses daddy's money and power to influence others, or force other non-funny people into the spotlight.

Also I adore and love Mel brooks, and would have supported this if it wasn't for Kroll"
Restaurant to Another World,"I'd much rather the skits have been one coherent run through, versus having to sit watching 4 different sets before going back to the original one.

I think a lot of the humor is forced, forgetting their original audience.

I don't blame Mel Brooks, as it looks as if he had no part in directing it. And what parts he did, it seems as if they twisted his arm into it with no say.

Imo, they learned too hard with Nick kroll being the funny guy, and tried playing it safe with their comedy."
Restaurant to Another World,"Because it’s massively disappointing and hasn’t managed to generate any organic traction? It’s Mel brooks in name only, none of this comedy is his and completely lacks the sort of bite he is known for."
Restaurant to Another World,Shirley needs to fuck off
Restaurant to Another World,The Alexander Graham Bell one is also fantastic.
Restaurant to Another World,"For those curious, two episodes are dropped each day for this week."
Restaurant to Another World,It’s not good
Restaurant to Another World,"Not nobody. You’re talking about it. Lol. No. But I searched last night and wondered the same thing. I didn’t want to be the one to start the page for it. Can’t decide on a favorite skit personally, but can’t wait to see more!"
Restaurant to Another World,"I rewatched the movie just before diving into this (it was my very first MB, seen on HBO when I was about 4 years old). The original movie mostly still holds up. Enjoyed the first two episodes overall. The riffs with Jack ass and Punk'd were good, lived Will Sasso as a Cossack choking to death and doing charades. The Shirley Chisholm bits fell a bit flat, even with seeing Marla Gibbs show up. Loved the Hitler on Ice bit (Poland : Fuck You), and agree that the discovery of fire was the only rehash (pun fully intended) from the original. Looking forward to diving into the next 2 later this evening."
Restaurant to Another World,Curb Your Judaism was legit
Restaurant to Another World,"The problem is the first one is a movie and looks like a movie and this one is cheap tv show. While i like the sketches it rubs me wrong they’re just using the name.

But hey i love drew tarver and im happy hes getting work."
Restaurant to Another World,"I've really been enjoying it. Some of the skits are less amazing than others, but it's nice just to watch something and laugh at the end of a long work day. 

So far the standouts have been Curb Your Judaism, Sigmund Freud, Jack Black as Stalin, the ""cave""women, Hitler on Ice. I have been enjoying the Civil War skits too (especially Harriet Tubman and holy shit, Zahn McClarnon!!), but the Russian Revolution ones have been a little flat (too much Nick Kroll, maybe?)

I'm glad I watched Part 1 the day before, it really rounded out the experience. I'll definitely watch it in its entirety."
Restaurant to Another World,I’m LOVING IT the cast is unbelievable! I just started watching today so I’m late to the party. How is no one talking about this show fr fr?!
Restaurant to Another World,"It's fine but half the bits are just not that interesting. Most of the celebrities are just there to be seen on a project with Mel Brooks name. 

It's completely undaring and a Mel Brooks comedies use to be daring in their humour and the humour in this is just the same modern comedy; tamed bits written by a writers room with a team of people attempting to be safe yet still funny. 

Nothing in it is so good that in 10-20 years you'll be like ""oh this one sketch was so funny and true"".

It started out with it's best bits on episode 1 like the Hitler on Ice sketch and frankly basically every other episode has been a slow slide down the quality hill."
Restaurant to Another World,I mean it's super just ok.
Restaurant to Another World,"So many bland and lukewarm jokes. Just real predictable low hanging fruit. A lot of the jokes were overdone bits that stopped being funny decades ago. For example, the bit where someone says ""What if we did so and so?"" and the other person replies ""No that's a bad idea. I know! What if we did so and so?"" Or the bit where the one person is choking and someone thinks they're playing charades. They might as well have just done a bit where they reenacted who's on first verbatim, although that probably would have been funnier that the rest of the stuff.

I watched one episode and it got two light chuckles out of me. Once at the cavewoman sketch and once at the jackass sketch. The writing just isn't clever. At all. Did they have interns writing this or something?"
Restaurant to Another World,The Civil War segments reminded me of UPN’s The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer.  Still hoping to see those 5 unaired episodes someday.
Restaurant to Another World,"It was unwatchable. Couldn't make it to the halfway point of the first episode. The comedy was so lowbrow and cringe. 

I'm just curious here who they're making this for. How many people under 40 know about the movie?"
Restaurant to Another World,"OK so parts that tickled me ""Where mel brooks is reading the beginning titles, on the Jesus Christ one.... he said JESUS CHRIST like how someone would say it if they were startled""  ........   ""The alexander gram bell "" SHOW MOMMA THAT DICKKKKK bit""   .......    ""When Sigmund fraud snorted coke and went ""WELL GODDDDDDAMNNNNNN""  the delivery was hlarious"
Restaurant to Another World,Had hopes this was going to be better than what it looked like but it’s actually worse IMO. Just not good. Not funny.
Restaurant to Another World,Mel Brooks has never failed to make me laugh. Until now.
Restaurant to Another World,"I remember about a month or so ago when the trailer was released people were getting torched in this sub for voicing skepticism about it. As if it wasn’t both apparent from the trailer and *likely* to be bad based on the track record of the endless reboots, sequels, prequels, and rehashes we’ve seen in the past 5-10 years that these things are nearly always mediocre-to-terrible.

I’ve really gotten frustrated with “toxic positivity”. How many times do people need to get the football snatched away before they stop getting excited for these nostalgia grabs and maybe finally motivate these executives to develop new content rather than aping on the past and *usually* failing to deliver or in the worst instances actually tarnishing the legacy of what came before?"
Restaurant to Another World,"RIP Comedy. thanks gen z. looking at you too, china"
Restaurant to Another World,"The trailer looked not great.  Despite a gajillion stars that they definitely managed to snag by being like “let’s be honest, this is the last thing Mel Brooks is going to do, don’t you wanna be a part of that?” they managed to not find 2 minutes worth of good material to fill a trailer with. That’s concerning.

Still, it is full of a million stars that I like and I kinda like Nick Kroll humor so I’ll probably try it eventually.  Like seven or nine days after the final episode drops so that I’m outside of the live plus and I’m not rewarding them for making a forty year too late sequel to a movie that was supposed to never ever have a sequel, that was the joke, they named it “Part One” as a JOKE!"
Restaurant to Another World,"I heard about this show a week ago, Nick Kroll was on The Watch podcast promoting it but that's all, the show had 0 buzz. I was expected discussion threads and more comments around here for sure."
Restaurant to Another World,"It's not available in the UK because Disney's International distribution is still absolutely dreadful.

We get Disney+ originals like Star Wars and Marvel shows on day one but when it comes to Hulu and FX originals, you genuinely have to cross your fingers and hope they deem you worthy of a day one release or if you have to wait months to see them. Only Murders In The Building we get at the same time but stuff like this and Welcome to Chippendales you have to just keep an eye out for a tweet saying it's available now (3+ months after the US).

And it makes no sense because Disney owns US AND international distribution to these shows."
Restaurant to Another World,I was born the year History of the World Part 1 came out and it was literally my favorite comedy movie growing up. I can't believe that I wasn't aware that he was doing Part 2 and that I missed the AMA. When I saw that Nick Kroll was involved I dropped everything and watched the first four episodes in one sitting. Can't wait for tonight!
Restaurant to Another World,I've been waiting for this movie for years.
Restaurant to Another World,You trying to astroturf me boy?
Restaurant to Another World,"Well, I sincerely thought that it wasn't out until the 10th."
Restaurant to Another World,It was ok so far.
Restaurant to Another World,"The only thing missing was the amazing cast of the original.  They couldn't ever replace them of course, but at least try to find funny people.  But no matter what, it will always be good to be the king. Thank you Mel!  Oh pissboy!"
Restaurant to Another World,I honestly don't think any new Mel Brooks was going to create much excitement. I loved his stuff but it's just the reality of comedy.
Restaurant to Another World,"It's super corny and silly, much like Brooks' later films, but I'm liking it a lot. Definitely pairs with Part I pretty well in tone and humor. Just two episodes in so far. Will spread it out over the week."
Restaurant to Another World,I thought this was a movie. Kinda wish they used the same type of camera then transitioned into a modern hd one.
Restaurant to Another World,"It is very hit or miss. The cast and writers are all some of the funniest people in comedy right now, and it seems like there are different writers for every sketch so it’s a real hodge podge.

I wish there was more involvement from Mel and any of his past collaborators who are still around. I get that he is quite old and is also probably extra nervous about doing big film shoots with Covid floating around, even with the vaccines someone at his age could get hit really hard by it still. 

I didn’t mind that they added modern stuff like instagram etc into the show, as that’s the type of thing Mel would do back in the day, I would have liked for them to tone it down maybe 50%. Some of the jokes that may feel more “cliche” are only cliche because people like Mel created and perfected those things when he and a few others were basically creating the Satire genre as we know it, so it feels here more like a tribute and homage to the style of humor of the man behind this franchise than a overdone joke. 


It could have been better, it could have been worse. 

I think I still would have preferred a real well done Spaceballs 2. The perfect time for it was probably years ago during the sequel trilogy, before Covid, Mel was a little bit younger and could have probably had more involvement, but with so much new Star Wars content to make fun of (and there is slot to make fun of) I think the timing is still good. 

Ultimately I’d rather he work with one or two younger writers on the scripts and have a bigger hand in the projects. Maybe asking too much of him but I’d love to get something new out of him before he leaves us. He still seems to have a pretty sharp wit, with someone like a Nick Kroll or whoever worked on that new Weird Al movie involved  along with Mel to help polish and do some of the heavy lifting so he doesn’t get overworked I think he still has one final last hurrah in him. 

This was more of a tribute to Mel Brooks by people who idolize him than it was a new Mel Brooks project. Which is fine, but I really want an honest to god new Mel Brooks movie with hm writing and hopefully, playing at least some character with decent screen time. Directing is probably asking too much,but there are plenty of capable comedy directors who could bring his vision to light in a way that honors his past work but is also palatable to a new audience."
Restaurant to Another World,Who is hacker Mary in JC resurrection?
Restaurant to Another World,"I really liked the Civil War, Russia (Jackrasp especially), and Jesus sketches. Kroll did some great work throughout the series. I think the Curb Your Judaism, statues, and the Beatles parody were probably my favorite bits throughout the entire series."
Restaurant to Another World,That show was a abomination to the original. It was horrible and so watered down.
Restaurant to Another World,I laughed so hard that my stomach consistently hurt for for hours because I binged it all in a row. Shirley! and the Jesus sits were a highlight for me. Galileo almost broke my chest from laughing.
Restaurant to Another World,"This series has been an incredibly mixed bag. There are some funny elements to it, but Nick Kroll attempting to connect with Gen Z as a tik tok star or whatever is…. Well, it’s hot garbage. Kroll is capable of being funny, I know he is. But god damn— for every good sketch he does, I feel like there are 3 more that fall flat. The recurring sketches don’t have strong enough legs to carry the story. The jokes are such a mixed bag, with a *lot* of the show relying on us all to go “haha, racism was a bad thing and still is!” After a point, it’s no longer a joke. It’s a depressing reminder of the way that the world is. 

I love Mel Brooks, but history of the world part 2 has been pretty bad in my opinion"
Restaurant to Another World,"""Benito Mussolini up next on the downhill, he can make the *trains* run on time but can he beat his *own* time on the slopes? Let's hope he falls down and breaks both of his fucking legs"""
Restaurant to Another World,Vichy cowards.
Restaurant to Another World,"this is my favorite, we have started quoting it in my house lmao"
Restaurant to Another World,The Judas bit was top notch. I wish I had an entire Curb version of all of these moments in history.
Restaurant to Another World,"The Shirley one should have only been a one or two time sketch and that’s it, the joke gets old really fast and it really doesn’t land all that well. The whole intention seems to be drawing comedy out of it being an unfunny 70s style cliche sitcom, but at the end of the day it winds up just being straightforward unfunny 70s style sitcoms jokes and the satire element isn’t strong enough to move it beyond that."
Restaurant to Another World,"My opinions align with yours, although I think I'm getting more of a kick out of the Civil War. The idea of Grant sneaking away to West Virginia to get a drink is kinda funny to me and I'll take more Timothy Simons any day of the week. (Although the purist in me is annoyed they keep saying West Virginia is part of the Confederacy. I'm hoping there's a building to a joke.)

Also the Noah's Ark sketch was short and sweet with a nice punchline. It may have been a missed opportunity but from a joke-to-content ratio it worked for me."
Restaurant to Another World,"I'll go ahead and daisy-chain my thoughts from episodes 5 and 6. It feels like more of the same and I fear this is becoming a case of diminishing returns. At least it seems like the Civil War and Russian Revolution portions have finally ended, so I hope that leaves more time for other time periods that haven't been covered yet.

It feels like they have a checklist of all the modern things they want to lampoon, so of course we get Galileo on Cameo (Galilameo), TicciTocci, Khancestry.com and various commercials and infomercials that don't really fit in with the common theme (though I liked the one about Amelia Earhart). It was fine at first but I feel like the conceit is wearing thin at this point. In 8 episodes, I really would've preferred if they devoted more time to other stretches of history. I did enjoy The Apostles/Beatles Get Back parody, though.

Also, not sure if anyone saw this in the final night preview, but I see JEWS IN SPACE!"
Restaurant to Another World,"Just watched the first episode and some of it made me smile but the only time I laughed out loud was Jackrasp. I 100% not expecting that and seeing the cast pop up with the music just made me so happy and thinking about the idea of that skit again makes me laugh. 

It’s a sketch show so I’m not expecting them all tk be winners, as long as we get a few lol ones I am happy with it"
Restaurant to Another World,I definitely feel like Fred Armisan was supposed to be similar to Yogurt in that sketch and I loved it
Restaurant to Another World,">The anachronistic quality seemed a bit overdone to me; the TV news crew, the Tik Tok makeup tutorial, the crew reflected in the glasses, etc. The original wasn't quite as heavy-handed about it

Agree with this entirely.  Excessive.  Seemed desperate at times to connect to today's audience, but the Gatorade on Grant and hashtag video scene just didn't work."
Restaurant to Another World,He had an AMA?? I wish I had known.
Restaurant to Another World,"> Fawlty Towers revival

Wait...What? [Well I'll be](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/john-cleese-fawlty-towers-monty-python-b2287458.html)."
Restaurant to Another World,"Yes.

FFS, the whole reason West Virginia exists is that they *didn't* want to secede from the Union!"
Restaurant to Another World,Yeah. As someone from Maryland we always learned that West Virginia existed ironically to stay with the union but now how thousands of confederate flag loving people there.
Restaurant to Another World,"Just watching the show now and we’re sitting on the couch googling things like this haha 

I don’t need comedies to be totally historically accurate but that was a little silly to get wrong"
Restaurant to Another World,"Same, it is also driving me nuts."
Restaurant to Another World,"Fairly certain it’s apart of the bit, as there are many people flying the confederate banner in this state today…"
Restaurant to Another World,"I agree. It has a very familiar vibe, but I would argue Drunk History is also derivative of things like the first History of the world or Monty Python. Sketch comedy is always a little hit or miss."
Restaurant to Another World,">Doesn't matter, I love Mel Brooks and may he live to be 2000 years old.

I fear this is going to go over too many heads, but I appreciated it :)"
Restaurant to Another World,">I was also surprised there wasn't as much discussion here on this show, but to be hoenst I had the opposite impression.


> The first couple sketches were just not that funny.

You kind of answered why there isnt much discussion"
Restaurant to Another World,"> The first couple sketches were just not that funny. I can't tell if it's not that funny or my taste in comedy is different than it was when I first saw History of the World Part 1.

Part 1 isn’t exactly my favorite Brooks movie, but I think Part II don’t have as much of an overarching feel of Brooks-ness. It has some of it but it feels mostly like a modern comedy just using his name to sell it."
Restaurant to Another World,"Also, I would’ve just preferred a film. 2 hours of content can be 2 hours sometimes, not just 4 half hour episodes."
Restaurant to Another World,I'm 50 and the trailer looks incredibly unfunny. ill probably never watch it
Restaurant to Another World,">Most of the sketches reminded me of SNL

Exactly what I thought halfway through the first episode. I'm actually getting annoyed at how unfunny it was just typing this. I've been a huge Mel Brooks fan for many years, and it just didn't feel like him.

The Curb sketch was funny, but mostly because it reminded me that I'd rather be watching something vastly funnier, like Curb.

I smell a bunch of hack writers all over this."
Restaurant to Another World,"What you are looking for is the comedy is too safe, SNL has the same problem. Mel Brooks was always funny because he pushed the comedy of that time to its limits. HotW part 2 and SNL no longer push the limtis, they make safe non offensive comedy."
Restaurant to Another World,"Yeah, I watched the first couple of sketches and then turned on something else. I like most the people involved so maybe my hopes were too high."
Restaurant to Another World,Maybe I like it cause I like SNL
Restaurant to Another World,"Part II pushes the button a lot more than SNL does, IMHO"
Restaurant to Another World,The Judas/Curb your Enthusiam bit was gold.
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,Why can’t we start making good anime out of bad movies instead?
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,This gon suck
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,"I have so many good memories reading and watching this series as a teenager, I just don’t know if this is the right thing to scratch the nostalgia itch."
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,Why they gotta make everything into live action it never works well
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,"They’re supposed to be in Junior High, lol"
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,Just hope it’s as good as other “anime turned  live action” masterpieces such as death note or cowboy bepop
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,"Cool, cant wait for netflix to cancel this one prematurely too"
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,Why after all these years? I think the anime came out in 94
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,"This is one of the few anime where the english dub is better, imo."
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,"With a Japanese director and Japanese production company, it could be not bad."

Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,Doesn't capture Yusuke's personality in that photo at all.

Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,"> Netflix

Oh no

> Japanese production

Okay it might be decent but I’m not gonna hold out hope."
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,Nothing is sacred anymore.
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,"I mean I love this show so much that I don’t care if it bombs I’m watching all of it. 

I wanna see genkai toguro"
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,It's going to suck.
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,This post is how I learned there's a yuyu hakusho live action coming out. Like why though. YYH is one of the reasons for anime to exist. Looks way too silly live.
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,No thank you.  Just came to say that.
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,"I rather they remake the anime. 

Or even better, animate the HxH chapters post chimera Ant arc since togashi is writing again"
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,Wow this is a very annoying face
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,"If it's a full on remake of the manga, it's going to be a *rough* first half. It doesn't turn into a fighting series until you're a good way in."
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,"Man, I can't think of one good live action anime themed/inspired show. Not one. This going to be pure hairy, sweaty, rancid, ass..."
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,Who… who asked for this?
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,the day Netflix gets its filthy hands on Video Girl Ai is the day I go to America and start acting like Terence Stamp in The Limey
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,Just stop…
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,Is anyone asking for these live action adaptions? Why do they do these?
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,Weebs everywhere rejoice!
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,"This probably won't be good but if nothing else, it'll probably put me in the mood to rewatch the original since that's what most of these live-action remakes do. So that's cool enough with me. Maybe one of these days they'll surprise us with a legitimately solid one."
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,It's gunna take them the whole movie for the protag to release one finger gun.
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,"Turning animation to live-action is always going to suck. Turn live-action to animation instead, like they did with Star wars."
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,"Ah shit, here we go again."
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,That's what Super Crooks did. It's absolutely beautiful. So much so that you really forget that it's in the Jupiters Legacy universe.
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,[Miami Connection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAyWiEKZBmw) would make a great Anime!
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,"Yes! Let’s get an anime based on Hancock. A washed up super hero in his 40’s trying to be redeemed by someone he saved. Although I guess Kaiju No. 8 is almost like that, since he’s a middle aged Shonen protagonist."
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,"Gon's from Hunter x Hunter, this is Yu Yu Hakusho."
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,"It still holds up today, some jokes that didn’t age well, but still great."
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,"I think the first part can be adapted easily, when he dies and starts as a detective, there is not a lot of special effects and is like a detective story. But seeing the cast I think they might try to do some action and it might fail there."
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,Money
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,"The Japanese viewers are very easy to please, hence why most of their movies are bad live actions adaptations, as long as the idol of the moment is in the cast they don’t have to try that hard"
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,"It is about popular IP brand recognition.  It is popular, so they want it to sucker the fans to watch it.  Even though history has shown that movies or shows created from popular IP's in the last decade are overwhelmingly bad and is a complete mockery's of the source material that is given to narcississitc talentless hacks because of nepotism."
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,That’s hilarious but even when watching the anime I figured (wrongly it seems) they were in high school
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,They don't look like they are in junior high in the show tbf. I was in junior high when I first watched it and they clearly look like older highschool kids. Hell they were drawn like they were supposed to models you would see in the style books at a hair salon
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,Depends on the Death Note. The Japanese one was fine
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,"They renewed Alice in Borderland and this is comin from the same creator. People are circlejerking about Netflix cancelling everything but WB  is cancelling things nonstop, at least Netflix has an excuse as Netflix makes more shows so they both cancel and renew more shows."
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,Maybe it is cheap since it is an old property.
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,"That is the only thing that gives a small chance this will not suck.  However, it is still netflix, so I am lowering expectations because they have a tendency to screw things up.  Will get a better idea when they get the whole cast selected."
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,"this is the key point. But Netflix being involved, dunno man"
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,I don't know. I've seen a few live action movies and the production value was pretty terrible as well as the special effects. It comes off as a b or c movie in America.
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,They’re going to Sad
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,Oh they will.
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,"It is Netflix live adaptation, it is a given they will fuck it up.  It is like a company version of Uwe Boll."

Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,i thought it was one of the most incredibly amazingly okay shows i’ve seen this year.

Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,I just rewatched the whole series during lockdown last year. It’s still just as good as it was.
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,but they arent even making money? Cowboy bebop was cancelled within days of release.  Avatar movie was a huge box office flop. Dragonball evolution was a flop. Fullmetal alchemist was a mess. Nearly all of them were failures - why keep going to this well?
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,[deleted]
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,Is that true? Do these movies actually perform well in Japan? That's wild. It's like hearing someone defend Shyamalan's Avatar on the sole basis that Shyamalan made it
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,"You’re incorrect. Very few live-action adaptations do exceptionally well in Japanese box office.

The ones that achieve great numbers — like the recent “Kingdom” adaptation — are the exception rather than the rule. Most live-action remakes tend to do acceptable to bad numbers, one every five years actually do well."
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,This seems really hypocritical considering most americans eat up anything with bright colored costumes and an inconsequential plot.
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,This isn't made for Japanese viewers though.
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,"All the characters are drawn like they are college age.

The voice actors certainly don't sound like kids.

The responsibilities these young character all have is something you expect of college students(in the US at least).

&#x200B;

Some of this is the animations fault and the other is probably on the dub.

&#x200B;

Though have you seen 14 year olds?  They are tiny. Like moody 5 year olds."
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,"same I didnt find out until genkai's tournament.  ""my name is kuwabara im the biggest punk at sara aski junior high"""
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,"They are in the year four of junior high. High school in Japan only lasts for three years.

They are the equivalent of high school freshman in western nations."
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,"Japanese people love middle school, for some reason. Almost all manga Shonen characters that go to school are in middle school even though they’re drawn like they’re 24.  I have no idea why."
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,"This is DEFINITELY true, but the last episode features Kuwabara talking about how he got into the best high school around, and he just started."
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,"That is because it was created by Japanese for Japanese.  The problem is when Hollywood wants to make it for ""global"" audiences and fucks it up."
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,"I'm just salty since about 70% of shows I really enjoy from netflix has been cancelled. They do greenlight a lot of stuff, but if they could keep some going for longer than 1 or 2 seasons, that'd be great lol"
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,There was never been a good anime to live film adaptation. I don’t know why anyone tries
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,"Curse your words, harbinger!"
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,"Nice try, but I dont constantly have to talk about it and try and insert it into everything like weebs with Anime and Japan."
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,The costumes were absolutely horrible. When I first saw it on Netflix I thought it was going to be a parody series.
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,Would’ve been 10x as popular as an animated series for 1/10th the price.
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,I was bummed when it didn't get a 2nd season.... shows take time to grow and so many excellent shows have sub par 1st seasons.... Like The US Office and Parks and Rec.
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,Yeah they just barely say anything about it. The Utopian shows up though.
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,r/Whooosh
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,Bc the people making it still get paid just the companies funding it get burnt. Those same companies are always looking for existing IP which animes provide so they make new ones anyways
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,"I don't think this necessarily applies here, but this article explains how bad video games movie adaptations come out ahead when it comes to accounting / taxes.

""Ach du lieber! You’ve lost nearly 95 million, right? No, we’re not done yet. Follow me closely here: Under the German tax code, you can take the full 90-million deduction, then have your Munich shell company charge me (the American producer) 80 million to lease back the rights to my movie. Because you just took a 90-million loss, you don’t have to pay taxes on the 80 million you recouped.

You’re only out 10 million, plus the 4.5 million you paid in taxes. You still have over 85 million left! And after you paid me 90 million, and I paid you 80 million back (most of which I got by pre-selling foreign and cable rights to my film), I’m 10 million up on the deal, and I’m not taxed in Germany. Sweet.""

https://www.escapistmagazine.com/uwe-boll-and-the-german-tax-code/amp/"
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,This is easily the dumbest answer I've read to something in a while
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,No Western adaptation of Japanese animes do well in Japan. Most Japanese adaptations don’t do well either. So OC is incorrect on all counts.
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,Kingdom and the Rurouni Kenshin films are the only ones I can think of that have done actual big numbers.
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,I hate marvel movies but they are 10000 times better than Japanese live action crap
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,LMAO if you think they make movies for the world instead of the home market your dead wrong….
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,"> Though have you seen 14 year olds? They are tiny. Like moody 5 year olds.

maybe these days but 80s/90s there was clearly something in the food."
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,Kuwabara is a huge for a 14 year old
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,"Remember that junior high in Japan is four years.

The cast of the show would be high school freshman in the States."
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,"Because Shounen is a genre targeted at that age range?

This is like going to the YA section at Barnes and Noble and complaining all the books feature high schoolers.

Turns out coming of age stories do best with people coming of age."
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,"That just sounds more like you consume Japanese media targeted at middle school and high school.

Shounen manga literally translate to young boy's comic."
Yu Yu Hakusho: Ghost Files,"Japanese highschools follow slightly different break up. Their junior high goes up to about 15 years old. Highschool is 16-17-18. 

It's also one of those break off points like the UK has or used to have? Where after 16 you could say fuck A levels I'm going into the blue collar work force. So while in American movies that choice is usually made graduating as an 18 year old old senior in some countries it's like right around your 16th birthday that you can make that decision.

So yeah a lot of shonen focus on this period of a kid either going down the college route at 16 or getting a part time job or joining a motorcycle gang."
QB1: Beyond the Lights,That man did not even TRY to cover baby Ellie's ears.
QB1: Beyond the Lights,It was so weird listening to Ashley talk in the beginning. Couldn't unhear Ellie lol. Good scene though.
QB1: Beyond the Lights,Finally a ladder and boost sequence!
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"Man, that attack on the hospital was something else. I read a long time ago that a lot of times when people are about to do something awful like a terrorist attack or a shooting, they will mentally check out and kind of go into auto mode. I got that vibe from Joel during this episode and Pedro did an amazing job in this show."
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"I’m so curious to hear from you folks who haven’t played the game and/or didn’t know the story going in, what was your reaction to the hospital sequence and how do you feel about Joel as a character?"
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"Joel isn't concerned with being a good man or doing the ""right thing"", he's a father who won't go through losing a daughter again, the world be damned.

This is great television."
QB1: Beyond the Lights,Damn he cleared that level fast.
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"So much stuff in this episode hits hard, but weirdly hearing Ashley Johnson's voice and seeing how closely she resembles Bella Ramsey got me the most choked up. Ellie is one of my favorite characters from any medium, and seeing how well this series was able to tell her story was amazing."
QB1: Beyond the Lights,The sound editor was having a laugh when joel opened that fence gate.
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"lmao i heard the grunt/scream in the beginning and thought “wow, bella really sounds like ashley johnson there.” imagine my surprise 15 seconds later"
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"Ashley Johnson and Bella Ramsey actually look super similar, great choice and way to use her!"
QB1: Beyond the Lights,Omg Ellie lost her pack and her book from Riley 😢
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"Man, hbo has been in love with distressing child birth scenes lately"
QB1: Beyond the Lights,They nailed the Joel rampage scene. The scene where he kills the head doctor too. Absolutely perfect inbetween of game and tv show.
QB1: Beyond the Lights,So Ellie has the same origin as Blade?
QB1: Beyond the Lights,The scoundtrack for these scenes has me on edge. exceptional.
QB1: Beyond the Lights,Joel having that gun on auto aim really helped
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"Spock: The needs of the many outweigh the need...


Joel *shoots Spock in the God damn face*"
QB1: Beyond the Lights,The giraffe scene was everything I hoped for.
QB1: Beyond the Lights,Bella Ramsey fucking NAILED that last shot
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"I know so much of the musical cues the show has used are pulled directly from the game, and I don’t know that was was used in the episode are the same recording used in the game, or new recordings of the same compositions. 

But nevertheless, a huge round of applause for Gustavo Santaolalla this season.   The giraffe scene works as well as it does because how how that moment registers musically, and it translated fantastically for the show.   Same goes for the end….

….The question Ellie asks Joel (fast acoustic strumming faintly begins)…

…. Joel lies to Ellie (rapid strumming grows louder)…

….Ellie considers for several moments (strumming reaches it’s climax, and cuts out entirely into silence)….

“Okay”

(Acoustic riff and outro, with somber un-distorted electric guitar lead)"
QB1: Beyond the Lights,“It wasn’t time that did it”
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"It's wild seeing Ashley Johnson talking to her daughter Ellie, a character that she had a huge part in creating. 

That had to be a really interesting headspace as an actor"
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"Zero brick kills. 

0/10 adaptation, completely unfaithful /s"
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"It’s kinda interesting tidbit, they cut part of Bella’s discussion in the post discussion, but didn’t cut the subtitles. She says “the trauma Ellie faced in 109”. It means they filmed all the post credit stuff before HBO cut in and made the decision to merge episode 1 and 2 together. 109 references episode 108, which was supposed to be 109."
QB1: Beyond the Lights,They had the giraffe scene. That's all that matters
QB1: Beyond the Lights,My one critique is that nobody ever got killed by a brick.
QB1: Beyond the Lights,Didn't get any Jesus Joel or holy shit Joel out of ellie all season haha. At least they stuck with the puns and joke book. Good job HBO. Set the standard for video game adaptations in Hollywood.
QB1: Beyond the Lights,I can't be the only one who thinks it is absolutely ridiculous they were leaping all the way to brain surgery less than six hours after they found her.  There's only one of her.  You kill her she's dead.  Run some tests on her for weeks at the very least.  Learn the biology while she is living.  If surgery is the prudent path after all that then so be it.
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"Great Episode.  That was probably the fastest 40 mins of TV I have ever experienced. 

Would have liked another clicker scene (tunnel scene) but still fucking great.  Can't wait for season 2."
QB1: Beyond the Lights,Lol that one Firefly who legged it out of the hospital got so lucky.
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"Cant believe its over.I assume like HOTD, Andor and ROP this will be back in like 2 years at the earliest...Hope quality remains."
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"Nice to see Ashley Johnson (voice of Ellie in the games for people that don't know it) as Ellie's mother and a very important scene (if I'm not mistaken, we never knew why Ellie was really immune). Also I actually knew both of them but never made the link of how much Ashley Johnson (which doesn't look like her game counterpart) and Bella Ramsey look like each other. Totally credible for them to be daughter and mother.

Also they did put a ladder scene! 

And I thought Marlene died in Boston actually lol."
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"I'm so glad Ashley Johnson got a role in this. It was crazy to hear ellies voice giving birth to ellie, but she did a great job. Episode was very faithful to the game and to this day I'm still not sure how I feel about it haha."
QB1: Beyond the Lights,Bad adaptation. Joel didn't kill all the doctors in the room like he did when I played.
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"bella was a god damn rockstar this entire season. mazin and druckmann were really, really smart to center this series around her; she is absolutely capable of carrying this thing on through the next part of the narrative (which is going to be INTENSE)"
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"Giraffe 🦒 is there!!!! 🤗
Let’s see what else happens…"
QB1: Beyond the Lights,This show set the new bar for video game adaptations. And it's fucking high as shit now.
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"Joel’s rampage through the hospital was special. In different hands it would have come off as heroic, but here it felt tragic. It was watching a man turn into a force of nature ready to end the world to save his daughter. Amazing and haunting at the same time."
QB1: Beyond the Lights,First two secs I hadn’t looked up and thought “Oh Ellie starts the ep.” Then realized it was Ashley lol. Old habits die hard I guess
QB1: Beyond the Lights,Be interested to see what tv viewers who have never played the game think of the ending (namely Joel's decision and lying to Ellie).
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"When Joel said “It wasn’t time that did it.” And looked at Ellie, I started sobbing. 😭"
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"Good job Marlene. Don't welcome them with open arms, get them fed and warm and having a few days R&R in relative safety before having a conversation about the potential benefits, the risks and what they'll do to mitigate them. Instead rush one of them straight from a flashbang to the face into surgery in some dingy 20 year old operating theatre and tell the other one, who has crossed a fuckin continent filled with infected who want to kill him and people who want to kill him even more so you know he's got some serious dog in him, that you're doing all that seconds after he wakes from the flashing to the face and a nasty concussion. Superb leadership."
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"I'm surprised by how good that was. As someone who played the game, I finished the last episode in awe of how great ep 8 was but was concerned because I didn't think they'd be able to wrap it all up in just one episode, especially considering that the last episode is only 45 minutes. However, they wrapped it up beautifully.

As a whole, I think season 1 is great. The best parts are the first 3 episodes and the last 2. The middle 4 aren't quite as good as those five but even at its worst (ep 7), it's still not bad. I'd give s1 a 9/10. Can't wait for s2, which hopefully will be 2024 rather than 2025."
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"I would have sympathized more with Marlene if they had asked Ellie before killing her. 

Just like Joel said, he was ready to kill himself until he flinched....maybe Ellie would have been ready to sacrifice herself until she made it to the operation room."
QB1: Beyond the Lights,Seems like there should be more bike riding in this post apocalypse.
QB1: Beyond the Lights,stupid long horses
QB1: Beyond the Lights,[removed]
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"Not sure what the consensus is but I liked the hospital part more here than in the game for narrative purposes. In the game, you had to fight for survival and get back at those shooting at you. They showed Joel’s ruthlessness in the show more which displayed how he made this decision and basically murdered anyone trying to stop him. If they showed him struggling and being in trouble, you’d sympathize more with him but the fact that he just breezed past the fireflies without any remorse showed his dark side which makes the ending really more ambiguous."
QB1: Beyond the Lights,Can’t believe we hit the over on giraffes
QB1: Beyond the Lights,So Ellie's immunity was straight up like Blade's? Mother gets infected close to childbirth.
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"They absolutely crushed this episode (and season.) I was a little worried going into the finale that Joel was too ""likable hero guy"", but this episode did a lot to change that. Interested in hearing what non game fans think about him as a character going into next season."
QB1: Beyond the Lights,that douchebag didn't even attempt to cover her ears!
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"Didn't hold back at all from Joel murdering the entire goddamn Firefly org chart. Awesome.

Still rushed, but still the holy grail video game adaptation."
QB1: Beyond the Lights,I mean I loved this show but I can’t help but feel the whole thing was just *so* rushed. the first three episodes were paced perfectly and everything since then felt like constant whiplash and I don’t think the ending was nearly as earned as it was in the game.
QB1: Beyond the Lights,Ashley being Ellie's mom is absolutely perfect.
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"As a fan of the game, this episode was phenomenal, practically perfect in my eyes! Pretty much nailed the Salt Lake level, I’m so happy! What a fantastic adaption of one of my favorite games of all time!"
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"Joel killing the doctor with one single shot to the head just made no sense.

I always roasted his ass with the flamethrower like he was a marshmallow."
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"My only complaint is the trope that ""step 1 - scientist needs to kill patient to find a cure"". Even if that proved correct, a surgery that's gonna kill the patient should be the last resort. There should have been months of different tests performed on Ellie before reaching for the lethal surgery option. It's dumb for the fireflies to kill their only hope on the first try, and it's dumb of Joel not to advocate other tests first."
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"I’ll only say this about the episode. It’s a quote from a certain other Mazin production:

“*Every lie we tell incurs a debt to the truth. Sooner or later, that debt is paid*”"
QB1: Beyond the Lights,The actress who played Ellie's mom looks so much like Bella I thought we had flashed forward for a moment to a pregnant Ellie.
QB1: Beyond the Lights,[deleted]
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"You know if I had to nitpick on something they didn't show in the show that was in the game that would be Joel and Sarah's picture together. You see it in Sarah's room at the beginning iirc, then Tommy says he went back to Texas and tries to give it back to him but Joel refuses. So Ellie takes it without him knowing and then gives it back to him in the moment Joel reveals he tried to commit suicide in the show, only then he accepts it.

I mean they did it differently here letting Joel tell directly to Ellie that she's the one that cured him, but the photo was a nice subtle touch. Him taking it signified that he made peace with his past and could finally allow the memory of his lost daughter to be with him without hiding it in the back of his head, but it is what it is. Not seeing it once more will make Part II hurt a little less"
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"I wanna point out the scene where they're talking and Joel says ""it wasn't time that healed it"". They followed the rule of not insulting the audience by not stating the obvious ""it was Ellie"", and I really appreciated that."
QB1: Beyond the Lights,unreal this is airing during the Oscars
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"Holy fucking shit, is Ellie immune because her mother got bit just before she cut the cord? It might have meant the cordyceps transferred to her but only a tiny amount or something, giving her some kind of genetic predisposition to immunity. I know Ellie’s mom says she cut the cord beforehand, but she only noticed the bite after the birth, there’s no way she could have known for sure and she’d say anything to protect her child. Maybe I’m looking too much into it though, but if that’s true that’s a wild revelation for both the game and the series."
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"I've never played the game but I'm curious - do they do the same thing with ""ok let's cut her brain out""?

I feel like that was a really stupid choice and I'm not sure if I should blame the writers or the characters. You have someone who is immune and instead of starting with things like blood tests/transfusions they just go right to cutting out her brain?

No extracting of cerebrospinal fluid, bone marrow, plasma, nothing. Just carve up her brain?

This is the most important and valuable person the planet. Their body holds the key to everything. I don't understand how you go right to killing her which means if anything gets fucked up you've now ruined your one shot. I'm talking from a pragmatic standpoint - it makes zero sense."
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"The behind the scenes addition to the episode is amazing. The conundrum Joel feels about having to save humanity or save Ellie, and the moral consequences of both"
QB1: Beyond the Lights,Can’t believe Joel didn’t beat someone’s head in with a brick. Brick cameo would have made this 10/10
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"Anyone else feel like they kind of rushed that ending? 

Can’t help but feel like the pacing of every scene felt better in the game, and I’m talking even a cutscenes only version"
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"Looking back, I do think the lack of zombies in the show makes it seem like perhaps a cure wasn't even super necessary. would have been a bit more impactful if you had a clear idea of how fucking bad things still are without one"
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"12-13 episodes would have been perfect for this show

building their relationship more as well as giving more time to david and jackson would have elevated this show"
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"Maybe I missed something but what's not clear to me was whether or not they knew for sure operating on Ellie was going to lead to the cure... 

The way it was presented it seemed like they thought or had a theory and was going into Ellie's brain to test that theory out.... which if that's the case seems like a very risky thing to do on a hunch! 

If you have this very rare thing like a cure in the only human you know where it exists you might want to only kill her when you have more info than a theory... maybe the game fleshed it out more but thought this part was rushed through and the ending fell a bit flat as a result.."
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"So I haven't played the game, for what that's worth on how it affects my thoughts on the show.

I'm gonna go a little against the grain here and say that, while I definitely appreciate what they were going for, the ending didn't quite land with me. It just felt like things moved a little too fast, the bombshells of the episode were a little too abrupt. Like I barely had time to process and have things sink in before the show was moving onto the next thing.

Not to say it was bad; like I said, I appreciate what it was going for. And I applaud the commitment to having the main ""hero"" go on a chilling massacre like that at the end, but I felt oddly... detached from it, in a way?

I dunno. Overall, I'd rank the show as pretty good, with moments of greatness here and there (pretty much anything pre-outbreak, the acting in general, Sam & Henry).

It'll be interesting watching the upvotes/downvotes on this comment for the next day or so lol."
QB1: Beyond the Lights,Holy shit Joel
QB1: Beyond the Lights,Marlene had so many opportunities to kill Joel. This is her fault as much as his.
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"Something tells me Ellie isn't buying Joel's massive lie........welp gotta wait a year or two before seeing that catch up to him.

Do wish it wasn't just 45 mins though, it was quick!"
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"I was worried this would end flat given how short the episode is for a finale, but they make great use of the time."
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"Ellie got her autonomy taken by both Marlene and Joel. Oof. I get why he did it but dang. I have conflicting feelings. I love Joel but....him lying to Ellie really broke my heart.

I'm sure there's other doctors out there...."
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"Haven't played or read anything about the game but liked the show a lot. Great start and ending, middle episodes kinda forgettable. 

Needed another ep or 2 to transition Joel from stoic guy doing a task to becoming this super father figure all of a sudden. A lot of it happens offscreen because of the long timeskips during travel.

Ep 8 was the best imo. 

Needed to show a bit more mushroom people to drive home the threat. 

Hospital fight seemed quite rushed, would have liked to see Joel pull some tricks out of the bag to get through there alive. As it is it looks like he shoulda taken a few bullets at least. 

Hospital shooting is also a little less dark because the fireflies handled it terribly. If they were super accomodating and tried everything before chopping into her brain (with her consent) the shootout would have been proper dark. Even more so if we'd had a full episode of the fireflies being kind and upbeat about the possibility of a cure, trying everything, then Joel going on a rampage after all that."
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"I really enjoyed the show, but I was left wanting more of everything.  They should've split the first game into two seasons, or at the very least given us a longer season to tell the story.  If we had more time with Joel and Ellie traveling together, fighting infected and raiders, and just generally bonding with one another, the payoff in the finale would've been way more effective.  And I'm not saying Joel needs to be killing people on-screen every few minutes, but there honestly wasn't enough of him being this unrelenting killer with the sole focus of keeping Ellie safe.

Also, I was disappointed Joel only killed the doctor in the operating room.  In the game, I killed everyone in the room just to make extra sure no one could come after Ellie and carry on the doctor's work.

It was nice to see Ashley Johnson cameo as Ellie's mom, especially after Troy Baker made an appearance last week."
QB1: Beyond the Lights,Joel Wick
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"As great as this episode was, i cant help but feel like they rushed it a bit, and the season in general has had some weird pacing issues, theres just too much compressed into too short a period of time, could have really done with another episode."
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"Overall, I enjoyed the show. I don't ever expect adaptations to be page for page or direct translations because each medium is different. A TV show isn't going to be a video game. With that said though, I don't think the show was nearly as good or as succinct in telling its story as the game was.

The major issue is that Joel and Ellie's journey felt both shorter and easier in the show. They're fighting fucking tooth and nail in the game, and having to see them experience all of that brutality really hits home how much they had to endure by the time you reach the Fireflies. There's also such a clear contrast in how Joel goes from being completely walled off to treating Ellie like a daughter, whereas in the show he always seems to just kind of get along with her.

I really think the show could have done with being 12 episodes so that it could have included not only more action, but more opportunity to let some of these moments breathe. I'm looking forward to season 2, but I feel like the story in TLOU2 is an even harder story to adapt than the first game. Hopefully they'll do it justice."
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"Things happened so fast. As someone who hasn't played the game, we see Joel and Ellie looking for the hospital and in a matter of like >5 minutes: Fireflies capture Joel and Ellie, Joel is laid up in a hospital bed and presented with sacrificing Ellie for a cure to potentially ""save"" the world, and Joel has already begun murdering people. It's such a massive decision and it wasn't given nearly enough time to let Joel/the audience weigh the moral ramifications or fully process the dilemma before the decision was set in motion. The pacing has been a problem all season. The show presented several ""payoff"" moments this season that felt hollow and unearned because they weren't given enough time to build. It's a shame because the show does a lot of other things right: The leads are great and well casted, the sets and scenery are beautifully shot, and the Frank episode was masterclass. That said, after watching the first season, It's a good show, but it could be great and I just can't help but feel a little underwhelmed."
QB1: Beyond the Lights,Joel went buck nasty
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"I liked the episode, but did anyone else find baby Ellie just unexpectedly being on the floor fully delivered in .5 seconds when her mother looks away extremely goofy lmao?"
QB1: Beyond the Lights,I LOVE how offhandedly Joel kills the Doctor despite how heavy the implication of that action is.
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"I love the game, and have really enjoyed the first season of the show, but these last two episodes have felt so fast, too fast, for me. The chapter of the story in last week's episode could have been told over two episodes, and this week's finale being the shortest episode of the season so far feels a little egregious in terms of the pacing.

I didn't think it was in any way a bad episode of television, but after the flashback intro, it was basically about 20-25 minutes between Joel and Ellie arriving and the end of Joel's rampage. I don't really understand why they couldn't have made this first season 12 episodes and taken just a few hours more to tell the story, it's such a well made, written and acted show that it's hard to believe it would have damaged the overall quality of it to do that.

They now have the choice to either jump into the events of Part II in season 2 or create an original season of episodes that bridges the gap to it, but if they do go straight into adapting Part II, I hope they take more time to tell that story."
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"Joel made the right choice. 

The Fireflies had no clue what they were doing. Why would you kill the only known person immune to the fungus? You don't want to do blood tests or observations first? 

Their whole plan was stupid."
QB1: Beyond the Lights,Great casting for the actress who played Ellie’s mother. They look so much alike that I wasn’t sure if it was a flash forward or flash back at first.
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"It’s hard to remove my knowledge of the games from this but I definitely feel like they didn’t capture the love Joel has for her as well. So I’m curious how people who just watched the show thought of that. 

It could also be my knowledge of part 2 that builds on their relationship and I’m ultimately being unfair."
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"Episode 7 should've been cut and released at a later time as a TV Special (it was DLC for a reason). I think it would've made the reveal of Ellie's first kill much more impactful in the finale, and it would've somewhat improved the pacing of the show."
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"This is not me complaining, I love the discourse, I'm just putting in my rambling, disjointed 2 cents:

Just like back in 2013, far, far too many people talking about how the fireflies weren't competent enough, or wouldn't have been able to synthesize a cure, or the cure didn't seem essential because the show had only a few infected, therefore Joel would've been justified in his ""decision"".

It's all post hoc, ergo proptor hoc reasoning. I believe it's mostly for people to excuse or rationalize what Joel did because they can't accept the creator's intent that what Joel did was monstrous, and was wrong from many points of view. It was the only thing he could do as someone who has been through what he's been through. There was no ""decision"" to be made. Joel did the only thing a father could. Protect his world. All else be damned.

Unconditional love is a scary, ruthless, primal, SELFISH thing - that's the message of that finale. The point isn't anywhere in the same postal code as the logistics of making a cure, or whether or not the fireflies were ""right"" - It doesn't matter if they should've, could've, did, or didn't do a biopsy or MRI or whatever. **All of that should be as meaningless to the audience as it is to Joel.**

Because at the end of it all, his relationship with Ellie is the focal point of the series - a relationship that is now tarnished by a massive lie. To borrow a relevant line from another Mazin masterpiece:

""Every lie we tell incurs debt to the truth. Sooner or later this debt is paid.""

That's the emotional thrust that punctuates the end of this season."
QB1: Beyond the Lights,Wow. Ashley killed it and god damn if I don’t buy they are mother and daughter
QB1: Beyond the Lights,That guy throwing the flash grenade scared the shit out of me lol
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"This episode was perfect, the giraffe scene made me feel very emotional. Would not have wanted it to end any other way then cutting to black at the end."
QB1: Beyond the Lights,I mean they went straight to her brain?  Not even some blood tests first lol?
QB1: Beyond the Lights,in my opinion they tried to show the numbness of the hospital scene that almost a knee jerk reaction to how Joel's daughter was ripped from his arm that he feel so helpless. I think he projected a lot of his anger for not doing everything he can and entrusting his fate and of his daughter at the hand of another (army man) . This time he have made his mind up no matter the cost of life to others he will save Ellie. That is why the scene after he seemed unhinged and draws many comparison to his daughter.
QB1: Beyond the Lights,"Joel, going through the grieving process with Sarah still, may have been clouded with his decision in the killing of Marlene and the fireflies but holding on to Ellie was his only reason to live now.....such a conflicting finale!"
Sachiiro no One Room,"There are definitely people who watch Ted Lasso in the UK, but I could count on one hand the number of people I know who subscribe to Apple TV (despite me talking all the time about how much I love Apple TV shows)"
Sachiiro no One Room,I don’t know anyone in Montana that watches Yellowstone either.
Sachiiro no One Room,"A lot of Brits think Ted Lasso is too American, also. They think it feels like a kids show."
Sachiiro no One Room,"I’m from Denmark, and I didn’t even really use my free period of Apple TV because you couldn’t use the app with chromecast. They have some interesting looking shows, and I would like to watch season 2 of The Morning Show, but I don’t want to watch it on my computer."
Sachiiro no One Room,">Only 8.7% of homes with a streaming service in the U.K. (1.69 million) even subscribe to Apple TV+

Actually surprised it's that many. I don't know anyone who's subscribed to Apple TV here. Got way too many competing streaming services."
Sachiiro no One Room,"What about Slow Horses? It’s ostensibly a British spy show, but even without having watched many British spy shows it feels somewhat American-ized."
Sachiiro no One Room,We watch it.
Sachiiro no One Room,"From the UK, watched it, loved it, got a bunch of people from work into it."
Sachiiro no One Room,No one?  Not a single person?
Sachiiro no One Room,"As an avid football fan from the UK, I don't think there's a show I've ever equally loved/hated as much as Ted Lasso.

The big pro is that when it's funny, it's extremely funny. Not many shows have made me belly laugh as much and I love characters like Kent, Higgins & Coach Beard. 

However, as someone else brilliantly put it, it just gets too aggressively nice at times. I get they want to have a heart at the show but my God it feels like a sugar overdose at times. I suppose us Irish/Brits are a more cynical bunch than those across the pond but even still, they really lay it on too thick where it just doesn't feel enjoyable.

With regards to the actual football content; I can forgive some inaccuracies; it's made for an American audiences and I don't expect it to be bang on correct. However, there's some elements which just seem like lazy writing. I don't think anything irked me as much as the whole wonderkid/wunderkind Nate arc last season. I don't know ANYONE in the UK who says wunderkind; wonderkid is far more commonly used so that whole bit just felt completely wrong and out of place."
Sachiiro no One Room,"I too waited far too long to get Apple TV, signed up for three months, watched everything and then canceled. They’ve got good shows, including Ted Lasso. Will resign up soon for a month just to catch up on new seasons."
Sachiiro no One Room,Those brits who say that are wrong because I watch it in the UK
Sachiiro no One Room,"Why should they? Just because a show is set there doesn't mean they should have special interest in it. I imagine lots of Ted's ""Americans know nothing about the UK"" jokes are just eyeroll inducing. Especially if you already heard them the first time when NBC did their commercials with him. It's kind of amazing how much of his season 1 shtick was lifted straight from those."
Sachiiro no One Room,"We will sub for one month watch Ted Lasso then leave, its a fantastic show on a crappy service."
Sachiiro no One Room,"They basically asked people in one pub their thoughts but yeah hardly anyone has Apple TV. Netflix has more content, prime comes with a lot of other stuff. apple TV, paramount+ discovery+ etc is all overkill"
Sachiiro no One Room,"For every gem there is soooooo much bad British TV, corny, bland 70s era crap about celebrities getting lost on islands, people eating, people baking, z list celebrities dancing, etc."
Sachiiro no One Room,I’m British and everyone I know has seen it.
Sachiiro no One Room,Its shit that’s why
Sachiiro no One Room,"People in the UK get gouged on subscriptions, so it's not a surprise that no one has Apple TV. 

Ted Lasso is great, but it also comes across as a very American-focused show intended for an American audience, so I'm sure that factors into why Brits haven't latched onto it like so many others."
Sachiiro no One Room,Don’t sleep on Trying and Slow Horses too. One of the best shows from Apple.
Sachiiro no One Room,"Can't speak for the UK, but in Portugal I don't know anyone that has Apple TV either. Netflix is by far the dominant streaming platform here, followed by Disney+ I believe. Amazon Prime took too long to come here, HBO Max as well."
Sachiiro no One Room,You cant even get apple tv up on most smart tvs. I have to get it up through xbox its so dumb of them
Sachiiro no One Room,This article is fucking weird. So it's Apple TV Plus's fault that Brits don't subscribe to it as much? It's available there to subscribe to and no one is blocking it.... Wtf do they want? More marketing??
Sachiiro no One Room,"I am British and I am fully obsessed with Ted Lasso. Like, 'have written fanfiction and own a #9 Tartt AFC Richmond shirt' obsessed."
Sachiiro no One Room,I subscribe to apple tv literally just for this show. Its worth it
Sachiiro no One Room,I got 2 or 3 free months of Apple TV+ thanks to Game Pass and I couldn't find any show or movie worth watching.
Sachiiro no One Room,I had a free 12 months or whatever for buying an Apple device and I ended up not watching a single thing on there. Not sure why... just nothing hooked me in and I had about 5 other services to choose from.
Sachiiro no One Room,"I know plenty of people that watch it or at least tried it. They have literally been giving away ATV+ for free here in the UK since it came out until just recently. First it was a free year with apple devices that got extended then it was free 6/12 with broadband and phone subscriptions then retailers started giving it away too. Currys had one going for ages where you'd get a 6 month code with purchases, it didn't need to be expensive TV purchases either you could just buy something cheap like a hdmi cable. There were more than that, it was everywhere."
Sachiiro no One Room,Yeah there’s almost no chance I’ll ever get ATV+
Sachiiro no One Room,"First season was ok, I couldn't get passed 2 episodes of the second season, 80% of the characters were (excuse the french) retards and honestly couldn't give a shit about the football."
Sachiiro no One Room,"I’ve recently started watching it, mainly because AppleTV seems desperate for me to watch it. A couple of episodes in, I’m not particularly impressed."
Sachiiro no One Room,"Huh I'm surprised anyone in the UK watches it since it makes a lot of very lazy jokes about America vs England and soccer/football that I thought would've had Brits rolling their eyes. Not to mention Americans coming in and succeeding at a British thing. 

But I suppose the show has enough charm to appeal to anyone it seems"
Sachiiro no One Room,"Hard to argue with it. Like Apple TV just has no incentive in the UK or Ireland. The main competitors in streaming over here are Netflix, Disney+(which has Hulu content at no extra cost), Amazon & NowTV. And 2 of those have live sport. Anything outside or even including those services, people will just pirate or get on a dodgy box. 

It's not even unique to Ted, Bad Sisters is an all Irish cast & I've not even watched it yet cause my Apple trial expired. It's just gonna be hard for any service outside of those big 4 to succeed here."
Sachiiro no One Room,It's probably similar in Germany. You need a credit card to sign up for AppleTV+ and people just don't use credit cards here. You can pay for Netflix and Disney+ with Paypal.
Sachiiro no One Room,It's just a sweary Hollyoaks really
Sachiiro no One Room,Nobody watches Ted Lasso in the USA either
Sachiiro no One Room,I saw it on a flight once. It was very 'meh'.
Sachiiro no One Room,"I watch Ted Lasso but like all yankee made shows it depicts London as a quasi magical land. Brett Goldstein gives it a touch of authenticity but lol, it's so ridiculous"
Sachiiro no One Room,I saw a clip of it they played as advertising during the Liverpool v Manchester United game on Sunday. The Roy Kent character acting was so woeful and it's obviously done for laughs but I wouldn't want to watch it.
Sachiiro no One Room,"Plus, it's fucking rubbish"
Sachiiro no One Room,"I'd like to try Apple TV but Apple makes it unreasonably difficult. Forgot the password to my Apple-ID and since a few years back I don't have any Apple products so I can't reset the password for some inexplicable reason. Verifying with email and phone number apparently isn't enough. Apple won't reset the password for weeks.

Remember when Gabe Newell said piracy is a service problem?"
Sachiiro no One Room,"Like most of the Apple TV shows that are raved about, I just couldn't get into it. Wasn't for me and that's fine. I can count on one hand the Apple TV shows I've enjoyed enough to watch a season through to the end  (or more).

There is some great looking stuff on horizon though so I'm looking forward to that. Getting Apple TV for free when purchasing devices also helps.

EDIT: I should add the few shows of theirs I enjoyed, I've REALLY enjoyed and would probably rave about so I get it :)"
Sachiiro no One Room,My love for Roy was beaten by my hate for Nate. I can’t see myself going back for Season 3
Sachiiro no One Room,"Meh, I’ve cancelled all streaming services.  Back to the old ways until it’s convenient again."
Sachiiro no One Room,Most of my watching is on my phone. Apple TV doesn't have an android app and their iOS app doesn't run on my iPad mini. Only reason I can't justify subscribing.
Sachiiro no One Room,"Apple TV is great, and so is Ted Lasso. If this article is to be believed then brits are missing out.. not only on Ted lasso but a ton of their other original content"
Sachiiro no One Room,"Meh, AppleTV+ is the weakest service, but I think they're the only one with growth going forward."
Sachiiro no One Room,I don’t watch it. And I’m in the good old US of A.
Sachiiro no One Room,Doesn’t matter.  We enjoy it here.
Sachiiro no One Room,"Makes sense. Ted Lasso might be good, might be bad, but people in this country don't have as much disposable income/attention span to be having eight fucking streaming services all on the go like people in America do."
Sachiiro no One Room,"What I find crazy about Apple TV is the fact it's not available on android smart TVs or devices. I got a 6 month free period last year and the only way to use it was on a PC, an Apple product (I don't own any) or through a games console. 

There were some good shows but the fact that it was a hassle to watch on my phone and that I couldn't really explain to my parents how to use the PS5 so they could watch it on our TV meant I would never consider actually paying for a subscription. I understand they want to get people into the 'Apple ecosystem' but I don't see the point of limiting your market for your streaming service when their good shows could easily attract people who don't usually purchase Apple products."
Sachiiro no One Room,Not heard of it. Is it worth a watch?
Sachiiro no One Room,I'll consider getting Apple TV+ once they provide Chromecast support. It's absolutely ludicrous that they are the only streaming platform that doesn't.
Sachiiro no One Room,Them Brits be missing out
Sachiiro no One Room,"This is one of the prime examples of a TV series that the fans actually make the show worse.  If you peek into the ted lasso subreddit you will find that the deep navel gazing the show encourages is profoundly part of that fandom.  

There are a handful of things where the fans ruin it, and Ted Lasso is part of it, just don't engage with the fandom."
Sachiiro no One Room,"That is Apple for you. I don't know why people support that shit company. They lock your phones and don't allow any customization, can't even get a fucking ad blocker lmao. Everything they do with their products is to make it harder for you to get what you want. And then they will offer what you should have got free for a price that is inflated. You can't even repair your own apple products lmao. GARBAGE, this doesn't surprise me at all. they only care about squeezing every cent they can out of you."
Sachiiro no One Room,I don’t watch Ted Lasso because it sucks. Slow Horses on the other hand 👌.
Sachiiro no One Room,"We don’t either. That severance, and after party are the only good shows so we get the 7day trial or get the 6month trial with our cell provider, watch then cancel. Sadly you can’t use the same Apple ID to get a the free 3-6 month trials."
Sachiiro no One Room,"Ted Lasso is worth watching just for the bit where the guy smells the little girl's breath after telling his girlfriend to stop being so harsh, she's just a kid.  Then he's barely able to mutter that he thinks she must be dying because it's so bad"
Sachiiro no One Room,AppleTV+ is brilliant the content is high quality and not spammed full of crap like netflix and messy amazon. Quality over quantity and Ted lasso is for sure Quality
Sachiiro no One Room,"All streaming services should show all shows and then pay the owner of the IP for views.

Change my mind.

You know what, dont, fuck you, I am right."
Sachiiro no One Room,"If it’s like Apple TV+ in Canada, they have like a dozen shows and that’s about it. Thousands of hours of other movies and shows are locked behind rental or purchase fees. It’s fucking stupid compared to Prime or Netflix."
Sachiiro no One Room,I watched whilst on Apple TV free period
Sachiiro no One Room,[deleted]
Sachiiro no One Room,It's too wholesome for the UK to enjoy
Sachiiro no One Room,"Isn't the most well known British TV show still Benny Hill


**Cue Yackety Sax 🎶**"
Sachiiro no One Room,"I'm British and I don't watch British TV. This show sucked balls when I tried to watch it. Nothing especially bad about British TV, it's the same everywhere. Money-making, lowest common denominator, ""stuff between the adverts"" from all TV companies now, with the odd exception, and Ted Lasso ain't one."
Sachiiro no One Room,">~~Brits say~~ no one watches 'Ted Lasso' ~~in the UK~~ and Apple TV Plus is to blame

If there was Razzie for the worst marketing team of all time, Apple's team would won lifetime achievement in it. They are so fcking bad at selling their own shows, they make WB's terrible marketing look good"
Sachiiro no One Room,"I do! 

Via torrents :/"
Sachiiro no One Room,No one? Not one single Brit?
Sachiiro no One Room,"Worst streaming app, just another Apple portal to rob you"
Sachiiro no One Room,Severance is great
Sachiiro no One Room,"I love Ted Lasso, I know loads of people that have seen it"
Sachiiro no One Room,"Loads of people watch Ted Lasso in the UK. Their viewership is unlikely to be included in the official figures though, m'hearties."
Sachiiro no One Room,"I subscribe to it like once a year and watch a bunch of stuff in one month if possible, then cancel again."
Sachiiro no One Room,Shane.  I watch from the UK.   Ted Lasso is a brilliant show
Sachiiro no One Room,"I won’t watch Ted Lasso season 3, and Ted Lasso season 2 is to blame."
Sachiiro no One Room,"Most people in the UK I know that have seen Ted Lasso or Severance pirated it. I subscribe to Apple cause I like their shows, but I completely understand how people feeling the crunch right now may want to limit how many subscription services they have. Appletv recently put its prices up too."
Sachiiro no One Room,"Severance and Ted Lasso are amazing I hope they keep coming with shows of that quality.

Mythic Quest is ok kinda going down hill imo"
Sachiiro no One Room,"I watched Ted Lasso in the UK but only had Apple for the three month trial and one month paid. Ran out of things to watch. Cancelled it.  I'll probably resub for a few months to binge watch some stuff at some point. No way it's worthy of an annual sub. 

Currently have 2 months left of Disney+ that came as a freebie with a new phone. Definitely not paying for that."
Sachiiro no One Room,"Yeah agreed, I do think it will slowly start to turn up there. Apple TV is cheap and making more and more good shows every month"
Sachiiro no One Room,What about Trying? Or was that streamed through BBC over there ?
Sachiiro no One Room,The argument around B.A.R.B is nonsense. There is *one* Netflix streaming program that has made their top 50 since they started including it four months ago - Wednesday - and that's it. The only other (Scripted) streaming program to make BARB prior was Obi-Wan. Ted is not exactly the most watched show on US TV either.
Sachiiro no One Room,It never snows in the TV show. It never doesn't snow in Montana.
Sachiiro no One Room,"I refuse to watch an episode, out of pure spite at this point"
Sachiiro no One Room,It is quite cheesy and the second season does lay it on a bit thick.
Sachiiro no One Room,As a Brit from what I can see optimism is something we have a love/hate relationship with. Despite outwardly appearing miserable af I really love positive entertainment like Ted Lasso/Parks and Rec/Star Trek and wackier comedy but a lot of Brits see it as childish.
Sachiiro no One Room,"I get why people like it but it’s just very very aggressively nice, and there’s barely any football."
Sachiiro no One Room,As a Brit it looks like an Americans impression of British football and small town life. Which is always way off the mark.
Sachiiro no One Room,It's an easy watch I enjoy it but I don't quite get why it's won so many awards. Feel like Apple just bought their awards
Sachiiro no One Room,"A kid's show? Every other word out of Roy Kent's mouth is ""fuck"". What are kid's shows like in the UK?"
Sachiiro no One Room,"As an (english) avid football fan, the thing that took me out of it was that the ""footballers"" just don't look like...footballers

I'm just so used to knowing what PL footballers look like after watching the sport since the late 90s, and Brett Goldstein & whoever plays that Jamie Tart just require too much suspension of disbelief for me to buy in. I know its not really about the football but the whole thing comes of as so kiddy like you said, and the lack of immersion plays into that"
Sachiiro no One Room,"Am British, disagree on both points"
Sachiiro no One Room,"The script is so horribly American it really makes me cringe in places. Either the cast should have said that isn't how we talk, or the director should've listened to the cast if they did say something."
Sachiiro no One Room,"I don’t mind Ted Lasso, while season 2 was a dip in quality it still has its moments and I’ll watch season 3. 

That said, I’m fairly convinced that the vast majority of people that love Ted Lasso are either American or don’t like football. It’s very much British football culture as you might find it presented at Disneyland. Vaguely recognisable but safely sanitised and with all the sharp edges smoothed out for a wholesome family from Iowa to enjoy."
Sachiiro no One Room,I can’t stand Ted Lasso but all my friends are obsessed. I was starting to feel like there was something wrong with me lol.
Sachiiro no One Room,It’s sickly sweet; way too American
Sachiiro no One Room,I must have missed that survey
Sachiiro no One Room,I’m a Brit who hates football and I love Ted Lasso
Sachiiro no One Room,That and the cultural appropriation / mockery of our indigenous ways.
Kath and Kim,it's nice it's different it's unusual
Kath and Kim,Look at muhee....I LOVE it!
Kath and Kim,"No new episodes, but gina riley and jane turner are still working! i've seen gina riley in Please like me most recently. 
Kath and Kim is an absolute treasure, and has great rewatch value! so great to see it on netflix now. 

We do not speak of the american version."
Kath and Kim,"*KUMMMMUUUYYYY.....*

Its on Netflix and I still watch it far too often."
Kath and Kim,It’s an amazing show but unfortunately I don’t think there’s any more planned.
Kath and Kim,"Seeing how there’s an Uber eats ad making the rounds that makes me want to kill myself every time it comes on, yes I think I do remember that show."
Kath and Kim,Are u taking about the Original Australian version or the US remake?
Kath and Kim,Terrible show
Kath and Kim,"> Does anyone else love the **Australian show** Kath & Kim?? 

Not sure if it was edited it in later, but definitely Australian one."
Kath and Kim,Especially since nobody liked the US remake.
Kath and Kim,"I'm an Aussie, of course I liked the original. The US remake started out as awful but after a few episodes when it found itself, became it's own thing, found it's versions of the characters. It actually was pretty decent. Unfortunately, everyone had stopped watching by then.

It may not hold up now, but I stuck with it and just remember it becoming its own thing and actually pretty good."
Kath and Kim,"I don't think there's a name for it. Maybe the word would be 'zany', and the opposite would be 'grounded' comedy, where the world and situations are more commonplace and ordinary. 

I think sitcoms usually exist on a spectrum between 'ordinary characters coping with ridiculous situations' (Liz Lemon in 30 Rock, most of the time) and 'ridiculous characters making ordinary situations insane' (George in Seinfeld)."
Kath and Kim,"It may not have a common name.  I would describe it as hyperbolic, character-centric office sitcom, but if you're looking for a keyword to search on, I really don't know.  It's a good question.  Found [this](https://blogs.weta.org/tellyvisions/2013/09/06/missing-it-crowd-here-are-some-workplace-sitcoms-you-should-watch-instead) though."
Kath and Kim,I think surreal or absurdist could be the words you're looking for?
Kath and Kim,They could probably be described as something like an “off the wall” comedy. The IT Crowd is closer to a classic sitcom though.
Kath and Kim,"I'd go with ""satire"", and I think it's a fun word you might enjoy researching - there are many things under that long-used umbrella term (from parody to poop!)"
Kath and Kim,"I'd call it caricature comedy. But I'm sure it's not the actual name, if there is an official name for the genre."
Kath and Kim,I would also add Kimmy Schmidt and the good place to this list
Kath and Kim,Funny?
Kath and Kim,Also Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia
Kath and Kim,"I call it cringe comedy. 

I don't think Scrubs fits though. It's much more traditional."
Kath and Kim,[deleted]
Kath and Kim,The Office and New Girl definitely both use cringe comedy as well.
Kath and Kim,I agree but The IT Crowd didn't seem like it fit in with the other shows listed.
Kath and Kim,"I have a hyphen in my name and it is surprising the amount of companies that can't even handle that. I could be in the system with a hyphen, them separating my name at that point with a blank,  adding the two parts together, making the first part of the hyphenated name my first name and the second the last name, and a bunch of other ridiculous things"
Kath and Kim,"I’ve always felt very represented by Cookie Monster and Oscar the Grouch. 

It’s nice to see kids feeling represented by new puppets."
Kath and Kim,I guess I always thought the point of muppets being weirdly shaped and colored was so that nobody would feel excluded because they're not any ethnicity.
Kath and Kim,Love Sesame Street 🥰
Kath and Kim,"My wife got a huge kick out of this when she first heard it. As a Korean artist named Jiyoung, it hit really close to home."
Kath and Kim,What’s the significance of the hyphen?
Kath and Kim,"Alan, a Japanese-American human, has owned Mr. Hooper's Store since 1998.

Kath and Kim,"Ironically, in the interview video in the article, the closed captions didn't spell Ji-Young's name correctly even once, but every other name and word was spelled correctly. In fact, the captions wrote it wrong in a different way every single time. I don't think it's automatic captions because they were accurate for every other word!

Kath and Kim,Kids have to learn racism in the first place. People are just people to them before that.
Kath and Kim,Bring back the AIDS puppet you cowards.
Kath and Kim,"I was one of the first generation to grow up on Sesame Street. Growing up in rural Canada (or white Canada) Sesame Street was the first time I actually saw people of colour, and hispanics. Having a variety of characters, of a variety of ethnic backgrounds helps all kids learn about the world around us."
Kath and Kim,This made me smile. I didn’t notice until now that there wasn’t Asian representation in the muppets. Happy to see this change. I hope all who read this have a good day.
Kath and Kim,"This is cool, but I thought all the puppets where just monsters.  When did they start making puppets of ethnicities?  Usually kids on the show where actual children."
Kath and Kim,"I always remembered Minh from Barney, she was from the Philippines! In my predominantly white neighborhood I had never met an Asian person at the time, as a small child, and Minh was my first exposure to non white or black people."
Kath and Kim,"that’s great but can we have more south asian representation? Everyone’s up about “asian representation” when they’re really talking about East asians. White people really think Indians, Pakistanis, Bengalis, etc are part of their own continent."
Kath and Kim,Ji-Young is so adorable! Sesame Street being awesome as it always has.
Kath and Kim,"This is great, but do people believe the that representation for Sesame Street was too white? I've never identified with a giant yellow bird, a green trashcan monster, a blue googley-eyed cookie addict, a purple vampire, etc. The puppets have always been pretty ambiguous."
Kath and Kim,"As a Korean American with a hyphenated name, this is the stupidest shit I’ve ever read."
Kath and Kim,">It makes us as the Asian American diaspora feel finally seen and validated.""

Because this lady speaks for all asian Americans . . /s"
Kath and Kim,"Why is it the ethnic puppets are all very ethnic, but there ae no “white” puppets? The other people puppets are all purple and green and orange and blue. The most “white person” puppet is Prairie Dawn and I don’t think they use her these days. The whole point was ro have “anybody” puppets. 

I got nothing against Koreans or Korean puppets, but it does seem to go one way. 

Also, ever notice that autistic characters in kids programs have dead eyes?"
Kath and Kim,[deleted]
Kath and Kim,"Wow People are upset with this in comments and I find it funny…cause they didn’t have a problem with Bert and Earnie being gay with white personas. Go figure they just hating on race

Sesame Street wasn’t made for racist it’s actually a liberal program. Conservatives can blow off watch or create your own hillbilly hate programming for kids"
Kath and Kim,"As a Korean, the Cookie Monster was my dude. Guess thats why I like Death Metal now."
Kath and Kim,More female puppets! More diversity! Yay!
Kath and Kim,The show lost its impact when every puppet had to represent a minority group for some woke cause imo
Kath and Kim,"This is what the Asian community needed to feel validated?  A fucking Sesame St puppet with a hyphen in its name?  

I really really wish people could be black for just a day.  Sure would change some perspectives."
Kath and Kim,Don't teach your children to rely on external validation.
Kath and Kim,Sesame Street does so much good in the world.
Kath and Kim,"What are you talking about… We Asians have always been seen and validated, what cave have you been hiding in?"
Kath and Kim,"since when do muppets have ethnicities.

they're different colours. not race colours lol"
Kath and Kim,"Smarter, stronger, kinder"
Kath and Kim,"ok, I gotta say...it never occurred to me before today that Muppets were supposed to have race.  

which are the white ones?"
Kath and Kim,Aren’t children on Sesame Street normally played by real kids and the puppets are monster characters?
Kath and Kim,Just cast the best puppet for the role. /s
Kath and Kim,I’m confused I thought the puppets on Sesame Street were without race
Kath and Kim,"Seen and validated? That’s rich. My (real) name has been butchered my whole life, it’s not a matter of being “seen and validated”, it’s more about people being careless and sloppy."

Kath and Kim,"I am an American with a hyphenated name. My parents were being “trendy” in the 90s I guess but as an adult I still have to look at my ID to remember how to spell it correctly. It’s been just a quirk in my life, never really thought about bigger implications like this. Good on ya Sesame Street!"
Kath and Kim,"oh for cryin outloud lol. this is becoming so silly… indians are outraged at Apu, Korean’s are overjoyed by this puppet… what are writers supposed to do, write *more* or *less* diverse characters? And more importantly, why are arbitrary characteristics like race and skin color so important to the character? Who cares, and why?"
Kath and Kim,It's about time.
Kath and Kim,"You feel validated by a puppet. Congrats on your very low bar, round of high fives for everyone"
Kath and Kim,Diaspora give me a break
Kath and Kim,I thought the point was to have kids play on Sesame Street with the puppets. Not to turn kids into the puppets?
Kath and Kim,"I don't know what the fuck happened to the rest of you, but this is the stupidest thing I've heard in a long time."
Kath and Kim,As if small children would give a crap about her name. If I was 5 watching this show I would be confused and assume her name is Jee and that everyone calls her young.

Kath and Kim,"I think it's great that Sesame Street is doing this, and I believe representation matters for kids that watch it. At the same time, I'll never understand the victimhood boner some Asian Americans have. [Is the fact that they're completely trouncing every other ethnic group including whites not enough to feel seen and validated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ethnic_groups_in_the_United_States_by_household_income#cite_note-3)?

Really?"
Kath and Kim,"42? Damn, good genes girl"
Kath and Kim,"Oh, this is so sweet! That's the first time I heard about a Korean kid on Sesame Street. What a fantastic character Ji-Young is. And she so reminds me of my Korean wife; it's incredible. We both were grinning with positivity and joy after watching Ji-Young on Youtube. I even have slightly watery eyes. :-) Sesame Street has such an essential role in educating kids (and their parents) about diversity and how wonderfully different yet similar monsters we all are. :-D

Cupcake and Dino - General Services,"quite honestly all anime is anime. dont believe me? go check last anime you watched to see if its anime? Yea, i like said, its all anime. Was it good or bad? Still anime. Anime Anime Anime."
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,"*just gonna re-add my comment again since you reposted*:

I too also hate generalization when it comes to criticism of TV shows (or media in general), and I'm surprised by how much of it I still see today. 

For instance, I just saw a comment on here the other day saying ""*if you've seen 1 romance K-drama, you've seen them all*"". Then there's the usual ""*teen-dramas are trash*"", ""*Netflix shows are trash*"" etc. comments. But you're right, Japanese anime (or animated storytelling in general) definitely gets the worst of it here. All these kinds of comments come from users who've only seen a couple or few shows from these genres/medium, and forever discarded the entire thing. 

It's totally normal and okay for a type of art form to not resonate or be relatable to you, but you can't censure a whole fuckin' genre bruh.... just say it isn't for you."
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,"Are the people downvoting bothering to read what I wrote?

I revised the original text, so that my tone is far more friendly now, and my analyses.

But I feel that people here are out to get me. I can't make any topic about animation anymore without people probably going like ""oh no, that guy again talking about animation, I'll downvote him"".

I don't want to seem like ""oh, poor me"". If it seems like I'm throwing a pity party in this comment, I apologize"
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,Anime is japanese animation. Simple.
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,Great comment!
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,Still anime.
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,"Yes, what is your point?"
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,"No but seriously there is no huge problem. This site has subreddits so if you want to discuss anime, you can find a proper forum for that. If you want read news or whatever about anime, you go a site specialized site who're writing about anime, you dont go to your local news for that."
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,"I'll already say one thing: your comment was not downvoted by me.

First, this thread isn't simply about anime. I talk a lot here about the misconceptions surrounding modern western cartoons. In fact, that's what I talk about in most of my OP. This thread really is about animation, specially animated shows.

Second, this is r/television. Animated shows, like a lot of anime is, fit in discussion here."
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,"I’m two episodes in and loving it. Yeah, it’s a bit over the top, but that’s better than moving like a glacier."
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,"yes - overall, I enjoyed the show (I'm a critic and was able to watch all episodes), but there are plot points like this - a writer from paste magazine took the time to spell out the problem, and it IS quite the problem/careless storytelling choice:  


To choose one example, >!the disastrous hack of 
the UK rail system, resulting in a train crash (that just so happens to 
injure Rowdy’s boyfriend’s daughter), prompts the U.K. to reconsider 
signing a cyber-security deal with the EU, from whom it broke off during
 Brexit. Fair enough. But the signing of this pact is seemingly left to 
two people, and when an advisor to the French Prime Minister wants to 
stop it in its tracks for his own ambitions, he can commission his 
mistress, who happens to be an assistant to the guy in Brussels in 
charge of this stuff, to just tell the Brits that the man in charge is 
out of town. This is, unfortunately, ridiculous; people have phones, and
 email, and the ability to plan; governments, you would think, don’t 
approach the signing of a major security agreement by sending over two 
ambassadors with orders to “see what you can do.” Then, when Rowdy 
circumvents these efforts by marching into the guy’s office (he’s happy 
to oblige), it’s derailed again by more extreme measures, i.e. the 
ridiculous death of a key figure in the negotiations.!<

I keep thinking ""maybe I should go back to that episode, watch it again and make sure that there is nothing that I missed. but from what I remember, it really WAS that simple / hamfisted. here's the review: https://www.pastemagazine.com/tv/apple-tv-plus/liaison-review/"
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,Glad you do :)
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,Has things changed how they do ratings? I thought you had to be a nielsen person for your viewing to matter. %90 of the population could be watching if the other %10 are the nielsen people it doesn't matter.
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,The amount of gold these posts are getting has convinced me I need to check this show out
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,"I posted this exact comment in r/scifi, but it's probably more relevant here:

This is great and all, but seriously, if it takes this much to earn a fourth season, what happens at the end of season 4? They can't wrap it up, they are literally still at the opening of the main story arc. It'll take a whole lot more than one more season to tell the story of the source material.

Also, here are some things that people outside of US might not realise:

* There is NO mention of it on the UK SyFy website. It is literally non-existent. It is as though it never was, let alone about to end.

* It is apparently a Netflix Original show in the UK. Season 1 and 2 are up, ready to view. None of season 3.

* It was a YEAR LONG WAIT for season 2 after US screening. Edit: Season 1 wasn't broadcast for a year after the US either.

* It will be ANOTHER YEAR until we get season 3.

* It is not on Amazon Prime UK

* Youtube TV is not available in the UK

* Hulu is not available in the UK

Now, do the producers of this show, seriously expect anyone to put up with that? No. It's torrented, pirated, viewed through proxies, whatever. There are HUGE numbers outside the US, unable to watch it, legally at least. NO ONE will wait a year. It's unreasonable.

Just incase US based people are wondering, the UK is not in a year long delay for content usually, this is an anomaly. Shows usually are shown the day after their US premier. Mainly because the US showing normally works out at the early hours of the morning our time. 

All of which is fast becoming irrelevant, since some shows, Game of Thrones is an example, are available to view on demand as soon as it has aired in the US. What fucking decade do the producers of The Expanse think this is?! It's been nearly 20 years since a month or more long delay between US and rest-of-world releases.

EDIT: When I think about it, I would seriously pay the same amount as my Netflix subscription monthly, for this one show alone. It's not even an amazing show, it's the best of a bad bunch. Now, obviously no where near the numbers of Netflix subscribers are willing to do the same, but even if you got 1%? Surely that would be enough to produce a single show? And maybe, possibly even make it actually *good*, with real revenue and no fearful execs worried about the content being too 'niche'. A direct funding between fan and studio, no bullshit, actual content.

Edit: Thanks for the gold, I'll be in the lounge..."
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,"Holy shit, this was gilded 9 times in a half an hour? I don't think I've ever seen that before.

Edit: 28 now!"
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,"Never seen an episode of The Expanse but I'll be having my tv on SyFy every episode for all the fans wanting a season 4.

Seems unfair that one of my favorite shows (B99) got saved, so hopefully this minuscule contribution helps!"
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,I'd much prefer if Amazon or Netflix picked up the show instead.  
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,"Unfortunately I'm in the UK. Hoping all you American sci-fi fans can step up.

If you've been convinced to start watching in the past few days but aren't caught up and worried about spoilers please just set your TV to the station and DVR and play it in the next three days while you're doing something else.

Help us make it so that once you are caught up there's a whole lot more The Expanse to look forward to!"

The work must continue."
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,Honestly would rather it be picked up by someone else at this point. Syfy will just cancel after ratings fall off again because EVERYONE IS FUCKING STREAMING. It's 2018. Live ratings are so antiquated and are a ridiculous measure of support and general viewership. 
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,Syfy don't be those guys. Renew the show.
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,"The Expanse has been on my ""to watch"" list for like, a year and a half now. Maybe it's time to give it a proper go."

Cupcake and Dino - General Services,I don't even watch The Expanse but watching you guys work together to pull this off is impressive. Good work guys
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,"I started watching it on prime and we use a fire stick for all of our streaming. I hated having to wait for it to come out live. Thank you for telling me that it is indeed live on Syfy and that I'm fucking retarded...


I even paid for the latest season because when I'm angry at my stories, I don't think things through..."
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,Tonight's episode should be lit given where it lands in the books. Can't wait to #savetheexpanse
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,"Done.  Watching on YouTube TV right now.  I'll buy it on Amazon Prime as soon as possible.

The Expanse is too good a show to be relegated to the graveyard of canceled television."
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,"Not to put a downer on things, but I think this is a bad idea. 

It seems fairly likely to be picked up by another service. If Syfy doesn't like the ratings now, its probably not going to like them once the furor dies down. We may be able to bump the ratings in the short term, but unless A LOT of new people get into the show in this short span, the ratings will drop back down again next year.

 Then Syfy will cancel it again. Then it will be a twice cancelled show with a short-lived return, and will be much harder sell for another service. 

Even if it doesn't get cancelled, unless viewership jumps A LOT and stays high consistently, the budget will be cut hard to justify it. 

I think I'd rather Amazon, Hulu, or Netflix get a hold of it rather than Syfy keep it."
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,**Can't Stop The Work!**
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,I honestly don’t want it to stay on Syfy. I think it has a better chance getting picked up by Amazon rather than leaving it to getting back on Syfy cause of an uptake of live viewings. I’m not going to get cable or pay for any live service just for The Expanse 😕
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,Lol watching live and DVR doesn't matter unless you're a Nielsen family.

Cupcake and Dino - General Services,"Syfy should just give up. They made a great show, that is loved and popular, but it isn't profitable because their business model is one based on how television worked in the 1970's. Like the writing hasn't been on the wall for decades. Why the fuck would anyone, especially someone tech savvy (a big part of their demographic), watch a tv show at a set time every week with 20 minutes of ads per hour. That's so stupid. No one is going to keep doing that except old clueless people, and they won't like this tv show in the first place. Or likely any science fiction show. 

So if SYFY can't make this work, what the hell can they make work? To add to that, the fact they partnered with hulu *and* netflix essentially means they would never likely be able to sell the show to either network, so for some reason, they decided to go about this in a really stupid way, and then as an extra, they decided to cock block themselves by sabotaging any hope of a secondary deal. What idiots. Unless they change their overall model, I don't see how this network intends to survive in the long term. 
"
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,Aren't Nielsen ratings only coming from Nielsen families?
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,"As a fan watching it on Netflix in Australia I really hope this show continues. 

It just makes sense for Netflix to pick the show up, especially after the success of Altered Carbon for them."
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,"The problem is, most of the world can't watch it.."

Cupcake and Dino - General Services,"Guilded 9 times in under an hour, that’s gotta be some kind of record."
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,"I'm waaaaaaaay behind (just started season 2), but I guess I'll load up the Syfy app and stream tonight's episode tomorrow in hopes it might make a vague difference."
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,"I don't mean to be rude or anything, but I thought tv ratings like the live watching was only affected by the people with nielson boxes?

Cupcake and Dino - General Services,"First time watcher, I just changed the channel to it and I have no idea what’s going on but holy shit does it look cool. Can anybody help catch me up really quick?"
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,I'll give it a shot tonight. I can't believe the support from the fans so far. You guys are crazy dedicated

Cupcake and Dino - General Services,Watched the latest episode this morning. It was sick
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,"So I never heard of this show until all this. Started the first episode and saw that Thomas Jane was in it! I fucking adore ""Thursday"" so I watched it all night. My biggest complaint (which really isn't an issue in present day) is that I had no idea that season 1 ended and season 2 began until I looked and saw the s2e3 was about to start. So I looked it up and there was a year gap? That had to have been brutal if you guys were following episode to episode. There wasn't really any resolution or transition of any kind between S1e10 and S2e1!"
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,"I don’t care how good The Expanse is, I’m not buying a cable subscription."
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,"I don't even watch this show but if it means so much to so many, I'll DVR it tonight for the sake of saving it. I might watch it later.

Edit: My first gold. Thank you :D"

Cupcake and Dino - General Services,Never heard of the series before it got cancelled...thanks to you all I found an amazing show. They'd be foolish not to renew!
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,Can i watch it on the SyFy app
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,[deleted]
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,"I'll admit I haven't watched before now, but as of today I've created a TiVo OnePass, my TiVo is on SyFy, I've started watching it on Amazon Prime AND iTunes, and I'm tweeting about it. Hope it makes a difference!"
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,I wish SyFy would post the show sooner on their app :/
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,"Also, everybody should watch the fuck out of it on Amazon just to show them that there is interest "
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,The show is too good and too popular for another network to not pick it up. I'm not worried at all even if Syfy doesn't pull their heads out their asses.
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,Half way through season one. I know what I must do.
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,Honestly kind of want it to go to Amazon or Netflix now.
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,God damn this show has such a huge fan base (that I never noticed) I may give it a try.

Cupcake and Dino - General Services,[deleted]
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,They may reconsider after WE do all of the work that they should have done from the start. Honestly at this point I would prefer amazon or anyone to get money over syfy. 
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,"On point #2 & #3 -- They care about C+3 numbers not just Live+3 numbers

Which means you have to watch the commercials and not just fast-forward.

http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/the-sked-ratings-that-mean-something-and-ratings-that-dont.html

The only measurement with substantive meaning to the networks is C3, which counts the viewers who, within 3 days of initial air, watch the commercials included within a show. Anyone who watches in that 72-hour period and fast-forwards is invisible to advertisers. History has told us that C3 numbers are very close to the overnight numbers reported here and elsewhere each day, but because the C3 numbers are so important, they’re rarely made public."
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,"I've never seen it but the noise you guys have made on Reddit got me to turn it on tonight.  I am going to have to check it out because while I wasn't really paying attention, it seems awesome.  Hope this is a success!"
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,I don't watch this show but you guys obviously love it a lot so I asked my parents to DVR it at home and bought the first few episodes. I got Brooklyn 99 back so I hope you guys get your show back! And I'm gonna give it a go myself. 
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,[deleted]
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,"Sod the Siffy channel. I'm in the UK so my viewing figures don't count anyway due to how we've been getting it, but I just won't support SYFY in any way anymore. 
Oh you don't want to be The Sci-fi Channel anymore and want to burn your core fanbase of ""basement dwellers""? Fine. Oh your ratings suck even worse now so you want to bring back fans with new SF shows?...annnd you've cancelled them. Nope, I'm not playing their games anymore. It'll suck if we don't get a season 4, but I'd rather support any other platform other than SYFY for SF shows now. "
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,"Well the ratings would be great if i COULD actually WATCH it legally.

Netflix adds new seasons at a delay of about 1 year. SyFy channel is not available here.

Amazon, hulu, youtube tv, etc are not available \- or have nonexistent library.

My ONLY option is to torrent it. It's not the shows fault or lack of viewers  \- its your own stupid regional restriction policy."
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,"In all honesty - check with torrenting sites to see the level of illegal downloading that happens across Australia and NZ. 

Like Game of Thrones, it became a hit when they realized that illegal down loaders down loaded it for the story, liked it so much then purchased box sets and find ways to support shows like Game of Thrones. As with a good hit show like The Expanse; we want to support it legally, as part of that geeky subculture that loves all things Science Fiction and probably have the original Corey books that the series is based on anyway.   

NZ and Australia have a thriving convention circuit where we welcome science fiction fans and obviously would love to host people and support the show. But we are all GEO-BLOCKED or the subscriber service can't do it legally.... "
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,"How are people like me that live in countries that DON'T have SyFy supposed to help???? All the ""watch it live"" options listed here are NOT available for my country.

I LOVE the show, but I have to turn to pirate sites just to be able to watch it. I fucking hate myself for that."
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,"I think we should be pushing for a different network. I mean they cancelled it, let them have what they wanted. Fuck them. They don't want our amazing show, all they want is the god damn money. Who knows if they'll pull the same shit next season? I don't care really, as long as the show keeps coming out, but you know how you should never get back together with your ex because since it didn't work the first time ... I don't know guys, I smell a rat!"
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,"Never heard of the show. I have heard of Reddit gold though... Apparently this show must be pretty good. I'll check it out, thanks!"
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,"I had no idea this was even close to being cancelled?! 
Thought was a fantastic, unique sci-fi series
No clue they wanted to cancel! 
I watch in the UK on Netflix so I don't know if my views count"
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,This show is actually pretty great! I’m in! 
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,"I recently was selected by Nielson to do a survey, and one of the questions was what is your favorite TV show. I thought about it, and was like The Expanse has really uped its game this season so I put it down. Literally a day or two after I mailed it I heard the show got canceled. So happy I sent it in and got to voice my opinion, I really hope it helps a bit. Such a good well put together show."
Cupcake and Dino - General Services,"I have never seen this show, but love the support it's getting. I'm on the Expanse train!"
Welcome to the Family,I still don't know how Ironside ever made it past being a pitched idea.
Welcome to the Family,Please don't put cancelled and Community into the same headline.
Welcome to the Family,"I watched the first ep of 'Ironside' and it fell flat.  Just seemed like a rejected Law n Order script with wheelchair detective with chip on shoulder...nothing to make the show outstanding.  Never saw 'Welcome to the Family' but the ads did not seem interesting.  'Hostages"" is my favorite new show thus far."
Welcome to the Family,"I feel like you can look at any season's TV schedule in advance and predict with about a 75% success rate which shows will not last more than one season.

Currently on the chopping block, in my opinion: Goldbergs, Trophy Wife, Dads, Crazy Fun Night.... they might eek out a full season, but I don't think any will find season 2.

I think The Millers, Mom, and Brooklyn Nine-Nine will be the ones to get another season. Crazy Ones and the Michael J. Fox Show are on the fence, they might get the nod due to their star power."
Welcome to the Family,"Is anyone else as completely UNsurprised by some of these announcements?  Welcome to the Family failed when it was called Rob.  We Are Men was just...sad.  Lucky 7 failed twice before.

On the one hand, I feel shows that are axed after one or two episodes really aren't getting a fair shake.  Doubly so in the days of DVRs, I know a guy who still hasn't seen Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D yet.  The episodes are just sitting there until he 'gets around to watching them'.

On the other hand, shows that are carbon copies of OTHER shows that failed within half a dozen episodes...what do the network execs expect from these shows?  This is why so many shows aren't even having their premieres until November...no need to save them for midseason when the schedule is going to be decimated in just a couple weeks."
Welcome to the Family,"I actually liked the two episodes of ""Welcome to the Family"" I watched. I watched it on Hulu because I didn't know what time it came on."
Welcome to the Family,"While I can't say I gave either a shot and Ironside seemed doubly ridiculous.. ""I have a different view of the world down here..unless you..kneel down."" I'd say TV today is way to finicky shows need to be given a chance to build. At least give shows a season that you can sell later on.. "
Welcome to the Family,"Wish NBC had the guys to cancel the Michael J. Fox Show.  It's so horrible, but critics are too scared to say it is terrible because it has Michael J. Fox."
Welcome to the Family,"Not surprising at all. Both of these shows were really struggling in the ratings since they launched. Ironside premiered to a 1.3 and than fell to a 1.1 and eventually a 1.0. Where as Welcome to the Family did even worse, premiering to a 1.1 than falling to a 0.8 and rising slightly to a 0.9. What will be interesting is what NBC is going to be doing about next fall. Their Thursday comedy lineup has been suffering these past two seasons. For example, yesterday Parks and Recreation tied Parenthood at a 1.3 which is really low, especially when compared to other networks like CBS. They took a bet with Michael J. Fox show this season and that is getting poor ratings, 1.2 yesterday. I wonder what NBC will do for next season for comedy Thursdays. Both Parks and Recreation and Community have reached syndication. Community was hitting Parks and Recreation numbers last season. Will NBC keep both of these comedies even though they are low hitters? Or wipe the slate clean and try for a lucky new comedy.  I have a feeling that NBC will only keep one and again use it to fill in for a early cancellation. "
Welcome to the Family,"Shoot, I actually liked Welcome to the Family and was glad to see Mike O'Malley outside of a three-camera studio audience sitcom. "
Welcome to the Family,Somehow I think we will be able to move on from this.
Welcome to the Family,"I'll never understand the discussions about those decisions and the decisions themselves to be honest. Not that I am ""upset"", but rather amused and confused at the weird-ish nature of those things... like Brooklyn 99 getting the Super Bowl spot (which I assume is a big thing)."
Welcome to the Family,it's actually a reboot from forty years ago.
Welcome to the Family,Its an absurd premise for a show. You can get away with it in the 70s but not today.
Welcome to the Family,"Relax, wheels is on the case!!!"
Welcome to the Family,[deleted]
Welcome to the Family,"I haven't been watching, but based on the ratings I've seen and the standard for ABC, I think The Goldbergs could potentially get another season. The others that you mentioned after that are goners though.

And The Michael J. Fox Show slipped drastically in viewers; no way it's getting renewed if you ask me."
Welcome to the Family,I didn't watch it but it did sound like one the better new shows. 
Welcome to the Family,They can't - they are contractually obligated to air all 22 episodes. It was part of the bidding process for the show.
Welcome to the Family,I kind of think NBC is shooting itself in the foot trying to put new shows in such terrible slots. They should really try to develop one-two good comedies and air them after the Voice for a season and afterwards move them to Thursday.
Welcome to the Family,His point still stands.
Welcome to the Family,I liked the original Ironside but the new one was just crap.
Welcome to the Family,"Holy shit, the original ran for 8 years and 199 episodes! People were lame back then.

Edit: I don't complain about downvotes, but really? It's Wheels and the Legman. Anyone that likes that… lame."
Welcome to the Family,"Full season order ≠ Getting a second season.

You're right though, based on the ratings it looks like it's heading in that direction."
Welcome to the Family,">Crazy Ones has the most viewers of any new show (including the Blacklist),

Source on this?

Everything I have been able to find has The Blacklist beating The Crazy Ones in total viewers for the last two weeks and the key demo for the last three weeks. I'm pretty sure The Millers is also doing better than The Crazy Ones at this point as well."
Welcome to the Family,It was pretty decent. It felt more like an ABC show than NBC show. It would have fit well in ABC's Wednesday family lineup. The third episode is on Hulu now and I can't bring myself to watch it. This is exactly why I wait until the season is over before I watch new shows.
Welcome to the Family,Unlike the main character...I'll show myself out.
Welcome to the Family,[deleted]
Welcome to the Family,"Okay, I disagree with how you came up with your conclusion but agree that The Crazy Ones is probably not on the fence. I don't think that Live + 7  data has any influence on if a show is renewed or not and and I put much more weight on what the show is performing now instead of averaging what it has done in the past. 

For example, Go On and The New Normal all did pretty well (by NBC standards) on average last year but the numbers fell off in the end. Even the Animal Practice started off really strong but quickly fell off after each episode. 

I think as long as The Crazy Ones can maintain a 2.4-2.5 it has a chance but the closer it starts to dip towards 2.0 the more it is in danger of not getting renewed. Keep in mind that they pulled We Are Guys after it got a 1.8."
Welcome to the Family,What the hell? I was really enjoying Ironside.
Welcome to the Family,"Maybe I'm alone on this, but I thought Welcome to the Family was an ok show."
Welcome to the Family,Ironside cancelled?  What will The Soup make fun of now?
Welcome to the Family,Blair Underwood's acting was so outrageously over the top that it seemed like satire to me.
Welcome to the Family,Premise felt odd.
Welcome to the Family,I couldn't stop thinking about Wheels and the Legman.
Welcome to the Family,"[Here](https://youtu.be/SZ5ErYc5KZA?t=64) is when Viktor first introduces himself. Unfortunately, this clip doesn't keep it in, but Five immediately has a similar reaction of acceptance and still gets mad at Viktor because he just messed up. Feels like a classic good sibling move, accept them for who they are, and immediately get mad at their actions anyway lol. 

The whole show is about accepting people for who they are, so it's not out of character for everyone in the show to be accepting. Usually, they have to accept the fact that one of their siblings just did something awful, but this time it was a cakewalk to just say ""cool, still love you"" and get back to the story."
Welcome to the Family,"As usual Luther is the sweetest of the bunch, the gentle giant. I think that he thought that they should make (or that Viktor deserved) a ""birthday"" party or something. Which is not a bad idea, but I think that shortly after that scene they get involved in another fight with the Sparrow Academy?

Anyhow, congrats to them for introducing Page's transition in such a natural way, and even with some preparation in the plot lines in the last season."
Welcome to the Family,Oh this is really good. Not over the top and with humor. Just accept and move on.
Welcome to the Family,"“Do you feel loved?” “Yea” “Good because you are” 

This was such a wholesome moment, and Luther standing there with his big dorky smile and then Viktor having to practically look straight up at him with that big smile. It was so sweet. 

Give the boys some tiny sandwiches!"
Welcome to the Family,"Really great way of dealing with the change and showing support for Elliot, however I've always thought that haircut is awful!"
Welcome to the Family,"I really loved Luther this season. This scene just further solidified that sentiment. Also, >!His relationship with Sloane, despite its breakneck pace, was such a breath of relief from all of the previous seasons' scenes of Luther pining over Allison.!<"
Welcome to the Family,"The whole thing has bee  hugely accepting of Elliot / Viktor 


Kinda beautiful, now can we apply this example into the real world, to just accept our trans folks the same way, as who they are ?"
Welcome to the Family,"I thought they handled it really well, but a couple of things bugged me.

\- They seemed a lot nicer to Viktor than the last two seasons. They were real dicks to him before.

\- No one else mentioned the transition outside of the family. Even the Sparrows met Viktor before he transitioned and aren't exactly friendly. Lila and Hargreaves were also very silent.  It's probably better they didn't as it enabled the plot to flow but it seemed a bit odd."
Welcome to the Family,"Most interestingly though, Vanya is a masculine Russian name, technically they didn't have to go toward Viktor, and it could been unintentional foreshadowing. 

Eithier way is good tho."
Welcome to the Family,and changed names from the masculine Vanya to the masculine Viktor.
Welcome to the Family,"I think it was well done. But, was it necessary? Could Elliott Page not continue playing a female character that he has already played for two seasons?"
Welcome to the Family,"The first scene is exactly how I was hoping they address it. Essentially “Oh you’re a dude now, that’s cool. Happy for you.” and move on with the story."
Welcome to the Family,Should I try this series? What kind of show is it? I thought it was about a secret society of young assassins or something.
Welcome to the Family,"I’m only on episode 3 and think they have handled the whole thing pretty well without dwelling on it. 

I don’t watch this kind of stuff to be constantly hit over the head with social issues."
Welcome to the Family,It’s been a great element to this season. The show is a lot of fun.
Welcome to the Family,This was very wholesome. I wish it worked this easily for people in real life
Welcome to the Family,I've been convinced after watching this that Elliot should replace the Flash.
Welcome to the Family,Essentially how I rolled it with my cousin. Just welcomed them and didn’t make a big deal about it.
Welcome to the Family,"I liked the idea, but it felt shallow. No one really cared, it was super neutral.

No depth meant no meaning. If this would happen in a real family it would involve a little bit more of a transition for everyone. Confusion, acceptance and little drama. They had enough characters to make it work. It was a lost opportunity.

Personally, all good and great. I like complex characters and support all life styles.

You know how they could make it work? Getting the final ""click"" on her new powers somehow connect with the personal and emotional."
Welcome to the Family,"How is the new season? I'm kinda surprised I didn't hear anything about it until I saw this post, I thought it hasn't released yet"
Welcome to the Family,The whole thing felt so forced.  Everytime they called vanya him it was so cringe.  And like nobody ever jumbled their speech in the days after she dropping this crazy bomb on them.  You can tell it ws shoe horned into the show last second.
Welcome to the Family,This being a TV show noone will accidentally deadname him or anything like in real life i'm sure
Welcome to the Family,[removed]
Welcome to the Family,"I love that this has been a proper subplot and not just a footnote. I also love that they made no real effort to disguise the fact that, to this point, Elliot had been wearing a wig."
Welcome to the Family,"This was a great explanation of how they handled it. I loved how they managed to integrate the transition into the show in a way that was reasonable and tied to the plot but not in a fantastic sci-fi way. And like you said, any tension between Victor and his siblings had nothing to do with the transition."
Welcome to the Family,"why did the first 40 seconds looked so weird, it was cgi?

Viktor looks amazing, in better shape than vania."
Welcome to the Family,"I'm impressed with how they did it, but in the 2nd episode that scene with the sisters went on for wayy too long, and just had some awful writing in my opinion. ""What do you see in the mirror now?"" ""Me, I see me"". Just was beating a dead horse with that scene IMO, keep communicating the character growth, but treating the show like an after school special for that scene was a bit cringey."
Welcome to the Family,While giving us Dorky Luther which is always great. The man just likes his tiny sandwiches!
Welcome to the Family,"They addressed it pretty much the entire season and it remained classy, tactful, and wholesome. Very well handled."
Welcome to the Family,"My only concern was that from a rhythm point of view, the transition seemed to have happened in about one or two hours. It felt like Vanya was walking in the street, saw a barber shop, decided to be Viktor and voilà. It was honestly not bad thanks to the crew reactions, but could have been written better beforehand. Starting from here, I can understand why some people would have prefered some added scifi narrative, like using space continuum paradox main plot. Some event that could have unlocked who Viktor really was from the start. Not a big deal, but it kinda felt like a missed opportunity."
Welcome to the Family,I feel like every guy has to have that one haircut that he thinks looks really good but really doesn't at some point in his life
Welcome to the Family,Luther when he sees a new sister: It’s free real estate.
Welcome to the Family,"Agreed, they had better keep Sloane in S4"
Welcome to the Family,Is he still getting his ass kicked by normal non-superpowered dudes? That really bugged me about the first two seasons.
Welcome to the Family,"> now can we apply this example into the real world, to just accept our trans folks the same way, as who they are ?

I feel like for the majority, that is already the case. Who gives a shit.  
   
It's just that the people who can not accept others the way they are will not stop screming and throwing tantrums about it."
Welcome to the Family,"As a trans man myself I can tell you I absolutely bawled at these scenes. I've lost so many family members because they refused to accept me. They refused to even try. My partner and like 1 cousin accept and love me, but that's it."
Welcome to the Family,The real world is pretty chill depending on your social circle and where you live.
Welcome to the Family,"My partner just came out as non binary and when we were talking to the kids about their new pronouns, they were confused only because we were trying to explain it in a dumbed down way. They understood it without explanation and have made 0 mistakes with their pronouns since we talked with them.  I have hope that this is the overall norm going forward"
Welcome to the Family,"He's already cut his hair, had top surgery, and is taking testosterone so his voice is getting deeper. Plus, isn't it good to get more trans representation in shows played by actual trans people?"
Welcome to the Family,"Broadly speaking, it's about a group of adopted siblings with super powers who have to save the world from an apocalypse. 

Lots of crazy characters, over the top powers, and time-travel shenanigans.  Pretty fun show that doesn't take itself super serious; good action and can be pretty funny as well."
Welcome to the Family,It's entertaining but god dammit each and every character makes me want to punch them in the face at least twice an episode.
Welcome to the Family,First season was pretty good.  I thought season 2 was a large step down.  I don't have interest in watching season 3.
Welcome to the Family,It's basically a dysfunctional superhero show with a bunch of oddball characters. Not as good as the Boys or Doom Patrol in my opinion but has it's moments.
Welcome to the Family,"It takes a similar concept to the classic X-men and Doom Patrol, and is about an older professor raising young superheroes. The twist being that the group is written as a dysfunctional family repeatedly needing to get over their drama to help each other and save the world."
Welcome to the Family,I call it: The CopmleX-Men.
Welcome to the Family,You'll like it if you're a fan of Stranger Things. A lot of conflicts in it could be resolved with basic communication but the show has its moments.
Welcome to the Family,"I think the Flash should be high energy and funny. Elliot Page doesn’t exactly give off that vibe, especially in this show."
Welcome to the Family,Don't know why you're being down-voted. I'm certainly not spending any money to see Ezra Miller.
Welcome to the Family,I would be for this if it werent for the fact that Elliot is tiiiiiiiny hahaha
Welcome to the Family,"> I liked the idea, but it felt shallow. No one really cared, it was super neutral.
> 
> No depth meant no meaning. If this would happen in a real family it would involve a little bit more of a transition for everyone. Confusion, acceptance and little drama. They had enough characters to make it work. It was a lost opportunity.

I think the neutral part of it was very intentional, they are a family with a very chaotic history including being raised by a combination of a talking chimp, a robot mother and an abusive father that pits them against one another for his own schemes.

The siblings themselves all have their own hang-ups and grievances from years of torment  

Victor transitioning really was just a bit of personal growth that also took place during yet another ensuing apocalypse, and since all he wanted to was to be himself and fit in it... the lack of any big deal being made about it was probably the best option."
Welcome to the Family,"It was probably the weakest yet, but still entertaining. Lots of fun quirky stuff, but also some unfortunate character in-fighting and lack of development for some characters. If you enjoyed the first two seasons I might still give it a shot!"
Welcome to the Family,"Luther is half ape, Five is a 60 year old in a 14 year old's body, Ben is a ghost, and one of the sparrows is a floating cube. Vanya becoming Victor was hardily ground breaking"
Welcome to the Family,I would like to see some accidental dead naming and see how they handle that. Friend of mine changed her name fairly recently. Nothing gender related just a new name. I still slip up from time to time.
Welcome to the Family,[removed]
Welcome to the Family,"Yep, they had a great hook to tie it into the story with the Dolly romance in the 60s. Much better than some convoluted sci-fi explanation. And the siblings being accepting feels very natural. I mean, one is an old man in a child's body, another half-simian. Transitioning to another gender is almost ordinary compared to that."
Welcome to the Family,"I feel the exact opposite about it not being done in a Scifi way. The show has aliens, a talking monkey, super powers, multiple apocalypses, time travel, and other ridiculous stuff. Yet they made the transition mundane.

I don't care that the character transitioned, but I do care that it was boring. I watch the show for the absurd and would have appreciated more of the absurdity.

The season started off with a hallucinated dance off to Footloose, I want stuff in line with that. And for fucks sake, an explanation of Christopher."
Welcome to the Family,I think Vania had a wig before he was Viktor this season. If that’s what you saw.
Welcome to the Family,"Siblings, not sisters."
Welcome to the Family,"I actually found that line insightful.  I have a few friends and a family member who have transitioned and we never really talked about it, but that line in particular clicked with me about what things may have been like for them."
Welcome to the Family,there are so many shows being filmed now to fill streaming shelves that the writing pool has been diluted.
Welcome to the Family,I actually enjoyed that conversation: it fit with everything we'd seen of Viktor previously and how he carried himself prior to this. Countering that with him not having to carry the weight around anymore and trying to actively negotiate with the Sparrows backed up everything he said. I thought the idea of him seeing questions and baggage in the mirror instead of himself and how his perspective had always been clouded was a nice touch of insight.
Welcome to the Family,"I really enjoyed Luther and Viktor’s relationship for the most part, especially >!Luther making Viktor the best man at his wedding.!< That shit had me smiling."

Jimmy: The True Story of a True Idiot,"I recently watched The Imitation Game, about Alan Turing's codebreaking efforts during WWII, and was shocked how many liberties were taken.

Jimmy: The True Story of a True Idiot,"I personally think shows like the crown should aim to align as close to accuracy as possible, otherwise the story is just too boring to have a purpose.

On the other side I really liked Versailles where the premise is that show is about real rumors in or about the court during the time it takes place. It assumes every rumor was true and we go from there. Everyone knows it’s not historically accurate but it’s the most fun way of fictionalizing it."

Jimmy: The True Story of a True Idiot,"Never watch biopics, I've been burned too many times."
Jimmy: The True Story of a True Idiot,"""Based on a true story"" means just that, it's BASED on the story, ""an accurate depiction of the story from all points of view"" is not a type of storytelling. Everything is dramatized for entertainment. Like with The Crown, who watching that was thinking ""oh yeah this is 100% truth?"" The public stuff, maybe, but even that could be spun to fit the storylines.

Film and TV should adopt the line ""a work of fiction based on facts"" to allow for creativity while still pulling from true events."
Jimmy: The True Story of a True Idiot,In regards to that: The Woman King really is problematic IMO
Jimmy: The True Story of a True Idiot,"I can’t think of any “based on a true story” movie or TV series that isn’t fictionalised in some way. Like Leonard Maltin says, never get your history from the movies. Many true stories just don’t have enough inherent drama to translate to film or TV structure on their own. Yet there’s a large and demonstrable market for adaptations of true stories, so it is what it is. 

All this said, the backlash over The Crown is absolutely hilarious to me. The way the Tories and the Royal bootlickers speak, you’d think a TV drama somehow has the power to overthrow the monarchy."
Jimmy: The True Story of a True Idiot,I love The Crown but I’m pretty sure it was made to be more of a historical drama so of course they had to add a bunch of drama. They never have “based on true events” in any of the episodes.

Jimmy: The True Story of a True Idiot,"I have little sympathy for the creators who could choose to either accurately tell a real story, or use real life as inspiration for grade A period pieces but with made up character names. What’s silly is the war genre tends to get this right. You have both the incredibly faithful retelling of history (Band of Brothers, The Pacific) which have small discrepancies but nothing anyone would sue over. But then you have lots of films which try to capture the horror of war, with incredibly realistic details, without attributing their fictional story to real people (Saving Private Ryan, 1917, etc.)."

Jimmy: The True Story of a True Idiot,"Fiction based on history isn't a documentary.

There's *always* going to be artistic license. You're going to compress timelines, events go out of order, create composite characters, all to tell a story people want to hear. Anyone saying ""the real history is good enough"" doesn't realize how much that means people sitting in offices looking at paperwork and a cast of a few hundred people. 

Like, I always am amused how much /r/movies hates Bohemian Rhapsody for it's ""historical inaccuracies"" and if you go to the list it's stupid shit like ""They didn't go on a tour until a YEAR LATER than they said they did in the movie!"" About the only thing I'd say is material is the timing of Mercury's diagnosis, and even that (IMO) wasn't that bad. 

If you're watching a dramatic interpretation of historical events, there's gonna be ""inaccuracies"" in the sense that it's ""modified to make it something watchable."" And you have to be okay with that, or you'll just have to watch documentaries, instead."
Jimmy: The True Story of a True Idiot,“Ripped from the headlines...” That is when you know it isn’t true.
Jimmy: The True Story of a True Idiot,"Pity no one will get sued for that Woman King abomination. How do you take the GD villains and make them the hero of the story with a straight face like that? There’s inaccurate and then there’s straight up bizarro world shit like that. 

There’s times where I bemoan the lack of a cinematic portrayal of The Trail of Tears, the single greatest atrocity committed against my people, but seeing how badly anything historical gets fucked up in the retelling these days with our luck they’d find some way to cast Viola Davis as the hero of the story. As much as I wish more people knew of it, because it’s a tragedy worth remembering, I’d rather they learn the truth instead of the Hollywood version of it."
Jimmy: The True Story of a True Idiot,Interesting how nobody has a problem with this in literature. I think the difference in reception has something to do with the way we internalize images.

Jimmy: The True Story of a True Idiot,You mean like every single historical drama over the last 120 years of cinema?
Jimmy: The True Story of a True Idiot,I don’t know why you’re going to make a show or movie about specific people that exist and just make shit up. You can’t have it both ways. You can’t pretend it’s based in reality with things that didn’t happen. You have to say it’s complete fiction with some things that actually happened.
Jimmy: The True Story of a True Idiot,"Here's how I'd do it, if I was the money man calling the shots for an American production:

1. start with established facts
2. include all the established facts
3. flesh characters and scenes out by inferring ideas that are consistent with the established facts
4. get feedback on the script

At this juncture we have two paths. The first possibility is that the ""true story"" makes for a compelling narrative based on these four steps, in which case:

1. start production
2. monitor production to ensure any ad hoc changes don't violate the first three steps

The second path is that the story is not compelling enough. This is unfortunate. My natural suspicion is that the best option if this happens is to invent a fictional character from whose perspective we can narrativise the true story provided we don't end up editing out the contribution of neglected perspectives. So, for example, if we're making a show about, I dunno, the Pink and White Terraces and the 1886 Mount Tarawera Eruption that drowned/destroyed them, it wouldn't be a good idea to make the fictional main character an American tourist. In fact, you'd probably make the main character a Maori local.

The other likely approach is to amalgamate characters, which you'd do with the same level of sensitivity. So, for example, if you were, for whatever reason, doing a television adaptation of John Key's government, you might amalgamate Jerry Brownlee and Steven Joyce, but you'd definitely have a separate Hone Harawira character.

If you find yourself inventing key events in order to have a compelling story, that's a sign that the true story isn't interesting enough to have a non-documentary show/movie adaptation. If your inventions merely allow you to transition between key events, you should be fine, so long as your dialogue and characterisation reflects what you know... or, at least, what anyone reasonable would believe they know."

Jimmy: The True Story of a True Idiot,"Our Flag Means Death is based on a true story in as much as Blackbeard did spend time with Stede, the rest is almost all bollocks.

The Assasins Creed games have some historical facts thrown in and Black Flag isn't a bad depiction of the era and piracy and seems pretty well researched. 

Neither are documentaries but they have both had me digging through Gutenberg for pirate stories, books and reports from the time.

BUT I'm not the average consumer and I do like to read the true story behind the based on a true story claim."
Jimmy: The True Story of a True Idiot,"Then you have shows like HBO's Chernobyl, which is riddled with slander and straight-up Soviet propaganda. The creator doesn't bother hedging with statements like ""based-on,"" but releases a podcast which fools everyone into thinking that all or most of the departures from the facts are disclosed there.

People defensively insist that the writers are entitled to indulge in creative license, while simultaneously taking the show's depiction of events as 99% factual. The series is lauded for its accuracy until it is challenged, at which point they turn around and claim that accuracy doesn't matter. If the subjects weren't sick old men from Ukraine and Russia, there definitely would have been lawsuits."
Jimmy: The True Story of a True Idiot,the story that was the cloest to be true is i think the chippendale show on hulu
Jimmy: The True Story of a True Idiot,"Yeah, not surprised and they should he sued.   

Using based on a true story “except the parts that arnt” is basically the same as saying “we are lying straight to your face and saying this is truth” because unless there are clear indicators telling the audience what is fact and what is fiction; the audience is just going to assume its all “true” because few are actually going to research and find out what is fact and what is fiction. 

The based on a true story “except the parts that arnt” seems like a lazy way for storytellers to just tell lies and have “legal cover” if the people affected want to sue."

Jimmy: The True Story of a True Idiot,"Historical fiction isn't meant to be holistically accurate. It's meant to capture a subjective interpretation of the spirit of truthfulness, compromising with real-world minutia to varying degrees depending on the format and genre of the piece, to explore an interesting dramatic question that drives at why the story of a particular person, place, or time might resonate with us living today."

If you’re mad about this then you’re too stupid for fiction right now. You should build back up from picture books as you learn how stories and writing works, let alone biographical adaptation. It’s a fucking film or show, not a documentary or journalistic article. “The royal family staff didn’t actually hide the newspaper from her” it’s a story! Morgan is storytelling! Wow, you’re telling me Marilyn Monroe’s life wasn’t exactly like Blonde?

For his part, Stonehouse can't sue because he's dead. His daughter complained though.

Jimmy: The True Story of a True Idiot,"I just watched ""The Aeronauts"" on Netflix, about a balloon flight in 1862 London that set the world altitude record. It was based on the actual flight by the real James Glaisher (played by Eddie Redmayne), but the Amelia character played by Felicty Jones was not only wholly fictitious, but made to be the dominant character who saved the hapless Glaisher.  It was a great, fun movie and the altitude scenes gave me the willies, but it was kind of annoying to learn that Glaisher was neither as ridiculed nor desperate for help as portrayed."

Jimmy: The True Story of a True Idiot,"The problem isn't just Hollywood playing fast and loose its that even the audiences don't know what's true or not.

In Law and Order its ""oh I think i vaguely recall this story and then they added 5 extra twists""


It's like ""Inspired By"".  Inspired by at points has been ""we lifted the names from a story and everything else is made up"" to ""I'm trying to put the book on film"". 


Honestly I think anything current is dumb, the slew of docudramas about recent events where everybody is alive should be either a documentary or an entirely fictionalized event."
Jimmy: The True Story of a True Idiot,"I think it depends on how recent things are, it's one thing to take creative liberties with something that happened 500 years ago, it's another to do it with something which happened not too long ago where the people who lived through it are still alive."
Jimmy: The True Story of a True Idiot,Absolutely… it’s disheartening to hear people assert that anything goes in the name of ‘entertainment’…. Barbarians season 2 managed both to be highly distorted and vastly less entertaining than a good faith attempt at recorded events would have been.
Dark Tourist,I enjoyed the show but the host is always so worried. I wish we had something like Insomniac again where Dave could be scared but it was hilarious.

Dark Tourist,"Love that band, P-Nut is a helluva bass player."
Dark Tourist,Dark Tourist was great. I hope they do more. 
Dark Tourist,"It seems like nobody here likes David Farrier as a host, but I STRONGLY recommend you check out his documentary film Tickled. He really shines as an investigative journalist."
Dark Tourist,"Never watched a show with a more condescending and arrogant host who managed to somehow belittle every custom he came across.

Yes, there is a mexican tradition of crawling on your knees towards that statue shrine thing. It was in Breaking Bad.. "
Dark Tourist," I liked the show but I do wish we had someone else hosting the show. There are so many instances where he goes to visit a place or person knowing full well what that place or person is about and proceeds to judge it immediately instead of just having an open mind about it. In one episode he goes to a crime museum with stuff about the holocaust and racism and judges the owner for liking that kind of stuff . It's a damn crime museum, what are you expecting?

"
Dark Tourist,I like how the friend of Charles Manson pointed out that the host was a cheap Louis Theroux knock-off. Right on the money. I did enjoy the show however. 
Dark Tourist,I really liked this show until he went to the WWII reenactment and tried to make it seem like the people portraying the Nazis were racists.  It is really no different than larping or renaissance fairs. Someone has to play that side. The host came off really looking like a douche.
Dark Tourist,"I was really excited for this show because it was going to so many locations I’m interested in. However I found the host patronising and honestly a bit of a dick. 
When his tour group were stopped and confronted by a Japanese official he had the nerve to ask the guy ‘Do you enjoy your job?’or something along the lines of that. Fuck you dude! You are the one sneaking into restricted areas. Take your dumb ass back to the van.
The Aokigahara forest was just stupid too. It’s a fascinating place but they tried to get it over with in 10 minutes. Oh and they brought a mentally ill person with them and so we could watch her unravel on tv. Yeah thanks for that. I’ll stick with Louis Theroux in the future.

Edit: because not but."
Dark Tourist,"Speaking of Dark Tourist, the YouTube channel for McKamey Manor is totally fucked up.

Regardless of whether the radiation risks were real in Fukushima, that Manor was real and disturbing."
Dark Tourist,"Okay, I have an issue with this show. The host is supposedly a dark tourist who likes these kind of things, and yet every single episode he’s a nervous wreck or is really put off by what he’s looking at. 

That leads me to believe that he’s not into dark tourism at all. Instead he simply looked the part and was given a script to read and is now stuck doing a job he doesn’t like. 

At least that’s how the show felt. "
Dark Tourist,">[Hey y'all, I'm a radiation health physicist and my father watched that episode and called me freaked out.

Dark Tourist,This show should be called “I’m white and this shocks me.” The ridiculous look on his face when he sees or is told anything is obnoxious.

Dark Tourist,I hate Dark Tourist because the host is trying so hard to be Louis Theroux but lacks any and all charisma to be anything like Louis Theroux. 
Dark Tourist,"The show was subpar, the other Japanese segments were forgettable. I given up after the American part. The poor man's Louis Theroux"
Dark Tourist,They’re only mulling because it goes against what their narrative is.  I’m loathe to disrespect the authorities as I went there after the tsunami and found the Japanese to be helpful and humble but I’ve worked with David and can’t imagine him faking it. 
Dark Tourist,The show was interesting but I'd like them to change the host. The current host is a blumbering wimp. 
Dark Tourist,3/11 never forget
Dark Tourist,"Well, that blew up."
Dark Tourist,How much radiation do those mobile trucks emit that test welds for faults? IRIS NDT I think it is. Im only asking because the person doing the testing is more at risk then anyone else.
Dark Tourist,Can't go telling the world what's actually going on now
Dark Tourist,Investigate 311
Dark Tourist,Why what tourism damage did it cause 
Dark Tourist,"http://www.who.int/ionizing_radiation/a_e/fukushima/faqs-fukushima/en/

There's really no health risks with a simple tour of this type of area. I know a woman who toured pregnant and absolutely nothing went wrong. I know members of very high level nuclear management who toured very soon after the accident. More dose was received on the flight over. Ultimately, there wasn't a real health risk to civilians during the event. Within the industry, we have discussed that the evacuation may have been premature.

None of this means the accident is serious and isn't being taken serious by other nuclear plant operators. It just means that the safety systems and fail safes did protect the public from harm. "
Dark Tourist,i guess the color of their energy isn't amber after all.... :(((
Dark Tourist,"TLDR we are all going to die of cancer if we don't die of some other method or ailment.  The reason is our cells eventually become cancerous if given enough time to do so.  Increased radiation just speeds this process along, and since we generally want to live as long as we can, we don't like putting our bodies in a position to receive extra radiation than necessary."
Dark Tourist,The host is a poor man's Louis Theroux
Dark Tourist,it's not as if Dark Tourist is a docummentary. It's an entertaining TV show about freaky tourists destinatons
Dark Tourist,"Should do more documentaries on coal, gas and oil industries as those are by far worse pollutants. There's not even comparison. Nuclear pollution is more along the lines of renewables pollution because it's extremely controlled.  But of course they focus on nuclear because that's what scares the ignorant masses. "
Dark Tourist,"Decent show, host is a cunt"
Dark Tourist,GET A NEW HOST DARK TOURIST
Dark Tourist,"Oh really? Never heard of it. I'll go watch it now. 
Barbara Streisand effect right here."
Dark Tourist,Investigate 311
Dark Tourist,Investigate 3/11
Dark Tourist,311 was an inside Job.
Dark Tourist,I don't know why a nuclear facility was ever built where it could pollute the ocean.  I know tremendous amounts of water are needed for the cooling towers but that could still be arranged as far inland as possible.
Dark Tourist,I loved this show I hope it gets another season
Dark Tourist,"""Fukushima mulls invoking the Streisand effect"""
Dark Tourist,Those Geiger counters didn't lie... 
Dark Tourist,Isn't this plant still leaking radiation into the ocean after 7 years? I understand it's a tricky thing to fix but how about you do that before you go around trying to paradoxically repair your reputation through aggressive litigation.  
Dark Tourist,"Because Fukushima's greatest problem right now is people **thinking** that it's a radioactive wasteland.  

Not the fact that it actually **is** a radioactive wasteland. "
Dark Tourist,I loved this show!!
Dark Tourist,"I really liked this show, strange to see people so down on it. I hope they make more episodes."
Dark Tourist,World's mulls action over Japanese whaling vessels and dolphin harvests.   God intervenes and fucks their shit up.  
Dark Tourist,"After Take your pills and that crap documentary about how medical diagnostics tools can kill you... im starting to think that the Netflix policy of publishing whatever shit they can and hoping some of it gets views applies to their documentaries as well. 

Right now a Documentary produced by netflix has as much credibility as one produced by PressTV.

Dark Tourist,[deleted]
Dark Tourist,"This dark tourism shit is disgusting.  Normalizing a persons morbid attraction to the suffering of others is not something I can tolerate.  I’m sure they have all kinds of rationale they employ to justify this behaviour, but I don’t buy it.  They are the equivalent of a sweaty old man attending child beauty pageants claiming they do it out of an appreciation.  It’s morally despicable."

Dark Tourist,"Everybody calm down, [the Radiation is under control](https://www.worldwidehippies.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Fuku-01-radiation-under-control.jpg)!"
Dark Tourist,I bet if you trace this shows ties you'll find connections to the fossle fuel industry.
Dark Tourist,3/11 was an inside job
Dark Tourist,"If you actually care about your health, I recommend you avoid visiting eastern Japan, including Tokyo. However if you don't mind eating fast foods, secondhand smoking, air pollution, etc., then a little bit of radiation isn't that big of a deal."
Dark Tourist,I've heard there is a pill that people can take and it will expel all the radiation from a human body. No I'm not talking about oils from your crazy Facebook friend.
Dark Tourist,"""Oh great! Look, we're all gonna die of cancer!""

*drags on cigarette after worrying reading on geiger counter*"
Dark Tourist,God I miss Insomniac. 
Dark Tourist,"Haha, replace him with Simon Pegg's character from A Fantastic Fear Of Everything"
Dark Tourist,the fact that the host was always worried about everything in every episode is what made me like the show even more.
Dark Tourist,That was such a great show. Both hilarious and informative. You sometimes forget that there is an entire world of people (mostly in big cities) who are starting their days when you are just going to sleep. It's an interesting look into a world most of us miss. 
Dark Tourist,Dave Attell is one of the greatest people of all time.
Dark Tourist,Insomniac was fantastic. I was like 16 at the time and it got me drinking jager..  . . Now the thought of that stuff makes me shudder. 
Dark Tourist,It annoyed me how just as something got interesting or you wanted to find out more about someone he would move on to the next location
Dark Tourist,"Man, I miss Insomniac. "
Dark Tourist,"I would watch an episode of Insomniac every day of my life. 

Dave Attell is just the best. "
Dark Tourist,"He seems afraid, but that dude just asks whatever the hell he wants. He constantly was telling Pablo Escobar’s hit man that killing his own girlfriend is fucked up. 😂 like he has more balls than most people would!"
Dark Tourist,"I thought the same 

It would be much better with a different host.  He was always worried or flummoxed"
Dark Tourist,"I like Karl Pinkerton. His calm, British voice with a tinge of fear is what gets me up in the morning."
Dark Tourist,That show is legendary. Dave Attel is so underrated imho.
Dark Tourist,"Get him Dressed as a Gay Clown.  Have him impersonate Putin.  In Red Square.

See how long before he 'accidentally' dies of Polonium radiation."
Dark Tourist,I wish I could like this comment more 
Dark Tourist,"Something about the guy really annoys me sometimes like he’s not good with social boundaries, but maybe that’s part of the job? Idk seems like he could back off a bit sometimes..."
Dark Tourist,He's a smug fucker also.  
Dark Tourist,"I felt he was an insufferable prick in most episodes 

He like mocked people almost by his callous attitude. "
Dark Tourist,"He basically ruined the show for me, although all the other content is interesting. "
Dark Tourist,Dude is just a colossal pussy about everything. It's cringy and hard to watch
Dark Tourist,Bird up! 
Dark Tourist,Sup melo
Dark Tourist,Your dad's here 
Dark Tourist,Time to deliver a pizza ball?

Dark Tourist,"Chill, light on my sight as my ego becomes

A funky child with some words on my tongue"
Dark Tourist,Whack
Dark Tourist,"Molten U238 can’t melt steel....,


Oh wait, yes it can.   "
Dark Tourist,"I don't know much about radiation but I remember them getting all worked up over how the radiation was above the levels that would be acceptable to live in. Which, sure, it's worrying, but the guy specifically said _live in_, not briefly wander around in.

Seems like they were just trying to manufacture drama. "
Dark Tourist,"All the panicking made me check the pictures of the Geiger counter we had on a tour of Chernobyl in 2017. These people were panicking over like 9-10usv/hour, and some of the pictures we had in Pripyat showed 29usv/hour! Our tour guide just played it down (although he ensured we quickly moved on)   "
Dark Tourist,"It's manufactured drama. Almost every show like this has that happen.

Edit : Took me a bit, but I dug up the bestof post about this.

https://np.reddit.com/r/NetflixBestOf/comments/90tvo0/us_dark_tourism_2018_from_a_nuclear_lake_to_a/e2tnfj1/"
Dark Tourist,I started to get the feeling the girl who was making haste of the situation due to increasing levels was a paid actor. She was interviewed or asked quetions by Ferrier a lot and was speaking of the situation on her own accord.  It seems to be a working condition.
Dark Tourist,Netflix might be working themselves into a shoot.
Dark Tourist,Eh the levels shown in that episode were extremely low. 
Dark Tourist,"[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRL7o2kPqw0&feature=youtu.be) shows a group of people exploring the most radioactive places on earth.

While he does explain how dangerous this is, he explains it's probably not as dangerous as most people are led to believe. He explains near the end how a cigarette smoker will put themselves through more ionizing radiation than he did going through these radioactive places."
Dark Tourist,">I hope this is a ""work"" and all the radiation going high was preplanned with the guests and fake Geiger counters, cuz if not that's a pretty fucked up and retarded thing to do.

It's definitively fake news.

>You don't fuck with radiation.

Definitely not, but the two workers that had the largest exposure (they literally waded around in reactor water) got a total dose just barely enough to maybe increase their lifetime cancer risk slightly."
Dark Tourist,"First: no, Fukushima has insanely high levels of radiation. Including in the areas where people are now living again. The Japanese government has been trying to cover up just how bad it is. 

Second, people need to learn more about radiation safety and the different kinds of radiation and what makes them dangerous. 

In general it’s ionizing radiation that is the most immediate threat, but how it happens changes distinctly between alpha, beta, and gamma radiation. And how you’re exposed also matters. [Take fuel fleas for instance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_fleas) - they’re not really dangerous with the appropriate PPE but if you accidentally inhale one you’re pretty fucked. "
Final Space,"Rogers:

>""Five years of my life. Three seasons of TV. Blood, sweat, and tears...became a tax write-off for the network who owns Final Space.  

  
>Yup. That's it. That's why it's disappeared everywhere in the USA. Five years of work vanished. When the license is up internationally, Netflix will take it down, and then it will be gone forever. There are no more physical copies of S1 and S2, and no physical copies of Season 3 were ever made. Your memory of Final, Space will be the only proof it ever existed unless you own a copy.
  

  
>I've been trying to process how this feels; it's been hard because it's just so absurd. Like a tax write-off, really? Or maybe I've become so numb to bad things happening in my life because of the frequency with which it been occurring that I didn't really register this sting.
  

>But the stinger has broken off underneath my skin. And now it's annoying. Look, I get it; this decision was just business. But Final Space will always be personal to me.
  
>Some might say to give up and move on, and I have moved on to many new projects that I'm very passionate about, but I will not give up this story and these characters. ""I will never stop fighting for Final Space. If it takes years, then so be it!""

>It's a banner you all have been waving, and it's a rallying cry I can stand behind while I continue into this long dark night chasing an ending for this story.”"
Final Space,"It’s almost like Final Space *is* the cookie.

Bummer."
Final Space,"HBOMax finally fixed their streaming buffering issues, only for them to start removing shows off of their platform.  It's like they're poking the alligators just begging to get chomped in half."
Final Space,Chookity pok
Final Space,The same thing happened to Megas XLR T\_T
Final Space,Time to employ the time-honored tradition of morally obligated piracy.
Final Space,"That fucking sucks, the 3rd season was where character arcs were finally established and the narrative was reaching a really cool point. Fuck I wish Adult Swim could save this series because it would be perfect for that platform."
Final Space,This is why we need piracy.
Final Space,"Olan is the kindest, hardest working person I've ever come across, and life is absolutely fucking shitting on him lately. I would do anything to support him."
Final Space,"I'm not a fan of Roger's ""no no no, it's cringe on purpose"" style of comedy, but I tolerated final space and enjoyed David Tennant's performance.

Annoying that it was cancelled."
Final Space,"So they didn’t even let the series finish, and now they are screwing Olan over again?"
Final Space,"I don't get WBD's end goal here at this point? Screwing over the creatives is going to make them less likely to want to work with you. As a consumer I am way less inclined to subscribe to any service they offer since products they offer can just get deleted permanently with no legal alternative (and it sucks that they are screwing over their employees).

Like sure they will have millions still watching who either don't know about this or don't care, but long term this can not be healthy for the company."
Final Space,"It's a problem with the digital age. If you don't have physical copies then the studio/service can take it away from you even if you paid for it. But hey, as long as it's convenient then people will buy it again and again. Data caps, cool, most of the services are owned by the ISPs, so win win."
Final Space,[olan is quite peeved](https://youtu.be/NAhNBr2Wytk)
Final Space,"If it's actually gone (or soon to be) and the IP owners have cancelled it, then wouldn't that make it okay to pirate ? No one's losing money, there's no product to be sold anymore, so no one loses. Rogers and the creative team would, I think, be happy that the show is still being watched and attracting new fans."
Final Space,"This is exactly what everyone who's been paying attention has been saying would happen since Batgirl. There's so many people in the comments of the O.G HBO/Warner media articles that are saying that people are overreacting, Batgirl was reportedly bad anyway so who cares, etc....


I expect there to be a lot more write-offs in the future."
Final Space,Pirate that shit.  It's the only ethical thing to do
Final Space,Such an underrated show too. We need to encourage DVDs & blu-rays even though I prefer streaming just in case they get axed.
Final Space,Chookity!!!
Final Space,"Okay, so here's the thing... Where the fuck even was it available? I saw season 1 somewhere and really liked it, then tried to find the other seasons and they were nowhere to be found. I never ended up watching past season 1."
Final Space,"Serious question: Does Zaslav want ANY programming, animated or otherwise, for WBD?"
Final Space,"There was a time when TV was truly impermanent. Networks would routinely tape over episodes in their archives to make space for newer programming. Famously the BBC allowed numerous episodes of Doctor Who to be lost to time. 

But we were led to believe in this age of information that everything would now be preserved and not lost due to incompetence or neglect. What we're discovering is that this hyper competitive stage in the streaming wars could result in the loss of many cult shows we subscribed to services for. All WBD services and shows have to be boycotted if we want to stop this from becoming endemic; it won't happen, but what other course of action exists?"
Final Space,It is insane that at the very least they can’t provide the creators with some sort of digital or physical copy.
Final Space,This is not what the internet was about. Erasing easily archivable art is dystopian asf. We have the most functional library to ever exist in the palm of our hands yet giant corps get to decide what content is allowed to stay and what will go
Final Space,I love owning nothing. It makes me feel very happy!
Final Space,I loved this show. Oh well I'll seed the high seas
Final Space,Stuff like this is why physical media is still relevant.
Final Space,We've actually enabled the creation of absolute monsters through these streaming services. They seem less accountable than cable and are approaching cable level costs anyway.
Final Space,"No fucking way. Oh my god this actually breaks my heart, this show was one of the few that got better with every season.

The fact that we will never seen how Gary and mooncake’s story ends is the worst news I’ve had all year."
Final Space,"WTF is up with WBD? This is horrible what they are doing to creators. Final Space was a damn good show. I watched all three season and have my DVR episodes ""archived"". Fuck WBD!"
Final Space,"So uh, who wants to make a website to stream all these animated series? I'll even turn off ad blocker, just don't give me viruses."
Final Space,"If ever there needed to be an argument for the return of physical media, this situation should support it. Within 10 years, the rennesaince we had in streaming services providing high quality and original content will be forgotten and many creative works will be gone forever. Piracy can't save them all."
Final Space,"Didn't we learn that these aren't being done for tax write-offs, but so they don't have to pay royalties? Which is imo is even worse since it's just penny pinching."
Final Space,Welp time to pirate this bitch and make it available to the world. Fuck the elites
Final Space,"So i guess since it lost ownership everyone with a copy is free to upload it everywhere?

That said. Just killing peoples creative IPs seems like something you could do a series about tbh.

reverse stranger things. All the IPs come back to haunt this moneygrubbing CO. 

Free use. Get at it!"
Final Space,"Damn, that sucks. Capitalism doesn't give a fuck about  art."
Final Space,I love final space. So good.
Final Space,This is a crime upon the universe.
Final Space,"I quit pirating a long time ago. But it looks like
Ima have to start that back just to secure this show"
Final Space,David Zaslav is a subhuman piece of shit
Final Space,"Wtf. Final Space is in top 3 favourite for animations! Anime is a difference category fyi.


I am so invested in the story. And another show that I have loved is cancelled. 

My condolences to Olan Rogers. I wish that he can bring closer to the series with another season or two!

Like seriously, I'm super bummed by this.
 Final Space is a great sci fi series that isn't a episode to episode animation/tv show.
This show made onions cry with how good it is."
Final Space,"This hurts. A lot. I’ve loved this show since I first saw it, and watched new episodes whenever I could. I felt myself connect with the characters, and to see all that hard work disappear because of the stupid decisions of someone who clearly couldn’t give less of a fuck about creators hurts more than anything. I hope that somehow, someday, we get to see Gary again. Godspeed Olan. Godspeed."
Final Space,[deleted]
Final Space,loved this show man smh
Final Space,Shit like this is the reason why I don’t want megacorps owning my characters
Final Space,"BuT pIrAcY iS hUrTinG cReAtOrS1!

If it is published with DRM it is not to be regarded as cultural canon. No project that receives public funds should be afflicted with DRM either.

Good luck to those of you who have come to feel passionate about a corporate owned product that existed not for you, but profit. Stop loving commercial IPs. It is the most devoid love immaginable. Even drugs love you more than public companies."
Final Space,"Olan Rogers is by far the most genuine, sincere, authentic, hard working, creative person to ever “make it”. Seeing this happen to him rips me to shreds. He’s the real deal underdog story. I don’t know him personally, but if I know anything about him, this will galvanize him and he will persevere to even greater heights. I truly admire this man and everything he’s done, the hardships he’s endured, and the people he’s helped along the way. He will get through this, and boy can I not wait to see what he comes up with next."
Final Space,Fuck. Can't they sell it?
Final Space,So was it good? Biased takes only.
Final Space,"In my opinion there has been a chance for an animation revival, and if that ever happens Warner Brothers is going to be the last place that any animators ever go. Hell, if Warner Bros just needs animators for any simple part of movie or show they'll struggle to find talent now. 

And this isn't just happening to animation, all talent is going to distrust Warner Bros now. Why dedicate yourself to a series if some corporate stooge will just write it off? The trust they are losing is way more valuable than the tax write-offs they are receiving. This is a CEO who is only thinking in the short term."
Final Space,this is why I always get DVDs. The Network can't come to my house and smash my DVDs
Final Space,"I loved this fucking show. Fuck... It's gone? Tax write off my ass. Fuck these corporations. Let's fuck them in their money hole. Warner Brothers can suck my ass. I'll never watch anything they do. DC comics, well they've already fucked that up. HBO Max, nope. I don't need to see the GRRM new thing, just finish the fucking books. I already went through Robert Jordan dying. GRRM, can't finish it. Fuck the whole series. Warner Brothers can't seem to get their head out of their ass."
Final Space,And studios wonder why piracy has been steadily increasing over the years….
Final Space,"From my understanding, these shows aren’t being canceled as tax write-offs but are being vaulted in effort to drive up value so they can be licensed to other platforms. 

Previously aired shows are not qualified for writing off. Batgirl is being written off as an expense before it is released. 

These are different business decisions. One is writing off expenses they don’t think they can recover otherwise. The other is to find another way to profit off of something they own but don’t believe a mass majority HBO Max subscribers care about."
Final Space,"If WBD has written it off -- i.e., they are counting the IP beyond its valuable lifetime -- then they would have a hard time arguing damages for pirating it."
Final Space,"I absolutely love this show,  and will support Olan in his quest to continue his beautiful story...."
Final Space,This is what happens when bean counters get to control the art
Final Space,"I think there’s a simple solution to all of this in that when a network declares a loss like this, then the project should go into the public domain."
Final Space,"Man, to have watched this dude from back in 2007-8 on Baloonshop go so far and then just be screwed over like this is brutal to see."
Final Space,Cellar boxing their own shows Jesus fucking christ what a disaster
Final Space,"Unpopular opinion but except for a lucky few, most people never get to write and produce an animated series period.  It sucks what happened to his show, but it’s not an injustice.  He rolled the dice and sold his idea to a company.  It’s the unfortunate risk you have to take if you want to make a television show.  He could have crowdsourced or animated a low rent version of it himself, but maybe it would have looked crappy.  Or maybe too hard and he would have given up.  I’m only playing devils advocate because it’s truly scary to partner with a big company, but if you want to grow sometimes you have to take a chance.  It sucks that this guy is understandably upset but it doesn’t mean there aren’t risks worth taking in entertainment."
Final Space,"I sure hope it’s good, because it’s about to occupy some bits"
Final Space,"I really liked the show. Gary was definitely a bit...much in season one, but they definitely toned him down in S2. They even called out reddit for saying how annoying Gary was so that was kinda funny."
Final Space,"And as is too common, there is in fact one way to continue watching it - through piracy, the very thing streaming was supposed to destroy."
Final Space,Streaming is a fucking travesty for media preservation.
Final Space,I have all the episodes backed up on my hard drive at 1080p.i love this show and hope it gets the love it deserves.
Final Space,Fuck WB!!! They’re ruining a bunch of shit just so they don’t have to pay their taxes… it’s gross and an obvious abuse of power… so many people losing their jobs just so the execs can line their pockets. FUCK THE RICH
Final Space,This is why Physical copies are important.
Final Space,Chookity-pok!
Final Space,Season one was pretty remarkable imo
Final Space,"When companies do this, the media should enter the public domain as a consequence."
Final Space,would you let a museum burn art to save on taxes.
Final Space,"We're going to see more of this and not just on HBOMax. Particularly with shows that don't kill it with viewership or have large audiences. Networks are still on the hook for things like hosting, artist royalties, etc. for anything on the platform and the finances don't always work. 

In the past, a show would end and nobody would be able to see it unless it was one that made it into syndication and get a second life and a new revenue stream for networks. Then came aftermarket VHS and DVDs that opened up another stream for networks. Shows with a smaller/non-syndication size numbers could still make $$. 

Then with streaming we simultaneously grew accustom to having literally anything we want available at our fingertips for a flat monthly fee no matter how small or niche the show (everything is essentially ""in syndication"" without the obvious payday for networks). Add on physical sales plummeting, we're essentially back to where we were decades ago with less choice in the market. 

It really sucks for Rogers, while there's more outlets than ever for a creator to get something greenlit, unless they make massive hits they have less places for said project to land on the back end."
Final Space,"Sorry to see this. Gary kinda annoys me a little, but this is a really good series. Worth a watch."
Final Space,[removed]
Final Space,"I mean, sounds like a shame but also the first I ever heard of this show. 

Maybe you spent 5 years of your life on a dud."
Final Space,[deleted]
Final Space,"Uhm yea, that’s entertainment bro"
Final Space,I'd it was a better show it wouldn't have gotten canceled
Final Space,"Why are so many of these comments so passive, ""oh that sucks, hopefully someone can save this series!""

Everyone should be posting let's pirate this show and save if from being forgotten. 

It's up to you to preserve art you enjoy. This story should not be a tragedy it should be a wake up call.

I use piracy to keep a backup of every videogame, show or movie I purchase and enjoy, I don't trust any company to preserve art anymore."
Final Space,That’s a bummer
Final Space,dude has had an interesting career since I first saw him making random gibberish videos on youtube.
Final Space,That’s upsetting. Hopefully it lives on piracy.
Final Space,"Welp, back to torrenting all my favourite shows I guess."
Final Space,"Welp... I'd say this is appropriate:

Play the good stuff, Hue!

The good stuff:

[When The Darkness Comes by Shelby Merry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9--uTfjP2o&ab_channel=ShelbyMerry)"
Final Space,Does that mean we will never see Cookie Wife and Cookie kids again?! No more chopping Wood!? Sad times… screw you WBD
Final Space,Chookity :(
Final Space,"FFS, this was a really good show.   
It broke the mold a little bit, and should have been given a few more seasons for sure."
Final Space,"They are companies, companies dont care for you. one day they just remplace you with someone else.

They have to start think on there self when they signe contracts. like set something that allow they to shop the show if the main company does things like this."
Final Space,Long live balloon shop
Final Space,Such a great series that ended too soon.
Final Space,It pains me as a fan. I hope we can find a way to purchase it for our own collections.
Final Space,"That’s messed up. All of these tax write offs are awful, but a show that lasted three seasons?!"
Final Space,Paying for a decent VPN is cheaper than having a couple subscriptions to streaming services that want to suck everything they can from you.
Final Space,"I loved Final Space. It was funny, poignant, and quite a trip."
Final Space,"Man this sucks, Final Space may not have been for everyone but it is one of very few genuinely unique shows I have seen in a long time."
Final Space,Sounds like a good time to get the Balloonshop crew back together!
Final Space,"Man this just fucking blows. It's Bravest Warriors all over again, but without the first few seasons being basically immortalized by official releases on YouTube."
Final Space,"This is a show I really enjoyed a lot season 1 and went down on 2 and I can't say I finished that one. Was making my mind about do a rerun of season 2 and finish the whole thing expecting maybe I would come around, like when I had time. Maybe I need to get to it soon before it goes out here on Netflix too. It's really bad when companies dicide to just take shit out of any possible source. It's the fucking internet, shit it was supposed to be available there forever"
Final Space,First knew Olan from BalloonShop on YouTube. It’s amazing how far he’s come
Sirius the Jaeger,"I don't think I've seen that one on TV, but all of the Mayhem commercials are posted on Allstate's youtube page: http://www.youtube.com/user/allstate"
Something About 1%,"Just changing channels and having something that will like catch my attention, also helped having a lot of procedurals where I didn't really need to know the plot.

Also back in the day if there was something on TV on the weekend most people will have likely watched that same thing by the beginning of the week and easy to talk about it. Now... people probably don't want to talk about a show until they get time to binge watch it. Then again things like reddit were not quite as prominent so easier to find another community for it."
Something About 1%,"Holliday episodes where whacky fun shit happens because “just because”

Something About 1%,Saturday morning cartoons
Something About 1%,"I've pretty much gone full circle in that I appreciate weekly episodes instead of full season drops. Some shows seems to need that gap between episodes so that you can talk about it, analyze and build up anticipation for next week.

I do however like that TV are more ""movie like"" with a full story arc over a season and higher production value."
Something About 1%,"The classic writing structure of traditional tv. Each 45 minute episode had a set-up, a climax and something at the end that made you wanna tune in again next week (could be a cliffhanger, could also just be an emotionally satisfying end of the specific episode arc that gave you happy feels). 

That style of writing made it happen that viewers still - many years later - distinctly remember specific episodes of LOST or Buffy or early Supernatural.

New shows written for the binge model tend to blur together. You remember individual scenes more than full episodes. Lots of episodes just kinda end and continue in the next one, with not much thought about when to make the cut. The biggest downside for me of treating every story like an 8 hour movie and not like a tv show."
Something About 1%,">it gave fans a predictable timetable of when they could expect their shows to come back, whereas now, not only do most shows take over one year to come back, but it varies between seasons.

I do miss that. While the downsides of that system outweigh the benefits (I'm happier without it), I do acknowledge that there was a benefit to predictability. The 2-year gap between the end of S5 of Better Call Saul and the premiere of S6 was brutal."
Something About 1%,I miss the 20 episode seasons
Something About 1%,Cultural zeitgeist
Something About 1%,"This is gonna be weird, but the idea that you don't have much of a choice on what's on.

It's like that BDSM thing where people get off on being told what to do. Streaming lets us have all these choices, but we sometimes get paralyzed and end up watching nothing. 

TV forces you to just accept what's on and you won't be inclined to switch channels or put shows on hold because there's no way to watch what you missed."
Something About 1%,"Im sure others can think of more examples but I inly know of one that comes to mind but it was viral advertising for shows. During I think season 2 of Lost, after episodes aired, a fake Oceanic Airlines ad would run, it had a number to call and the number would play a strange message. It basically led to an ARG game through a website that provided more mysteries and lore into the island and such."
Something About 1%,"Shouting ""it's ONNNNN"" as the show comes back from commercial and hearing madly running feet as everyone hurries to make it back in time.

It was also very different when there was no guarantee that there would necessarily ever be re-runs of anything, so there was at least some sense that this might be the only time you could experience something.  Now you get people saying 'well I'm looking forward to seeing how this works for me on a rewatch' almost as soon as a new series drops, which is for sure a nice option to have, but a very different experience with the stories."
Something About 1%,I miss premiere week in September and watching all my shows until May where they would all end roughly around the same time. I also miss watching the new episodes live rather than just watching the new episode whenever it is released in the day.
Something About 1%,"The expectation that you could watch a random episode of a show you'd never seen before and get a complete story with a beginning, middle and end. And if there was anything from past episodes that was relevant to that story, the show would fill you in with some exposition or *maybe* a ""Previously on..."" sequence at the beginning.

The expectation's flipped now: people expect everything to be serialised instead. I got into watching Star Trek on TV when I was a kid by watching random episodes I rented on video, and I knew that would work fine. Now you see people all the time being like ""*But where do I staaaaaaaaaaarrrt?!?!?*"""
Something About 1%,"I miss the watercooler aspect of discussing TV shows.

With a lot of streaming stuff being released all at once, it does not have the staying power that shows in the past did, because you don't give it time to build.

Hell, I remember Stranger Things S4 a lot better than I do the other seasons, just because they broke it up in half."
Something About 1%,"Yearly releases and 20-24 episode seasons. 

These nearly 2yr or longer breaks between seasons, which was happening even before Covid, is generally a death sentence for show. Rarely do shows have these long breaks and survive after the second season mostly due to the lack of advertising that the next season is even coming out. On top of that by the time the next season comes out you have mostly forgotten what happened in the previous season and have to go watch or read recaps just so you're not completely lost. Hunters is a great example of this, the first season was at the very beginning of 2020 and the second season just dropped in January so 3yrs between the seasons it's been so long we forgot most of what happened besides which main characters had been killed so we tried to rewatch some of the first season just to refresh, but unfortunately it turned out Amazon had re-edited the entire first season cutting out nearly 2hrs of content and actually cut some very important character development scenes.

I'm not saying every show needs 20-24 episode seasons, but half hour sitcoms need more than 8-10 episodes. You are just barely getting to know the characters and as soon as you are getting into the show it's already over especially with how they drop all the episodes at once rather than weekly so you have a burst of people talking about it for about a week and then it's completely forgotten about until you hear it's been canceled."
Something About 1%,Episodes that were basically just there to develop character. Every single thing is just plot nowadays. I Miss the balance
Something About 1%,"Honestly, all the ""discourse"" that surrounds every TV show is exhausting now. TV and movies were better without any of that intensity.

There is so much pre-release and post-release discussion and hype around every show and movie now. It feels like it takes away from the experience of just watching something and enjoying it, instead of having a million people try to bombard you with their hot takes online."
Something About 1%,"Randomly starting a show, from episode 14 season 3 because thats when you zipped and it was on, and now you watch it."
Something About 1%,"1. Episodic television. Obviously, story arcs are superior, but since Netflix has taken over, most streaming shows have this ""everything is one long movie"" approach to storytelling when most shows don't have a main story arc to justify it. 
A lot of shows would be better with a few single-story episodes with a story arc around it so your television show doesn't feel like one big slog with no variety in between the episodes. 

2. I miss 13 episode seasons. Definitely felt like that was the sweet spot between too much, 22-episode seasons and currently not enough 8-episode seasons."
Something About 1%,"The timing and hype.

LOST always comes to mind.  At its peak, I remember everyone HAD to be home watching.  During the week between episodes, there was so much speculation and discussion about what was going to happen.  It was like a weekly, mass event.

Now I feel like I'm always an episode behind, and always amazed at how everyone else seemed to find the time to binge 12 hrs of a new season all in a weekend while I'm on episode 3 of 12."

2. Being excited in the fall when TV shows came back and sweeps weeks because you knew they'd throw their best at you.  Now shows come with such unpredictability that it just feels random.
3. Finally, the way TV shows would mark the passing of time during the week.  You knew what was on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday and so on.  It sort of set the tone for your whole week.  Objectively, on demand is better.  But I do kind of miss how excitement would build during the week and then you made sure you were home when the shows you really liked came on, or if you were desperate, set up a VCR.  Now I often don't even realize when new episodes have come out because it's all on demand.  I just check the streaming services and see what's new, but I don't normally think ""Thursday night, here's what is coming on."""

Don’t get me wrong, on the whole streaming is better. But the whole having to actively decide what to watch is annoying sometimes. Sometimes I just want to flip until I find something good enough. 

I realize of course I could still get cable and flip channels, but the commercials on non-streaming have gotten way out of control."
Something About 1%,"I miss finding a show because you stumble upon it while channel surfing and you would have ignored it otherwise. Many shows owe their success to being found this way and word of mouth spreading.

Now we are just fed content that is similar to everything you’ve watched before because of algorithms.

It’s an issue and what has happened to Music. Smaller artists complain they get less listens than they would before streaming because they are ignored - people listen to what is fed to them and can’t be discovered"
Something About 1%,"I miss being able to talk about tv shows with people in real life as opposed to just online.  When I was young, there were 3 or 4 channels and at any given time only one or maybe two of those channels would be showing anything that appealed to children, or women, or men or whatever demographic you were in.  So, the next day you could talk to whoever was at school or in the office about what you watched the night before because at least half the people around you would have watched the same thing.  Now, not only am I not watching the same shows, I have never heard of most of the shows that my friends are watching and they have never heard of the shows I am watching.  And we are the same demographic (middle aged, suburban soccer moms)!  If I want to talk about something I am watching I have to go online and talk to strangers."
Something About 1%,"I miss the bumpers. Not commercials but the ways that networks would create a feeling of watching their channel almost as if it were watching a stage get ready in-between scenes. 

Bumpers really gave you a different feeling about TV it feels like an experience and not just media straight to the eyeballs."
Something About 1%,"Something that really ended with GoT and hasn't come back even with shows like White Lotus and Last of Us: A singular television show that we can all gather around. 

There's just sooooo much content out there that even the most popular shows are only watched and spoken about by a fraction of people for a fraction of the time. So much joy of television is in the conversations with others and some of the magic is lost when so few people are watching something or everyone is watching so much their attention is split. 

The other thing... its impact on movies. I legitimately miss the theater experience. I go once in a blue moon when there's truly a movie I want to see or believe it should be seen on the big screen. But ultimately, every time is so expensive that it's hard to justify. 

I genuinely believe a critical factor to the loss of the theater movie that isn't superhero or some big action film is because everything else just goes to streaming."

Something About 1%,"Not something I miss particularly, but I understand their purpose: Filler episodes.

Filler episodes have their purpose, mainly to give some time for actors, writers and crews, they allow to be filmed in such a way they take less days to shoot, and some of the scenarii are written in advance, they also allow to change stuff up when needed, an accident, a death of an actor or a public personality (exterior to the show) or an important event.

Also they help form new writers, something that is lacking in the streaming/binging format. You get all those shows nowaday, but no real experienced writers in it
The 22-26 episodes format allowed to have some episode with rookie writer taking the helm (with some supervision from the head writer) and do their stuff and learn more.

Now, we get stuff like The Witcher, The Wheel of Time, LotR, etc... where writers want to make their mark but disregarding 30, 40, 80 years of lore... and getting a subpar product and the rage of fans.

If you compare that to other show like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Gilmore Girls, NYPD Blue, Lost, Bones, Veronica Mars, to name a few of different genre, they all have some stuff in common, they all have a clear head writer/show runner, they all have filler episodes, but they all have a lot of writers, some more experienced and other less so. But some of those lesser known writers gained fame and are now trusted to have their own project. This happens rarely with the new streaming/binging format, unless they landed one of those now trusted writers."

Something About 1%,"Yup - I miss the TV season and episode releasing weekly. It was nice having the summer with just summer programming, or repeats.


I also liked having water cooler shows - now instead of a bunch of theorycrafting week by week and between the breaks, it's people watch at whatever speed and there's no real discussions. It was also nice when shows went on hiatus, there was time for people to catch up!


Now we're just inundated with shit and shows have to sink or swim - no giving them time to try to thrive, if they don't get finished in 3 weeks the series gets cancelled.


Also, filler.


8 episode seasons suck. There, I said it. Sometimes, plots need time to breathe - it doesn't have to go bam bam bam all plot all the time. Just plot doesn't let us learn as much about the characters as we would if there was at least a bit of filler. Filler episodes help us learn a lot about the characters and who they are."
Something About 1%,"I miss sweeps week. When shows would do the craziest stuff to get viewers.  Also one off episodes of shows with large casts so they can focus on one character who normally doesn't get enough time, or just an episode where they can goof off like in a timeloop or something.  Stuff like that is why the characters from older shows are so iconic and well remembered."

Something About 1%,"Turning on the TV and having it come on immediately, in the middle of whatever show was airing on the channel it was last on. Then you could change the channel and it was immediate.

Nowadays I turn on the TV and it takes some time to boot up. Then I have scroll to select a streaming service then I have to scroll to a show (or perform a search).

Something About 1%,"I have largely lost interest in TV, and while I do overall prefer the 'prestige format' and emphasis on cohesive, bigger budget production, I also miss the 90s and early 2000s when a season was like 22+ episodes. I kinda miss the 'dud' episodes, the filler eps that lengthened out even the best shows. 

X-Files, Buffy, and Millennium were all shows I really enjoyed, for example, and they all had episodes that felt lazy and uninspired AF. I kinda miss having those. Now that the emphasis is on quality and a cinematic feel, shitty episodes are judged more harshly, and a lot of times the creators are frustrated because they aren't trying to make duds-- whereas in the past, I think dud-episodes were more of a reality of creating, and creators would be aware going into filming that particular episodes occupied some space between filler and trash."
Something About 1%,Scheduling. I do binge but sometimes it's over too quick and you're waiting sometimes years for more. I used to like the clearing your schedule getting everything ready for the day and time of your favourite show. Making it a special event during the week. Some shows are still released weekly. Like the Peripheral on Amazon came out every Friday. Good show but also gave me something to look forward to.
Something About 1%,I don’t miss a single thing about regular TV.  Not one.
Something About 1%,"Prime time TV watching, Just contemplate the ""must see TV wars""  you had amazing line ups of shows and each channel tried to out do the next.  Which I think led to better shows, they didn't cater to a special interest group but to the masses. Also you had special episodes (google what happened to the NYC sewer system after the Mash Finale) holiday episodes, there's nothing like that now.  You also could setup a weekly cliff hanger MUCH easier.  Think about the first 2 seasons of LOST, or Alias or the original Quantum leap.  They left you guessing for A WEEK or more.  Now all TV shows play out like a movie, because there's no need for a cliffhanger, people just click start next episode.  


Commercials- yes commercials suck but hear me out on this one.  You watch TV now what do you see pharma and insurance ads.  Back then commercials were a spectacle in themselves.  In the hay day of traditional TV you had the Bud commercials, Trailers for new shows and movies, clothing ads, Food ads (Doritos, Pepsi, Coke, McDs, BK, etc.), Computers video games the list went on, and some of these ads were short stories underlying a bigger narrative or ad campaign.  Then there were the jingles and slogans."

Something About 1%,I really miss having my Thursday night comedies on NBC on a two hour block.
Something About 1%,"Not much, but streaming has largely eliminated the water-cooler casual discussions.  You get to have it with some shows, but that is only on the internet with the rabid fans who watch it right away.  This leads to more extreme (and sometimes toxic) discussions."

Something About 1%,"I guess I miss the fact that in the old days, I could channel surf and discover new stuff.  Technically I still can, but there's so much out there that I'm not going to discover via channel surfing because its all on streaming.

Something About 1%,Nothing!
Something About 1%,"Honestly, nothing. 

I spent way more time in front of the TV when I could channel surf, I'd watch whatever was on Comedy Central before or after ""The Daily Show"" or whatnot, and it was fine, but I don't really mind having that time back, even if it's just sleeping a bit more. 

The amount of stuff out there is overwhelming, and it all being spaced out over 20 different streaming services is infuriating (I have hope this will eventually resolve itself because people aren't going to pay for more than, i dunno, 4?) but it was overwhelming in the days of cable as well, we just didn't hear about as many shows because there wasn't social media?"
Something About 1%,"I might be the only person to say this, but the thing I miss the most is ad breaks. I don't why, but something about them gave life to the tv experience. It also helped make hour long episodes hold your attention for longer. Streaming by comparison feels much lonelier. Even advertisements on services like YouTube feel a bit hollow. It may be just me who has this opinion, but I wish live tv with ad breaks was more popular."
Something About 1%,Not a damn thing.  Traditional TV was a pain in the ass.  Especially pre-DVR and OnDemand.
Something About 1%,"20+ episode seasons.

Even ""filler"" episodes, that people constantly complain about, have meaningful character development and lore. Streaming shows are so laser-focused that each season is over by the time i start to partially get invested or care about anything. Disney+ is the worst at this. An average 6 episodes that are maybe 30min long."
Something About 1%,Nice idea but you’re going to have to watch a commercial every 5 minutes. Read a book
Something About 1%,"I miss the sense of community; I'm old enough to remember 3 networks and if the President was on, the night was ruined.

We all had to watch the same shows at the same time. If you missed a week, you had to pray it would show up in a rerun, or you'd never see that episode. (Prior to syndication, of course.) 

Now, I'm married with two kids and three grandkids, and between all the streamers and DVR stuff, we all have to wait for each other to catch up with shows before we can talk about 'em."
Something About 1%,"Just having a standalone story or adventure with well-developed characters, without the creators worrying or fans complaining that it's ""filler"" for not adding into some uninteresting series-long arc."
Something About 1%,"I like bottle episodes now and then. Cast encounters a problem, resolves it, job done. Not everything is part of a huge dramatic and sometimes exhausting multi-season arc. Maybe they'll reference it in an episode one season later, maybe not.

As a corollary, the writers had to make the episode interesting in and of itself, and not rely on mystery box teasing.

The best shows had a bit of both. X-Files had monster of the week, but also had the ongoing plot about the alien invasion and government's involvement, Fox's missing sister, etc.

House had some major arcs between characters, but most episodes were patient of the week.

It let you get to know the characters more. Like with Star Trek: Discovery, I remember so little of the characters because it was 3 seasons of them dealing with quadrant ending threats almost from start to finish. 

I also miss being able to talk about shows with friends or coworkers more. Because there were fewer shows on, and they aired at the same time, everyone was ""caught up"". Now you have to have picked the same streaming show, and be watching at roughly the same time."

I really wish I could be left alone and my time and attention respected just for once."
Something About 1%,"I just seriously miss the summer break.  I have to admit that I am sadly addicted to TV and as a kid the summer gave me a chance to keep the TV off and enjoy other things.

Something About 1%,"Not that i like comercials but back when tv was king a lot of companies would put in effort with their comercials. now with a large amount of people watching shows online or via streaming the incentive to still put that effort in just doesn't exsit because people can skip ads or play on their phone until it's over.

There's always a tradeoff, even if it's a small one.

And there's always marketing involved - sound equipment to be paid for, radios and TVs and color TVs to be sold. Part of the marketing has always been to convince people that the old style has nothing to recommend it. That marketing line (which isn't exclusive to the entertainment field) is almost never true, and isn't likely to be true now."

A Place Further than the Universe,One of my favorite anime shows of all time
A Place Further than the Universe,"It was an amazing series for sure, but I just wanna say the theme song and credits song were absolute bangers."
A Place Further than the Universe,"At times it can be pretty hard to recommend anime to people. 

And sadly A Place Further the Universe does not have an English dub and in America is only available on the anime centric streaming sites Crunchyroll and VRV(You can watch Crunchyroll without a subscription if you are ok with ads or get a free trial month) as opposed to something like Hulu or Netflix which most people have.

But apart from those two difficulties it's probably one of the most accessible and touching anime series out there. Four teen girls seek to journey to Antarctica to fulfill personal inner goals in one of the most inspiring series I've seen. Warning after you finish watching it you may find yourself questioning if you're doing enough with your life, be careful and try to avoid booking yourself a trip to Antarctica before you can stop yourself. 

A short, extremely beautifully animated and complete story (no chance of  sequelitis or stretching story out) about doing something, overcoming grief and forging strong friendship"
A Place Further than the Universe,"Halfway through this, it's a very wholesome watch. All the girls watching the sunrise view from the mountain is a brilliant moment, as is ""breakup rejected"". Also laughed my ass off at her father begging for forgiveness from outside the front door."
A Place Further than the Universe," Beautiful show, one of three to make me cry"
A Place Further than the Universe,"Even if you don't like anime, even if you hate it, don't sleep on this show. Genuinely improved my life, and it has more heart than 99% of western shows could even dream of. Easiest 10/10 I've ever given."
A Place Further than the Universe,"Note this doesn't feature any romance, violence/gore but does deal with grief.  
Nothing racy/sexual (apart from a quick joke that the girls are too innocent to understand that a temp job posting that pays way too much is obviously using euphemisms until it's pointed out).  


It also has some very cute penguins.   The animation style is beautiful but does sometimes look a bit like stickers due to white outlines (you'll understand what I mean when you watch it)."
A Place Further than the Universe,"I'll check it out.

I've been watching The Daily Life Of The Immortal King and it's awesome. I'm also reading it too."

A Place Further than the Universe,"One of my favorite shows period. So, so good."
A Place Further than the Universe,[The Girls are Alright](https://youtu.be/DaTzRcSyEWc)
A Place Further than the Universe,"I have to admit, I was one of those people who thought it was one of those ""cute girls doing cute things"" shows and ignored it.

I ended up watching it this year as a sort of covid relief. Boy was I wrong- my assumption did a disservice to what is, I felt, a great character story.

Partly out of my assumption as of it being a trend chaser, I was also surprised at how much quality it had. There's a lot of just ""good enough"" animation out there these days that ignores the little life-giving details, but this isn't one of them. The characters instead come to life with through their animation, and that's only one part. The directing, writing, and even the cinematography (is that the right word for this? Or is that only live action?) all come together to make much more than the pastiche I was expecting into nothing less than a labor of love.

I don't watch much anime these days but this was a pleasant reminder of what I like about the medium at its best. It's vibrant and it has heart."
A Place Further than the Universe,What are the other two?
A Place Further than the Universe,I loved the ED more for the show.
A Place Further than the Universe,Anohana and fruits basket the finale
A Place Further than the Universe,"I don't suppose you could add a brief few sentences/words selling us on the series and why they're worth a watch and what makes them special? To me, I just see a laundry list of titles and genres honestly. 

Knowing the animation studio and year released is pretty much meaningless for knowing the quality of character development and plot depth."

I was confused for a second there, then realized thats the English name for Kekkai Sensen."
A Place Further than the Universe,"Konosuba definitely should be on here for it's hilarious subversion, wherein everyone seems nice but are terrible people"
A Place Further than the Universe,My Hero Academia is also really excellent.
A Place Further than the Universe,"I think you can also add Megalo Box to this list. While the ending wasn't as good, rest of the show was still great, and might actually suit most of the audience here. The old school animation and design, etc. "
A Place Further than the Universe,"Next time I would include Animes that would appeal to Western Taste. Most of these will not be appealing for the general audience. 

Some good animes for the Western Taste (2010s only):

One-Punch Man (Action/Comedy. An overpowered dude that is a hero for fun).


My Hero Academica (Action/Coming of Age story. A weak powerless boy gets the most powerful superpower in the world and his tale to master this power without breaking everything in his body using it.)


Psycho Pass (Thriller/Crime. Dystopian Future where police kills everyone who has a hint of mental instability)

Parasyte (Thriller/Horror. Dude gets infected by an alien parasite but the infection doesn't go as planned.)

Edit: Forgot to add that these all have English Dubs. Most of the list above do not.
"
A Place Further than the Universe,"Gundam: Iron Blooded Orphans
Is a great one, its serious, the animation looks great, it does get dark because it deals with children piloting the mechs"
A Place Further than the Universe,"First, thank you putting this list together and trying to offer more exposure to an entire medium/format/genre (Japanese animation) that is, imo, underappreciated in the west. Now, on to a few thoughts/opinions:

When people actually ask for recommendations, it's best not to overwhelm them with options else they might feel overwhelmed and give up. If they get a response of ""Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, Death Note"" then they already have ~100 hours of watching ahead of them and those are totally fine options. 

There's a lot of comedy and slice of life on this list. While more variety sounds better on paper, I don't think those genres work as well as others with a language/culture barrier. They're usually more character focused and thus body language, dialog, inflection, dialect, translation, nuance, delivery, inside jokes, locality, animation style, etc. become more important. The usual Cowboy Bebop recommendations are generally more serious, conceptual, sci-fi, psychological, seinen, action, mystery -type series that show off what ""adult"" animation is capable of which result in more ""wow!"" experiences (and western media ""borrowing"" from them). The unfortunate ""anime stigma"" in the west is that anime is perverted and characters look/act like 12yo children (which westerners already have in the form of youth-targeted cartoons). So, while I personally really enjoy something like Kill La Kill, I don't think the over-the-top action, ridiculous plot, and easily misinterpreted sexualization would be a good starting point/leave a good first impression for the uninitiated. 

This list is great for those who have already watched most of the popular recommendations for westerners and want to branch out a bit more. That said, new fans should keep in mind that they'll probably dislike 95% of all anime produced. I've watched 300+ series and I wouldn't go anywhere near some of the stuff on this list. And that's OK; it's common with most hobbies/interests. Find what you like, look for more, have fun with it, share your experiences!

For reference, my favorite TV (top 10, random order):

* Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul
* Game of Thrones
* Westworld

A Place Further than the Universe,Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt
A Place Further than the Universe,"I was kinda hoping you would list [Uchuu Kyoudai](https://myanimelist.net/anime/12431/Uchuu_Kyoudai ) or Space Brothers in English.  Pretty good slice of life/sci fi about becoming an Astronaut.   Here is the [trailer with English sub for it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciS3fDqT1Vw )

Another series maybe not considered in the past decade is [Hajime No Ippo](https://myanimelist.net/anime/263/Hajime_no_Ippo ) even though the 3rd season (Hajime No Ippo: Rising) came out in 2013/2014.  Its a great sport/slice of life/comedy series."
A Place Further than the Universe,Needs more Jojo
A Place Further than the Universe,"i like cowboy bebop, ghost in the shell, FMA, samurai champloo

basically anime that does not rely on anime troupes and tells a great story, what would you recommend from this decade?

edit: action oriented is a plus"
A Place Further than the Universe,I'd like to throw a shout for Terror in Resonance too. Great show
A Place Further than the Universe,"Barakamon and Girls' Last Tour are two of my absolute favorite shows, and I'm pretty happy to see them make the list. Sora no Woto is up there too.

Those three are all slice-of-life type shows, a genre that can be pretty hit or miss, but these three do a great job of building a world (or a town, as in Barakamon) and making you keep watching because you're interested in that world, and the characters, even if there's no overreaching plot trying to tie everything together. They aren't necessarily exciting, but they're thoroughly enjoyable. And sometimes you just need a nice calm show like that."
A Place Further than the Universe,Kind of a weird post. I'd expect at least a sorry description with each show. A genre doesn't really cut it.
A Place Further than the Universe,"**Sora no Woto** is surprisingly good. Definitely not what I expected. It's part slice of life, part post-apocalypse, and also an anti-war story. And the music is fantastic. Occasionally feels like **Kino's Journey**, but somwhat less bleak. 

***
**Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu** is a slow burn, but is an exceptionally good period drama set in the post-postwar era where the Japanese economy was beginning to pick up again. One of the popular forms of entertainment was a style of traditonal comic storytelling called Rakugo. In an era where not many had televisions yet, they were often broadcast on radio. 

A recently released convict approaches one of the masters of this artform to become his disciple after having only heard his radio broadcasts in prison. Drama ensues. Lots of dialogue as you may expect. **Joshiraku** is a much less serious take on Rakugo, if you like terrible puns and Japanese cultural references you won't understand, this is for you. 

***
**Natsume's Book of Friends** is really one of the most heartbreaking yet heartwarming series I've ever seen. Main character is the only person who can see the denizens of the spirit world, resulting in him being ostracised by almost every human he meets due to his reaction to heir presence, but returning to his grandmother's hometown changes that, for better or worse. Partly episodic, but with some overarching plot. For another contemporary fantasy series that's kind of similar, try **The Ancient Magus' Bride**. **Mushishi** is also excellent and has a similar spirit detective vibe, but much more serious. "
A Place Further than the Universe,Didn't see Steins Gate on here..... Better than 90% 0f the things listed

A Place Further than the Universe,"I’m not a huge anime fan. But I watched Erased recently... good lord that’s a fantastic show. Cool plot, good characters, good mystery. Plays on a fantasy I think a lot of people have at least once in their life. And there’s only one season. They got in, told their story, and got out."

I can recommend darling in the franxx."
A Place Further than the Universe,"If you are looking for slow burn anime's that don't have your typical Japanese pervy tropes, watch Mushishi and Monster. Masterpieces imo."
A Place Further than the Universe,"Blood Blockade Battlefront, Mob Psycho, and Made in Abyss are all in my top 10 anime. Very solid shows. "
A Place Further than the Universe,"What do you guys recommend as good mindfuck mystery type ones?

in the vein of Mirrai Nikki, Madoka Magica, Shinsekai yori"
A Place Further than the Universe,"My anime background is just the classics and most well known (DragonBall, Naruto, Bleach). Right now my only base for anime is Netflix. I've watched Attack on Titan, Tokyo Ghoul, Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, Sinbad, Death Note and One Punch Man, and currently I started watching Sword Art Online. 

Do you recommend it? Based on my viewing history and the Netflix catalogue what would you recommend I watch next?"
A Place Further than the Universe,I would say you’re missing Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure. Besides being awesome it’s a cultural touchstone in Anime that is constantly referenced and parodied. I would argue it’s a must watch show

A Place Further than the Universe,No love for Welcome to the N.H.K.?
A Place Further than the Universe,"I'm someone who haven't watched a lot of anime since about 2008 or so, so I'll check out some of these, thanks. 

That said, I feel like the medium has definitely changed a lot since that time. So many shows now have either very strange animation styles (Kill la Kill, Made in Abyss, Devilman Crybaby...) or these strange formulaic stock characters everywhere (at least I don't remember people talking about tsunderes and moes and I don't know what back in the day). I'm sure there's a lot of good stuff once you get past these things, but in most cases nowadays I don't get further than some weirdass synopsis before I sigh and re-watch Black Lagoon or Claymore instead. And I'm someone who, despite not immersing myself into the anime/""weabo"" culture, has after all read and watched quite a lot of manga and anime in my time, and someone who likes 'weird' stuff Evangelion or Gantz.

I think that's the reason why Attack on Titan has been such a hit here in the West, despite imho not being that good of a show (it seems to go for repeated 'shocks' over telling an engaging story). It has a pretty 'realistic' and good looking animation style, characters that for the most part look rather normal, and though the premise is a bit strange it's very straight-forward once it gets going."
A Place Further than the Universe,"Recently saw Made in Abyss because a lot of people have been raving about it.

The main characters are a girl of 14, and a robot that looks like a boy of about the same age.

I would like it a lot more, if there were not shit like recurring ""jokes"" where people look down the robot boys pants and exclaim that he has a penis. 

Like often when people were recommending it, I'd see em specify that it was not for children, and I kinda assumed that was because of horror elements or something. Like god dammit Japan."
A Place Further than the Universe,"Ummm...My Hero Academia?

It's an amazing shonen series with much better pacing, animation and characters than a lot of its contemporaries."
A Place Further than the Universe,"Another one I’d absolutely recommend if you’re looking for a more light hearted/comedic take on anime is “The Devil is a Part Timer”. 

Really funny, great story and quick watch. Premise is pretty simple, Devil comes back to earth and tries to take over the world...by working in fast food. 

If I’m not mistaken it’s still on Netflix, highly highly recommend."
A Place Further than the Universe,Parastye -the maxim- should 100% be on this list. 
A Place Further than the Universe,"I'm gonna use this thread to mention that, yes, One Piece has over 800 episodes, but it is probably the most pure fun that you can find while still managing to be epic, emotional and engaging. "
A Place Further than the Universe,"Your lie in april. 

Shokugeki no soma 

Nanatsu no taizai"
A Place Further than the Universe,I'll martyr myself and list Tokyo Ghoul. I guess it's become pretty 'normie' but i still really enjoyed it. Also The Lost Village was a pretty neat short one.
A Place Further than the Universe,I recognized so few animes in that list. Feel like you're missing a TON.
A Place Further than the Universe,"Damn. When you realize all of the super popular anime you liked as a kid aren’t part of this decade lol 

Old. "
A Place Further than the Universe,Does crunchyroll or funimation offer offline/download & play yet? That's been my biggest obstacle to consuming anime.
A Place Further than the Universe,Black Clover?
A Place Further than the Universe,.
A Place Further than the Universe,I would recommend Made in Abyss. Only one season and it's already one of my favorites.
A Place Further than the Universe,Beast Player Erin (Kemono no Sōja) is a really good one that I never hear anyone mention.
A Place Further than the Universe,"Pretty good list, though I'd add Higurashi (the official stuff, essentially seasons 1 and 2.) for how damn good it was it combining the slice of life with horror, especially the more psychological aspects. Umineko is different, but good just somewhat odd at times and feels better to read than merely watch. 
"
A Place Further than the Universe,"Baki 2018. Absolutely brutal fighting. If you are squeamish do not watch. It is metal as hell though, I love it.


I could probably recommend some others but I'll leave it at that."
A Place Further than the Universe,[deleted]
A Place Further than the Universe,"Don't forget to request to get new seasons of your favorite anime:

https://help.netflix.com/en/titlerequest"
A Place Further than the Universe,"I've only ever watched one anime in my adult life and that's Attack on Titan. I really enjoyed it but I'm fine not watching anything else. I have some personal hang ups about anime being ""for kids"", even the one tailored for mature audiences. "
A Place Further than the Universe,"Not only are these shows that fall out of the ""Same 10 anime"" thing. They're all shows that I can see actually getting people into anime. Shows like FMA:B and Death Note are shows that feel detached enough for people to think ""I'm not too sure about anime, but Fullmetal Alchemist is pretty good"" instead of ""hey maybe I like anime"". All of these shows (at least the ones I've seen) are both great and feel like anime. Good list.


I also want to boost March Comes in Like a Lion to anyone reading this. It's one of my favorite shows. It follows a 17 year old depressed professional Shogi player who just recently started living on his own. Over the course of the series you watch him open up to people and form a familiar relationship that he's never really had in his life. You don't need to know anything about Shogi to understand the show."
A Place Further than the Universe,"I'd like to think that Shouwa Genjou Rakugo Shinju is the pinnacle of anime in recent years. THE series that towers above the rest. It's not my favourite series for sure, but it comes incredibly close to perfection in so many ways. I doubt I'd recommend it to someone new to anime, but there's no excuse for anyone who calls themselves an avid fan of anime to not watch Rakugo. 

And then there's Ping Pong... The things I would give to see another series of this caliber. I'm so glad to see it on your list."
A Place Further than the Universe,All are pretty good except Yuru Camp and Flip Flappers
A Place Further than the Universe,"Kobayashi's Dragon Maid is probably the first new-ish anime I've fully watched in years, since Bodacious Space Pirates and Jormungand. It's poignant, cute, a little... creepy... but still heartily recommended."
A Place Further than the Universe,"I was never an Anime fan.  I remember enjoying Ninja Scroll back in the 90's, but that's about it.  Then one day 'Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress' popped up on Amazon Prime, and I clicked on it, because there was nothing else to watch.  Loved it.  As soon as I finished it, I wanted to see even more.  Attack on Titan was a recommendation I've heard over and over, so I started watching it next.  It was even better than the Iron Fortress.  The animation, the soundtrack, the story - they were all just perfect, and I couldn't wait for more.

While waiting for the next season, I was eager to see all the other great anime shows I've been missing out on.  But here's where the disappointment came.  I would check dozens of the top recommended shows, and they simply weren't my cup of tea.  Either the animation was looking like something made in the 80's, or the story was just meh.  I could barely watch one episode, before giving up in the search of the next Attack on Titan. 

It all made sense, when I found out both Attack on Titan, and Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress are made by the same studio.  I have yet to find any other anime show that comes close to those two.  And this is not me shitting on other shows.  I'm sure they're great, but they just don't do it for me.  There's just something about AoT or KotIF, whether it's the awesome visuals, or soundtrack, that put them in a league of their own."
A Place Further than the Universe,"No sword art online season 1?

What's the point?


Jk (though I do like SAO)

Great list op thanks for sharing"
A Place Further than the Universe,"Maybe doesn't *technically* count, but 48% of Gintama (and potentially more, maybe, hopefully) has come after your cutoff date, and imo Gintama is a legendary anime. Action/comedy, has survived multiple hiatuses, and has reportedly been more profitable than Bleach or Naruto in Western countries, made even more incredible due to its lack of an English dub or mainstream viewing channel (such as Cartoon Network's Toonami). Insane amounts of fun, and I'm incredibly sad to be seeing it go."
A Place Further than the Universe,[deleted]
A Place Further than the Universe,"Totally expected, but still dissapointed that there's no Yu-Gi-Oh. :p  
Just fits well with my personal taste.  
  
My favorite beyond that though is the old anime Ranma ½. Although the manga has better plots and characterization, love the animation, voices and music. :D"
A Place Further than the Universe,"Look at you making a worthless list that doesn't include whether there is a dub, which makes it awful, and by extension you awful."
A Place Further than the Universe,"Oh! I can do a brief rundown of all of them. Give me a few minutes and I'll be back with a few words about each.  


EDIT: OKAY! Here we go.

**Barakamon:** brash young calligrapher gets exiled to the boonies to find himself

**Blood Blockade Battlefront:** secret society of supers fight weird monsters in wacky New York

**Cells at Work:** Osmosis Jones but with a cute redhead as the lead instead of Chris Rock

**Chihayafuru:** Sports show about a poetry card game. Cooler than it sounds.

**Death Parade:** Bar in purgatory hosts games to judge souls’ fates

**The Eccentric Family:** An eccentric family of shapeshifters go about their lives

**Erased:** Time travel murder mystery where the time travel isn’t that big of a deal. Tearjerker.

**Flip Flappers:** I literally cannot describe it beyond “two magical girls and trippy world”

**Flying Witch:** Extremely relaxing show about a witch training in the countryside

**Girls’ Last Tour:** Two girls journey across a harsh post apocalyptic wasteland. Philosophy?

**Haikyuu:** Hot guys play volleyball. Character development.

**Hyouka:** Bored high schoolers solve boring mysteries. Show is anything but boring.

**K-On:** Cute high school girls play in a band and eat cake. Super comfy.

**Katanagatari:** Finding swords? Weird art style. Weirder dialogue.

**Kids on the Slope:** Realistic jazz coming of age in the 60s. Great music.

**Kill la Kill:** Skimpy lingerie battles at fascist high school. Way better than it sounds.

**Kyousogiga:** Similarly trippy, often confusing show about multidimensional family. Fantastic.

**Land of the Lustrous:** One of the few 3D CGI anime worth your time. About gem people, but not the Steven Universe kind.

**Little Witch Academia:** Harry Potter.

**Love, Chuunibyou, and Other Delusions:** Cute middle schoolers do things? Haven’t seen it.

**Lupin III:** Classic, classy thief steals riches and hearts. Got Miyazaki his start.

**Made in Abyss:** Don’t go exploring the big scary hole, kids. Don’t.\\

**March comes in like a Lion:** Drama about a chess prodigy and his relationships. One of the best. 

**Mawaru Penguindrum:** Brothers and penguins(?) try to help their sister. Haven’t seen it.

**Miss Kobayashi:** Fun, funny show about a woman who adopts a bunch of dragon people into her life

**Mob Psycho 100:** Cool, trippy, great action show about a kid with super psychic powers

**Monthly Girls’ Nozaki Kun:** High school girl’s crush on romance manga artist goes unnoticed; she becomes his assistant in this wacky, hilarious comedy about romance.

**My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU:** Catcher in the Rye if it were anime and there were three Holdens. Very good.

**Mushishi:** Cool-ass spirit detective does spirit detective shit

**Nagi no Asukara:** Very pretty show about water people(?) Haven’t seen it.

**Natsume’s Book of Friends:** Arguably the closest you’ll get to a Ghibli TV show. Guy has spirit friends.

**Nichijou:** Wacky sketch comedy about wacky insane people. Very good.

**Noragami:** Haven’t seen it …. a fallen god is trying to get back on his feet(?)

**Ore Monogatari:** Gentle giant falls in love with pint sized classmate. Adorable as fuck.

**Ping Pong the Animation:** Guys play ping pong, learn about themselves. Looks wacky. Is fantastic.

**A Place Further than the Universe:** Girls go to Antarctica. Sweet and touching show.

**Polar Bear Cafe:** Polar bears and other animals run a cafe (?) Haven’t seen it.

**Shinsekai Yori:** WORLDBUILDING. New generation of humans trying to figure out about themselves(?)

**Shirobako:** An anime show about making anime shows. It’s incredible, heartwarming and educational.

**Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu:** Stand up comedy but it’s sit-down comedy and it’s very old fashioned. Character drama about artists in a dying medium in the 60s, 70s, 80s, and beyond. Slow burn that’s easily one of the best shows of the last few years, anime or no.

**So Ra No Wo To:** Girls in a small brigade run an army corps of musicians. Also they have a tank? There’s more to it but I can’t remember.

**Sound Euphonium:** High school concert band, and all the character drama and shenanigans that go with it. Very good.

**Space Dandy:** About a dandy guy in space. Lots of sexual humor. From the guy who made Cowboy Bebop. 

**Tamako Market:** Girl living in a market district has fun shenanigans with friends. Warm and comfy. The talking bird grows on you. Oh, also there’s a dark-skinned prince who shows up.

**Tanaka kun is Always Restless:** haven’t seen this one -- it’s about a guy who’s always lazy. But supposedly it’s very good.

**Tatami Galaxy:** Very fast dialogue, weird visuals. About a guy figuring out his life in college. Once you get the hang of it, it’s very entertaining and relatable.

**Tsuki ga Kirei:** Adorable show about middle schoolers’ first love.

**Tsuritama:** Haven’t seen it. IIRC there’s a guy who’s like a mermaid? Comedy, I think.

**Usagi Drop:** Relaxing, sweet show about a bachelor who takes in his grandfather’s six year old daughter from an affair. 

**Violet Evergarden:** Gorgeous show about PTSD and a young woman who becomes a letter writer in a semi 1930s world. Don’t go in expecting an action show. 

**Yona of the Dawn:** Semi-historical action adventure about a princess and her crew who go rogue.

**Yuru Camp:** Comfy show about high schoolers camping. Will make you want to camp."

A Place Further than the Universe,"Nichijou, Ping Pong the Animation, Sound! Euphonium, Kyousougiga, and A Place Further than the Universe are my next biggest recommendations.

Also, I actually almost didn't include Noragami, as I had some problems with the 1st season, but damn was Noragami Aragoto amazing. It's everything I love about battle shounen (a genre I'm not really a fan of) but without the filler. Too bad we'll never get a 3rd season."
A Place Further than the Universe,"Haha yeah i decided to use english names unless it's so uncommon. I've seen a fair amount of people online refer to kekkai sensen by the english name, so i went with that. In contrast, I've literally never heard anyone call Nagi no Asukara by the english name: A Lull in the Sea."
A Place Further than the Universe,"Agreed. One could make an argument that it's the anime equivalent to It's Always Sunny. 

Not me obvious, but someone else could."
A Place Further than the Universe,"Watched it but didn't find it quite as funny as others. Then again, I actually like Isekai as a genre (I know some dismiss it) and would probably have recommended Overlord at least. Honorable mentions to Re:Zero, Death March, and even Knights & Magic IMO though I know that last one is held up by many as an example of what is wrong with Isekai shows. "
A Place Further than the Universe,"It's so popular I feel the OP decided it didn't need another shout out.

But yeah, it's a pretty good show."
A Place Further than the Universe,"It just annoys me how none of the heroes ever die.

A Place Further than the Universe,Watching that show only makes me pine for OPM that much more. 
A Place Further than the Universe,I feel it's just a copy of Naruto. 
A Place Further than the Universe,How does it compare in tone/style etc to Hajime no Ippo? Definitely loving the idea of another boxing anime.
A Place Further than the Universe,"Oh right, I should get around to watching that."
A Place Further than the Universe,"Parasyte is really good, Imagine Japanese Peter Parker turned into venom before he ever became spider-man, and takes the responsibility to make sure to the best of his ability that humans and alien body snatchers are able to co exist secretly without everyone dying. 

"
A Place Further than the Universe,I dunno those first two are the sort of over-recommended shows that the OP was trying to avoid. 
A Place Further than the Universe,"> Next time I would include Animes that would appeal to Western Taste

Baccano!"
A Place Further than the Universe,Psycho Pass season one is AMAZING

Yuri on Ice,"lol i don't get what's wrong with the title. maybe ""all talk, no dick"" would've been more familiar?"
Yuri on Ice,Cartoons about sports? No thanks.
Yuri on Ice,"I'm about halfway through season two of Haikyuu right now and I'm really enjoying it. I love how despite the necessary bending of time for the sake of story and character, they do as much as possible to ground the show in real tactics and explains itself and volleyball to the audience. Because of the writing the show could probably succeed with a much less realistic portrayal of sport but the fact that they put the effort in makes it that much better for me."
Yuri on Ice,No *Prince of Tennis* here?
Yuri on Ice,"Soccer also has:

- ""Area no Kishi"" (The Knight in the Area) 
- ""Keppeki Danshi! Aoyama-kun"" (Clean Freak! Aoyama-kun)

I don't know if they are on any streaming service or not since I don't use any."
Yuri on Ice,">Eyeshield 21

I really liked this show.  It was fun, exciting, funny. It showed an understanding of what makes American football a good sport.  Good depiction of why team sports in general bond diverse people together, even opponents.  Great depiction of how even if you have amazing talent you will need an insane amount of work to get anywhere."
Yuri on Ice,"I'll add a few more that you missed out:

# Football/soccer

**Aoki Densetsu Shoot!** *\[No official stream\]*

58 episodes and 1 short movie. No English dub.

>This anime is based on the manga, ""Shoot!"", which was published between 1990 and 2003. It won the 1994 Kodansha Manga Award for Shounen. The anime adaptation was broadcast from 1993 to 1994 and thus, does not cover the entirety of the manga. It tells the story of Tanaka Toshihiko (""Toshi"") and his 2 friends, Hiramatsu Kazuhiro and Shiraishi Kenji, who played football together during middle school and were known as the Kakenishi Middle School's Golden Trio, and now they have graduated to high school. In high school though, it's only Toshi who continues to play football. His 2 friends have dropped out of football due to their personal circumstances. They are still in the same high school, Kakegawa High School. The reason that Toshi joined Kakegawa High School is because of his football idol, Kubo Yoshiharu, who plays there. The portrayal of football in this anime is a bit more down to Earth compared with Captain Tsubasa, the preeminent football anime then. It is a contemporary of the basketball anime, Slam  Dunk.

**Hungry Heart: Wild Striker** *\[No official stream\]*

52 episodes. No English dub.

>This anime came out in 2002 at roughly the same time as the manga. It is the creation of Takahashi Youichi (the creator of Captain Tsubasa). Created to tap into the interest in football to tie-in with the 2002 World Cup jointly hosted by Japan and South Korea. The story is about Kanou Kyosuke, a teenage high school student, whose older brother, Kanou Seisuke, is a top Japanese professional football player that plays for A.C. Milan (they were giants in European football then). His older brother taught him how to play and love football but he finds himself being regularly compared to his older brother by others. This pressure of expectation made him lose his passion in the game. This anime covers his path back to find that passion again.

**Whistle!** *\[No official stream\]*

39 episodes. No English dub.

>Based on the manga of the same name. The English-translated manga is published by Viz Media. There are 24 volumes in total. The manga/anime is about a middle school boy named Kazamatsuri Sho who dreams of becoming a professional football player. However, he is short and not that good at it but he does have a passion for it and works hard to improve himself. He makes it into Musashi no Mori Junior High School which hosts a top class football team but he is way down the order. He transfers to Sakura Josui Junior High School to have a better chance to make it into the football team there. The school is not known for football but does have a football team there. When the Sakura Josui football team hears that he transferred in from Musashi no Mori, there were high expectations of him but he could not deliver those expectations. The anime covers his determination to improve himself and to defy the odds for a short player. It's a show that espouses positive values.

# Baseball

**Mix** *\[Funimation\]*

24 episodes. English dub available.

>This is the anime adaptation of Adachi Mitsuru's manga of the same name. The manga is still under serialisation with a monthly release of chapters. This manga is set in the same world as Adachi's classic manga, ""Touch"", but 25-26 years after. It is not necessary to have watched the older series. For those who have, it's like slipping into a pair of comfy home slippers. The story revolves around the 2 Tachibana brothers, Souichirou and Touma,  and their younger sister, Otomi. The 2 bothers are step-brothers to each other but it so happens that they were born on the same date and at approx. the same time (to different mothers, of course). The older brother, Souichirou, and the younger sister are from the maternal side, while the 2nd brother, Touma, is from the fraternal side. They are good at baseball with Souichirou being an excellent catcher and Touma being an excellent pitcher. They make a formidable battery. This is their story from late middle school to early high school. For those familiar with Adachi's works, this is very typical Adachi with his quirks in full display.

**H2** *\[No official stream\]*

41 episodes. No English dub.

>Another anime adaptation of a Adachi Mitsuru manga. This is an earlier manga than ""Mix"" but a later one than ""Touch"". The manga ran from 1992 to 1999. The anime adaptation ran from 1995 to 1996. This series revolves around the competition between Kunimi Hiro, a pitcher, and Tachibana Hideo, 3rd base and 4th batter. In middle school, together with their catcher and friend, Noda Atsushi, their middle school team won the national championships consecutively. However, both Kunimi Hiro and Noda Atsushi were diagnosed with career-ending sports injuries before high school. Thus, the both of them enrolled in Senkawa High School, a high school with no baseball team so that they would not be reminded of not being able to play baseball anymore, whereas Tachibana Hideo enrolled in Meiwa Daiichi High School, a high school with a powerhouse baseball team. Early in their high school life, it turns out Kunimi's and Noda's injuries were wrongly diagnosed and that they are in good health to continue playing baseball. They now decide to form a baseball team in Senkawa to continue their baseball career. The title, ""H2"", relates to the initials of their first name, Hiro and Hideo. It also relates to the initials of the first name of the 2 girls, Amamiya Hikari and Koga Haruka, who are a core part of this series. Amamiya Hikari is the neighbourhood childhood friend of Hiro that Hiro matchmakes with Hideo during primary school years while Haruka is the girl who has a passion for baseball in Senkawa."
Yuri on Ice,People who like sports and people who like anime are not overlapping categories.

Yuri on Ice,"Tbh heard some bad things about Prince of Tennis especially with the super powers on display, tried to aim more towards the grounded shows."
Yuri on Ice,"Yeah there's tons more football ones, it actually gets a bit overwhelming so thought I'd limit it to the more interesting ones. Personally I found Clean Freak! to be really hard to watch."

I am, am I not people? It's often the stress reliever I need after watching a stressful match, unless I'm watching down the pub where a few pints does the same job. 

You just seem to have a very rigid view of the things people enjoy tbh."
Yuri on Ice," I personally don't like anime much at all and love sports however there are a ton of NFL Players that watch a ton of anime, as well as NBA players. Im thinking its a generation thing, so I think they overlap a bit a more than people realize but yeah def not widespread."

Yuri on Ice,"They tried to reboot it in 2008, and it sucked."
Yuri on Ice,"I worked on the 2007-8 reboot. In fact it was my very first job in TV. We were all very excited about the return and right out the gate there was incredible action. A friend pointed out the first barrier in assault. It was a solid block. ""Originally that was a plexiglass screen. First time they test fired the gun it completely shattered it."" Goddamn. Contestants were getting hurt. Broken bones, blown ACL... GODDAMN! At one point we ran out of alternates and the gladiators had to be told to take it easier.




We were all very excited for it to air. Unfortunately you didn't feel any of that intensity on screen. It was edited to death. Got the feeling the producers weren't sports people. ""Let's go to instant replay..."" *Shows the same shot in crappy post slow motion then MOVING ON WE GOT COMMERCIALS TO SELL!*




Wasted potential and probably killed any chance of another reboot. I don't think anyone understood the amazing ridiculous nature of the property."
Yuri on Ice,"It could be, but like every old show they bring back they’d have an annoying host that screams most of the time, they’d try to really super modernize it to this period of time today, and there’d be a bunch of unnecessary drama and drawing things out.   

I’d love to see something like the original, just two fairly normal people doing some events against some slightly less than pro athletes. Keep all the trends out of it and just make it a competition show with no BS or agenda, or any other crap and it’s be super cool. Daytime Sunday tv or something, it doesn’t have to be a huge Monday or Thursday night at 8am thing. Just give us some cool and fun classic events and some cool and fun new events."
Yuri on Ice,There’s too many options now. there are fewer people stuck watching channel 9 on a Saturday afternoon
Yuri on Ice,"it would be more fun to participate. 

I think if they popped up American Gladiator event areas around major cities it would be popular."
Yuri on Ice,I think it would more interesting if you had retired athletes as American Gladiators. We could see the average Joe vs Pros.
Yuri on Ice,[deleted]
Yuri on Ice,"Nope. It was of it's time, but with WWE, MMA, ninja warrior and whatever else, it would just fall flat. Plus what would it be if anyone asked for steroid testing?

It's body quit. It's bird quit. And it's no longer legit."
Yuri on Ice,Malibu all the way
Yuri on Ice,Turbo!
Yuri on Ice,"Game shows were big in the 90's and American Gladiators was the perfect mix of game show and the popular physical fitness trend.

Nowadays I just can't see anything that would grab a modern streaming audience to watch the original American Gladiators and it would need to be changed significantly with things newer audiences demand like more storylines and higher stakes as to be a completely different show. 

People's expectations of physical fitness have also changed and the gladiators would have to be so ridiculously roided out now to be considered as imposing as they were back then to new audiences who have grown up on Marvel movies."
Yuri on Ice,"No.  Granted, a hit today is a far far lower bar, but this show is would be heavily skewed towards male audiences, and I don't think there's a good channel for it.  It would get lost in the shuffle for streaming, and otherwise on cable, it doesn't really have a home channel that would generate any significant viewership"
Yuri on Ice,"I remember giving the reboot a chance, and it was lame. I think the day of the roided up athlete is long past."
Yuri on Ice,"Nope. It'd just be Titan Games. 42 minutes of which 5-10 of it is actual action and a LOT of slow motion while we tell 25-30 minutes of people's sob stories or inspirational stories and the rest is The Rock talking.

I enjoyed Titan Games but it became grating after a while and as competitors advance, they'd fucking reintroduce their sob story again to pad more time."
Yuri on Ice,It’s also how I figured out I am gay
Yuri on Ice,Mark Ortega beating Bam Bam at the last second on the Eliminator is still talked about to this day at my family gatherings.
Yuri on Ice,"It already is a hit today… whether it’s fighting or singing or “surviving “ or running through an obstacle course, it’s still on everywhere, entertaining the same simple intellects as ever"
Yuri on Ice,"These days, people would be triggered by average people in shape and doing amazing things."
Yuri on Ice,Only if they replace the tennis balls with live ammo
Yuri on Ice,"Probably not a hit but it could be fun still. That ultimate tag show was on a couple years ago and I thought it was good, the athletes had personalities and the games were pretty exciting."
Yuri on Ice,No. There were way less options when the original aired.
Yuri on Ice,"Well, for my country's best friends, got bad news. We're getting a reboot before you.

But the good news is that the BBC is going to outwit, outplay and, with a bit of luck, outlast Big Brother with a certain format."
Yuri on Ice,Dress up a couple of dudes as orcs shooting tennis ball cannons at you from a stage dressed like Mount Doom and watch the money roll in on dumptrucks.
Yuri on Ice,Bring it back with the original gladiators against contestants born in the 1970’s or earlier? Must-see-TV.
Yuri on Ice,The rock already ripped it off and tried
Yuri on Ice,Only if they had swords.
Yuri on Ice,Tried and failed multiple times. I attribute this to actual blood sports getting more popular.
Yuri on Ice,They have been releasing full old episodes (up to season 5 so far) on youtube FYI
Yuri on Ice,They are bringing back the UK version. I remember going to see it on tour at Wembley arena back in the day. As a kid it was great. As a adult? No thanks
Yuri on Ice,"Only if it was real gladiatorial sport, replete with bloodshed and triumph, and that tennis ball rail gun."
Yuri on Ice,"Always felt a comedy movie or series about it would be better. Cena, Battista, Rock, Hemsworth, Adam Devine, etc"
Yuri on Ice,"I used to watch that with my father. Great show, definitely think it would be a hit today too."
Yuri on Ice,Nitro!!!
Yuri on Ice,"I don't think so, only because since then (even the reboot one) there's a TON of these competitive obstacle courses that are all over TV like NBC. I think The Rock, John Cena and Stone Cold each did one too. I'll be damned if I know the names as I'm not really interested in those shows, but the fact there were so many of them tells me the ratings have been good for them overall."
Yuri on Ice,"Ow, my balls"
Yuri on Ice,"It was Saturday morning tv, no ? Unless that was a rerun but that's how i remember it"
Yuri on Ice,They should mix Family Feud and American Gladiators. Little Cindy on the tennis ball gun takes out that smart ass Webber kid while the moms pummel each other with those giant Q-Tips.
Yuri on Ice,A friend in college trained to be on the reboot and they rejected him because he made Hulk Hogan look too small.
Yuri on Ice,I think Assault could be it's own show.
Yuri on Ice,This was the show to watch during the ‘08 writers strike
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,"On the one hand, I am glad this silly idea of children's books now have a television show based on them.

On the other, as a big fan of the books growing up, I am still fairly soured by the entire execution of the franchise.

I was so excited to see the movie, and overall it was decent. But it entirely skipped an entire book in the series, and not just one entire book but *the* book where Captain Underpants gets his powers.

I had some hope that the TV series would actually course correct and continue the adventures from the books instead of make up brand new stuff. But oh well, not like I am the target demo anyway."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,Why on *earth* would anyone post a promotional trailer as an **unlisted** video on Youtube? Don't you want people to find it?
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,Season2?  I didnt know this was even a show.  My daughter loved the movie and has just started reading the books. 
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,The movie was alright. The TV show was atrocious. 
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,Well it was on verified sneak peak sites
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,It is amusing. I hate the fourth and ninth episodes tho
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,Explain
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,But this has to be better than Teen Titans Go or My Little Pony Friendship is Magic ... right?
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,"The voice actors were horrible, which is a common enough occurrence. You hire big Hollywood stars to voice act themselves in the movie and since you can't afford their salaries you end up with second rate actors voicing a rough facsimile. There are of course exceptions to the rule (Like Tangled which is phenomenal) but...  
That aside, from the 2 episodes I've seen it seems very formulaic and not very interesting.  
Do the kids like it? I don't know, maybe. But it didn't really appeal to me, a grown up who can afford his own candy to snack on while watching cartoons."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,"I kind of like both of those shows, but popular consensus would say MLP is better, but TTG is worse because internet "
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,Which two episodes did you watch...?
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,"I don't know how anyone over the age of 6 could have a lot of enjoyment out of MLP, I tried watching it when the brony craze was hitting and I couldn't even finish the first episode, it felt like a baby show"
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,"The first season is the wrong season. I don’t even care if you’re a stickler for chronological order, get a better season."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,"Ya know, people hate on Flash animation so much....done right and with style I think it can look pretty damn cool. I feel like most shows that use it DO just that. Yes, traditional hand-drawn animation from Korea will always looks better, but I do think that Flash animation has a place for itself when done right. Classic Hanna Barbera/Cartoon Network/Nickelodeon cartoons had some ROUGH looking animation with it being hand drawn..

So yeah, I don't think the animation of this show looks bad. In fact, I think it rather fits the overall style of the show/content. People like to shit on ""Flash"" animation but don't realize that acclaimed shows like Rick and Morty or Bob's Burgers use VERY similar methods."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,"This makes me sad, I was really hoping for a second movie. The first one was amazingly well made, I don’t have high hopes for a flash-animated series."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,A sequel is still possible. There is a Trolls Netflix series and a theatrical sequel is still coming. There are also several How to Train Your Dragon seasons on Netflix as well. 
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,The how to train your dragon is the only good series on Netflix and miles ahead in quality then the other dream works show.
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,I don't get why DreamWorks has to make a show of every they release. Who is even working on all these series. 
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,"I liked the film, had no idea there was a TV show. Hadn't even heard of the books until I'd seen the film earlier this year."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,"Watched the whole thing. Takes bits from the books, takes bits from the movie. It’s incredibly charming and hilarious. Just when you thought you could get past potty humour. I started from the second episode, and went back to the first a couple episodes in since I didn’t want anything explained to me.

I’m gonna recommend it to my little cousins, but I had a ball catching all the mile a minute jokes and meta humour. "
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,I've Watched All episodes of it!
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,"Watched Ep 1, I love how all the self aware humour (“We’re sorry for wasting these few seconds of your life.”) is translated over from the books!"
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,"I watched an episode and a half. This is bad. Like, terrible. Truly a bad experience to be had by all involved."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,It had a surprising amount of continuity and the S1 cliffhanger in particular surprised me. Not much character development but a smidge which is better than the none I expected too. I think kids would get a kick out of it.
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,"It's my biggest pet peeve with animated movies. They get celebrities to do their own voice and then cheap out massively when they make a series, and it shows. There are a lot of talented voice actors out there, get them to do movies... "
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,At least they actually sound like kids in the series.
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,"Kids are terrible voice actors for kids, with exceptions."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,"The kids who voice Harold and George do fantastic! And there’s been amazing talent in VA for children over the past few years. As far as animated series, the kid who does Steven Universe is great, there were quite a few kids in Adventure Time that sounded hella cute as well as the  exceptional talent of the main character Finn, and even Ike in South Park was one of the creator’s kids and she does awesome for someone so little.

With the exception of South Park, kids should be helping make kids shows, and characters who sound like their age are great. I wouldn’t count them out."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,Man. I also loved these tapes!! And the the fairy tales told by Shelly Duval as well!
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,"It was specifically ruled 'not piracy' to home record.

https://www.soundandvision.com/content/flashback-1984-supreme-court-upholds-right-tape"
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,"“My mom was a VHS pirate” is my favorite thing! Thanks for the laugh. I met the Captain about 30 years ago at a radio station I worked at. He was very kind, especially to the staff’s kids."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,"Loved the Captain! My favorite was Hammy the Hamster in ""Tales of the Riverbank."" Mr. Moose was also a big favorite, and I remember Grandfather Clock and Mr. Green Jeans, too."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,"Woke up with The Captain since 1964 or so, although he had been on longer.  I can still here the original theme, ""Puffin' Billy"" on a pipe or something.  The Captain was all of us kids' favorite Uncle; full of jokes and fun and interesting stuff to know.  Mr. Green Jeans and, if I'm remembering right, Mr. Allegretti was Mr. Painter.  These were happy, happy times.  The Captain's Christmas shows were little thills that got us kids building up to the Big Day.  You knew it was a'comin' when The Captain and everyone gathered around the upright piano and he had those Jingle Bells going' as they sang all the old tunes.  You knew it was Christmastime.  God bless you, Bob Keeshan and all our friends from the past."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,Good morning Captain!
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,"My wife and I just reviewed Captain Kangaroo tonight on our podcast. Check it out!

The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,Whoa!!! I never knew that! Don’t think my mom did either lol. That’s incredible! Thanks for sharing!
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,do reviewers get to see the whole series early or are they basing this on 1 episode?
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,"The fact that HBO gave the entire season to critics in advance shows how confident they are about the series.

edit: they're so confident that the episodes the critics watched had unfinished special effects, there weren't ready to be watched, and yet HBO shared them all anyways."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,"HBO’s The Last of Us sticks to original story material and does not try to reinvent something that works perfectly fine.*

Yes, all the other studios now need to take note as it should have been evident for years now with shitters like Alone in the Dark, Resident Evil 2-whatever, and damn near most all other video-game adaptations."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,">When I started watching the first season of The Last of Us, I did what I always do, I asked my wife to join me. I told her about the series and that it was based on a videogame, and her initial reaction wasn’t positive as she doesn’t care for games and isn’t into post-apocalyptic settings. She even said, “I’ll probably just watch the pilot and you’ll be on your own from there.” We ended up watching all nine episodes over the course of four days, and she was hooked.

This is the key part of the review for many."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,OH SHIT THATS TONIGHT
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,The game that strongly mimicked cinema story telling now has a cinematic telling of a video game mimicking cinema story telling.
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,"For someone who hasn’t played the game, will it matter that I haven’t? I would love to watch."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,"So excited for tonight!

Edit: It didn’t disappoint!"
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,Man I really wish it was HBO that had picked up The Witcher
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,"Not surprising. It tells the story of the game The Last of Us, which was an Epic, Brilliant, Character-driven story."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,It better
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,"Can anyone who has seen/read The Road and also played this game give me an idea how closely this story reflects the doom and gloom of The Road? Because I could barely pull myself out of bed for weeks after reading that book, and it took me a couple years after the movie was released to work up the nerve to see it, so I ain’t about to go through that again unless there’s at least a glimmer of light at the end of this tunnel…."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,I am glad that non-gamers are getting to experience the masterpiece that is TLOU. I am just glad they are telling the entirety of the first game in season 1 and not splitting it amongst several seasons.
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,If only Uncharted could've gotten the same treatment instead of that lazy-ass Tom Holland movie 😔
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,"Currently playing through part 2 and I can’t freaking wait, the first game is the best story I’ve ever seen, naughty dog don’t miss"
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,"Hm....as someone who hasn't played the games, but intends to play them, when they come to PC (this march?), I'm not entirely sure what to do - wait for the game, or watch the series. :-/"
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,Freaking awesome pilot. Ready for more.
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,"I am literally counting the hours until this premier.  I have informed the family that there will be no dinner and the ""Big TV"" is mine for the evening."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,First episode and I already cried. This shows going to be good
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,As a big fan of the game I'm excited to see this. HBO rarely misses and by most accounts this has been a great adaptation.
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,"I’m playing the game for the first time - very cinematic , easy to adapt"
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,"Me, having the played the game a decade ago, pretending to be shocked at certain plot points throughout the episode, and actually being reminded of my emotions 10 yrs ago.

Did not disappoint."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,How are people already reviewing this on rotten tomatoes? Is it just people b.s.-ing in both directions or did it release early? Hopefully not a leak but I don’t see it on HBO US.
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,Loved it
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,"I'm not afraid to say I love HBO. So reliable with genre fiction series.

I know GoT tripped on its dick for a bit at the end but also keep in mind they immediately got to work on a spinoff and we immediately went back to loving it. Westworld waffled into the weeds but they still put a lot of effort into the show and did a noble job of trying to right the ship at the end. 

They're like a team that you can always count on to make the playoffs, and that's comforting. You put this show in Amazon's hands? Who knows. It could be a dumpster fire right out of the gate. HBO doesn't do a lot of dumpster fire."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,"After watching the premier, it's safe to say that we are going to see tons more VG adaptations. That was basically fan service at its finest. HBO managed to do what, sadly and surprisingly, most studios and directors seem to struggle to accomplish. If this was a dick measuring contest, HBO just asked Paramount+ to hold their beer."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,When is the show airing tonight?
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,I actually like that rt has a very broad synopsis copy pasted for every episode on its season review page. I assume that’ll change.
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,Man! It was sooo good! I wish I could binge watch at least 2 episodes at once!
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,First episode was legit. Good sign…
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,"So first season will be outstanding, but what are the odds they'll spend the entire 2nd season on a farm?"
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,You mean….just like the source material?
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,I feel like I’m going to really enjoy this show. Have no interest in the games. Never played them. But all the reviews have me interested.
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,Reviews are very positive from everything that's been posted. Here's me betting reddit will call it overrated when season 1 is all said and done.
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,Does anyone know if I will need to play the 2nd game before watching this? I’m not familiar with how the narrative in the show compares to that of the two games.
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,"I’m hyped, but if I don’t see a giraffe this show is dead to me."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,That first episode was so damn good and that intro sequence reminded me of how gut wrenching it was in the game. Who’da thought a video game adaptation should actually resemble the video game.
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,"I mean, if it's based solely off of the games there's more than enough to make an outstanding season."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,Always has been...
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,So much good stuff to watch on Sunday night. I’m hooked on Mayfair Witches too.
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,Honestly you could just watch a playthrough of this game and air it on TV and it might do well.
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,Better adaptation than the garbage fire abortion that was The Foundation
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,"That's why the last of us is so good. Sure the setting is the apocalypse but it's a very personal story. 

It's about relationships and it's all the better for it. 

And just like with movies like Interstellar the music ties the whole package together to really help evoke emotion"
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,I think HBO knew Velma was gonna flop so they released it right before this so they could distract us with the shiny thing right after we stepped on the turd.
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,"Yo, the first episode was fucking GOOD."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,Most zombie movies / shows start strong but fail after the 1st season / movie.  It’s hard to keep the zombie show plot going after the end of the world or zombie pandemic cause reveal.
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,Amazing what can happen when showrunners actually care about the source material.
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,It was an absolute honour getting to be apart of this! I’m excited for it to come out!
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,Goddamn. People are trying to shard to make The Last of Us happen.
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,Reddit has done an amazing job of sucking this show off every chance they get before it’s even premiered.
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,SO DOES THE GAME
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,[deleted]
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,Hyped
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,"Yeah, so does the game"
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,"After the last few “Epic, Brilliant, Character-Driven Stories” we have been getting in the past several months, I will believe it when I see it."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,Are they rolling out the whole season on the go?
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,"What an incredible validation for Neil Druckmann, after all the trolls and BS he had to deal with online."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,"So is the ""wednesday and velma"" for this month? Theyre not gonna shut up about it are they?"
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,A little tired of the Last of Us ad blitz
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,"Pretty sure the game did that as well...

Call me cynical, but all the excessive love Last of Us has seen recently just feels so excessive.  Like, let's take this cinematic story-driven game and make a series out of it... not sure I can think of a game less in need of a live action movie or tv series to tell it's story.  Or how about we remake the still beautiful PS3 original for the PS5 even though we already remastered it for the PS4 and that PS4 game could already be played on the PS5 without issue."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,Omg the hype is insufferable. This shit better be good and not just fan/critic desperation for HBO to have a new good show. House of Dragons is ok but not great.
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,"I'm not interested in this show but it looks 100x more faithful than that garbage Halo show we got last year.

I mean I've already played TLOU...so...I feel I've already watched the show. The game is basically already a TV show.

What exactly can I get out of the TV show that I didn't already get out of the game?"
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,we'll see in a couple of hours.
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,Hope they complete the story in one season....
Game Shakers,"From what I've seen of the show, it was insanely bizarre for children's entertainment.

I remember one episode where the stereotypical thug Black guy got his hand cut off or something, so he got it reattached but it started decomposing or something and started to shrink and go limp. He then ran around the set letting out bloodcurdling screams while all the kids laughed at how wacky it was (there was a laugh track behind this too, of course)"
Game Shakers,"Schneider's Bakery has only produced crap after Victorious, it's a shame due to its reputation.  Drake and Josh was perfection, Zoey 101 was great, ICarly was amazing, Victorious was good.  But after that all the shows were crap.  Sam and Cat was bland and ended prematurely because of Ariana Grande's music career.  Henry Danger had its funny moments but is still mostly bad, and Game Shakers was the worst with no redeeming qualities whatsoever.  Dan had been a part of Nick for YEARS with plenty of great moments, but he clearly had nothing left in the tank and it seemed like most of his shows ran on life support.  He was burnt out as a creator and had numerous unsavory rumors to his name so it seems wise to part ways with Nick.    "
Game Shakers,Does this mean we can get Kel on SNL now?
Game Shakers,This news goes hand in hand with the news that Nickelodeon and Dan Schneider and not continuing their partnership. 
Game Shakers,Get ready for some bombshells to drop about Dan Schneider guys 
Game Shakers,\#IStandWithLilPeanut
Game Shakers,...What a tragedy?
Game Shakers,Nickelodeon was behind Disney's shadow but now they both are awful in terms of sitcoms.
Game Shakers,"This is actually because Dan Schnieder is being pushed out at Nick. Him and his production company. The only show left will be Henry Danger which is getting one more season because of the good ratings. The rumors are swirling that he is both hard to work with and runs over budget by a lot. Also, there are going to be allegations of sexual harassment coming that they are trying hard to cover up and keep quite. So not a good look for a kids network and they are getting out now. They already lost Chris Savino because of that."
Game Shakers,That sucks I really enjoyed game shakers. 
Game Shakers,Thank the Lort. What a bad show 
Game Shakers,Good riddance 
Game Shakers,Wait is this a jok? This sounds like some sick demented shit. I thought it was what an old man thought video games were like.
Game Shakers,that sounds hilarious.
Game Shakers,"Thinking back to when I was a kid, I would have found that funny.  Maybe I was just a sick little bastard though :)"
Game Shakers,He auditioned back in the day and didn't get in. 
Game Shakers,Don’t fuck... With my BITCHES!!!
Game Shakers,Or...or maybe its low rated
Game Shakers,Dont say accusations are happening without evidence dude. 
Game Shakers,My kid will be crushed.. I share in your delight my friend
Game Shakers,Have you actually sat down and watched live action children’s entertainment? It’s all bizarre.
Game Shakers,"Yeah, it wasn't unfunny or anything, but it was really surreal watching something like that happen on a kids show. "
Game Shakers,Which sucks cause I always found Kel funnier than Kenan. 
Game Shakers,"It's really weird to me how I can still unironically enjoy a good amount of Drake and Josh, especially compared to the quality of shows now"
Game Shakers,Current live action children shows are so odd. Henry Danger has the worst acting and nothing is ever funny. I don't get it.
Game Shakers,"Kel's good at physical comedy, they could have had him do some Chris Farley shit if he was on."
Game Shakers,and now I'd respectfully say its the other way around
Game Shakers,Dan Schneider has never been the same since the end of Victorious. That show marked the end of his era on Nick
Game Shakers,Didn't Victorious have like tons of Jew jokes? That's all I can remember currently 
Game Shakers,It was kinda really sexual too. Lots of inappropriate stuff for a kid’s show. At least more so than iCarly or Drake and Josh.
Game Shakers,"> Lots of inappropriate stuff for a kid’s show.

I'm reminded of the episode where everyone (save Ariana, natch) gets stuck in an RV with the AC off during a day at the beach."
Game Shakers,Nice try Dan Schneider but you're not fooling anyone there.
Game Shakers,It sounds like you already have your mind made up.
Game Shakers,"Yeah sure dan schneider is a pedophile when not even a single actor has ever accused him of it... even the ones who worked with him like 15 years ago.

can't deny he is a weirdo tho"
Game Shakers,Explain the feet stuff dude. 
Game Shakers,"I really don't know what to say about it all. Dan Schneider built and had an empire at Nickelodeon. He and his shows carried the network, HELL the shows were the entire network. 

The dude had such success there that at one point Nickelodeon ordered half a season of one of his shows with out even hearing what the show was going to be about, or who was going to be in it etc, etc. They understood Schneider was doing a new show and they were paying for it, deal done. Nickelodeon had such faith in him and his shows that the network once purchased 40 episodes of one of his shows. That is unheard of.

Networks don't dump a bread winner like that for no reason. Nickelodeon has been in trouble for a while and legends like Schneider can be double edge swords. As they can wield so much power that the networks are stuck. 

Did Nickelodeon dump him because they have dirt on him or are they doing what so many organizations have been afraid to do with legends and bread winners?  

There is a long list of universities and sports teams who wish they had fired legendary coaches long before the coach left. 

I have no idea. I do know that tweeting pictures of people's feet is fucking weird and something that is going to raise a lot of hairy eyebrows when it comes from someone so closely associated with **THE TWEENER** network. "
Game Shakers,You have clearly not dug deep enough. There have been multiple accusations on CDAN (crazy days and nights) for example.
Game Shakers,"I think that you’re ignoring a very important part of the whole feet thing. Nobody cares that Dan ^hold ^her ^down ^tighter Schneider has a foot fetish. 

The problem is that Dan ^the ^hymen ^divider Schneider uses his children shows to get young girls to show their feet off to the camera so that Dan ^the ^man ^with ^the ^van Schneider can get off to it"
Game Shakers,"I agree, until actual evidence is produced its just rumor. 

Its amazing how a person's rep can be destroyed by just rumor, regardless if its true or not. 

I wonder if this kind of tactic has been done by groups before, like rival business or government agents. It seems like quite an easy thing to do. People are gullible and will believe anything if its repeated often enough. They'll start fitting square pegs into round holes on their own to come up with ""proof"". "
Game Shakers,At this point theres just too many rumours to ignore. I think all the spacey and metoo stuff has proven that if there's a huge amount of rumours then there's probably something there.
Game Shakers,"I'm not going to say he's a pedophile because that's a hell of an indictment without any *solid* proof, but I will say it wouldn't surprise me if he is/was one"
Game Shakers,"He's fired now.

What now pedo-shill?"
Game Shakers,"Typical troll response, assume that anyone who's defending someone controversial must be the controversial person in question.

Go away Milo."
Game Shakers,"Not saying it can't be true, but right there's not enough to convince me it is."
Game Shakers,Feet pics in and of themselves do not make a person guilty of anything besides being a little strange.
Game Shakers,"I heard him being dumped had more to do with his bad temper then anything else, (and that was because Nick had been mistreating his shows for years at that point, they killed off Sam and Cat purely out of mean-spirited spite towards an actress who dared to call them out on unfair treatment)"
Game Shakers,"Not to defend Schneider (uggh) but CDAN is unreliable.  It even says so in their disclaimer at the bottom of their page.

Lol I get downvoted for telling the truth."
Game Shakers,"If you're talking about that one guy who everybody thinks is Robert Downey Jr(even though there's not much evidence that he is) that's not convincing enough for me, i'll believe the rumors when people who  actually worked with him whose identities we know for sure start accusing him, until then unlike some people I believe in Innocent Until Proven Guilty."

Game Shakers,"There were also lots of rumors about Michael Jackson, and they all turned out to be bullshit, so rumors mean fucking nothing."
Game Shakers,"> I think all the spacey and metoo stuff has proven that if there's a huge amount of rumours

Let me tell you about a thing called:  McCarthyism

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarthyism
"
Game Shakers,"He got fired months ago dumbfuck, also there's still zero actual of him being a ""pedo"" you stupid sack of shit, i'm guessing you're one of those idiots who supports crazy mike(The pizzagate guy)."
Game Shakers,Uh they are fucking children...
Game Shakers,"> I heard him being dumped had more to do with his bad temper then anything else

I do not know the reasons but he has been responsible for the top 10 of all Tweener shows. You can be a raging asshole if you are having that level of success. 

"
Game Shakers,"You don’t seem to realize how many predators with talent specifically aim for careers to put them in a position of authority above children? Larry nassar? Jerry Sandusky? The rumors about Schneider are mainly fueled by many anonymous posts on Crazy Days and Nights throughout the years that indirectly accuse him. Amanda’s behavior, dan’s foot fetish twitter thing, and behavior of other former actresses under him are just fuel for the fire. Nick parting with him for no real given reason and giving him a 7 mil payout just to leave furthers speculation, and the recent news of John Kricfalusi’s pedophilia while working for the network, as well as other pedophiles who have recently been changed who were formerly employed by them, is proof that Nick will overlook the behavior of people who are making money for the station. There is no solid evidence yet, but with all of these factors it’s hard to imagine there isn’t some truth to the rumors

EDIT: http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2018/01/four-for-friday-its-about-time-himmmm.html?m=1

This is the most recent and specific post on CDAN that indirectly points to Schneider. You can chose to believe it as bullshit, but it is enormously detailed, a little too much to be made up out of thin air in my (and others) opinion. I believe that the only reason it’s taking so long for him to come down is because there has been A LOT going on to cover up his doings throughout the years, millions of dollars paid out, and many people would go down with him. The truth will come out though, it’s only a matter of time."
Game Shakers,"Exactly, Spacey I can absolutely believe because of how detailed his accusers accounts of his behavior are and the sheer volume of them.  But with Dan there's nothing more then vague rumors to suggest he did anything inappropriate(and no I don't count pictures of feet as inappropriate, weird yes, but far from the creepiest thing i've seen)."
Game Shakers,I really like your shows dan even if everyone thinks you're a creep. 
Game Shakers,Still ain't illegal.
Game Shakers,I'm all aboard the anti-Dan train but having a foot fetish doesn't mean you're fucking kids
Game Shakers,"Nick didn't hesitate to give a reason for firing Chris Savino though, so I don't buy that they fired Dan for sexual assault or anything like that.  

Far more powerful people then Schneider have been outed, so i'm not convinced."
Game Shakers,Well actually...yes it is...
Game Shakers,Except its kids feet :/ 
Game Shakers,Why are you getting downvoted? It's creepy but not illegal
Game Shakers,If taking pictures of feet was illegal he would've been arrested already and his Twitter would've been suspended.
Game Shakers,"So you would be fine with some man taking pictures of your childs feet, which he obviously has a fetish for. "
Game Shakers,"I don't have a kid so that's not relevant, but the kids parents didn't have any objections to those pictures. "

Game Shakers,"SOme of these weren't cancelled, some of them are just ending. The middle is ending, not cancelled. But wait a few weeks when the rest of the shows are hit with their cancellations. It is supposed to be a good number because a lot of shows have had very down years."
Game Shakers,yo! neo yokio's not canceled woooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!! 
Game Shakers,"Please add Shut-Eye, from Hulu. I don't understand how Jeffrey Donovan isn't a bona-fide star yet. He excels at every part i see him in."
Game Shakers,"Ash vs Evil Dead and to a much lesser extent Graves are the only ones I will miss though I watched several of these.
"
Game Shakers,"Some kind of hyper realistic VR where you could just live in that world indefinitely if you choose to, and everyone you know - dead or alive - could be there with you"
Game Shakers,"Critics were given the first 5 episodes, apparently we will find out in them."
Game Shakers,[deleted]
Game Shakers,It’s difficult for me to come up with a good guess. The show is so grounded in reality that anything sci-fi would seem absurd.
Game Shakers,After the back to the future references I'll be disappointed if it's not time travel
Game Shakers,"I dont do theories, I just watch shows. I'll see what it is when they reveal it."
Game Shakers,"I think you are overanalyzing this way too much.

I don't think there is one big sci-fi plot twist. What Angela was talking about was mostly her psychosis talking, and Whiterose's manipulation/brainwashing. She wasn't mentally healthy, that's nothing new.

The weird Lynch-esque scene when they meet in the suburban safehouse was a psych test to know how Angela could be used and manipulated.

I don't remember what character said it but it was clear that Angela was a nuisance because of the lawsuit and they were just trying to get rid of her."
Game Shakers,westworld
Game Shakers,"Yeah I thought it was pretty clear that she’s building a reality “simulation”. 

Although it wouldn’t surprise me if they pull a “this was a simulation the whole time” type of thing."
Game Shakers,Do you know where this was mentioned?
Game Shakers,yea...i like it
Game Shakers,S04E01 - this season opener had a very similar vibe to the opening sequence of the Matrix 1 with Neo being guided around the office via a telephone call. Matrix foreshadowing ?
Game Shakers,I'm starting to lean towards it all being a simulation too.
Game Shakers," Possibly Forbers or Rolling Stone, the latter of which does have a couple spoilers about stuff coming"
Game Shakers,OMG its a Matrix ripoff.
Mr. Sunshine,I watched the first few episodes last week (still need to pick up the one they released last Saturday) and was pretty impressed with it.   I'd definitely say give at least the first episode a shot.
Mr. Sunshine,"I've watched the first 4 episodes and I love it. I was actually checking Netflix this weekend just waiting for the new episode to be available. Visually it's beautiful and the interconnected stories are quite intriguing. So far I only have to minor issues with the show. First is that some of the ""American"" actors are most definitely not American. Their accents are pretty bad. The 2nd issue is that the same song has been used 3-4 times. With all that being said...If that's all the issue's I can find then there isn't much to complain about. I would strongly recommend watching the show."
Mr. Sunshine,"Beautiful visuals, at least from the trailer."
Mr. Sunshine,This was actually a masterpiece. I want to erase my memory and watch it like the first time.
Mr. Sunshine,The couple of times I've attempted to watch it I've wanted it to become better off Ted. 
Mr. Sunshine,"I like a lot of series on TV, but Mr. Sunshine has never done it for me. I can barely get through an episode because it bores me so much."
Mr. Sunshine,can we just please have the Friends reunion already....can't stand any of them on their own
Mr. Sunshine,"Did they cast Mr. Sunshine with all the actors who should be good, but are only good in ensemble casts?"
Mr. Sunshine,"The show has it moments, but they are few and far between. However, Allison Janney is hilarious."
Mr. Sunshine,I didn't care for the show but Andrea Anders is adorable.
Mr. Sunshine,I hope not.  I like it.  I think it has some real potential.
Mr. Sunshine,"Both [bubble watch](http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/05/08/bubble-watch-brothers-outsourced-back-on-the-bubble-too-soon-to-put-fringe-on-the-bubble-for-2012-13/91868) and [renew/cancel index](http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/05/03/abc-happy-endings-swings-closer-to-happy/91241) have it right in the middle, halfway between definite cancellation and definite renewal.

"
Mr. Sunshine,"I haven't seen it but it wouldn't be fair to blame it on Andrea Anders. I think she's funny in the right show, for example Better Off Ted's cancellation was absolutely unjustified."
Mr. Sunshine,I just watched the Pilot and found it pretty funny. Guess i'm gonna continue !
Mr. Sunshine,"I really like the show, and it's another where you have to watch all of it to really understand and appreciate all the characters and referenecs.  So it'll definitely be canceled.  If not this year, the next year."
Mr. Sunshine,"I think this first season has been rough, but it has the potential to get itself together and become great. I felt that way about Parks and Rec too. The best part of the first season was the opening credit sequence/song but then in the second season they stepped up and it became pretty great.

*But*, it's exactly the kind of thing that always gets canceled, so yeah probably."
Mr. Sunshine,After watching a few episodes I just imagined it being better off ted and I liked it alot more. 
Mr. Sunshine,It's on Netflix Canada. that's a sign of likely death...
Mr. Sunshine,When I saw the promos I thought they had rebooted Studio 60.
Mr. Sunshine,"It'll probably be renewed for one more season seeing as it's been syndicated

It is shit though"
Mr. Sunshine,"They can have 2 Sex and the City movies, but not one Friends one? that's just ridiculous."
Mr. Sunshine,"I enjoy Matthew Perry's, uh, solo work. Schwimmer's behind the camera these days, Aniston can't decide what she wants to do when she grows up, Cox appears to remain moderately successful on TV, and LeBlanc has all the money he made on Friends."
Mr. Sunshine,"Yes, but both Joey and Better off Ted had been renewed for a second season."
Mr. Sunshine,"I love the *Two and a Half Men* ""Renewed, But...""
"
Mr. Sunshine,"I know it's not fair to blaim her, but it seems kind of odd. I agree with you better off ted was a great an funny show and it's cancellation unjustified.   It just reminded me of the summer glau thing, thus i wouldn't blame her for Firefly (Firefly was a great a how but the broadcaster had to mix up the order of releasing the episodes). "
Mr. Sunshine,"I feel the same way (in that Parks & Rec took a season to step up, and Mr. Sunshine has the same potential).

But Mr. Sunshine, right now, isn't in the same league as Parks & Rec. It's pretty standard, inoffensive, brainless sitcom fodder, no better or worse than plenty of other shows around.

Personally, I like it. It's not hard to watch if I feel like killing 20 minutes or want to watch TV while concentrating on something else. It's good to have some shows like that. And who knows, maybe it *will* have a chance to find its footing later."
Mr. Sunshine,Except without Aaron Sorkin.
Mr. Sunshine,Except without Aaron Sorkin.
Mr. Sunshine,A *Friends* movie... that is a sickening thought.  Let's never speak of it again.
Mr. Sunshine,"*tear* I'll always miss you, Better off Ted."
Mr. Sunshine,Better off Ted deserved several seasons. Joey shouldn't be uttered in the same sentence.
Mr. Sunshine,“Yay.”
Mr. Sunshine,Lee byung-hun :o
Mr. Sunshine,Clone High. What happened in the meat locker?!
Mr. Sunshine,My So-Called Life. It was the perfect show to watch being an angsty 15 year old in 1994. Thought there'd be so much more to explore before cancelation. But in a way I'm glad it because it really captured a moment in time in a very unique way. 
Mr. Sunshine,"The Tick live action series with Patrick Warburton, very funny and a good adaptation, I thought it had a lot of potential but was probably too weird for its time "
Mr. Sunshine,I know it was a miniseries bit I could happily have watched more of The Lost Room
Mr. Sunshine,"Stella. One of the oddest, funniest, most unique shows I have ever experienced. Everyone I show it to gets so sad when they find out there was only one season. Michael showalter, Michael Ian black, and David wain are brilliant."
Mr. Sunshine,John Doe and Journeyman.  Cool premises that just could not get the attention required.
Mr. Sunshine,"Awake and Flash Forwards, I love those types of shows. "
Mr. Sunshine,"Freaks and Geeks, hands down. Perfect blend of comedy and drama all wrapped up in the crazy world of REALISTIC high school. "
Mr. Sunshine,Michael & Michael Have Issues. So goddamnn funny.
Mr. Sunshine,"Day Break.

It was a groundhog day-themed type of show that was getting really good and you could tell it was about to get really weird. Taye Diggs was awesome. I watched it on Netflix."
Mr. Sunshine,Terriers. Really fun noir-ish show. I think it's on Netflix.
Mr. Sunshine,"Wonderfalls.  Never heard about it when it was on, but out of the tv dvd's i own, it's the one I re-watch the most.  "
Mr. Sunshine,"[Police Squad.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzD01Hu1nPs) 
Although the series ultimately spawned the Naked Gun films, the show itself was genius. Leslie Neilsen's timing and delivery is just perfect. "

On Children,"I'm pretty damn excited for Ncuti's run. I'm an odd redditor who was pretty okay with Jodie's run (the truth is I find myself enjoying any era of Doctor Who), but I'm really ready to meet the new guy.

It actually makes me kind of eager for the 2023 specials to be past already, though I'm sure they'll be decent."
On Children,Kind of hoping for Aimee Lou Wood to keep with the Sex Education fun plus I think she'd be a great companion for him :D.
On Children,In RTD we trust.
On Children,"I thought it was Yasmin Finney, but I guess that’s just for one of the specials."

On Children,I wonder if it will be a young woman from modern day London?

On Children,"Jodie was great, but she was let down by bad writing.  If she was a Bond, she'd be Timothy Dalton."
On Children,"can you give me the synopsis of the whole jodie run?

i skipped it after 3 episode.

I know they ruined some parts and added new lore such as who is the timeless child, the weeping angel has new abilities? and thats it from my youtube clips"
On Children,I’m with you. Had a good time during Jodie/Chibnall’s tenure but also very excited to see what we’ve got coming
On Children,… why?
On Children,She's 14 (Tennant again)'s companion. Ncuti Gatwa will have someone else.
On Children,"Yeah whoever the new companion is they probably won't be introduced into the show until after the specials, I'm guessing"
On Children,"""Candidates"" is an exaggeration, but popular fancasts I think (Rose Ayling-Ellis, Lydia West, Aimee Lou Wood)"
On Children,I can tell you right now it's definitely not one of those three
On Children,[deleted]
On Children,"Also comparable to how Colin Baker's tenure as the 6th Doctor turned out.

Shitty writing and long delays between episodes."
On Children,"The Doctor isn't really a Time Lord, or maybe they're the *original* Time Lord on which all others are based, it's not clear, but they aren't a *normal* Time Lord.

The Doctor was discovered near a portal as a child, adopted by a scientist, and had the natural ability to regenerate, which the other Gallifreyans copied. They also worked for a secret government agency for a time, and had other lives before the First Doctor, but their memories of these were erased.

This is obviously a *huge* retcon, and pisses a lot of fans off. As a longtime fan, I don't think it's *inherently* a bad idea, it's more like it's made up of various fan theories that already existed kludged into a single mega-theory. The idea that there were other Doctors before the first? The Brain of Morbius hinted at that in the 1970s. That the Doctor did time as a secret agent and doesn't remember? The ""Season 6B"" theory is practically canon and has had official books written during it. That the Doctor was one of the original founders of Time Lord society? The whole Cartmell Master Plan was going to reveal that, but the show got cancelled before it could. So yeah, nothing here that wrecks the show, really, just existing ideas combined and made canon.

Problem is, Chibnall seems to have that JJ Abrams problem of setting up all these mystery boxes, promising what's inside is really awesome, and then never opening them. We have no idea what to *do* with this information. At the end of Flux, Thirteen's last season, she gets one of those memory containing pocket watches that has her whole past inside. She has the TARDIS hide it from her because she doesn't want to know. It's like Chibnall is saying ""Well, I'm out of ideas, future writers can do something with it or not, I'm done.""

Anyway, we got a new Master in season 12, played by Sacha Dhawan, and he at least is a hoot. He's the one who reveals all this stuff about the Doctor's past, which suggests that some of it *might* be a lie, considering the source. But we know at least some of it is true, because there definitely *were* other Doctors, and the villains of Flux want revenge on the Doctor for things they did during the time they can't remember.

In the finale the Master teams up with the Daleks and Cybermen, was secretly Rasputin, and [this happens](https://youtu.be/Bb3bXgUEMk4). It makes just as much sense in context, but at least we got a cyberman and a dalek sharing a ""What. The. *Fuck*."" glance. Also, Tegan and Ace show up, as well as some of the classic Doctor actors, to finally give those two a proper goodbye, as they both kind of got screwed on the old show.

The Master steals the Doctor's body, but it doesn't last very long. They both get seemingly killed, but the Doctor survives long enough to say goodbye to her companions and regenerates...into David Tennant.

Yeah, that's the big twist. Before we get our official new Doctor, Tennant is back for a few specials. He's as confused by this as anybody.

Overall Thirteen's era was a confusing and convoluted mess punctuated by occasional moments that were funny, awesome, or heartwarming. The potential was there, but it never really came together into something cohesive. Jodie and Sacha killed it, but you'd probably be better off watching the highlights than the whole thing.

Here's to the future."
On Children,"I guess? In short, and my opinions abound throughout:

Her first season was very light on classic Who connections, on purpose. It instead focused on cinematography and effects, while the episodes were more frequently historical or otherwise earth-bound. Some good episodes but kind of a muted Doctor and one decent companion carrying the weight of all three.

Her second was very solid, somewhat derailed by the revelations at the end (the Timeless Child stuff, as you mentioned). It dives headfirst into classic Who monsters and storylines, and Jodie finally gets her opportunity to really showcase herself as the Doctor. It trips over the much-fussed-about Orphan 55 and Praxeus, but a lot of that was environmentalist preachiness I think. The rest of the episodes make up a season that would have fit solidly during RTD's first tenure. At the very end, Chibnall shot his shot at making a big stamp on the lore of the Doc, and it wasn't delivered great and he wasn't really the guy to do it (hadn't earned it, at minimum). I'd say it's not *that* big a shift, and it's actually not too different from the old Cartmel Masterplan shenanigans from the 80s... 

Her third is a six-parter all connected called the Flux. This is lovely, entertaining, nonsensical chaos, by and large. Covid really took its toll on production, though it shouldn't have had *that* big of an effect on writing and editing. It's absolutely gorgeous, though, and has the best special effects of any point in Doctor Who's history. Though, if you're already a DW fan... the quality of special effects is probably not something you give half a shit about.

The three specials after Flux vary wildly. The first is actually pretty fun, a good self-contained, small, smart episode. The second is, I have to admit, literally the worst Doctor Who episode I've watched--and I have watched all of them that still exist, from An Unearthly Child on. It's just a miserable fucking steady bungling of writing, editing, pacing, planning, shooting, acting, as well as effects, stunts, and humor. 

Thankfully the third and final special is terrific. Tons of callbacks--and past companions and Doctors!--all piled into a glorious mess of a plot that is nonetheless completely worth your time. While I recommend Doctor Who fans do watch the Jodie era, particularly as I think it will age mostly okay, if you only watch one more of hers watch this.

Some other stuff during this run includes an excellent return of the Master, a wonderful villain in the Lone Cyberman, a secret previous incarnation of the Doctor that landed really well, and a stilted and ill-advised subplot of yet another young earth girl falling for a Doctor who mostly ignores it, eventually gives her some ""if only things were different,"" and then finally leaves her ass on Earth for good. Definitely with a much blander companion than Rose, by a good margin, but at least it avoided the Twilight vibes the earlier couldn't avoid.

That's more than I meant to write. Whoops! Certainly Chibnall has been the weakest showrunner of the three NuWho guys, and his tenure was somewhere between a big step down and an outright stumble, but it's not all a waste and it's not all been a waste of 3.5 seasons, in my opinion."
On Children,Because I like what I've seen from Ncuti as an actor? What reason would I have not to be excited to meet his Doctor?
On Children,"Aw, that’s kind of a bummer, I was looking forward to seeing the two of them together, but I’m still excited. Thanks!!!"
On Children,"> Aimee Lou Wood

YES PLEASE"
On Children,"That was for the specials, and we know who they are playing. 

As far as we are aware they are not the new companion."
On Children,"I seriously don’t know if there is a BAD Doctor. Every actor has more than proven themselves, and it’s only writing that seems to screw them. Colin Baker probably got the most flak as doctor pre-Jodie by people familiar with all of Who, but it was because of production problems just like her."
On Children,"Baker got a great redemption in the Big Finish audio dramas. Hopefully Jodie does too, I loved her performance, she just needed better scripts."
On Children,"Well, shit, kuddos to you for taking the time to write a very accurate summary of what the show has been in and out for the past five years."
On Children,"now, i tried to do different keywords on youtube about the weeping angel, but i couldnt find what happens.

So when jodie turned into an angel what happened, what freed her? How did she escape?"
On Children,"Great summary.

Maybe it’s my cynical side but my guess is they just made the Master Rasputin so they could use the song."
On Children,"cool, will watch the flux due to your recommendation.

Which episodes are they? I assume its season 13 one of the 9 episodes?"
On Children,"If Sony/Disney and RTD (Bad Wolf Studios) hadn't gotten the rights to Doctor Who, Ncuti Gatwa's tenure might have ended with the show just like Sylvester McCoy's."
On Children,"That wasn't a *weeping angel* thing so much as those angels were employed by the Division, which was the group she used to work for. They ""angeled"" her to take her in for a debriefing, basically.

If all you saw was the youtube clip of it happening, I bet you had some real questions!"
On Children,It'll be the first six of those. The final three would be the specials.
On Children,"If Sony/Disney and RTD (Bad Wolf Studios) hadn't gotten the rights to Doctor Who, it would've ended with the 13th Doctor regenerating."
On Children,"Yeah, like a lot of this stuff it's maybe a cool idea, but they don't seem to *do* anything with it.

Were the angels always working for Division? Were they created by Division? Did they used to be Time Lords? We don't know, show doesn't care, it was an excuse to write the angels into the morass of random ideas that was Flux.

... I'll give Flux one thing, the Sontarans actually had a good plan for once, and weren't total jokes. It's so *frustrating*, there ARE good ideas in this era, they're just drowned out by so much *noise*."
On Children,"very much so, i liked the new cgi"
On Children,"what if the weeping angels are the timelords. Thats how they get the regeneration powers. They first have to steal everyone's time until its enough for 12 regenerations, then they can become full fledge timelords.

:O

I just pulled it out of my ass right now. I dont know."
On Children,">I just pulled it out of my ass right now. I dont know. 

Then you understand this era of the show perfectly, because that's exactly what it's like!"
On Children,"The only catch is that, because of Covid-19, he's going to be wearing his Bane mask and nobody is going to be able to understand what the fuck he's saying."

On Children,He's already done 4 or 5 hasn't he? My girlfriend was very impressed with his storytelling skills. Enraptured even!
On Children,"Celebrities line up for the chance to do this, and a previous Tom Hardy appearance was the highest rated episode, especially appealing to the children under 5 and women over 30 demographics. See this video (with mention of the Hardy appearance at the 5 minute mark):

On Children,"He's done it before, loads of celebs do. Derek Jacobi is the narrator on In The Night Garden and David Tennant is one of the voices on Tree Fu Tom."
On Children,"Tom Hardy, the bane of Christian Bale's existence."
On Children,"He can tuck me in and read me a bedtime story anytime he wants. And I wouldn’t mind some of Hardy’s hardy. 

No homo though."
On Children,I hope he does it in his Peaky Blinders voice
On Children,"A-list actors reading children's stories is an established thing over here. It's alien to Americans because no stellar actor would be affordable in the States for such a thing. But the BBC's *Jackanory* children's TV programmes often had the likes of Ian McKellen, Judy Dench and David Tennant reading kid's stories. 

It's a badge of honour, not a highly paid job for them, and British TV is the richer for it. And of course it encouraged parents to sit and listen with their kids instead of just plonking them down in front of the gogglebox on their own."
On Children,Maybe he will bring back his Texan accent from *The Revenant*. That's my favorite character of his.
On Children,"I’m going to walk into my bedroom to find my wife, her vibrator, and Hardy reading Goodnight Moon"

Samantha!,"This probably says more about me than it does her, but I’ve grown so tired of the righteous indignation genre of comedy. On the other hand, I don’t really like the light hearted Jimmy Fallon approach either. I’m not the target audience for any of this stuff though, I wish there was a nightly or weekly comedian I really enjoyed but none of it is working for me lately. CBS Letterman and Daily show Jon Stewart were probably the last two I really enjoyed. Bill Maher is alright but he can be a little smug and condescending. Ehh I wish norm macdonald was still alive…"
Samantha!,"I like Bee, but there are only so many of these shows people can watch."
Samantha!,"I watched this show once early on. Every single joke in the episode was about Trump, not creative, just trump is stupid/fat/bad.

It was exhausting to watch, had to turn it off. Never a fan of Trump but you can only hear the same joke a couple times before you get tired of it"
Samantha!,"I tried maybe half a season but there was no just no finesse to it. Or comedy, frankly. It just seemed to be her screaming and swearing a lot.

People with talent have something to back that up. She seemed to just have the noise."
Samantha!,"I feel bad for the crew but, bee never had any of the charm that jon Stewart or John Oliver did. Full frontal came as obnoxious."
Samantha!,Zaslav strikes again.
Samantha!,"She lost a lot of progressive support to John Oliver after pushing the “fragile men only supported Bernie because Hillary as President intimidates them” narrative. Consequently a lot of people into political lampoons weren’t even aware she was still going. It was not only needlessly divisive, it was ignorant of how elections work, since very few of the many online disillusioned Bernie voters were registered in the states Hillary narrowly lost.

I think Samantha accidentally let her Canadian flag fly on that one, because in Westminster systems with multiple parties that kind of thing can happen . (Before Trudeau, Canada’s Liberals had difficulty in elections mostly because many did not want to see Dion or Ignatieff as PM and voted NDP or Bloc.)"
Samantha!,"IMO, she isn’t that funny."
Samantha!,"Ah shit, now i wont know what can and cant be joked about without her policing comedy."
Samantha!,"Almost nothing seems to move the needle on cable TV outside of news and sports.

Anything that can't be used for an all-day marathon has to be in constant danger of getting cut."
Samantha!,I have her subbed and STILL never see her on my feed. So bizarre.
Samantha!,Terminally unfunny
Samantha!,7 seasons? I tried to do five minutes once.
Samantha!,"When 99% of her content is about Donald Trump, it gets played out really quick."
Samantha!,"It's hard to succeed in her specific niche because there are already a few more competitors who have a leg up due to brand name or bigger network backing. 

Not to mention YouTubeers are allowed to be unfiltered, it really puts her at a disadvantage. 

Not to mention, I think younger people are tired of some of these shows type of politics (I know I am), and not really receptive of it anymore."
Samantha!,"I’ve never seen the show and discounting the politics of it, I just have to say that Bee’s delivery in all of the commercials I’ve seen upset me in the same way listening to an old-timey radio DJ or local newscaster does. Just a totally inorganic way of speaking that spikes my blood pressure. It’s like someone speaking to you in baby talk.

That said, losing a job sucks and I wish her success on whatever she does in the future."
Samantha!,It took them six seasons to realize that nobody was actually watching the show.
Samantha!,"""Oh no"" said her 12 watchers."
Samantha!,I’ve never heard of this show and it had 7 seasons?
Samantha!,"Just like the Colbert Report, the host will move on to start a late night format show,  you know, the place where comedy and nuance go to die"
Samantha!,thank god
Samantha!,How did it even make it 7 seasons?  It has viewership ratings worse than the average YouTuber.
Samantha!,Was it ever any good? I never saw it but I never really like Sam Bs stuff on Jon Stewart
Samantha!,Good riddance
Samantha!,Did anyone actually watch this?
Samantha!,"Even I, an obnoxious left leaning college educated jerk, couldn’t stand this show. Second worst pundit besides Bill Maher."
Samantha!,"If only reddit watched this show with the same intensity that they are showing in downvoting critical comments on this post, the show might still have not survived because the psycho population the show served was barely larger than her studio audience."
Samantha!,6.5 seasons too late
Samantha!,"This show lasted 7 seasons?

People actually watched this?  Every single promo was just pure cringe."
Samantha!,"Damn, seven seasons?! That's a great run."
Samantha!,I think tbs is getting out of live tv shows
Samantha!,"wow 7 seasons... didn't know she made it past 1.... 

Really terrible show."
Samantha!,Good.
Samantha!,"As much as I like Sam Bee, I'm surprised her show lasted as long as it did. It really just wasn't that good. It didn't hit the topics her demo knew her from. It regularly focused on oddball issues few cared about and didn't do it in a very funny way like Oliver does."
Samantha!,Huge W
Samantha!,"May be a good place to inform/remind people that one of the best sitcoms ever made was by Samantha Bee and her husband Jasom Jones, and was also cancelled by TBS.  

If you never saw it (and most didn't) it's called The Detour.  It's worth finding it and watching the three season run.  Easily rivals Arrested Development."
Samantha!,I lean to the left and she was never funny. I can’t believe she lasted this long.
Samantha!,Man that’s bs. Zaslav cutting all programming from Tbs and tnt is a terrible move
Samantha!,That was seven seasons it was on too long
Samantha!,"Good.

A show of half an hour of being lectured to about liberal norms by a segregationist sounds incredibly tedious."
Samantha!,"oh man, im gonna miss the worse version of the Daily Show"
Samantha!,A lot of angry libs in here 😂🤣😂
Samantha!,I didn’t know this was on.  There was like a political trivia thing before one of the elections that was the only thing I knew about this show existing.
Samantha!,I thought it ended back in 2018 lol
Samantha!,I thought this was cancelled 7 years ago
Samantha!,Finally. She is not nor was she ever funny. She was litteraly a liberal puppet and mouthpiece spewing her verbal dysentery on the screen.
Samantha!,Awesome she sucked
Samantha!,Finally
Samantha!,"Who was watching this for 7 years, and why!??"
Samantha!,More time for her and her husband to devote to keeping poor black kids out of their neighborhood schools
Samantha!,For 7 seasons consistently one of the lowest rated shows on cable.
Samantha!,Samantha Bee is awful.
Samantha!,"Wow. Who would have thought that having absolutely no promotion of a show would lead to it being cancelled? 

I had no clue it was still on. She was great."
Samantha!,Good. One of the most vile women on TV. She might find a home on the View or some other nonsense.
Samantha!,"I watched teh first episode and didn't care for it, tried too hard to be outrage porn and just came across shrill and mean spirited."
Samantha!,"I’ll miss the show. I really enjoyed a female perspective in Late Night. At the same time, sometimes it felt like she limited herself to only that, and a very narrowly defined ‘female perspective’ at that. Some of the jokes were repeated too often, every segment felt predictable, and outside of constantly mentioning female sexual anatomy, the show started to feel like it didn’t have an identity separate from other late night shows. Still, it often made me laugh, it was the first comedy program I turned to when women’s rights were being harmed, and it had some great correspondants and Sam herself was always a welcome face. I’m glad it ran so long and I’m sad to see it go. Hope Bee and the others go on to great other things I continue to see them in."
Samantha!,"Meh, it was heavily partisan and preachy. Maybe put something with wider appeal in its place."
Samantha!,Her meal ticket lost the presidency and her ratings plummeted
Samantha!,Feckless cunt
Samantha!,rest in pepperoni
Samantha!,"I mean it had an audience score of 25%. I really wanted to like it. In the first season, she had a couple of good shows, but it just turned into a mantra of worn out talking points. She was so fantastic on the daily show. I was disappointed.

When people watch a nighttime TV talk show, they want some real insight. They want something they aren't aware of. John Oliver delivered that in spades for several seasons, and then he fell into the Samantha Bee trap himself. I went from watching every single new episode of his as soon as it came out to not even bothering. We want segments like the latest Bill Maher's New Rules where he gives you a fresh and well thought out perspective. Where you want to stand up and slow clap after watching it. Jon Stewart always did that better than anyone, but he stopped doing it when he made his new show ""The Problem"". I mean his panel on racism was 4 white dudes and a white woman. Then the white woman went on a rant about she doesn't talk to or engage with white men anymore... despite choosing to be on an alabaster panel like that one. Yeah that was like 10 minutes of the show. It's just crap now. It makes me wonder if it wasn't him, it was just one of the writers on him team that didn't switch to any of these new shows. I remember when he did the whole segment on Caitlin Jenner on the daily show and her transitioning, it was comedy and insightful gold. Now, he's just a shadow of what he used to be."
Samantha!,It made seven seasons?!?!?
Samantha!,Proud to say I’ve never seen a single episode. She is awful.
Samantha!,"This was one of the worst shows on TV. About time. Im down with dunking on trump and repubs/tards as much as the next guy, but this show is insufferable. Its like big bang theory level of bad."
Samantha!,Can’t believe it lasted 7 seasons
Samantha!,Bout time she wasn't very good or funny.
Samantha!,I remember her bit on [russian troll farms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OauLuWXD_RI) was months before anybody else picked up on it.
Samantha!,She turned me against her from almost the first episode. Cancelled 7 years too late if you ask me.

Good Girls,"Whenever I get too critical of streaming, I just have to look at what the networks are doing and it makes me take a step back."
Good Girls,I was really hopeful about this show based on the cast. Watching it though reminded me a lot of the worst parts of Weeds.
Good Girls,It had run its course by the time it ended anyway.
Good Girls,so everybody was accepting lower pay except the actor nobody knows
Good Girls,"I'm sorry, but I'm having trouble buying that one actor not wanting to take a pay cut got the ***entire*** show cancelled. If someone could prove me wrong or explain it to me I'll take my L, but it seems like they were looking for an excuse to cancel the show and took the first one."
Good Girls,"Love those ladies, disappointing show overall storywise. To take an opposing view, I could imagine their salaries being much higher than Manny’s so a pay cut for them vs him could be a much different thing.   I’m curious what those numbers looked like, not sure why it’s up the cast anyway to take a paycut for a shortened final season. Also damn, what an easy character to write out regardless"
Good Girls,"Why are people still calling this a “dramedy?” It stopped being funny after season 1. Incidentally, that’s also when it stopped being good."
Good Girls,Writing was pretty bad by that point anyway.
Good Girls,"Kind of reminds me of the issues with Growing Pains.

Kirk Cameron became a Born Again Christian during the show's run and used that to object and storylines that he didn't like and reportedly derailed some major productions over it - the story arc about the family going on vacation in Europe was meant to be filmed *in* Europe, but instead they had to film on an island off the coast of LA instead. He even got two co-stars fired for going against his beliefs as ""Agents of Satan"" despite one being a major character.

But because he was the biggest and most famous star on the show at the time (he was a teen icon), he was allowed to get away with his antics... up until a point.

The executive producers wanted to do one storyline on the show, but Kirk Cameron attempted to object only to be shot down. But Cameron then went straight to then-head of ABC, Bob Iger and complained to him instead, even calling the EPs ""Pornographers"".

When they heard what he did and what he said about them, they just decided to cut their losses and chose to end the show instead of continuing to work with Cameron.

It had a few major effects as well. When they had a reunion TV movie for the series, Cameron wasn't invited and it killed his Hollywood career, relegating him into making movies purely for the Christian market."
Good Girls,The show was watered down Breaking Bad anyway
Good Girls,Elisabeth

Good Girls,Could T have said it better.
Good Girls,"It was carried a lot - a *lot* \- by the charisma of the three leads, but it could never decide if it wanted to be Breaking Bad or 9 To 5 and wound up ultimately being neither. I abandoned it once I realized that it was never, ever going to allow its alleged ""antiheroines"" to actually do anything genuinely bad, and if that's the case, what the hell is the point?"
Good Girls,"The showrunners wimped out at the end of the second season when they could have killed off Rio. Instead, they'd rather satisfy the Beth x Rio shippers than tell a good story."
Good Girls,"In the article
>NBC dramedy was closing in on a Season 5 pickup, with Retta, Christina Hendricks and Mae Whitman all agreeing to take pay cuts for a truncated final run. But negotiations with Manny Montana — who played fan favorite Rio — reportedly went less smoothly: Some theorized that Montana’s strained working relationship with on-again/off-again scene partner Hendricks may have been a factor, making the actor less willing to take the kind of financial hit NBC was asking of him.

edit; Unless you meant the least famous of the group."
Good Girls,OTOH the others have made a good living acting and he hasn't. Maybe he thinks he needs to cash in while he can.
Good Girls,"I agree, they were obviously looking for an excuse and this was it. People get recast in shows all the time. Especially an actor like Rio"
Good Girls,"Eh. It was a family show and one actress was a Playboy model. This was the 90s.

Alan Thicke was banging a 17-year-old, and people were oddly chill about it."

Good Girls,I personally doubt Mr T would have said it better but you never know.
Good Girls,"If they had, Rio wouldn't be around to have gotten the show cancelled for refusing to take a pay cut."
Good Girls,I tapped out after the first episode of the 2nd season. A man got shot right in the chest and it ‘just missed’ his heart.
Good Girls,They should have just killed him off
Good Girls,Why wasn't he just written off? Shows have written off way more important characters in the past.
Good Girls,"I’m sorry, but who could have issues working with Christina Hendricks?"
Good Girls,yeah thats the only actor i didnt really know
Good Girls,That really sucks for the cast and crew that had a steady job. Don't know enough of the interpersonal relationships to say whether it's justified but it sucks for the people who wanted to finish the show and it sucks for fans. Bummer.
Good Girls,"Looking at his history, he got an FX role (Mayans MC), an HBO role (Westworld), and a D+/Marvel role (Ironheart) within the last two years. He must've been closing some of those deals during Good Girls negotiations, decided his stock was rising and not compromise w/ NBC."
Good Girls,Melissa Joan Hart found a way to be a Christian on a 90s family show without getting Aunt Zelda fired for having done softcore porn.
Good Girls,Mr. T pities the fool who stuck with Weeds until the end.
Good Girls,"At the end of S2.

His story ran its course. Bringing him back was super dumb and contrived."
Good Girls,Manny Montana.
Good Girls,Malcolm Reynolds.
Good Girls,He's Michael Mando but from wish.com
Good Girls,Now you know him…
Good Girls,">Aunt Zelda fired for having done softcore porn. 

How the fuck am I just hearing about this?"
Good Girls,"I actually read her memoir. She wasn't particularly religious back then. She did drugs and hooked up with guys, though she was a Republican.

Kirk Cameron was big in the early 90s."
Good Girls,I did… I don’t give up easily!
Good Girls,"I'm positive it was the shippers that ruined the show, or at least lead it down the road to its eventual cancellation. 

It looked they had something cooking with that senator or lawyer or whatever that looked like he was being set up as the big bad towards the end of the 2nd season, but then, after Rio was kept alive, that storyline seemed to have faded away to never be mentioned again."
Good Girls,"Maybe he can get her on a few episodes of his show, The Rookie."
Good Girls,…who was rumored to have an extremely bad relationship with Stana Katic on Castle leading to increasingly-absurd excuses for them to be in as few scenes together as possible despite being the romantic leads of the show
Good Girls,"His name is Nathan Fillion.  Damn, dude.  Touch grass."
Good Girls,I did too. Mr. T literally called me to tell me he pitied me.
Good Girls,">I'm positive it was the shippers that ruined the show, or at least lead it down the road to its eventual cancellation. 


Absolutely, it was embarrassing being on the sub when the show was airing.

Just a bunch of horny house wives lusting after the psycho murderer drug dealer and shitting on Matthew Lillard.

edit: lol, looking at the sub right now, they're calling her jealous and a mean girl because 'the only reason anyone was watching the show was because of him'."
Good Girls,Shippers *always* ruin shows
Good Girls,"Sorry, you seem to be confusing a fictional character with the actor who portrayed him on TV. Might want to figure that dynamic out if you're hanging out in r/television."
Good Girls,They truly are the worst.
Good Girls,"It is one thing when shippers ruin shows but a totally different thing when shippers are so mental they start to harass people outside of shows because they are not dating the ""right people"".  Seen that at least a few times. Shippers are too often bat-crazy psychopaths who don't understand human relationships so seeing shippers ruin good or even decent shows is never a surprise."
Good Girls,"Fictional Character Richard Castle used his fictional wealth and connections to fictional city officials to gain a position within the police department in pursuit of a fictional for-profit endeavor. He used the privileges of this position to stalk and serially sexually harass a fictional police detective with whom he was infatuated, as well as repeatedly violating the civil rights of multiple fictional members of the public.

Or I guess we were talking about Malcolm Reynolds, in that case probably something about using his role as landlord to try to coerce sexual favors from Inara, but honestly I've forgotten why I was typing any of this"
Good Girls,this particular thread already mixed fictional characters and real life actors so it really was the right dynamic
Good Girls,I wonder why shows like this aren’t a show they would put on Peacock to push. It’s apparently an amazing performer on Netflix. Seems like a win/win for it.
Good Girls,"Nooooooooooo!

Despite some plot holes, and the strong tendency for murdered people to keep popping back up, I love that show.  Very strong cast. The writers have a gift for writing the show into corners and then deftly pulling it back out. The trans kid’s transition was very well handled."
Good Girls,"I liked the show in season 1, but it got less interesting as it went on... there isn't really anything happening to move forward, just a bunch of same stuff happening in different ways. I mainly have stuck with it this long because of the three main women."
Good Girls,This show was OK but had the potential to be more. They never found as interesting a route to take as Breaking Bad did from somewhat similar beginnings.
Good Girls,"First season was great. Second was alright. Since then...

......."
Good Girls,Her?
Good Girls,"Netflix should have bought the show and did a shortened 5th season to wrap things up. Having a solid 5 season show with a proper ending is good to have in the library, especially one that has developed a strong online fanbase who is willing to keep discussion of the show going. Not a show I watched, but I knew tons of people who did. And it consistently cracked the top 10 on Netflix when a new season dropped."
Good Girls,"Honestly, it had a good run. Besides the obvious ‘another season,’ what more can you ask for?"
Good Girls,That sucks
Good Girls,"The fanbase for this show is unreal, check out the subreddit.

It seems to consist of middle aged women who only watch it to see Christina Hendricks hook up with Rio.

They all talk about how horrible her husband in the show, Matthew Lillard, is while talking about how dreamy Rio is.

And Rio is a despicable character that they've seen execute innocent people.

But I guess he's hot so they all fawn over him and talk about how their scenes together is the only thing people want to see."
Good Girls,"Ok. I'm on season 3. Enjoying it ok. But does season 4 end on a cliffhanger, or does it get a reasonable ending? If a cliffhanger we'll probably stop."
Good Girls,I liked the characters. But it devolved into “the girls get in trouble then find an improbable escape” every two episodes.
Good Girls,"They took the show nowhere, doing the dame shtick for 4 seasons then cancel it smh. After season 2 they should have blown it up shaken the concept and tried something new/different 🤷🏽‍♂️"
Good Girls,Guess I won't watch s4 then.
Good Girls,Ugh No
Good Girls,"I liked the show a lot, but its fans were disturbingly obsessed with a character that shot a young lady in the head. He had no business being on the screen. Keeping him around made the show stale."
Good Girls,Damn. I enjoy this show. Maybe Netflix will pick it up.
Good Girls,Omg just found out earlier so pissed they canceled it uggh 😡.
Good Girls,"A NBC show got cancelled. In other news, water is wet."
Good Girls,I honestly had no idea the show even existed. Where can you find it to stream?￼￼
Good Girls,"Sigh. I'm going to miss ""them""."
Good Girls,I watched the first few episodes to see if Christina Hendricks got them out.
Good Girls,This show still exists?
Good Girls,I have no idea but I'm waiting for the next season. I don't understand why so many shows that are brilliant but underrated get cancelled. The show was great. It was simple and straightforward. The whole cast was great and everyone nailed their role perfectly. I hope they don't cancel their next season.
Good Girls,"I'm guessing because Netflix got the streaming rights before Peacock was even a thing.  Despite being a show NBCUniversal produces and owns, you can't currently watch it on Peacock.  It wouldn't surprise me if that factored into its cancellation."
Good Girls,"⛔️ WARNING: I’ve hijacked the top comment to announce that if you’re in the process of streaming Good Girls, the Variety article contains spoilers that describe what has happened so far in Season 4. ⛔️

Sorry, everyone. Please continue."
Good Girls,"Agree it wasn’t forced down our throats, it wasn’t classic drag, or classic queer over sexualized or cross dressing to the extreme end. It was just tastefully done and basically abandoned as a subject. I love how they let it be and didn’t add on to it as it went. Ben was just Ben and not Ben the trans who is struggling to be noticed to breathe and be set free with identity issues and bullying."
Good Girls,Definitely felt like it started running in circles instead of moving forward
Good Girls,"I kept waiting for a shake up or for the women to make progress. Why are they still doing this stuff and suffering when they aren't making any money? It's only bad things happening, I thought Beth would become her own boss but she's still at the mercy of Rio. Why not make them professional rivals?"
Good Girls,I don’t think the show was ever trying to appeal to the same people that watched BB. Seems made for middle aged housewives and never intended to be anything more.
Good Girls,Netflix...proper endings...lolz
Good Girls,Nope cuz this just leaves it to be open to allow it to branch off into another show. That would he dope almost like Breaking Bad w Better Call Saul and El Camino. However to make it a better series that is longer would be amazing.
Good Girls,An ending?
Good Girls,People constantly rooted for Walt and despised Skyler. And I still think it’s weird how people shipped Rylo Ken with Rey after he massacred not one but five (or six?) entire plants. Weird misguided shipping is not unique to this show.
Good Girls,"I would go there sometimes to read episode discussions in the first season, then for fun sporadically these last seasons because of that exact reason. Straight up horny housewives pissed at the husband and drooling for the bad guy."
Good Girls,"well yeah, of course.  those ""bad boy w/ a heart of gold"" type characters are ALWAYS super popular, and people love shipping them w/ ""good girl"" types.

I think the two of them had pretty good chemistry in the first 2 seasons, but the whole thing was also kinda icky lol"
Good Girls,"Season four will end on July 22nd, so who knows if it will wrap it up or leave it hanging."
Good Girls,IT ENDS ON A CLIFFHANGER. I’m so sad it was getting good D: I didn’t even know it was ending until after I watched the season 4 finale
Good Girls,[deleted]
Good Girls,"You misspelled Netflix.

You realize NBC and Universal Television is the home of SVU, Chicago Fire, Chicago PD, Suits, and a dozen other 7+ season titles?"
Good Girls,It's on Netflix.
Good Girls,Hulu
Good Girls,That’s true. But it plays on Hulu as well. New episodes do. I just find it strange. Seems like the perfect situation.
Good Girls,I don’t love the show but I’d agree with you on this.
Good Girls,Yep.  After the millionth time they showed Ruby struggling to pay her mortgage I realized there would be no change or growth and gave up

You know which one."
Lastman,Man this Final Fight reboot looks legit.
Lastman,This show seems awsome I'm looking foward to it!
Lastman,"Comic is great, check it out. The creators have said in interviews they intend it for a younger audience though. The comic at times can't decide if it wants to be for young adults or a mature audience with its mix of tones and genres, but it has some fantastic art and a very intriguing story, I'm pumped for a cartoon version. "
Lastman,"Guys it's time to give a hand to the project:

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/42220914/lastman-la-serie-tv-animee

They need extra financing to finish the episodes. Just got 75k€ in less than a week, but they need quite a bit more to finish the series.

This is an absolutely awesome project with the best talents around, let's give them the means to produce the best anime possible"
Lastman,This looks absolutely fantastic! I have not been interested in anime for 20 years. Is there anything else like this out there?
Lastman,"Yes, this is an awesome looking project. The animation looks great, and as far as adult animation goes, I guess there won't be as much limitations given that the director did the dYe Fantasy MV."
Lastman,"Doesn't sound french to me, lol"
Lastman,[removed]
Lastman,*jet engine noises*
Lastman,100% - the game is the official license of Last Man (the comic book).
Lastman,I believe it is.
Lastman,"This series is definitely not going to be for children, Jeremie Perin is directing it and he's very into sex imagery and monsters..."
Lastman,"theres plenty if you look. this isnt anime either its a french cartoon.

Lastman,What about Family Guy?  I don't hear anybody else laughing.
Lastman,Looks like a pretty average anime to me.
Lastman,"I mean, it looks like it could be interesting, but. . .

""Attain the holy grail of Western animation""? That's a bit of a ridiculous way to describe it."
Lastman,Exosquad was kinda successful outside of the comedy genre. It was a scifi war drama.
Lastman,"seems pretty neat, i don't know french tho i wonder if the lyrics explain more about the story"
Lastman,"This looks beautiful. 

The animation style reminds me so much of [this] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QFwo57WKwg). Could it be by the same people?"
Lastman,"Is this done by the same animators as [this work of art](https://vimeo.com/30798517)?

A quick google search shows it's directed by the same guy, so I figured it might be."
Lastman,I dont get why people are saying there are already successful western animation outside of comedy.Ive always wished animation would blow up here. So I could get some fantasy/scifi shows without set/props/costume budget limitations.
Lastman,"The art is nice but the animation is pretty noticeably choppy at some points for something going for ""holy grail"" status."
Lastman,Isnt an animation tv outside of comedy a cartoon? They can be for adults too
Lastman,"Bojack has its funny moments but it's more of a drama. I'd say it does this pretty well.
"
Lastman,"Or Tod's cab company starting off as being a taxi service that's a ""safe space for women"" nosediving into being a ""a safe space for men who like looking at women."" Maybe that joke just worked for me, but I find it hilarious when they have an episode that you think is going to be preachy but ends up becoming its own warped joke, like ""Find dat fetus kill dat fetus."""
Lastman,There are lots of western animated shows that aren't explicit comedies that have done exceedingly well.
Lastman,"Persepolis, Waltz with Bashir, Princess Mononoke, etc. maybe there's more than one Grail?"
Lastman,"This is just anime... not really ""Western"" animation. Unless you consider Avatar: The Last Airbender to have achieved the same ""holy grail"" being made in the US and all, being highly successful outside of the ""comedy genre"""

Lastman,I thought the superhero cartoons and avatar were successful too 
Lastman,I was about to make this joke with Bo Jack horseman... because I really like the show. It just isn't funny.
Lastman,"Eh, I think you're overestimating how good the average anime is, there.

There's a *lot* of shit anime out there. Thankfully, there's A LOT of anime, so there still ends up being a lot of great stuff even though most of it isn't. 

But if this was a trailer for an anime, it would definitely be one of the standouts of any given season. Not like new Masaaki Yuasa or Shinichiro Watanabe show level of anticipation, but it'd definitely be one to look out for."
Lastman,this is french
Lastman,"By using the word ""western"" in his title he's cutting off 99.9% of the animation market in the world. So many master pieces in the anime history. Congratulations for being the best of 0.1% dude!!!!!

Basically an average anime.

Edit: sorry for being rude, but I think calling it ""holy grail"" is a bit arrogant of OP."
Lastman,"I love animation, and the last adult, non-comedy, Western animated series I can think of is Aeon Flux.

On the audience side of things, they're rare.

On the creator side of things, you have to put yourself in the place of someone who gets their pitches turned down again and again because ""adults won't watch serious cartoons.  They have to be funny,"" and having to make comedy series that pick up an audience before they can slowly turn the show serious under the network's nose.

Ever wonder why a lot of comedy shows slowly turn more and more serious over time?  That's why.  Because the people who fund the production believe, very firmly, it seems, that cartoons *must* be funny, and the only way for creators to get their foot in the door is to start funny and then blend in character development and plot when the network isn't looking.

So yeah, for creators, creating serious, adult-oriented cartoons is extremely difficult, can take years of work, and still usually ends in being turned down.  For them, it's absolutely their grail."
Lastman,"Speaking as a director of animated work, and having seen great concepts get passed up due to the hemming-in of animated work into kids or comedy only, I would respectfully disagree with you. A holy grail, in this case, is something very difficult to attain. "
Lastman,I think people have also forgotten Young Justice. It had some comedic moments but was largely a serious series. Similar to the 90s batman series but with wider story arcs and a larger assortment of protagonists.
Lastman,"Nope, just some random poetic bullshit about ""problems flying away like birds in a blue sky"" and ""stars in the sky"" and other stuff that sounds good in a poem/song."
Lastman,"Yeah, it's by the same people. - Jérémie Périn is the director of this project. He's also did that dYe music video you linked to, along with a bunch of others. "
Lastman,"They can be, but rarely are.

I mean, what was the last adult, non-comedy, animated series?  Aeon Flux?

Gargoyles is fairly serious, and excellent, but it was technically a kid's show.  The Avatar series is excellent, but just as just comedy as drama(I'm not complaining either, the comedy is perfect for the series and wonderful, and I wouldn't define either as 'comedy' in the genre sense, but at the same time I wouldn't ignore the very strong comedy element).

Hell, Adult Swim's entire thing is 'cartoons for adults' and rather than fund a serious or dramatic show, they've started making live action comedies -- comedy is safe.  I was hoping we'd get a new generation of Liquid Television and evolving animation and storytelling, and instead we got Ed Helms being a clown.

So sure.  Serious cartoons can be for adults.  But there's been like one serious, adult, animated show(non-anime) made, so I think it's disingenuous to act like it's not difficult for Western creators to achieve.  Most networks auto-turn down pitches for animated shows that aren't comedy.

It's why you get a lot of adult cartoons like Rick and Morty, Bojack Horseman, Metalocalypse, Moral Oral, Venture Brothers, etc, where the creators pitch a comedy and then have to ""sneak"" things like plot and character development in through the backdoor.  And you'll notice that of those, two are canceled and one struggles to get a season every two to three years."
Lastman,Is Bojack Horseman a comedy? Everything I've heard suggests it's kind of depressing. 
Lastman,"This is /r/television.

And Princess Mononoke isn't western animation."
Lastman,"This is actually made by the same studio as persepolis:

Lastman,Are you stupid?
Lastman,"> Cool concept, but Samurai Jack and a lot of content on Adult Swim isn't comedy.

What are these animated programs that are both a) Firmly for adults, and b) Not comedies?

>Plus I'm not backing any Kickstarter content anymore since I was burned by Cans Without Labels. Board games only.

Oh no."
Lastman,There's nothing funny about stealing a meal from Neil McBeal the Navy seal?
Lastman,That doesn’t change anything. 
Lastman,A lot of people think anime is beautiful visually but are turned off by the terrible stories.  An adult western style animated series that's not a comedy would really hit the spot.
Lastman,"I legit cannot stand most anime. I do like some anime, but most of the stuff people reccommend to me I just cant get into.

I like almost anything Studio Ghibli. I like Grave of the Fireflies, and stuff like that. I even like Attack on Titan and I used to watch FMA when I was younger. But so far thats all Ive found I can stand. I really dont like anime tropes at all."
Lastman,Over the Garden Wall manages to keep the childish side of things from being any sort of comedy while maintaining a mysterious and foreboding atmosphere the entire time. Highly recommend it
Lastman,"> Ever wonder why a lot of comedy shows slowly turn more and more serious over time?

Honestly no? Can you give me some examples"
Lastman,scavengers is this new thing from adult swim that was sweet

Lastman,"It's all meant to be silly, the show is poised to be very self referencial and self parodic, while still trying to be cool. It was the same in the graphic novel it's based on."
Lastman,well then :p
Lastman,"Over the Garden Wall is a Cartoon Network show that manages to keep itself from becoming a comedy while not completely jumping into adult style. Similar to a Studio Ghilbi movie. It really blurs the line.


I'd also like to point out that there are strong ""kids"" shows that have strong adult appeal. Shows like Gravity Falls, Adventure Time, and Steven Universe manage to bring very adult/real life themes into the show while mixing in the occasional silliness to keep the show from being too dour. Although there are plenty of episodes that dig deep into those dark events. There is some build up at the beginning that seems like pure cheesy/silly kids show stuff but it really accesses some serious themes."
Lastman,"Absolutely a comedy. A dark comedy, and one with serious tones and messages, but it still falls broadly into that category."
Lastman,[deleted]
Lastman,"It gets less  funny as the show moves on, but I still laugh a decent amount. But the story is very sad and tragic, and it covers some pretty heavy topics."
Lastman,Or Seaworld being re-appropriated to house lady whale poledancers and strippers?
Lastman,"It doesn't change you think its mediocre but anime refers to Japanese animation.

I think its sweet. Impossible to find dubbed tho"
Lastman,I just hate when anime's pander. It takes me out of the story whenever they show an upskirt shot.
Lastman,"Pretty sure the show is inspired by one of those so called anime with an adult story. They do have their own genre, seinin. I think they suffer like most long lasting shows with the decrease in quality over time but are strong in the beginning."
Lastman,"Good storytelling is good story telling. Just like the wide array of cartoons available, there's a wide array of anime. Except it's even more wide because it's a beloved for of storytelling with people creating stories for all different ages. "
Lastman,"It was an enjoyable show.  I didn't find it as laudable as others have, though.  It was nice, but I didn't feel like it had a strong throughline.  It was mostly just cute romps.

This isn't to criticize it terribly, so much as to say that others seem to have loved it a lot more than I did.  I would say I liked it, but didn't love it."
Lastman,"Big ones of the last several years that I can think of, off the top of my head, are Rick and Morty, Bojack Horseman, Metalocalypse, Moral Oral, and the Venture Brothers.  I know there have been more, though -- I'm just too lazy to go looking them all up.

Now, all of those are different levels of seriousness.  For example, Rick and Morty is still like 90% comedy, but there's still some character development and plot.  But the others all start out as relatively light hearted or funny and progressively become more character or story oriented as time goes on.

Archer is a cartoon with character development over time, but I wouldn't include it in the list, because it hasn't really increased in seriousness.

Moral Oral and Metalocalypse have been canceled, while the Venture Brothers struggles to get a season every now and again.  Bojack Horseman probably has the best possible home, because Netflix appears to be probably the most progressive(in terms of business practices) producer out there.  

You'll see the phenomenon in kid's shows as well -- Avatar's first season was mainly episodic in nature, with a lose-linked journey through line, but the show was able to focus in more on the developing plot and characters as it gained popularity.

It also occurs on live action adult shows, though less in a comedy-to-serious progression than in a episodic-to-serial fashion.  The writers of Star Trek: DS9 have talked about how they had to ""sneak"" plot into the show, and tried to use two-parters to advance the story, slowly building in popularity until they were able to do the longer plot that they'd wanted to.

The basic common theme is that producers of television are very conservative, when it comes to serious, long form storytelling.  The belief is that people won't watch a show in which any episode can be watched, free of context.  Since the introduction of DVDs, this belief has been being slowly eroded, with LOST being one of the big turning points, but it's still very present within the industry.

And nowhere is it more present than in cartoons.  Cartoon characters aren't even allowed to *age*, something that's really, really weird when you think about it.

Network producers are extremely demanding when it comes to cartoons: it has to be episodic, it has to be comedic.  There's even an entire TV network devoted to airing adult-oriented cartoons, and that network cancels shows that try to be more serious, and has started producing live action comedy shows -- that's how devoted the industry culture is to these tenants.  If a show can become popular enough, creators can manage to either ""slip in"" stories that they want to tell, or else negotiate with the network by pointing out that they've been successful enough to warrant the chance."
Lastman,Kind of sounds like you broke it yourself. 
Lastman,"I tried to google Lastman graphic novel but only got Y:The Last Man which looks nothing like OP's animated series. Does it go by a different name, in french maybe?"
Lastman,"I adore Steven Universe, and think it's one of the most interestingly written shows -- a show that puts a large emphasis on emotional storytelling, which is a form of storytelling much more challenging than scene or event oriented storytelling.  It's really impressive.

Gravity Falls was excellent as well.  Adventure Time was fun, but I could never quite get into it?  I dunno.  It did make me laugh, and there were a lot of good scenes, but it never felt like enough good scenes were linked together to really pick up momentum for me, so I always ended up kind of...having the brakes pumped, I suppose.

Over the Garden Wall was nice, but I find that reddit loves it more than I do.  I didn't find much strong story telling in it, with only some character development.  Largely it was a series of nice, but unrelated romps.  I thought that the background animation was *gorgeous*, absolutely stunning, but was completely betrayed by boring character design.

But anyway, yes, there are a lot of great cartoons out at the moment, and I think that that's fantastic, over all!  But still, all of those shows are kid's shows -- or, well.  I think possibly using ""kid"" and ""adult"" here is misleading, or incorrect. 

Those shows are G-rated, or kid-accessible, but interesting and complex.  Which is all great, and I have no complaints \*thumbs up\*  I'm definitely all for that.

I'd just like more serious/dramatic cartoons that are allowed to explore more adult-oriented stories/material, to go with them.  IE, I don't want less of the former, just more of the latter along with it!"
Lastman,Life.
Lastman,"That actually does sound funny when you phrase it like that. But in the moment, meh."
Lastman,"Maybe in the 80s, but now it's just a genre/style. There are plenty of American anime. "
Lastman,"Seinen isnt a genre it's a demographic, seinen anime and manga is aimed at adult males. Shonen which is aimed at teenage males tends to be very popular outside of Japan."
Lastman,"I loved it in the way you love marshmallow. Soft and sweet, but not much to bite your teeth into and makes you throw up if you have too much."
Lastman,"> Network producers are extremely demanding when it comes to cartoons: it has to be episodic, it has to be comedic.

Dan Harmon, writer of Rick and Morty, said something interesting about television as an art form. (Which I will now try to paraphrase):

He said that television is a commercial art form. Its purpose is to sell ad space. That's the medium the artist works with. I feel like for him, recognizing that has freed him to embrace every bit of potential within TV'S limitations. Rather than struggle to get more and more pure art past the network suits or the philistines in the flyover states, embrace your position as a shill for products and make your little dance the best new dance on television."
Lastman,"Doesn't the existence and popularity of anime completely debunk this myth?  Can't producers look at how popular some of the serious anime are and be like ""we're going to make something like that"""
Lastman,"> There's even an entire TV network devoted to airing adult-oriented cartoons, and that network cancels shows that try to be more serious, and has started producing live action comedy shows

Thiiiiiiiiis. I don't give two shits about Children's Hospital, Adult Swim. Don't forget that Robot Chicken and ATHF are your moneymakers."
Lastman,You forgot f is for family
Lastman,"> And nowhere is it more present than in cartoons. Cartoon characters aren't even allowed to age, something that's really, really weird when you think about it.

Yeah, that's a good point. The Venture Brothers, which you mentioned above, is the only animated show I can think of where the characters explicitly age, and begin to look different as the show goes on.

The Simpsons, which have been on air for most of my life, are still the exact same age. (Not that this is a bad thing for them; their formula works, and kids aging on shows can drastically change the dynamic, and break the show.)"
Lastman,damn you got this to the T. what do you think of the batman animated series?
Lastman,That'd be a controversial opinion.
Lastman,"Nope, it's the same:

http://us.macmillan.com/series/lastman"
Lastman,"I get your point. I think that these series are a lot stronger than a lot of very serious ""adult-oriented"" shows. While I enjoy occasionally watching Breaking Bad/Daredevil/Jessica Jones/etc, most of those series don't capture me the same way and typically have too heavy of a mood. Of course it's all gonna be based on their storytelling and quality. Shows like Steven Universe and Adventure Time have wonderful writers who work very hard to keep consistency in the world and characters. Steven universe has the best consistency I've ever seen in any TV show. Aside from the occasional art differences between episodes, there is a strong emphasis on how body and eye language. 


If you haven't watched past season 3 of Adventure Time, I'd highly recommend it. While there's always that stopping feeling, there's such as strong connection between episodes seasons apart that it is often amazing to me. And I'd say there are many emotional moments that dig deep. Season 7 has been the best season yet to me, especially with the Stakes miniseries."
Lastman,"IDK they're just cartoons and animation to me. Some are just more detailed than others.

Having action and fight scenes or characters with colored hair isn't gonna make it more anime to me."
Lastman,That's fair but I consider it a category/genre because many sites have used it as such. The feel of seinin manga/anime are wildly different from shounen or shoujo. There's usually visible differences in the art style too. 
Lastman,"The problem is that getting execs to change their beliefs turns out to be *spectacularly* difficult.

I mean, they still whole-heartedly believe that ""boys won't watch shows with female main characters,"" despite the fact that creators(most notably the two creators behind the Avatar series) have debunked it and said ""Look.  Here.  You can make female-led shows.  It'll be okay.""

But most network execs are more likely to turn down female-led pitches, because they still believe that they will be inherently less profitable, despite evidence to the contrary.

And, I mean, think how long it took for studios to really, truly believe that *the internet* isn't going away.  That fact was obvious to everyone by 1999, but it's almost twenty years later and there are studios still acting like they don't need to bother with online distribution, or do it poorly, in a very reluctant ""fine"" kind of way, instead of accepting it as the clear and obvious new method of distribution, going forward."
The Asterisk War,"Neeson:

>”No, I’m not,” Neeson said when asked if he’s interested in returning. “There’s so many spinoffs of ‘Star Wars.’ It’s diluting it to me, and it’s taken away the mystery and the magic in a weird way.”

>""It was nice to do that little bit with Ewan, after 25 years, 24 years. I appeared in the last episode. I had 2 lines to say, and it was cool and I loved it. But that's it."""
The Asterisk War,Star Wars is being hurt by lack of direction and mediocrity.
The Asterisk War,"The only Star Wars spinoff I've liked is Rogue One and Andor. 

Andor was one of those where I couldn't *believe* anyone was able to get the script approved."
The Asterisk War,"I just don't understand why they insist only doing stuff from the start of the clone wars to just after the fall of the empire. Give me some Old Republic stuff like Mandalorian wars, the ancient sith lords, or the creation of the jedi order."
The Asterisk War,Or maybe it's that the ratio of good to shitty movies/shows is like 1 out of 5 being generous.
The Asterisk War,Number of spin-offs isn't the problem. Terrible scripts are.
The Asterisk War,Liam Neesons though….
The Asterisk War,"Honestly, the last movies were hideous in comparison with the spin offs."
The Asterisk War,There's different camps of Star Wars fans. Original trilogy vs original 6 vs disney Star Wars
The Asterisk War,"ITT: Lots of misdirected anger.

The guy is right, and there's nothing wrong with him saying so.

Edit: FYI, if you're writing me a five paragraph essay of fan drivel, I'm not going to read it."
The Asterisk War,"I can see where he's coming from, but when your spinoffs (Mando, Andor) are considered better than the trilogy that recently came out, you gotta get behind what's still making you bank."
The Asterisk War,They are being hurt from shit stories and terrible writers
The Asterisk War,"He then closed out the interview by promoting his next film.

#Tooken 8: The Tookening"
The Asterisk War,"He's not wrong.

It's why DC Comics tried to streamline things for new readers with The New 52, and then Marvel later tried the same thing with Marvel NOW!; when there's too much of something, people get fatigued trying to keep up with everything.

You could always say ""don't watch everything"" but that's not how the brain works."
The Asterisk War,The “mystery” was taken away with “midiclorians “
The Asterisk War,"Agreed. And he isn't saying all ""spinoffs"" are bad, which would be unsupportable (see: Andor). An overabundance of varying quality, definitely."
The Asterisk War,"I mean I kinda agree 

Mainly if your content isn’t AAA maybe it shouldn’t be made 

Like bad batch is great but some episodes are kinda filler and think obi wan and boba Fett shows don’t need to exist"
The Asterisk War,He should know. He was a part of the beginning of the end.
The Asterisk War,He's right.
The Asterisk War,Andor
The Asterisk War,"Andor was ten times better than the last 6 movies.

I think it's the opposite.  The terrible movies are ruining the franchise.

Even bobba fett was better than the last few movies."
The Asterisk War,"Wasn't he in the midichlorians Star Wars episode that literally removed the mystery of the force?

And didn't he have that bullshit story line about Anakin?  Ok, just checking."
The Asterisk War,I agree with him for the most part. Andor was out of this world.
The Asterisk War,"Hes right, but also....

Do another movie where your a grizzled old veteran that has to begrudgingly do one last job or save someone that's in trouble, and in the process you redeem yourself."
The Asterisk War,Says the guy who did “Taken” and dozen other  of the same formulaic films of a guy seeking revenge.
The Asterisk War,"I hate to break it to him, but the prequels diminished the value of the franchise."
The Asterisk War,"Says the guy from: Men in Black International, Daddy’s Home 2, The Huntsman, Ted 2, Taken 1-2-3, Anchorman 2, Wrath of the Titans, The Chronicles of Narnia, The A-Team, Les Mis, Arthur the King, Excalibur, and I’m sure I’m missing a few spinoffs, remakes and sequels. He is well versed in running stories into the ground."
The Asterisk War,Says the man in the first spinoff.
The Asterisk War,Bro there’s too many Liam Neeson movies if anything. Three of them came out last year alone and I bet they were all basically the same
The Asterisk War,"He's right. I used to really enjoy the movies occasionally. Even saw the prequels in theaters. Then they kept coming, one after the other and every dumb mother fucker in the world is out here trying to act like they are the biggest fan in the world. It got so annoying that I can't enjoy any of that shit anymore"
The Asterisk War,It’s become the Empire
The Asterisk War,I don’t mind the expanded universe of movies so long as they are not shit and lately the complaint is that the movies and spinoffs have been nothing but social justice shit.
The Asterisk War,Totally agree
The Asterisk War,"Yeah, sorry Liam, but nah. Projects like Rogue One, Mandalorian, Bad Batch, and Andor show that there is plenty of time for great stories in this universe. It's not an issue of to much content, but an issue of flying space Mary Poppins cameos of Princess Leia's reanimated corpse and Jar Jar Bigalow ""Mee-sa Senator now"" being regurgitated into the screen. The issue isn't volume, it's quality."
The Asterisk War,"""Being hurt""?  


No, the damage was done a very long time ago. Now its more like kicking the pulverized remains of a long dead horse"
The Asterisk War,"people here complaining about diluting star wars, sayin disney is at fault.

meanwhile i was reading these same stories in the 90s, in comic and/or novel form, because the star wars EU existed.

the only difference is now they are turning the stories into live action. hell episode 9, which i greatly dislike, is still very much Dark Empire from the 90s.

Fuck if they dont need to go ahead and make Shadows of the Empire into a live action series.

crime lords vs sith lords. lets go!"
The Asterisk War,I happen to agree with Mr Neeson on this...
The Asterisk War,Whatever made Andor happen - keep doing that.  Best Star Wars material out there.
The Asterisk War,"Stars Wars succumbed to the Marvel-ization effect a while ago. I feel the same way about a new star wars IP as I do a new superhero movie: oh, ok."
The Asterisk War,"“Star Wars” always struck me as a story about Anakin Skywalker and how he turned away from good and then was redeemed by the love of his son. 

That story has been told."
The Asterisk War,"Well Star Wars fans have proven that they'll watch and like any old crap, so it doesn't really matter."
The Asterisk War,I agree and also like the some of the spin offs.
The Asterisk War,Space Jesus isn't wrong
The Asterisk War,"Think the sequel trilogy did that, mate."
The Asterisk War,When does Taken 6 come out?
The Asterisk War,I think it’s diluting for me that Neeson has made multiple films with the same plot for the last 15 years.
The Asterisk War,Clearly not a fan of Andor being better than his entire role.
The Asterisk War,"No, it's been hurt by Disney having ZERO outline for the Sequel Trilogy.  Rian Johnson's Episode 8 was a mess, then Episode 9 was an abomination.  ""Somehow, Palpatine returned.""  

Say what you will about Geroge Lucas' writing skills, but ""Somehow, Palpatine returned.""  Is just about the most idiotic sentence in any Star Wars movie... scratch that, ANY movie where a villain came back for unexplained reasons."
The Asterisk War,"I disagree, I think fleshing out the galaxy beyond the skywalker saga is a good thing.

I think people are conflating some of the quality issues of some of the content with the need for said content. I would prefer Disney spend more time curating quality Star Wars spin-offs rather than green lighting every half assed project, but I don’t think spin-offs themselves are the issue."
The Asterisk War,Isn’t this the guy that shared screen time with JarJar Binks?
The Asterisk War,"Respectfully, I disagree."
The Asterisk War,Boooo … explore the Galaxy.
The Asterisk War,"Yeah, well, you know, that's just, like, your opinion, man.

I think its fine, its more the varying quality that is the problem, not the quantity."
The Asterisk War,"I have to disagree with him - especially when it comes to the shows.  For this IP or any other, it really comes down to the quality of what is being produced, not the number.  If it is good, then people will watch it.  For ***Star Wars*** specifically, the ""universe"" is so large I am enjoying the more micro looks into it."
The Asterisk War,"Ehh sounds like an old man complaining bout kids on the lawn, I wanna see every story of that universe and now I can. Sure some are misses but at least they tried."
The Asterisk War,Jar Jar.
The Asterisk War,"I don't know, many people are actually liking some of the things they have done. Many spinoffs in the movie department were really good, like rogue one and solo, many were great successes like the mandalorian and andor. Fans love those (maybe some not so much at the start like it happened with the episodes one though three) but the misses on Disney plus have been much less, the bigger ones were in the last trilogy.

The only thing that really was going to hurt the brand was focusing entirely on the Skywalkers. Fans loved and live through the extended universe for years until they had some live action stuff again. And that was the beauty of Starwars how they could make different stories in the same universe not make everything about the same people all the time."
The Asterisk War,It is funny because the spinoffs are the only thing that I enjoy.
The Asterisk War,Yeah it started around 2001...
The Asterisk War,"You were in one of those spinoffs, Liam! XD"
The Asterisk War,"Yep star wars stopped being special a long time ago but there was money to be made so can't really blame disney for squeezing every penny out of it. If you could of told 12 year old me there would be multiple star wars tv shows and movies I would never be even quasi interested in, I don't think I would of believed you, but here we are."
The Asterisk War,I mean...the movie he was in started that.
The Asterisk War,"Hard to agree when Andor is hands down the best piece of starwars content out there.

I know people who don't watch any starwars content that loved Andor."
The Asterisk War,"Yes, but I knew Disney was going to get that 4 billion they paid George Lucas for the franchise back and then some.

There was a video of a guy or someone freaking out when Star Wars Episode 49 or some such came out. I figured that was where it was going to go."
The Asterisk War,Pretty sure midiclorines s/p are the ones that took the mystery away.
The Asterisk War,I love Qui-Gon!
The Asterisk War,"Lol. jar jar binks. There are only 3 star wars films, anything else ruins it."
The Asterisk War,Wrong
The Asterisk War,Wrong.
The Asterisk War,"After reading the comments, I just wanted to say I enjoy the prequels; especially ROTS!"
The Asterisk War,Honestly… Rogue One is the only Star Wars movie I like and would watch again.
The Asterisk War,Oh please bring back the midiclorian bs…
The Asterisk War,Humbly disagree.
The Asterisk War,"I love Liam, but Star Wars shat that bed the first movie he was in. At first i was annoyed at them ruining my childhood. Then I realized I'm a grown ass man. Maybe it's ok that Star Wars don't cater to me as a grown ass man the way they did when I was a kid."
The Asterisk War,Yep.  This cow has been milked dry
The Asterisk War,"From the man, in the movie that gave us a boring genetic reason for jedi to exist."
The Asterisk War,"No, because there was no more story to tell after the first trilogy."
The Asterisk War,The damage was done with the prequels.
The Asterisk War,"Yeah, fuck that. Andor was great. Rogue One was great. Keep them coming."
The Asterisk War,No one tell him about where midichlorians came from
The Asterisk War,"I feel like the original appeal was a rag tag group of filmmakers and actors got together to tell a story about a rag tag group of underdogs adventuring around space, with lots of space battles and laser swords. But it's grown so beyond that now that it's so exceptionally mainstream. That's probably why The Mandalorian and The Clone Wars are so popular among fans because they are the closest to capturing that spirit."
The Asterisk War,"I love The Mandalorian and the original trilogy. I haven't seen Clone Wars or Andor yet. Otherwise, I think the franchise has been more misses than hits."
The Asterisk War,"I think he has a point. Lot of garbage in the star wars universe. But there's some true gems. Andor is truly remarkable and if you love star wars, then this series acts as a love letter without unnecessary fan service. It's fantastic story telling within the star wars universe with compelling and interesting characters."
The Asterisk War,That’s because he didn’t get a part in a good show. Like Andor…
The Asterisk War,I swear I read this as Leslie Nielsen.
The Asterisk War,“We have to explain the reason behind Han Solo’s last name.”
The Asterisk War,"…He says from the set of Taken 13. /s 

But for real, they should’ve stopped after the prequels, at least there was a point to those ones."
The Asterisk War,Isn't this one of the main criticisms leveled against the prequels when they came out? George Lucas has the same problem I do where he has too much anxiety when it comes to explaining things and so he over explains instead of letting the audience infer things. A big reason the first 3 movies were good was because of his ex-wife who edited them.
The Asterisk War,-said a person who's never read a star wars book
The Asterisk War,No its being hurt by idiots making the decisions and poor writing
The Asterisk War,"If only Qui Gon had a young daughter that had been kidnapped whilst on holiday in Coruscant with her best friend, and then he had to use his talents to track her and bring justice to the evil ringleader of the trafficking gang. That would have worked as a spinoff series!!!"
The Asterisk War,You mean bad star wars. Andor is a masterclass in how NOT to fuck up the universe. I say more spinoffs
The Asterisk War,"True, I literally did not even care about the spin-offs only the main trilogy movies."
The Asterisk War,"I totally disagree with Neeson here. If they made fewer Star Wars spinoffs they wouldn't suddenly be more magical. Instead of regular soulless cash crabs it would just be somewhat rare soulless cash crabs.

Hack writers and creatively bankrupt people don't magically become more talented by doing less work."
The Asterisk War,"That's a very reductive take on what is a grand fictional universe ripe to tell many different kinds of stories in.

Lack of mystery and magic doesn't happen because of spin-offs, it happens because of unimaginative writers.

But there is a bit of truth to it, of course. You can't keep telling stories without chipping away at the mysteries of the IP. That's just how it goes.

However, I have never believed that to mean that more stories shouldn't be told."
The Asterisk War,I've got the perfect solution: don't watch the spinoffs.
The Asterisk War,He’s right and he should say it.
The Asterisk War,"Well, I don't know. Maybe he has a point, but for me the reason it has been hurt has more to do with the lack of talent and vision, particularly in the sequel trilogy."
The Asterisk War,10000% agreed
The Asterisk War,Solo is the best Star Wars movie and I'll die on that hill.
Peter Rabbit,So is the Lakes District astro turfing for tourism in a global pandemic or what?
Peter Rabbit,"So, I guess their goal today was to take everyone who said D+ had no original content besides The Mandalorian, and pretty much punch them in the face repeatedly."
Peter Rabbit,Hooch is crazy

Peter Rabbit,/u/arashtp you missed Percy Jackson.
Peter Rabbit,Super stoked on most of this. I’m especially looking forward to the Nat geo content. Can you imagine if Disney+ dropped with half of these titles? Game changer
Peter Rabbit,"Based on the release timelines of those shows, it looks like their strategy is: 

Zeitgeist show for 6 weeks -> 1 week of cool down —> couple weeks of hype up -> next Zeitgeist show -> Repeat"
Peter Rabbit,They're really going all out with the High Republic.
Peter Rabbit,did She Hulk get a trailer or anything?
Peter Rabbit,that's a lot of content
Peter Rabbit,"So strange to realize Ice Age is owned by Disney now. 

Also I’m sort of unexpectedly excited about the continuation of Mighty Ducks!"
Peter Rabbit,A Turner and Hooch reboot yyyeeeeessss!!! I've been a fan (we call ourselves Hoochers) for years and am flipping out right now!!!!
Peter Rabbit,Missing rogue squadron on Star Wars
Peter Rabbit,Hocus Pocus 2. What.

Just going to ignore the Little Mermaid and Tangled series apparently."

Peter Rabbit,I have only read a hand full of moon knight comics but from what I have heard and read making a PG moon knight show is not going to go over well with fans.
Peter Rabbit,Any specific dates to go with this?
Peter Rabbit,You forgot the multiple tongue in cheek references to Matt Murdock.  Charlie Cox's Daredevil is officially part of the MCU now.  Hes apparently in She Hulk and Spider-Man 3.
Peter Rabbit,"Damn, the Ducks end up becoming what they rebelled against..."
Peter Rabbit,"As a bi dude I'm still waiting for literally anything big that features a non-straight dude. In film they ignored it almost completely out of fear of gay-hating countries banning it and them losing money (like China). 

Really hoping for something to come through, maybe with x-men back in the fold Iceman could get something"
Peter Rabbit,So is Ahsoka taking the place of the Rebels spinoff? Because thats what I was most excited for
Peter Rabbit,Disney is milking Star Wars and Marvel for everything dollar they can squeeze. There are way too many reboots and remakes. They need originally sourced content that has no reliance on existing IP. How about some original NON-Marvel/Star Wars scripted content? I think the Mandalorian is a cute show but I want to see ORIGINAL content for once. This slate of shows are not enough to keep all of their subscribers satisfied.
Peter Rabbit,I just want to have the spin off Thrawn and Ezra travels in space show.
Peter Rabbit,"Hey, bozo, why didn't you mention It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia?

Great list, otherwise."
Peter Rabbit,so much content that post alone made me vomit .
Peter Rabbit,Seems like Star Wars's future is on TV.
Peter Rabbit,Is it weird that I'm most excited for the Josh Peck version of Turner and Hooch?
Peter Rabbit,"Looks like they're updating Microcosmos with A Real Bug's Life, that should be cool as fuck."
Peter Rabbit,">The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers

>Lauren Graham (Gilmore Girls, Parenthood) and Emilio Estevez (reprising his role from the original feature films) star in the next chapter of the hit Mighty Ducks franchise, premiering in early 2021. In present day Minnesota, the Mighty Ducks have evolved from scrappy underdogs to an ultra-competitive, powerhouse youth hockey team. After 12-year-old Evan is unceremoniously cut from the Ducks, he and his mom Alex set out to build their own ragtag team of misfits to challenge the cutthroat, win-at-all-costs culture of competitive youth sports.

I hope Disney has been paying attn to Cobra Kai and takes all the good from it and applies it to the Ducks!!!"
Peter Rabbit,"Man, Tony Stark cannot keep control of his tech, can he? Well, I guess he's dead, so that makes sense."
Peter Rabbit,The one thing I want from Marvel is an OG Nick Fury and the Howling Commandos show.
Peter Rabbit,They forgot Shadow Hunters.
Peter Rabbit,Disney+ launch was more like beta test to ensure their decision of allocating such resources to the platform
Peter Rabbit,"The criticism was regarding lack of original screenplays, too. It's still true in that aspect."
Peter Rabbit,"It's still lacks diversity, it's still marvel, star wars and Pixar animated pg-13 movies, still no new new IPs."
Peter Rabbit,[deleted]
Peter Rabbit,"If they don't have Phill Lewis playing the dog using mocap, they dun goofed."
Peter Rabbit,*holds up lighter*
Peter Rabbit,Thanks man you're awesome
Peter Rabbit,[Rogue squadron](https://youtu.be/5bLkTjn6Y_s)
Peter Rabbit,Not enough 🚀🚀🚀
Peter Rabbit,"Just hints at Daredevil, from Sony in Spider-Man 3 and at the reveal here today for She-Hulk."
Peter Rabbit,"Yeah sounds like the Multiverse in SM3 will pull in Daredevil and Kingpin. Which could be great.

Daredevil was hinted at strongly for SheHulk, and there have been rumors that DNofrio has campaigned hard and they’ve taken him seriously as maybe using his character to put together the Sinister Six."
Peter Rabbit,"There's a big hint in Hawkeye. Maya Lopez is a definitively Daredevil character (Echo, a deaf woman who can see something once and imitate it originally hired by Kingpin to take out Daredevil and eventually befriending him). She also wore the Ronin outfit for awhile that Hawkeye wore in Endgame after his family vanished (New Avengers comics).

Edit: why am I being downvoted for this?"
Peter Rabbit,And Swiss Family Robinson.
Peter Rabbit,It’s pretty genius
Peter Rabbit,Super into the Acolyte as I’d really like to see what the Sith/dark side users were up to during this time period
Peter Rabbit,"No, but they confirmed Tatiana Maslany."
Peter Rabbit,Tim Roth will be back as Abomination and Mark Ruffalo.
Peter Rabbit,Its a rather deceptive line if your not in the know.  WDAS is the movie studio. Disney Television Animation is the studio that typically handles the TV side (they were the ones that made the Tangled series).
Peter Rabbit,That's not necessarily a bad thing tbh. It's how they execute it that matters. GOTG was kinda considered a bottom of the barrel IP for marvel before they made it and it turned out well.
Peter Rabbit,"There’s like 70 announced shows here and less than 10 are actual original ideas. Really disappointing *in my opinion*.

I get people like Star Wars and stuff, but it seems extreme to me."
Peter Rabbit,"I think it could be done. For me at least the fun part is the mind-bendy unreliable narrator stuff and not the graphic violence. Although there is something to be said for when other characters meet Moon Knight and are like, ""oh this guy is *crazy* crazy and not just *Batman* crazy."""
Peter Rabbit,"This didn’t mention any of the Marvel movies since it’s still not certain whether they’ll be released in theaters first or on Disney+ at the same time, but The Eternals is set to have their first openly gay main character whenever that’s released.

If you haven’t watched the Disney+ short film Out, you absolutely should."
Peter Rabbit,"Young Avengers is just over the horizon, and that comes with the most prominent gay couple in marvel. Still a few years out though."
Peter Rabbit,Not sure if it is 100% confirmed but I remember seeing somewhere that Valkyrie is looking for a wife in the next Thor movie.
Peter Rabbit,"As a fellow homo, I'm sorry you're getting downvoted, but that's r/television for you. I've learned not to bring up representation issues on this sub anymore."
Peter Rabbit,"I would bet it will be in a team, or they will reveal the character is gay in a sequel...that way people in China will already be invested.  Because you’re right....they want that China money badly. 


Wouldn’t it be a kick in the nuts to China if the wait until like Shang Chi 3 and reveal he was gay the whole time! Lmao. That could literally start a war!!"
Peter Rabbit,"I feel like this'll be a big part of the Ashoka show, considering that she was still searching when we see her in The Mandolorian."
Peter Rabbit,Thats not on Disney+ you 1 star fool.
Peter Rabbit,That’s pathetic
Peter Rabbit,I really don't like the sound of this. The whole point of the Ducks is that they are scrappy underdogs. Having them become what they played against feels kind of weird. And it's obviously gonna end with both Ducks teams playing against each other. It just sounds weird to me.
Peter Rabbit,"They're going all in because they've lost all profits from Disney parks and tourism, 75% of their revenue.

Also why they gutted ESPN"
Peter Rabbit,"Certainly, but was anyone really expecting that? Aside from Pixar, Disney hasn't done an original story in... I'm not sure. Possibly ever."
Peter Rabbit,Pixar films are all new IPs lol
Peter Rabbit,[deleted]
Peter Rabbit,One Star Wars IP will drive more total interest than anything on HBO Max lmao
Peter Rabbit,"Uh ""Win or Lose"" is a new IP."
Peter Rabbit,"You are soo right. Marvel has been overdone, it's a stale medium at this point.  SW feels the same after the last 3 movies. Even Mando is aimless with no real main plotline.

It's so formulaic it isn't appealing.

Will smith movie,
Cars tv show, 
SW, SW, SW, SW, SW
Marvel movies or shows of all side movie characters, because why not saturate the market with bland superheros"
Peter Rabbit,"Yeah. Did anyone really expect Disney to do something genuinely new? Aside from Pixar, which still has very niche content, I can't remember the last time Disney did an actually new story. 

It's one of the reasons this obsession people on here have with D+ ""killing"" Netflix is so silly."
Peter Rabbit,Well original content in this context means content that is developed specificity for the platform and is owned by Disney
Peter Rabbit,"
>Daredevil was hinted at strongly for SheHulk...

That doesn't excite me...  I don't see Daredevil remaining dark and gritty if placed in She-Hulk.  SH over the years has been more of a fun loving character."
Peter Rabbit,"It's going to be interesting to see how Tim Roth plays his take on Mark Ruffalo. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

^^i ^^jest"
Peter Rabbit,[deleted]
Peter Rabbit,"It's a Disney property.

They a announced it today, as well.

It actually appears on traditional broadcast television, anyone who can't see this **IS A SAVAGE AND AN IDIOT**.

Stoked about almost all of these, though."
Peter Rabbit,Most of these projects are planned before the COVID
Peter Rabbit,Different services provide different content. I dont see why that's only an issue when it's Disney. How much Oscar winning animated content do we see on HBO or Netflix?
Peter Rabbit,Duh.  If you want Disney's adult content you mosey over to Hulu.  If you've been looking at the end of the year critics' lists you'll have noticed Disney is beating Netflix and Warnerbrothers decisively when it comes to critical acclaim.
Peter Rabbit,Disney doesn’t give a fuck about that. They care about commercial success of which they aren’t matched.
Peter Rabbit,The show is listed as a comedy. Not sure how Charlie's Matt Murdock would fit into that.
Peter Rabbit,"I get it. But AntMan seemed really dumb to me. So did Thor at the time, and GotG is when I thought they had given up. 

I think the Series will be used to set up bigger events in the movies.  Almost like a Rogue One to Star Wars.  

That way people who want more background will have it, and yet you don’t HAVE to have seen it to follow the movies.  

Also Ironheart, Kate Bishop, Ms Marvel and I’m betting a Young Loki will get set up for a Secret Avengers movie."
Peter Rabbit,"Armor Wars is widely considered one of the best, if not the best period, Iron Man stories.

We’ll most likely see Justin Hammer return and the intro of some other big Iron Man villains like Crimson Dynamo.

I wouldn’t call it bottom of the barrel. The only difference is that War Machine will he finally getting the spotlight rather than Iron Man"
Peter Rabbit,"Well, you have to remember, when they first started making Marvel movies, Iron Man was a very odd choice in how to begin."
Peter Rabbit,Yes.  Can they only make outer space/superhero stuff?  That’s not the only genre.
Peter Rabbit,"Well, I don't agree with ALL the nominations, I think this is a pretty good list! I think Pedro Pascal had better win best reoccurring character! And again, I would have included GoT in Best Television Show (I mean, come on! Season 4 was the best season yet!) I do agree that True Detective and The Returned are awesome nominations. Can't wait for the final results.  "
Somewhere Between,I agree it is truly impressive how bad this show is.  I also couldn't finish the pilot and I love groundhog day plots.
Somewhere Between,I couldn't make it through the first episode and I am normally *extremely* open and forgiving towards bad TV. Pilots (or even entire first seasons) run into all kinds of problems like low budget and fresh new actors so I tend to cut them some slack. But the first episode of this was unwatchable for me.
Somewhere Between,It's so bad that it makes me feel even sadder about Downward Dog getting canceled. 
Somewhere Between,It's so bad but I love Paula Patton. I already know that it's going to be cancelled. 
Somewhere Between,ive never even heard of this show
Somewhere Between,"Paula Patton's acting really annoys me in this show. The concept itself is interesting (it is remake of a Korean series, roughly about traveling back in time two weeks), but Paula's caught in a wind tunnel expressions never end."
Somewhere Between,"I watched the first episode.  I watched the whole thing just in case it got better.  It did, but not enough to continue watching."
Somewhere Between,I'm watching the pilot now. She's pretty damn bad. Like ridiculously bad.  And the writing has no flow. It's very choppy. All her lines seem to be 1- 2 sentences written by a 12 year old.  Just watched the part where she find out her daughter was taken with her gasps. It's Mark Wahlberg in the happening bad. 
Somewhere Between,Fantastic soundtrack.
Somewhere Between,This show is pure fucking gold. The mom’s power is my absolute favorite.
Somewhere Between,"It's a sign of good writing when a show about people with superpowers is interesting because of the character dynamics/relationships rather than their powers, which play a secondary role to their relationships more than anything else. Whilst the show does involve her searching for her power, it's very much used more as a vehicle for the narrative than the actual plot of the show."
Somewhere Between,"3 episodes in and damn this is really good. It's literally what I wished My hero Academia had more of

Quick binge"
Somewhere Between,"Really fun show. Highly enjoyed it. Just wondering though was I the only one frustrated by the money issues when the girl who could get possessed by ghosts exists? I know they addressed it in one episode but I’d spend every episode thinking of the dozens and dozens of ways she could use that power to be insanely wealthy.  

Having that power and not being a billionaire felt pretty inexcusable. Even a phone line where people could speak to their dead relatives is easy millions and that’s one of the least lucrative uses I thought of."
Somewhere Between,I'm loving it! I'm loving the girl playing Jen 's boss. She's doing a great job.
Somewhere Between,"Just binged this. Reminds me of the graphic novel Top Ten where the world is the same - everyone has a superpower.  

Does anyone think Jen's power is >!to nullify other people's power!< ?"
Somewhere Between,Just finished the whole show and i LOVE it! It was quite different than anything i have seen in a long time. Very funny but also very heartwarming. The characters are great!
Somewhere Between,"Really enjoyed the series just binged it. A bit predictable, but not enough to put me off it. One complaint though,  as much as I liked the soundtrack, I felt it was poorly balanced for volume. I'm a bit deaf so I had it turned up for the dialogue, but then the music would blast in. Anyone else feel that?"
Somewhere Between,Oh my god that was one of the best shows I’ve watched in a while. I really hope they release a second season!!
Somewhere Between,"The show was brilliant. Quirky, different yet relatable. I think Jen's power is to influence other people's powers. That's my theory. Maybe Jizzlord's power acted up because of her, same with the girl who teleports and Lucas the flying guy?"
Somewhere Between,"Just watched the first episode and it's really promising so far, fun light hearted, without being for kids. They do some good jokes with extras and their powers"
Somewhere Between,I’m loving sister Michael as the mom. Glad to have her back after Derry Girls ended.
Somewhere Between,"As a newer parent, I won't be able to watch Encanto now that I've seen the adult version and it rules! Literally she doesn't have a power and her sister is super strong. I also took edibles before watching but I swear there were other similarities to Encanto."
Somewhere Between,I need season two IMMEDIATELY.
Somewhere Between,"This show was hilarious and heart-warming and enjoyable! I cried at the discovery at the end of the first episode. That was a little heartbreaking but in a good way. 

I wonder if there are more people with Carrie's power, since there are like multiple flying people. I want to know all about the world building!"
Somewhere Between,"I thought this show was fantastic. Really hope we get a second season.

Also great music"
Somewhere Between,Jizzlord is hilarious.
Somewhere Between,"Thoroughly enjoyed the show! 8/10

Binged it Friday evening/night. Funny moments, genuine emotions and i really like the angle of how characters are really trying to help and support each other but they have their own life and problems as well. 

Hoping for a follow up season but regardless a fun show to watch over the weekend of you are looking for something different to watch."
Somewhere Between,This is my absolute new favorite show. Absolutely fantastic.
Somewhere Between,"I stumbled upon this show randomly on Hulu, and I loved it! Funny, heartwarming, original premise, and interesting characters. My only complaint is that eight episodes wasn't nearly enough! I'm so glad to hear that it's already been renewed for a second season."
Somewhere Between,"I just finished the first episode and I like it, The humor is very british and a bit lewd, and also >!there's an emotional gut punch during the end of the first episode!<, I think I am going to binge few episodes after this.

If you're into superhero and British sitcoms, you should try this series."
Somewhere Between,Just finished the series. Awesome show. Can’t wait for S2. I hope we will see Come Boy again.
Somewhere Between,"Almost finished the series, love it"
Somewhere Between,Dentist lady should pick another career.
Somewhere Between,The dynamics of the main characters of Extraordinary reminds me of “You’re the Worst”.
Somewhere Between,This show sounds interesting. What did you guys think about it?
Somewhere Between,I binged it all and I loved it. Just hilarious without feeling like there isn't any development
Somewhere Between,"Hey, I noticed there was no active sub for the show,  so I made https://www.reddit.com/r/extraordinary_tv?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share.

Come join if you wanna discuss the show!"
Somewhere Between,Binged through all 8 episodes and really enjoyed it. My only gripe is how insufferable a character Jen is. Not so insufferable that I can't watch but similar to Elena from The Vampire Diaries.
Somewhere Between,Get rid of Kash
Somewhere Between,I’m loving this show!
Somewhere Between,[removed]
Somewhere Between,I only watch 3 episodes and I really like it. It is very funny.
Somewhere Between,"Does anyone know what the song in episode 2 is (or if it's a real/full song), when it cuts to the opening credits? Lyrics were ""does confidence look good on me"" ?"
Somewhere Between,Thanks a lot for linking the sub :)
Somewhere Between,"Guys, what power does ang (the party store manager) have exactly?"
Somewhere Between,"Anyone can tell me what’s up with the sister and her violin? I first learned about it when Jen realised the violin thing was coz of her strength, but I don’t remember any mention of it earlier from previous episodes and can’t find it"
Somewhere Between,I just finished watching the first 2 episodes. Good show. I enjoy it.
Somewhere Between,I liked the show but found jen’s character to be insufferable for most of the episodes
Somewhere Between,i dropped it after 3. it felt basic and predictable.
Somewhere Between,"I find it hard to relate to a show where the characters don’t act smart or realistically. 

Too many times in the series where characters just don’t act like a real person"
Somewhere Between,"Anyone else watch just to find out what Jen's super power was going to be? And expect it to be revealed on the last episode? I just finished watching episode 8 and I was very >!disappointed that the showrunners decided to not reveal was Jen's super power is. Like, it was a huge let down that kind of soured the ending of the last episode. I waited all the time for that one climatic moment - and it was never delivered!!!!< and then on TOP of that >!After Jen finally gets a BF and ditches douchey flying boy whose too embarassed to be seen publicly dating her, Jizzlord ends up being a dad with a secret family and can't even BE with Jen? Like WTF!!! Way to end with a big let down of no bf and no superpowers. Anyone else feel that way??!<"
Somewhere Between,"ooh ooh ooh I forgot about this - how is this? Is it funny, or is it a british style comedy?"
Somewhere Between,Is it just me or has the “everyone else has super powers but me” trope been done to death?
Somewhere Between,"Incredible. Courtney Barnett, Go Team-you can guess how old is the creator!"
Somewhere Between,Whats the mom's power? I'm drawing a blank.
Somewhere Between,"I am glad you like it, I just finished binged 8 episodes and I enjoyed it. Jizzlord is my favorite. This series was a delight binge watch, light, funny, a bit crude and lewd, and sometimes, heartwarming."
Somewhere Between,Just finished EP 1 and i really like it!
Somewhere Between,"I think she's already a junior associate at a law firm and it doesn't appear to be a particularly rare power considering how lowly they treat her. She probably has a law degree *and* uses her power at work, but no one seems shocked by it. People just use it. Even Jen casually just uses it to talk her dead dad. I don't think anyone's impressed by it so it just be *somewhat* routine. She just happens to do it AND practices law so it's more convenient."
Somewhere Between,I think she was just too timid to properly get her money's worth.
Somewhere Between,100% yes - she could channel people who aren’t terrible and easily make tons of money. Great show though.
Somewhere Between,"Yeah this line and her delivery is amazing.

> You can't imply a customer is pegging their husband as Margaret Thatcher!"
Somewhere Between,She speaks just like a 50 year old woman I was genuinely impressed
Somewhere Between,I like the girl who plays Carrie.  Especially when she's possessed by dead people.  The voiceovers help the immersion but her mannerisms bring the character to life.
Somewhere Between,"I think it's >!changing animals into people by showing her tits !<

But really that would be interesting."
Somewhere Between,"I was looking around Reddit for somewhere to ask others about this, this was my theory and you beat me to it lol. It seems very likely that it's her power, and would kind of make sense as a sort of surprise twist. Now I'm just waiting for season 2, whenever that might be."
Somewhere Between,I had the exact same reaction at the final episode to you. Pretty sure you are right
Somewhere Between,"100% agree on the power. It also ties into her sister's violin issue, I think Jen will help her get over it."
Somewhere Between,If that were true then >!it would nullify Carrie’s ability to channel people around Jen. Instead we see long scenes where Jen communicates with her dad through Carrie.!<
Somewhere Between,Bit late to the game because I just finished but I totally think this is her power! And she doesn’t know it!
Somewhere Between,This was my guess from the beginning of the show because it's the twist at the end of the first Xanth novel which has a very similar setup.
Somewhere Between,"Yeah, even >!Kash, Carrie slacker's boyfriend that quite a jackass on her, but at the same time, there's something about him that I want to see him getting redemption in later season!<"
Somewhere Between,I use subtitles with every single thing I watch cos I find this happens more oftrn than not these days…..
Somewhere Between,"I noticed this too, makes it impossible to watch on my phone. I have a Sonos soundbar for my TV. There's a feature called Night Sound that reduces loud sounds and boosts the volume of dialogue. It works great!"
Somewhere Between,"That was the first thing I noticed, the audio was HORRIBLY mastered. Atleast with movies they can excuse it as they are mastered for theatre audio setups which usually leaves the dialog quiet at home, but this is a streaming services tv show, no reason for it to be mastered this badly. Glad I’m not alone in realizing that lol."
Somewhere Between,I've noticed this with a lot of tv shows and movies these days. It's really irritating
Somewhere Between,"It actually was renewed two days before it premiered, so more to come!"
Somewhere Between,"I think you’re onto something- just thought of her sister’s power, too!"
Somewhere Between,"I’m on episode two, and I kinda love the dentists power."
Somewhere Between,I was so excited to see her. I can't wait for the second season.
Somewhere Between,I’ve been recommending it as ‘horny Encanto’
Somewhere Between,"The music producer mentioned that her channeling voice was unusually clear, so I think yes, other people definitely have her power, but she is much more talented than most mediums."
Somewhere Between,"Yeah, me too! I was very taken aback and surprised to find myself in tears."
Somewhere Between,"> Really hope we get a second season.

[The show has been renewed foe 2nd season](https://deadline.com/2023/01/disney-plus-extraordinary-second-season-killing-eve-sid-gentle-1235240242/)"
Somewhere Between,Check out Fleabag if you haven't yet
Somewhere Between,I wasn’t ready for that gut punch
Somewhere Between,I just finished ghosts (uk) and have been wanting more British comedies. I’ll check this out
Somewhere Between,"I do not recall said gut punch, unless you're referring to a key character appearing...I don't know how to do spoiler tags so I'll leave it at that"
Somewhere Between,"> I hope we will see Come Boy again.

He's the underrated MVP of the show."
Somewhere Between,That scene was so much fun though. I love seeing the random powers appear throughout episodes.
Somewhere Between,"I was thinking the oppose tbh, she seems to get to work one on one mostly as a dentist. If she had a job around a lot of people I think it would be unbearable"
Somewhere Between,"All 8 episodes last night, loved it. At the end I was disappointed we'll have to wait a year for the next season, I was that interested!"
Somewhere Between,"To be honest, it is less vigilante stuffs but more figuring out your 20's but with superpower, which is really exciting."
Somewhere Between,I just watched the pilot and it was fun
Somewhere Between,I’m on the 4th episode and think it’s great
Somewhere Between,"Me too, absolutely loved it. So good natured while still feeling the character's issues had a bit of heft. Laugh out loud multiple times in each episode, which is rare these days. This will definitely be one I revisit."
Somewhere Between,Thank you! I’ve been looking for one!
Somewhere Between,She’s supposed to be a bit insufferable though. The show is supposed to highlight her growth. That was my take at least.
Somewhere Between,Lost of soundtracks for the show  https://www.nme.com/news/tv/heres-every-song-on-the-extraordinary-soundtrack-3388381
Somewhere Between,"Tried Shazam, tried google.... no luck."
Somewhere Between,"No idea, but you could just type the lyrics into Google and see what turns up."
Kiss Me First,Maybe picky comment but I think the show was done by Channel 4 (uk) and only distributed by Netflix elsewhere.
Kiss Me First,"Also interesting is that after looking up the source materiel, the two have like nothing in common. They made up the entire gaming angle up from scratch, and just kinda referenced the origional plot in a few sections.

Apparently, the book is just about euthenasia and online vs. real personas and the ethics of that, whilst the show is like... well not that. Also Tess is like a middle aged women in the book that you never see, rather than a hot damsel in distress narrative device."
Kiss Me First,"It was done by a third party production company. Channel 4 has UK and Ireland rights and Netflix has rights everywhere else, but it's another company that actually makes it anyway."
Kiss Me First,"It's a co-production between Channel 4 and Netflix.
> Kiss Me First, a co-production with Channel 4 in the U.K., may be the Black Mirror-iest of Netflix's Black Mirror-adjacent programs [...]

Kiss Me First,[deleted]
Kiss Me First,"Yeah, I couldn't even bring myself to watch the last episode - I thought there was gonna be some kind of big reveal that explained everything, but honestly, why the main character is even risking their lives for Tess when it was kinda shown earlier that she liked the idea of her more than the actual person is kinda silly."
Kiss Me First,[deleted]
Kiss Me First,This would have been really great if they aren't going the emo/thriller route 
Kiss Me First,Trailer looks awesome...it’s like a mash up of tron + ready player one !! 
Kiss Me First,Awesome. Another Netflix show....yay
Kiss Me First,"I found the main characters so annoying that I started sympathising with the antagonist. The concept is cool, but there is an issue with pacing especially between episodes. And there are also annoying leaps in logic within the plot."
Kiss Me First,Good concept ... meh execution.
Kiss Me First,Probably not gonna see a lot of discussion about it because so far it's only been shown in the UK. It won't get released in the US until the 29th.
Kiss Me First,"Yeah, that would explain it. Doh. Oh well, I'll wait then :-). Y'all should watch it, it's really interesting."
Kiss Me First,"Oh yeah, I plan on it. It's already on my netflix watch list."
Kiss Me First,"The writing is as bad as it ever got on the worst episodes of Skins and the characters are terrible. There is little to no motivation to any of their actions, the plot is dragged on by important conversations being randomly interrupted, there is enough angst there to fuel the entire CW lineup for years, everyone is an idiot most of the time, unless the plot demands otherwise (and it almost never does). 

But hey, the lead character becomes a cool hacker out of nowhere, despite having no prior coding experience or any skills whatsoever (she is mopping floors and waiting tables for a living).

If that's not enough to make you cringe, someone commits suicide early in the season by stepping off the roof of like a 20-floors high apartment block. His slightly bruised body is shown shortly afterwards (no damage to the face ofc). 

There is a character who comes all the way to the UK from the US to assassinate someone who the show's antagonist had invited to hang out with them in a secluded area inside of a computer game where they don't really do anything noteworthy, but somehow the place is special and she is ruining it. 

There is little explanation to what those people actually find in the game (or inside the secluded area within). They are never particularly happy either inside or outside of it. Inside the game they are being manipulated and mostly just sit around and discuss boring shit until they start logging off. It feels as if 13 Reasons Why had been a VR experience.

Concepts of time, choice and money are completely foreign to the series. Characters travel all over the world because the guy in that computer game they like for some unknown reason had told them so. There are only so many plot holes you can fill with sex, drugs and loud music."
Kiss Me First,Simple answer: no. 
Kiss Me First,I have watched the first episode... and it's not for me. Too much cheap-ish pseudo-videogame CGI. If they cut down on that in further epsides it might become better... but I'm not going to find out myself. 
Kiss Me First,I'm episodes in and it's pretty dull overall. The drama is building slowly.
Kiss Me First,This seems highly irresponsible but okay
Kiss Me First,NOT a flex.
Kiss Me First,"It's funny because Jenna is trying to tell this story to make the production seem awesome or her acting dedication and talent to be top notch, but instead it's coming across as a pretty massive failure by all those involved."
Kiss Me First,">“They were giving me medicine between takes because we were waiting on the positive result.”

>MGM, the production company behind “Wednesday,” stressed to NME that “strict COVID protocols were followed and once the positive test was confirmed the production removed Jenna from set.”

""Strict"" as in strictly the bare minimum I guess. Totally irresponsible."
Kiss Me First,"They clearly knew Jenna Ortega very likely had COVID and were trying to cram in as much filming as they could get away with before her results came back positive and they would have to shut down filming temporarily.

They exposed all of the actors and crew on set, all of their families, and anyone else in the community they came into contact with. And it's one of the worst scenes to film someone who likely has covid as she is surrounded by a crowd of extras, dancing, exerting herself, probably breathing heavier than normal."
Kiss Me First,"Cool scene and all, but because of the song, all I can ever think of when I see it is SpongeBob taking Pearl to the prom and everyone doing “The Sponge”"
Kiss Me First,"You can tell, she looked pretty pale"
Kiss Me First,So they risked the rest of the staff and their families instead of just letting her have sick days?
Kiss Me First,"Having been the covid compliance officer on major film sets, this was 100% against the rules."
Kiss Me First,Aaaahhh so we're back to forcing people to work while sick. Lmao. NatUre is HeAlinG
Kiss Me First,"I try to not to completely hold people accountable when I don't know the full story. But even if Jenna was stressing that she didn't wanna delay shooting, somebody should have still made that call for everyone else in that shot.

Terribly irresponsible."
Kiss Me First,Companies will do anything but provide sick days.
Kiss Me First,"There seems to be a constant escalating string of stories with this narrative about this dance scene and how amazing Jenna Ortega is.

""Did you hear she choreographed it herself?""

""Did you hear she learned it in two days?""

""Did you hear she didn't need tips from Christina Ricci?""

""Did you hear she was super I'll with COVID?""

""Did you hear she flew to Ukraine to fight the Russians between takes?"""
Kiss Me First,"Friend worked an indie in Mississippi last year where a producer knowingly held production meetings after testing positive. 30+ people got Covid, the main talent was hospitalized, and the whole production was shut down for a while.

Personally, I'd have sued that piece of shit for every penny he had, but everyone was young and hungry (hence working an indie in a shitty location) so it slid by.

Meanwhile, the show I was working in LA was the gold standard of safety, making all crew test and wait 1 hr for results before coming to stage. Every single day. They spent a fortune on testing but we shot an entire season with almost no issues."
Kiss Me First,Enough about this fucking dance scene already
Kiss Me First,They couldn't wait like 5 days?...
Kiss Me First,"As someone who has signed dozens of death certificates for patients of mine who have died with this disease…





What. The. Fuck."
Kiss Me First,Tom Cruise about to lose it on her
Kiss Me First,"> MGM, the production company behind “Wednesday,” stressed to NME that “strict COVID protocols were followed and once the positive test was confirmed the production removed Jenna from set.”

Yeah screw that production team. Your lead clearly had covid (she mentioned scratchy throat and body aches) and you exposed all the other actors and crew rather than postponing shooting a few hours to wait for the results. If anyone on that set got covid they should sue"
Kiss Me First,"the amount of posts i've seen about this dance scene, i was expecting some huge dance number with insane choreographing and stunts or whatever else craziness

i was pretty surprised it was just a girl dancing a little bit. and people saying it's the best part of the show lol"
Kiss Me First,This is fucked and completely on par with the experience of so many crew members.
Kiss Me First,That is not fucking cool and the actor's union needs to step the fuck up.
Kiss Me First,"In case anyone was wondering, this is a good representation of the COVID protocols on movie sets. If she were a crew member she would have been shooed away immediately, but since she’s most likely #1 on that show they fudge the rules so they can film a little. Seen it happen a few times now."
Kiss Me First,"“MGM, the production company behind “Wednesday,” stressed to NME that “strict COVID protocols were followed and once the positive test was confirmed the production removed Jenna from set.””

While she CLEARLY had Covid. Guess everybody else on set can just piss off, there’s no way to be responsible with a highly symptomatic individual BEFORE the test results come back!!!!! Right???

Edit: Also, even if the test was negative, if she’s clearly sick with SOMETHING shooting should be shut down until she’s better. I hate that the old idea that it’s okay to go out and expose people to sickness as long as it’s not Covid might be creeping back."
Kiss Me First,I can’t remember seeing so many stories about a single scene in a long time. Clever marketing by Netflix!
Kiss Me First,"Jenna Ortega filmed the already famous Wednesday Dance Scene in sub-zero temperatures, in the midst of a 2 month long fast while battling a potent mix of the flu and shit from both ends food poisoning. In the midst of these arduous conditions, and on set, as the rhythm boomed and her body moved, Jenna found herself entering a state of meditative bliss, tapping into the primal energies of our realm. Her very being ascended into planes of understanding glimpsed only by the Buddha himself, the dance scene of Wednesday Addams akin to a modern Bodhi Tree of Siddhartha, a vessel for powerful soul energies and the ultimate source of enlightenment, Jenna Ortega herself reaching this ultimate enlightenment as her earthly body sways to the sounds of the Goo Goo Muck, her movements and gaze physical attributes of a higher being, and as the dance ends, and running a high fever, struggling not to shit herself and desperate for sustenance, Jenna Ortega’s Wednesday Addams dance becomes a rallying point for humanity’s spiritual actualisation.

Wednesday Addams is renewed for season 2."
Kiss Me First,"Well that’s fucking disgusting of them. She should’ve been resting and not exposing other people. Fuck you, Netflix."
Kiss Me First,"This isn’t the flex she thinks it is, also I’m so over this dance scene already"
Kiss Me First,"I'm getting tired of hearing about Jenna Ortega in Wednesday. My family watched it and we loved it, but god damn give it a rest already. I've especially heard about the ""dance scene"" like it's the fucking Red Wedding."
Kiss Me First,Total bs.
Kiss Me First,She’s so brave I could shit my pants
Kiss Me First,Goo Goo Muck was a perfect choice of song.
Kiss Me First,"Even beyond how reckless and irresponsible this was to do… why the fuck would you tell people this??? Like, how would the producers not make you keep a lid on that but of info

 COVID protocol on film and TV sets have been a rigorous, as annoying as it can be, process. But it’s always been clear it has been established to protect actors and above-the-line crew (producers mostly), with little to no regard for crew. In fact, it’s mostly been my experience that it’s treated as “crew members can get actors sick, but not the other way around” situation. 

It was stupid to do this, and just as stupid to tell the press about it."
Kiss Me First,Well… that is a gross and scary thing to happen. Especially when the final product was Netflix’s Wednesday.
Kiss Me First,"This is an awful, horrible thing to do to everyone in the room. Wtf, is this supposed to be a puff piece bc all it does is make it seem like an unsafe work environment"
Kiss Me First,What a bunch of morons.
Kiss Me First,Weird flex.
Kiss Me First,Tired of seeing articles about this scene. Like wtf
Kiss Me First,"I’m sick of tabloids (paid by Netflix probably) trying to convince me this ”dance” was somehow a must see event.

I like the show well enough so far (although it’s turning a bit too CW- Young-Adult-love-triangle kind of show for me, and some of the casting is… terrible) but it is pretty obvious they are trying way too hard to convince people to watch it."
Kiss Me First,"Jenna Ortega Filmed ‘Wednesday’ Dance Scene while high on a cocktail of drugs.

There's the headline you were trying to say but didn't."
Kiss Me First,We never really know if it is really being watched that much or if they market it enough eventually it’ll be true….
Kiss Me First,"Everyone here acting like dropping your masks at a restaurant table as soon as you sit down (during mask up phase) wasn’t some massive pretend game of:

“Oh the virus exists until we have to eat in close proximity and breathing in each others faces”

Edit: I delivered food for a year in a huge city similar in size to Chicago, and I saw with my eyes how there were these points of double standard that we all pretended didn’t exist.

Yeah the film crew and producers should have followed stricter guidelines and not put anyone at risk.

I’m mostly complaining at the commenters pretending like they didn’t go to a sit down restaurant during the height of the mask phase."
Kiss Me First,"That's not a badge of honor!!!

If you're sick stay home!"
Kiss Me First,And I hate how people praised this like: “ She choreographed this dance herself and executed so beautiful even though she had covid. Queen 😍”. Like props for choreographing the dance I guess but no one should be praised for risky behavior.
Kiss Me First,Just another reason to not watch this.
Kiss Me First,"Weird, as based on the Return To Work agreement the various unions and guilds, including SAG, signed, she shouldn’t have been on set after testing positive."
Kiss Me First,"Why do all modern movies, commercials and music videos have dancing shoehorned into them?"
Kiss Me First,Then some grip got COVID and wasn’t allowed to come in to work for a couple weeks. And maybe an extra or two died
Kiss Me First,"Why do they keep mentioning this? If you're gonna put lives at risk to avoid a delay in shooting, I would think you'd wanna be a bit more hush hush about it. 

The dance scene was excellent but this story is gross. And someday down the line, I expect Jenna Ortega will realize that the people in charge did not do right by her, caring more about the work than her well-being"
Kiss Me First,"I’d be fuckin pissed if I was someone on staff working behind the scenes, probably too many hours. Just so I can get sick for this one week relevant show."
Kiss Me First,"This brilliant actress was fucking pissssssed that they did this and knows this is a hit and she's irreplaceable and just exposed them.

People will get fired."
Kiss Me First,"I am so over hearing about this dance scene. 

She dances incredibly awkwardly and the scene is cringy beyond belief."
Kiss Me First,"Lol! Pretty sure you're supposed to isolate after taking a test, in case it comes up positive. Nice work, Hollywood. My employers would be put out of business if they did this to their employees."
Kiss Me First,"This is definitely the studios fault not hers. I work in nursing and had to cause a scene because they said “Oh well you’re not coughing so you can work.” I get that people think she should’ve said no anyway, but she’s so new in the scene + being a female that the pressure was too hard to not give in. Plus, there’s hundreds if not thousands of dollars on the line and countless of other peoples jobs that would get affected. She didn’t make the right choice, but I can see why she would make that choice. My coworkers came in positive. Only reason I got away with it was because I’m a dude and told my supervisor “Ok I’ll come in but when my coworkers and the patients I take care of start getting sick this will be YOUR fault, not mine and I’ll be telling everyone I come in contact with that I’m positive and was forced to work.” 3 minutes later her boss said “Yeah stay home.”"
Kiss Me First,"The more I hear about this, the more I'm not ok with it, and I hope every union involved rains hell upon the decision makers for this. Jenna Ortega should never have been on set that day. If that means they have to shut down until she got negative, then that's what they should have done. By having her work that day, they fucked with the health of everyone who was on the set that day. I suspect the only reason that we're not hearing about a mass outbreak on the set is that she and everyone else was vaccinated as that does make you less likely to be contagious. At the end of the day, this is a safety issue, and the producers do not value the safety of their cast and crew."
Kiss Me First,Is this supposed to make me respect the dedication or something?  Because that just seems negligent of crew safety.
Kiss Me First,"All I ever see is Jenna Ortega these days. Out with the old, in with the new I guess. Somewhere, Millie Bobby Brown is fuming."
Kiss Me First,"Didn't take long for everyone to get back into the ""continue to work even while you are sick"" bs shenanigans again. Disgrace."
Kiss Me First,wow that’s amazingly irresponsible and the production company should be sued for putting the crew in danger
Kiss Me First,Disgusting and everybody involved with that decision should be embarrassed.
Kiss Me First,Lowkey getting annoyed at seeing this show everywhere on social media.
Kiss Me First,"This actress is hacking my social media, all I read is a Jenna Ortega story on every platform"
Kiss Me First,But …is it as good as andor?
Kiss Me First,So what?
Kiss Me First,"Netflix must have paid a LOT of PR firms to push this show.

I don’t hear about it anywhere except on Reddit and affiliated media with Netflix"
Kiss Me First,">MGM, the production company behind “Wednesday,”

Weren't MGM the studio behind The Wizard of Oz where they forced an underage Judy Garland to take cocaine and smoke? Somethings never change I guess."
Kiss Me First,"So long as all the well paid industry jackoffs got sufficiently overcompensated for recycling an idea for the 50 millionth time, all is well."
Kiss Me First,"Wow so brave. Seriously, who cares?"
Kiss Me First,"This is a pretty grievous violation of the Hollywood Return To Work Agreement’s COVID rules, and I have a sneaking suspicion we’ll be hearing about a seven or eight figure lawsuit from the unions over this."
Kiss Me First,The press the studio hoped for lol
Kiss Me First,Why would she tell people this? This is a bad look.
Kiss Me First,Why would she admit this
Kiss Me First,"Another ""look how hard actors work"" article."
Kiss Me First,Oh my God who the hell cares??
Kiss Me First,Why is everyone so obsessed with her jfc
Kiss Me First,What a hero
Kiss Me First,"""*The show must go on*"" is being taken too seriously here."
Kiss Me First,Wait what…that’s not good
Kiss Me First,"This time last year this news would have caused a series of lawsuits. She had all the symptoms of covid but they still allowed her access to the set, allowed people to be in close contact and provide her with medicine between takes, bet $50 it was PAs they sent near her. Then a positive test comes back just in time as they already filmed the scene and now all the cast and crew have been exposed to covid. This just goes to show that the actors can do whatever and the crew has to conform to the protocols. I’m actually shocked she even revealed this information at all."
Kiss Me First,"I thought Wednesday's personality was cringe AF at first but it grew on me. Tbh she kind of seems aspergers in a way. Her disregard for social norms is something people with aspergers do a lot of (either intentionally or they're unaware.) If I were to try diagnose her with something it wouldn't be anti-social personality disorder despite the edgy stuff she says because she does have relationships.

A lot of the stuff she says is consistent with how a schizoid would --be-- but it's not consistent with how she --is-- deep-down. E.g. she pretends like she doesn't care about anyone else when she's still effected by her fight with her room mate. I think she probably does have schizoid tendencies that lower her need for other people. But it's still not completely absent. By the way: schizoid personality disorder is very rare and vanishingly rare in females. I think this is possibly one reason Wednesday is so compelling. It's fictional: but there are people out there with similar personality traits."
Kiss Me First,"How far the film industry has come since the beginning sheesh. But it was always a 2 class system with COVID on set. Cast never had to wear masks, crew always did. Now seeing this, holy shit, any general crew member at this point would get 10 days of no pay. And they filmed with her, with no mask, endangering hundreds of crew members."
The Forest,I don't know but would like to know
The Forest,same... D;
The Forest,"Great episode, glad to see them getting away from the formulaic break they took.  Actual consequences to actions are possible again.  I liked it, and I like that I don't know what is going to happen in the second half of the season with the storyline or the characters."
The Forest,Decent fight for a TV show.  I didn't like the editing towards the end.  This sort of fighting should be shown further back so we can see whats happening. 
The Forest,"This gonna be so gooooooood.

"
The Forest,This looks utterly cheesy. I can't wait

The Forest,"I’m gonna try to link it here but Tony Gilroy addressed what you’re talking about and why he chose to make the episodes slower even when Disney pushed back and wanted him to make the 1st episodes more “exciting”.

[Tony Gilroy Interview](https://i.redd.it/tony-gilroy-addresses-the-people-that-call-andor-slow-and-v0-mevhg1hfbf2a1.jpg?auto=webp&s=6ed5bb6c9896cef10c9f2a4e105a76cb7debefb1)

Its absolutely the right move here especially cause we know the fate of this character and we need to be invested in the character and not the plot.  We know the plot.   

We’ve been so conditioned with shows recently both SW and Marvel and really everything else that we should want plot first Big Bang right out of the first episode then character later.  To flip that and put character first is so refreshening.  It could only happen in SW shows like this because of its built in audience.  If most shows these days started like Andor started people would tune out and not push through and that would be the end of the show."
The Forest,"I am not calling it the most fun Star Wars can be, but it is the most moving, most thought provoking, most layered, well acted Star Wars has ever been. I have thought and watched more on it than any show this year. It did not engage you. It happens."
The Forest,"I finished last night and I loved it.  Cass's journey was epic over one season.  The fact that the whole prison storyline even took place within a season is amazing to me.  This is one of my favorite shows of the last five years solely for the fact that it exposed so much more every day life within the star wars universe.  Seeing coruscant, ferrix, and aldhani culture was amazing and add in the fact it was attached to what I consider a damn good story is the icing on the cake."
The Forest,"The fact you think rise of Skywalker is better than last jedi kinda says all you need to know

EDIT: Rian Johnson didn't kill your childhood and he made a pretty solid movie with the only shred of originality that the Disney movies have pumped out"
The Forest,I’m sorry you had this experience. It’s OK to have different reactions to art.
The Forest,"It is hard for me to imagine being so into Star Wars and not liking Andor… it is so much more multidimensional and thought provoking than it’s predecessors. To me it is Star Wars for adults. While past Star Wars toys with the notion that things aren’t always so black and white - Andor approaches the topic head on. 

For a prequel show where the MC and several others have plot armor, they insert constant tension. Luthen is already a top 10 Star Wars character to me and he could climb even higher. I’m already hoping for a triple prequel Luthen backstory series."
The Forest,"It's okay that you didn't like it. It's absolutely a masterpiece compared to everything else Disney has offered for the Star Wars franchise, but that doesn't mean everyone has to enjoy it. I worked with a guy years ago whose favorite movie was Michael Bay's Transformers. He didn't care that it was objectively dumb because it was fun. Maybe you just prefer a fun viewing experience to a well-crafted and layered story. No shame in that. 

Although i will say when I hear people complain that it's boring, I wonder if they were even paying attention. Without giving away context for spoilers, you have a double homicide, a failed capture by authorities, a 'bank' heist, thieves double crossing each other, a prison break, and a clash between authorities and an oppressed group. I guess it needed a lightsaber fight to have some action?"
The Forest,This isn’t a Star Wars show. It’s a great show that happens to be set in the Star Wars Universe.
The Forest,"If you’re someone who thinks The Last Jedi is the ***only*** other bad Star Wars media, I don’t think Andor is the problem here lol"
The Forest,"Nothing happened to Mon Mothma?  She committed her daughter to the same horrible life that she has?  For Mothma everything happened!  We learn about her as a character and not just as someone who showed up one time in New Hope.

Also my best part of reading your post was that you found the show boring with the exception of the prison break, Mothma and the finale.  So you basically disliked half the show only?  I guess you kind of missed the point of jab jab uppercut that the writer was going for.

Look man if it's not your speed that's ok.  There's plenty of low hanging fruit in the star wars lore to enjoy.  Slow chase scenes through forests, cartoonist escapes from imperial facilities, characters that are never given any sort of motivation for their actions.  So enjoy what you will, but Andor is quite possibly the greatest star wars has been in quite a long time.  Clone wars is 7 seasons just to build to the incredible ending of the Siege of Mandalore."
The Forest,"I stopped reading after they claimed the last Jedi was the *only* other SW project the disliked and said it was the worst film.  Sure I wasn’t crazy about everything they did in that movie but it’s definitely *not* worse than the utter garbage that was Rise of Skywalker and Attack of the Clones.  On the tv show side Book of Boba Fett was an absolute dumpster fire and made me actually *dislike* a character I’ve loved since I was 5 years old.

What I’m getting at is, while everyone is entitled to their own opinion, OP has terrible taste."
The Forest,Is Reddit’s homepage sorting by controversial now or something? Feels like hot take r/television posts keep popping up at the top for me.
The Forest,Bro wanted marvel cameos
The Forest, The stuff OP complains about is why we got stupid chase scenes in Obi-Wan and Boba fett that didn’t lead anywhere or develop the plot….
The Forest,If you didn’t like it after ep 3 then why continue lol
The Forest,Lost me at its boring.  Sorry.
The Forest,"Lots of people like crazy action sequences with no depth type shows. Some of the most popular TV is reality TV, some of the highest grossing movies are about people driving fast cars with dumb stunts. There's nothing wrong with enjoying action packed stuff. 

Andor is not that. It's a show that shows the delicate balance when being a spy. It shows the horrors of fascism and how it warps those who think they are the heroes into committing horrible acts. It's a spy show with quiet deceit, careful planning, and flawed execution. About why people rebel, and why those who ferment rebellion are grey and can sometimes be the villain. How even those who commit atrocities can love and are at their hearts human.

If you can't appreciate that, I honestly feel a little bad, because it's very beautiful. Star Wars the originals always had a tight rope to walk, because it's action packed, but there are deeper stories to be told. Sons trying to heal father's wounds, fear leading you to bring about your doom. 

Honestly though, if you watched the prequels and sequels and thought ""these are good moves"" I can't take anything you say seriously. The prequels are dumpster fires of movie making. The dialogue is horrendous, and the acting worse. There's so much useless fluff (which appeals to children, the way cocomelon is dumb garbage, but kids love it). The sequels have no plot that makes any sense, and TRoS is the worst of them because it rewrites the entire point of the original trilogy. 

So to cap off my long thing, that's fine you didn't like it, but I would try to broaden your horizons a bit. There's lots of deep slow pacing things that don't hit your dopamine receptors, but are worth it to savor."
The Forest," I’m a lifelong SW fan, and at 47, it means I’ve consumed all the movies in theaters in real time. Learning to adapt to the new world order with so much new and mostly good content takes so much time. As a result, I’ve “picked and choosed” my way through all these limited series. 

With that as a brief context, I loved everything about Andor. The pacing, the cinematic quality. It felt so right to me. I binged watched over a vacation, staying up until 2 am and 3 am on consecutive nights. 

I totally understand how people would assess this as slow. Many of my good friends with common tastes to mine lost interest before finishing it. For me, Andor is the Godfather 1 of the SW universe. Just perfect."
The Forest,Here for my obligatory downvote… OP missed the mark on this one
The Forest,"It’s human drama in the Star Wars Universe.  It’s not trench runs or lightsabers or pod races.  I LOVE those things.  But I also enjoy HBO dramas about real people dealing with real problems.  I like understanding the actual human motivation to rebel against a totalitarian state.  You kinda have to let go of Star Wars to appreciate the show, but then realize how much the show actually enhances the Star Wars franchise that we love.  It’s a big universe with lots of stories."
The Forest,[removed]
The Forest,"It’s certainly much less an action centered show than other Star Wars shows tend to be, I’ll give you that. If you’re just not into drama and characters, I can see how you would be bored. To me it has a more GoT pace and style, multiple interconnected characters and sub-plots. If you understand why that style wildly popular, maybe you can see why other people would find Andor a good show, even if it didn’t resonate with you."
The Forest,"Your they type to enjoy *Goodfellas*, but wouldn’t be able to sit through *The Godfather*. I don’t say this to in a bad way. All I’m saying is there’s a certain type of show that you enjoy, but *Andor* ain’t it."
The Forest,"Understandable that it wasn’t your cup of tea - it seems like you prefer driving action tempo, and Andor was not that.  As an older person, there were A LOT of the more mundane elements that resonated deeply with me, and those may not have resonated with a younger person who hasn’t experienced the cruel judgement of a loving parent, the the mundanity of bureaucracy stifling a burning passion, the oppression of a self serving and corrupt boss, and so many other elements.  All good."
The Forest,Lmao of course someone who hates TLJ dislikes the best Star Wars media since TLJ came out.
The Forest,"It's ok if you don't like good shows, to each their own"
The Forest,"They set the show up to be similar to how TCW did things, with 3 episode arcs. That’s why it was very up and down. It was definitely slow but had some of the best character development in the universe in my opinion. Episodes 4-6 in Aldhani were excellent because it was really showing Andor start to get with the Rebellion. 

They pretty much had to set up a whole new universe because Star Wars fans expect to see Bounty Hunters, Lightsabers, and the Force in everything. I love how they are expanding to non-force storylines. 

Also the best part of Andor was definitely the prison break. But I think that is great for more than just Serkis and his amazing acting. You can see that he was scared to escape because I think he knew all along he was not gonna be able to escape. And that sacrifice builds the entire character arc of Andor willing to sacrifice himself in Rogue One. 

This was far and away the best material SW has released in a while. Happy new year!"
The Forest,"I mean some people like Ewoks and Jar Jar. To each their own. I vehemently disagree with OP, but it's fine that's his opinion."
The Forest,"Nah, OP. Andor was subtle mature and awesome. I get it that you like space wizards more but Andor is for people looking for a deeper story in StarWars."
The Forest,"I think the main issue is how you ended up watching the show.  If you already knew what was going to happen in episodes 1-5, I can see it being a slog to get through.  But on the first watch, if you’re not over-tired, the show was gripping.  No surprise that the better episodes for you were when you were watching it for the first time.  First show in a LONG time that I looked forward to watching every week."
The Forest,"I can understand why some would find it slow and boring, and at times it was definitely slow, but I think that is because we came from a lens of previous Star Wars content. Star Wars doesn't need to be fast and exciting in every piece of content, but since most of the content is fast and exciting we expect all Star Wars content to be as such and we find it weird when it is not. 

Personally, I enjoyed the change of pace and mindset."
The Forest,"There’s always going to be a better or worse character developed line. I’m just happy as a pig in mud that they are making multiple derivative character shows that I am entirely ok with it not being “The Best”. You’ve got the single episode excitement with Mando, you’ve got some character background on Kenobi, I liked Fett, think it needed some more work - but really - we have more episodes and movies, and that’s awesome. Go at it open minded, and you won’t be let down."
The Forest,Idk if this will be buried but was anyone intrigued by the manifesto ? I would love to read it fully or a version of it
The Forest,Slower is better for me. I like to live in a world and see how it functions. What comes to mind is The Assassination of Jesse James. It’s a Western that lets you feel what it’s like to live in the world.
The Forest,"Thanks for giving it a watch, at least.  I guess I'm more of a worldbuilding and character-driven fan.  I don't need or want SW to be all about action sequences.  Although when they happened (much more rarely than with other SW series) it made me enjoy them all the more."
The Forest,"I watched the entire season in one day. I was hooked. I might watch it again. I think your too used to action movies and shows. We all have our tastes, personally I'm not a huge action fan. I like shows like andor. Where you can discuss the characters, their motivations, and where they come from. Every character is well done. There isn't a single character that didn't do a good job. Which is surprising. Also, you may notike it. But, star wars needed a show like this. It finally introduced new characters instead of using cameos. Star wars ip was/is on life support. Merchandise sales are down, and Disney has ruined the ip. Andor is bringing it back slowly. It won't have everything people want. But that's fine. We shouldn't try and have shows that cater to every demographic. That's why we got awful movies and shows that are too spread out. Obi wan was a travesty. And mandalorian was a good show in what it offered. But it didn't introduce too many characters. We'll see more shows with good action. I hope they make some shows in the high republix. That will be good sith vs Jedi."
The Forest,"You're inability to enjoy Andor for what it is and your dislike of The Last Jedi are linked here, I think."
The Forest,Star Wars is only relevant because of fan service. Andor was refreshing to me because it did its job not relying on fan service too much.
The Forest,Can I get your opinion on Kenobi?
The Forest,"I think it’s important to understand that this show was not meant to follow the blueprint of how the movies were written and filmed. This show effectively expressed the sacrifices that humans make during times of suppression and violence from cynical and authoritarian governments like the republic. I feel like it was beautifully presented, but if you didn’t feel the same then to each their own. I like hearing how each person does or does not like a specific TV show or movie because that’s the beauty of free speech. Hope you find a show you like!"
The Forest,"That's unfortunate. This is probably the most negative review I've seen given to Andor. The pacing was something I personally enjoyed very much. I do agree that it wasn't perfect, but for me the maturity of the series is way beyond the movies and also any if the series, which I personally like non of, besides mentioned Andor."
The Forest,"I wasn't enjoying Andor until I decided to ignore it's a Star Wars tv show. As soon as I started to consider the show as a political drama that tells its own story independent from the franchise, that's when Andor became an amazing series. Now I can't wait for a second season."
The Forest,Everyone who didn’t like the show is rightwing politically. Only half joking.
The Forest,Slow buildup and increased exposition is my personal favorite characteristic of a TV show or movie. This just wasn’t for you
The Forest,"You have bad taste, man. Sorry."
The Forest,It's the best written Star Wars project. Hands down. I'll die on this hill. Fight me.
The Forest,Best Star Wars series so far. It’s a masterpiece. It’s been a literal war in the stars.
The Forest,"Possess bad taste you do

Grow up you must"
The Forest,"It’s possible you were disappointed that there were no light sabers (clone wars, obi wan, etc), no using the force (prequels, sequels) or baby yodas.   I’m not being sarcastic.  I think some fans find extracting creativity from the original source to be fun and nostalgic.  Unfortunately for me, I find it very unimaginative and it made the prequels and sequels very painful to watch.  This is why I loved rogue one and Andor bc they truly went beyond the source material.  Andor did even less recycling and completely built intricacies of the Star Wars world we never could appreciate.  What did it feel like working under the empire?  The actual feeling of oppression in your day to day life?  Sure blowing up planets is threatening but it’s distant and abstract.  Also to see the rebellion as a secretive ragtag group of misfits is a completely different angle from all other films, except perhaps the early portrayal of Han Solo in New Hope.    

Andor also has a powerful and sharp script with flawless acting (the acting in Obi Wan was awful).  The storyline is brilliant on a whole different level because they pace it and build their characters."
The Forest,"I totally agree. Relative to other recent Star Wars series, it’s really good. Relative to other really good television, it’s meh."
The Forest,"Well this may be the last opinion of 2022 we didnt ask for, so thank you"
The Forest,Glad you got that off your chest.
The Forest,"You’re entitled to your opinion. It’s wrong, but you’re entitled to it"
The Forest,Disagree. Andor is SW world building at its finest. So much depth in each episode. Love the drama and intrigue and conspiracy. So glad the flashy stuff is toned down/nonexistent in this series.
The Forest,OP is gonna get downvoted for just expressing his opinion. I watched the first 3 episodes and it really did bore me and feel like a chore to get through. Haven’t touched it since. Idk just didnt catch my attention or have me interested enough which is weird bc usually the Star Wars universe alone is enough to get me to watch something.
The Forest,Boooooooooooo
The Forest,I’m still fighting against myself to get through it. I’ve seen five episodes so far and every single one has felt like it’s dragging as badly as the Hobbit movies or Avatar did for me. It’s a slog and I don’t see myself finishing. It’s been so boring. Nothing about it has pulled me in yet.
The Forest,"It is boring, don't worry, you're not alone. Should have just left it at Rogue one, which is arguably the best star wars movie"
The Forest,Completely AGREE with you
The Forest,Congratulations.  I couldn't make it through 2 episodes
The Forest,Go watch Book of Boba Fett and jerk off to soulless Star Wars nostalgia instead
The Forest,My gf and I watched the whole thing twice. It is a masterpiece
The Forest,When all you eat is mcdonald’s I guess a nice steak is boring
The Forest,"HARD AGREE. It was mostly boring and I didn’t care about any of the characters or what happened to them! So confused by everyone saying how great it was! I am not a huge Star Wars fan, but I did watch all of the Star Wars spin-offs that have been coming out lately and enjoyed them. This one was a dud, I’m not sure why."
The Forest,"I agree OP but this sub does not embrace debate or dissenters. You either buy what the mouse is selling or you’re downvoted into oblivion.

Can’t wait for the next ‘DAE think The Last Jedi was the greatest of the sequel trilogy???’ thread."
The Forest,"Haven't made it through episode 2. Thanks for the review,  I won't waste my time because I was feeling the same way about it."
The Forest,Even Stoppard couldn’t save the dialogue in Revenge of the Sith.
The Forest,"Pointing out that the boring show Andor was boring isn’t tolerated here. 

Don’t worry most people outside Reddit agree with you which is why it was the lowest rated Disney+ Star Wars project to date."
The Forest,Me too
The Forest,"You just have bad taste theres nothing wrong with that. Thats why shitty movies exist because there’s someone out there that will watch them.

Mon mothma plot was important and things *did* happen. This is how we see her begin to fund the rebellion and navigate the political side without making noise that would alert the ISB/Empire. We see the relationship she has to keep with her husband to remain inconspicuous, the parties she has to throw in coruscant, the political allies she keeps, and sacrifices she has to make (courting her daughter as part of a deal) to ensure she has the support she needs."
The Forest,"Agreed, shit was slow as hell"
The Forest,"Yes, lifelong SW fan here as well.  The Last Jedi was the worst and Andor was an arduous task to get through"
The Forest,Every thing you said word for word is on the dot with how I feel about this show. Ironically I’m enjoying the Willow series more despite its many issues.
The Forest,It’s wild to me that someone can enjoy any of the Disney Star Wars content outside of Rogue One and then actively dislike Andor. To each their own though
The Forest,"I felt like I was in an abusive relationship with Andor. Every episode, I kept watching in the hopes that SOMETHING happened that was interesting. It was a series of unnecessary slow burn. It did a lot of world building when it didn't need to. You could have accomplished what happened in Andor in 4 episodes. You didn't need 12 episodes of build and build and build. I feel that scene where Luthen Rael gets into an engagement with the empire during a small space battle was thrown in there due to the complaining of lack of ANYTHING of substance happening.  


I usually give a new series an entire season before I pass judgement. This series was boring, and pretentious. I am a die hard Star Wars fan, and I found myself having to stop mid way through episodes to do something else because they were so boring and I was falling asleep. I will not be tuning into season 2, which I'm sure an announcement for such is inevitable. I'm not saying that there has to be constant action, but there are ways to build a political spy drama that pushes the narrative at a nice clip so the viewer doesn't feel disengaged. I felt like I could watch C-SPAN's house floor feed for 24hrs and gleam more entertainment than I would have from watching Andor."
The Forest,"Not going to lie, this post sounds like baiting.

Yeah, I can believe there's a person who doesn't like Andor. The pacing is... some people would call it ""grownup"", but that would imply fast pacing is bad. Andor isn't slow per se, but it's not mindlessly fast either.

However, TS also added ""The only other SW project I disliked was the last jedi"". I'm not even talking about blatantly bad stuff like Kenobi, but pacing-wise, Andor's NOT the biggest offender.

If they're not lying - that might just be a twitter journalist baiting people for ""hateful fans"" material."
The Forest,"I agree with you, It's boring as shit, I watched 3 episodes, forced myself to watch the 4th one and that was it, every character was bland/boring/uninteresting, no one's motive was gripping or suspenseful in any way."
The Forest,">The only other SW project I disliked was the last jedi (which I view as the worst movie in the franchise)

If you liked TRoS, that certainly explains why Andor wasn't for you. Andor is a thoughtful, character-driven drama. TRoS is not.

You can't condense or skip over the heist prep work. Getting to know each individual is important because they all represent the different ways people come to and interact with the rebellion."
The Forest,I have to agree I thought it was extremely boring with so many useless story lines and characters I struggled to finish it. I could’ve cared less about the empire characters and they were in the prison for too long among other things. Also I didn’t really didn’t get the full British cast I mean I don’t mind some but it was an overload with many actors that I never saw before and honestly weren’t that great of actors (the one empire lady was overly serious and not great sorry) This is the first Star Wars show or movie that I really didn’t like (I thought Rouge one and the Last Jedi were great). I’m usually not picky with shows or franchises I love but I probably won’t watch season 2.
The Forest,"If you didn't like it then that's fine.  I enjoyed the pacing and I think it's a decent show, but it's probably overrated."
The Forest,"Andor is definitely suited towards the more hardcore Star Wars fans that were looking for a more mature and multidimensional story, it isn’t for everyone and casual fans like yourself probably won’t fully understand and appreciate its huge and much welcomed departure from the shit that they’ve been releasing over the past several years like the ST, BOBF and kenobi"
The Forest,"I AGREE UGH unrelenting depressing boredom. No joy, no humor for contrast, every episode is just oh look how bad the Empire is. No interesting characters. Even the bot was manipulatively “oh look he stutters and is shy so the audience WILL LOVE HIM.”"
The Forest,totally agree. I was wondering if something was wrong with me. thank you
The Forest,I don't understand how anyone finds this boring
The Forest,"Yes, agreed.  I seriously think it's some sort of social experiment going on because I just can't fathom coming to any other conclusion.  We were all on the edge of our seats wondering, will Syril eat his cereal? Stay tuned for next week..."
The Forest,I finally finished Andor and disagree with OP. It was a good show. Not revolutionary but better than a lot of what Disney has been churning out. I can see how somebody would find it slow - but I thought it was a good pace.
The Forest,"""monkey brain bored, not enough explosions, show bad"""
The Forest,Another example that proves opinions can indeed be wrong
The Forest,"My feelings are 100% in line with OP. I love Star Wars. I will always give every single SW project a shot. I watched every minute of Andor and I just couldn’t engage. Some episodes were good. A few were almost great. Most left me struggling to stay awake. 

I won’t bad mouth it, but I laugh when people say it’s “the best Star Wars project”. Just because it’s different from the other Star Wars shows doesn’t make it “the best”."
The Forest,"Have to agree, I have 2 episodes left and I can't even bring myself to finish them"
The Forest,I liked it as a whole but I can’t help but agree with you. I had to re-watch so many episodes because I would just some out or fall asleep in every other episode.
The Forest,A lot of bad takes there.
The Forest,"What I found funny is that I started this show not caring about these character and at the end of the series I still don't care. It feel like Andor had more character in rogue one than he does in Andor and I guess it would be because of the time period where the empire is controlling people. 
The prison arc was good but I guess this is comparing with the slow pace that it took to get there, and it was over quick. 
My issue was also with the slow pace prequel exposition dump they put in the episodes. 
I think this is one of the ok star war show but I don't see myself rewatching it."
Harvey Street Kids,"I have a hyphen in my name and it is surprising the amount of companies that can't even handle that. I could be in the system with a hyphen, them separating my name at that point with a blank,  adding the two parts together, making the first part of the hyphenated name my first name and the second the last name, and a bunch of other ridiculous things"
Harvey Street Kids,"I’ve always felt very represented by Cookie Monster and Oscar the Grouch. 

It’s nice to see kids feeling represented by new puppets."
Harvey Street Kids,I guess I always thought the point of muppets being weirdly shaped and colored was so that nobody would feel excluded because they're not any ethnicity.
Harvey Street Kids,Love Sesame Street 🥰
Harvey Street Kids,"My wife got a huge kick out of this when she first heard it. As a Korean artist named Jiyoung, it hit really close to home."
Harvey Street Kids,What’s the significance of the hyphen?

In fact, the captions wrote it wrong in a different way every single time. I don't think it's automatic captions because they were accurate for every other word!

Harvey Street Kids,Kids have to learn racism in the first place. People are just people to them before that.
Harvey Street Kids,Bring back the AIDS puppet you cowards.
Harvey Street Kids,"I was one of the first generation to grow up on Sesame Street. Growing up in rural Canada (or white Canada) Sesame Street was the first time I actually saw people of colour, and hispanics. Having a variety of characters, of a variety of ethnic backgrounds helps all kids learn about the world around us."
Harvey Street Kids,This made me smile. I didn’t notice until now that there wasn’t Asian representation in the muppets. Happy to see this change. I hope all who read this have a good day.
Harvey Street Kids,"This is cool, but I thought all the puppets where just monsters.  When did they start making puppets of ethnicities?  Usually kids on the show where actual children."
Harvey Street Kids,"I always remembered Minh from Barney, she was from the Philippines! In my predominantly white neighborhood I had never met an Asian person at the time, as a small child, and Minh was my first exposure to non white or black people."
Harvey Street Kids,"that’s great but can we have more south asian representation? Everyone’s up about “asian representation” when they’re really talking about East asians. White people really think Indians, Pakistanis, Bengalis, etc are part of their own continent."
Harvey Street Kids,Ji-Young is so adorable! Sesame Street being awesome as it always has.
Harvey Street Kids,"This is great, but do people believe the that representation for Sesame Street was too white? I've never identified with a giant yellow bird, a green trashcan monster, a blue googley-eyed cookie addict, a purple vampire, etc. The puppets have always been pretty ambiguous."
Harvey Street Kids,"As a Korean American with a hyphenated name, this is the stupidest shit I’ve ever read."
Harvey Street Kids,">It makes us as the Asian American diaspora feel finally seen and validated.""

Because this lady speaks for all asian Americans . . /s"
Harvey Street Kids,"Why is it the ethnic puppets are all very ethnic, but there ae no “white” puppets? The other people puppets are all purple and green and orange and blue. The most “white person” puppet is Prairie Dawn and I don’t think they use her these days. The whole point was ro have “anybody” puppets. 

I got nothing against Koreans or Korean puppets, but it does seem to go one way. 

Also, ever notice that autistic characters in kids programs have dead eyes?"
Harvey Street Kids,[deleted]
Harvey Street Kids,"Wow People are upset with this in comments and I find it funny…cause they didn’t have a problem with Bert and Earnie being gay with white personas. Go figure they just hating on race

Sesame Street wasn’t made for racist it’s actually a liberal program. Conservatives can blow off watch or create your own hillbilly hate programming for kids"
Harvey Street Kids,"As a Korean, the Cookie Monster was my dude. Guess thats why I like Death Metal now."
Harvey Street Kids,More female puppets! More diversity! Yay!
Harvey Street Kids,The show lost its impact when every puppet had to represent a minority group for some woke cause imo
Harvey Street Kids,"This is what the Asian community needed to feel validated?  A fucking Sesame St puppet with a hyphen in its name?  

I really really wish people could be black for just a day.  Sure would change some perspectives."
Harvey Street Kids,Don't teach your children to rely on external validation.
Harvey Street Kids,Sesame Street does so much good in the world.
Harvey Street Kids,"What are you talking about… We Asians have always been seen and validated, what cave have you been hiding in?"
Harvey Street Kids,"since when do muppets have ethnicities.

they're different colours. not race colours lol"
Harvey Street Kids,"Smarter, stronger, kinder"
Harvey Street Kids,"ok, I gotta say...it never occurred to me before today that Muppets were supposed to have race.  

which are the white ones?"
Harvey Street Kids,Aren’t children on Sesame Street normally played by real kids and the puppets are monster characters?
Harvey Street Kids,Just cast the best puppet for the role. /s
Harvey Street Kids,I’m confused I thought the puppets on Sesame Street were without race
Harvey Street Kids,"Seen and validated? That’s rich. My (real) name has been butchered my whole life, it’s not a matter of being “seen and validated”, it’s more about people being careless and sloppy."

It’s been just a quirk in my life, never really thought about bigger implications like this. Good on ya Sesame Street!"
Harvey Street Kids,"oh for cryin outloud lol. this is becoming so silly… indians are outraged at Apu, Korean’s are overjoyed by this puppet… what are writers supposed to do, write *more* or *less* diverse characters? And more importantly, why are arbitrary characteristics like race and skin color so important to the character? Who cares, and why?"
Harvey Street Kids,It's about time.
Harvey Street Kids,"You feel validated by a puppet. Congrats on your very low bar, round of high fives for everyone"
Harvey Street Kids,Diaspora give me a break

Harvey Street Kids,"I think it's great that Sesame Street is doing this, and I believe representation matters for kids that watch it. At the same time, I'll never understand the victimhood boner some Asian Americans have. [Is the fact that they're completely trouncing every other ethnic group including whites not enough to feel seen and validated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ethnic_groups_in_the_United_States_by_household_income#cite_note-3)?

Really?"
Harvey Street Kids,"42? Damn, good genes girl"
Harvey Street Kids,"Oh, this is so sweet! That's the first time I heard about a Korean kid on Sesame Street. What a fantastic character Ji-Young is. And she so reminds me of my Korean wife; it's incredible. We both were grinning with positivity and joy after watching Ji-Young on Youtube. I even have slightly watery eyes. :-) Sesame Street has such an essential role in educating kids (and their parents) about diversity and how wonderfully different yet similar monsters we all are. :-D

Some places don't support capital letters in my name at all. It's gotten a lot better in the past few years, but it's still the occasional hassle."

Harvey Street Kids,In one of the states I work with directly for entering death certificates you can’t use punctuation. Name O’Malley? Cool you get a space. The names are all in caps as well so you have to decide if you ad a space to indicate the capital or just ignore that there is a capital same would go for a hyphen. It is just lazy coding in my opinion. Punctuation is clearly important for different reasons or everyone’s name would be on capital letter followed be a serious of lower case letters.
Harvey Street Kids,"Company? IRS forms still don’t take hyphens. You just have to leave a blank.

That said, it’s not a big deal LOL. I think there’s a huge difference between immigrants who came into the country and kids born from immigrant parents who insist on hyphenating their kids’ names and who have to “endure” a bunch of “wow your English is really good!” growing up."

Harvey Street Kids,"Yeah, but then you have african american puppets and latina puppets, so…"
Harvey Street Kids,Can you tell me how to get there?
Harvey Street Kids,"Representation is definitely important, especially for programs watched by little kids. It helps them learn that they are not an outsider or unwelcome because of their race and nationality, but instead someone who is also a part of their community. They are in their most formative years and learn who they are based on how they and people like them are treated even on television."
Harvey Street Kids,"I don't think there is a big consensus on using a hyphen, because some people go about concatenating the two characters (Jiyoung), using PascalCase (JiYoung), using a space (Ji Young) or in this case, a hyphen (Ji-Young).

I personally like the hyphen because it helps distinguish the two characters that form the name. Each character in a name has an associated Chinese character (we call this hanja) and each hanja has its own meaning.

For a name like Da-Mi, it's showing that it's 다미 and not 담이 even though technically they're pronounced the same.

Additionally, Korean generations are often (declining over time, though) distinguished with one of the hanja in a given name being used as a generational indicator. More simply put, siblings will generally share a common syllable.

Soo-Min, Soo-Young, Soo-Jin could very well be 3 siblings belonging to the same family, where Soo is the generational hanja, and Min/Young/Jin is the more personal hanja.

So all this to say, the emphasis on making each character distinct is probably the biggest advantage to using the hyphen. However, even with that, I find it more convenient just to omit the hyphen and the hyphen seems to be employed more frequently in formal / official situations."
Harvey Street Kids,i have one in my first name. you wouldn't believe the number of sites that see that as an illegal character when filling forms. its annoying.
Harvey Street Kids,"I don't know anything about Korean names, but maybe it is like removing accents from names? (for Spanish)

It's kind of weird to remove part of your name to fit in, I understand there can be some limitations due to how technical systems operate, but ""hiding"" your heritage eventually makes it weirder or more difficult for others to actually display it."
Harvey Street Kids,"I think it's just that a lot of Asian names have them, and it's something that historically white people have looked at and said, ""That's too complicated, I can't pronounce that."""
Harvey Street Kids,"As a white American hyphenated names aren't the norm and anything that isn't the norm, well, people are cruel"
Harvey Street Kids,I might be wrong but it could be similar to hyphenated English names. For instance I know a Terri-Jo.
Harvey Street Kids,"It just makes it easier to pronounce in English. In Korean, each letter pairing is one syllable, but that doesn’t make sense in English. So, hyphenating a name makes it easier to say. But a lot of foreign people will go by an English name. So instead of Ji-Yung, they might go by Jenny."
Harvey Street Kids,"Yeah and Koreans don't represent all Asians either. They're just the most popular one right now.

Edit: Why are you booing me? I'm right!"
Harvey Street Kids,I only accept representation in puppet form.
Harvey Street Kids,"Yep. Why are people (the puppeteer included) acting like this new Asian muppet is nothing short of a revolution, when there has been diverse casting on Sesame Street from Day One?"

Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,I too really wish someone would *finally* get around to telling the stories of the people who fought in WW2.
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,Do you think we have a shortage of stories about people fighting in WWII?
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,I’m guessing you haven’t seen her in many roles then.
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,"Like in Goodnight Sweetheart, where he walks down an alleyway and finds himself in the 40s, and leads a double life in both the 40s and 90s with two love interests?"
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,"she doesn’t, and had to learn in weeks! i was shocked, i only googled if she speaks french natively because i saw she was a brit and i was like ????"
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,"Her French accent was decent enough, but it wasn't a Québécois accent. Interestingly enough, when she was on the telephone with her mother, her mother did indeed have a Québécois accent."
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,I believe shes in talks to do a fourth series but after that she imagines they’ll have to recast with an older actress otherwise she’d be in the makeup chair half of the day having age prosthetics put on
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,"Where did you see that? The last thing I saw was from earlier this year where she was still in talks for another season, but with the pandemic, plans can change in an instant."
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,I think she's easily the best companion.
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,[deleted]
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,I dare say those stories will be more interesting than a group of office workers getting banged by various love interests while we pretend their actions played a more meaningful part in fighting the war than the people on the front - both men and women.
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,"Stories - no. TV series - yes. 

Do you think we lack stories about the work people did on the home front?"
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,I have. She's utterly bland.
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,"Yeah, actors tend to have dialect coaches to help with both accent and language for roles.

Anya Taylor-Joy, for instance, has had a perfect English accent in a variety of roles and great American accents in Peaky Blinders and whichever film I'm thinking of where she co-starred with Olivia Cooke (another Brit actress).

Surprised to learn Anya's Swedish."
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,Magazine interview with the show creator not long after the last season aired.
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,Donna wins that in my book.
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,"I agree, the character was better in the snowmen and the dalek episode. Once Clara became a companion I still liked her but she felt watered down."
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,you realize he’s being sarcastic right? there’s plenty of films and TV of WWII soldiers fighting lol
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,"The BBC's ""[World on Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqe1URnfKv0)"" is literally doing a run on PBS right now.

I think a show about what was going on in the war rooms of the British Government, adapted from a memoir of someone who was really there, isn't a controversial choice to base a show around."
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,"She is from Argentina and her native language is Spanish, but spent most of her life in England. Where did you get Swedish from?"
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,"I wasn't fond of her, honestly.

Saying that, I never liked her comedy, either."
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,Same!
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,Of course I realised the sarcasm. Happy to hear some ww2 TV series about soldiers fighting - that aren't a documentary or Band of Brothers.
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,"I agree if it would be fine if it was a historical representation of what went on in the War Rooms - the code breaking, the stress, the result of poor intelligence, the battlefor Britain happening overhead. But we both know that it won't be accurate. It will be retold and recast so to reflect the diversity of today's society purely for the purpose of equality. My bet is that there will be POC thrown in for the sake of not offending anyone with the reality of 1940s England, a selfhating gay white man, an unhappy housewife that finds love, and any other myriad of tropes the TV industry thinks the viewer needs education on (World on Fire is a great example of that). 

It will be hacky and overdone. And some people will love it and some will think it's shite."
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,I ain’t bovvered
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,Blackadder?
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,dude just google it lol you will find some
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,"Well, I'd say that it's too soon to judge what exactly it will be like.  I can almost certainly guarantee that at some point, they will be dealing with the Battle for Britain going on overhead.  British dramas LOVE doing the Battle for Britain.

The truth is that studios have always and will always use tropes in order to tell their story.  Old WW2 movies/TV shows used tropes.  There's the ""All Germans are Nazi's trope.""  There's the ""America were the saviors of WWII"" trope when 80% of the German military were fighting the Soviets.  

Your problem seems to be that you don't like which tropes are in fashion right now, and yes, that includes telling stories that reflect diversity, and telling stories about types of people whose stories weren't told in older treatments of these historical periods.  

You fear that it won't be accurate?  C'mon now.  Most historical dramas aren't completely accurate.  Saving Private Ryan wasn't based on a real story.  It was a complete Hollywood fabrication.  The Dirty Dozen didn't exist.  Even a ""Based on real events"" movie/TV show like ""Patton"" or ""Band of Brothers"" is riddled with historical inaccuracies and uses tropes.   It just seems those are tropes and inaccuracies you don't mind.  If you want complete historical accuracy, watch a documentary.  Movies and TV shows are about storytelling.  Sure, that story can be set in a historical period, or tell a story about how historical figures dealt with real-life events, but the story is primary to the history.  Always has been, always will be.  Even Shakespeare fudged the history here and there when it got in the way of the story he wanted to tell, or even in the way of some social commentary he wanted to make.  So, my question to you is, why are some tropes acceptable and others are not?"
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,"You are missing the point of what I am saying. I think the industry is so obsessed with recreating history to allow for ""forced diversity"" that they do a disservice to the stories they are trying to tell. 

The only thing that makes this story unique is that it's about women. It could easily be replaced with men and be uninteresting.  That is an indication of a bullshit story."
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,"I think that it's a story about the war rooms of the British Government in WW2.  Those war rooms, in history, included a large number of women.  As far as we know right now, it's not a recreation of history for ""Forced diversity.""  It's a choice to tell a story from history that naturally included diversity.  Whether it turns out to be a good or bad show is anybody's guess, but it should be allowed to stand on its own merits and find it's own audience whether that audience includes you or not.  If you're adverse to stories because they feature women in prominent roles, there's plenty of other shows for you to watch."
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,We shall see. But I bet you $50 to a charity of your choice that they alter the ethnic make-up of the women in the War Room so to meet their diversity agenda.
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,"Again, the show is going to use tropes, as all do.  Why is this one so bad compared to all the ones you don't seem have a problem with?"
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,Because I personally think it speaks to the undermining of the history of what was achieved and by whom. It is part of a broader social project by the media and governments to rehash history to make some segments of society feel more included. Its revisionary and boring.
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,"Women played a role in Britain in WW2, from nurses, to air raid wardens, to mechanics, and yes, they played a prominent role in the Whitehall War Rooms of England.  Why are their contributions so unworthy as to not be deserving of a TV show about them?

The European theater of WWII was mainly a war between Germany and the Soviets.  And yet, practically every American war movie since WWII portrays America as having an outsized role in the victory.

That was done as part of a broader social project by the media and Government to rehash history in order to boost nationalism and also downplay the fact that the war was actually won by the communists who were our adversaries at the time these movies were being made.  

WW2 media has ALWAYS been revisionist.  History drama has ALWAYS been revisionist, for one reason or another.  Shakespeare was writing in Tudor times, so when he was crafting his historical dramas about ""The Wars of the Roses"" he made Richard III a bit more villainous than he was in real life.  This is not a new thing.  You can't say that you don't like revisionist history, because every history drama is revisionist, and pretty much always has been.  You just don't like this particular method of revision.

This story is adapted from a memoir by someone who was there, and you're prematurely attacking it for no other reason than the memoir of the person this story is being adapted is a woman.  If this was a show being announced adapted from the memoir of a man who served in WWII, I bet you'd at least wait until it started filming to start attacking it."
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,"The original Chilean ""documentary"" was nominated for an Oscar and it's absolutely brilliant."
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,"Alright! I have to admit this sounds a pretty interesting premise, and with Schur and Danson I have a feeling it will be a hit."
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,Add Jason Schwartzman and Zach Galifianakis and just make this a continuation of Bored to Death.
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,Ted Danson and Michael Shur just feel like it has to be on NBC
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,Not bad for an intern.
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,I’ll watch anything Schur makes. He’s banked so much goodwill that I’m excited for this despite it being a Netflix property
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,is the main character gonna be called sam moleswell?
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,Schur and Danson? Sign me up please.
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,"...okay, I'm interested"
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,Just wish it wasn’t Netflix. I like my sitcoms to have more than 8 episodes a season.
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,I am 100% onboard with that
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,"Oh man, I need to watch the original, they say it's beautiful."
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,Who taught Mose sex?
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,"Had to read the article, but Mike Schur is actually writing this.  They aren't just putting his name on it for extra traction.  Im down.  That guy has written some of my favorite shows."
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,Netflix will cancel it after one season so that's a big pass from me.
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,"I looked up the documentary and it says it's 'docufiction', what does that mean?"
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,What is known for sure - jazz is going to be insulted in some way.
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,Isn't it actually a documentary?
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,Michael's new twist on his human life.
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,Well this is a Universal Television production. It's likely that either NBC and Peacock passed on it or Netflix just offered more money.
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,"really cool to see how he’s grown in his time at meadowlark, i think he has potential"
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,I’m assuming the main character lives in Sacramento and is investigating why the Miami Heat suck so much as an organization and are ruining the NBA.
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,"Agreed. While Rutherford Falls didn't hit for me, it was still pretty decent. And if THAT is his stumble? Then bring it on.

P&R and Good Place are incredible."
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,Sam Moleone ^^^^(Malone)
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,Lance Manion
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,Epic joke Elon!
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,"It really reads plot-wise more as a movie or mini-series to me anyway.

So because of that, it's a big pass from me also."
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,"I watched the original. The main character is hired to live in a retirement home for a few weeks to check up on a particular resident. I didn't read anything about it, but I remember he actually had a cameraman and sound technician following him around recording him a lot of the time. 

So the residents and staff would have known what was going on, and I guess would have been instructed to just act as natural as possible."
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,"It's as staged as a film can be and still qualify as a documentary. I don't have a problem with it being labeled a documentary, but I wouldn't want to suggest it to people without qualifying that it's not what a lot of people think of when they hear the term."
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,"Yea, Schur is signed with NBCUniversal, all of his projects are gonna be Universal Television projects."
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,It sounds like an interesting premise and I trust Schur to find the right about of comedy/emotion for it
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,"I’ll watch Danson in anything, ever. And my favorite thing of his? *”Bored To Death”*"
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,"Ted Danson and Mike Schur?


Sold."
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,"I'm really confused by the ""documentary"" it's based on, the trailer makes it seem like a semi-scripted dramedy, sort of like the Christopher Guest mockumentaries. Is it real or not?"
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,[deleted]
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,Mike Schur is really having a moment.
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,Larry David's gonna be pissed.
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,Always happy to see another show by Cousin Mose.
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,Becker is back
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,"Wait did that Mayor show get canceled, then?"
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,Ugh… it’s going to be trash
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,Great. I’ll be sure to never watch it
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,Sounds like heaven.
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,In Schur We Trust
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,I feel like Bored to Death hardly gets talked about. Makes me feel like I’m the only person that actually enjoyed the full show.
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,"I don't procrastinate, I just like to do things later."
Churchill’s Secret Agents: The New Recruits,"loved Bored To Death.

and i feel like Mr Mayor was pretty good and on its way to really find its feel to becoming something great so i was sad it was cancelled. the roots and moments were there; i just wish they gave it at least another season to find its lane"
Secret City,"this is the series with anna torv, right?  because i dug that first season"
Secret City,Anything with Anna Torv is worth watching.
Secret City,Are there any subreddits with episode discussions for Secret City?
Secret City,Anyone know if the secret laws in Australia are accurately depicted in Secret City?
Secret City,It's so good! It's the only good Australian series.
Secret City,"So did *spoiler* 













                                                                                              Mina do it???"
Secret City,Love this show.
Secret City,yup
Secret City,"Sadly no. It doesn't garner enough attention for some reasons.
It is a great political thriller.
Finished season 2 in one day lol.
Hoping they would renew for 3rd season. "
Secret City,I was wondering the same.  Are the journalist and the government really housed in the same building?  Just fascinating.  
Secret City,"Rake was pretty damn good

So was The Code "
Secret City,yea I believe so the secret soldier didn't do it (he didn't have a reason to lie) and harriet kinda confirms it when she picks her up from prison
Secret City,I came to find discussion on Secret City and am at least grateful for this post.  Loved the first season.  The character Kim was such a great character.   Loved her.  On episode 3 of season 2.   It doesn’t have the same emotional pull for me.  But definitely will finish. And it’s a lot better than lots of other shows out there.  
Secret City,"Lol, I finished season 1 over a weekend a while back. I'm limiting myself to 1 episode per day this time! :D"
Secret City,How about pine gap?
Secret City,"Totally agree. I am sad that Mal Paxton (the former defense minister) didn't return for season 2. 

The show reminds me a bit of Homeland (minus the action). "
Secret City,"Have not seen it yet

&#x200B;"
Secret City,"I'm halfway through it, and it's quite good. Not a thriller, it's quite slow, but very good overall. Also, it's only six episodes, so quite short for today standards.   


Anna Torv is impecable as usual, and she perfectly nails the australian accent.  


Worth watching."
Secret City,I finished it and have mixed feelings.  Started out very good but then resorted to the same old formula of a deep state conspiracy against its own citizens.  Some of the twists towards the end were mind numbingly silly in their implausibility.  I'd still recommend it because even with its flaws it is still better many of the other new series that are available on Netflix.
Secret City,Have been wondering about this show!  A political show eh?  I thought it was sci-fi or something in the future based only on the netflix card and 5 seconds I saw of the trailer.
Secret City,I’ll definitely check this out. I have loved Anna Torv since Fringe and this seems right up my alley. 
Secret City,"This was a pretty good series with a great cast.

For more Australian series, check out The Code (2 Seasons), The Principal (also on Netflix) and definitely seek out Mystery Road which was just released."
Secret City,"I can confirm this is a great show. In fact, this is the only Australian TV show that's bearable. It has a very good depiction of Canberra and Australian politics.

And apparently they're making a 2nd season."
Secret City,"It definitely reminds me of an Australian ""House of Cards"" - great acting and writing, slow but effective thrills, and honestly, needs for rewatch. Maybe it's just my brain but I definitely needed to watch a couple Eps twice just to keep track of everyone's actions."
Secret City,"> she perfectly nails the australian accent. 

Turns out that Anna Torv is an Australian! 

As for the show itself I really like it, it's unpredictable. You think you know what's going on and then they hit you with something unexpected that turns everything upside down."
Secret City,"The first season of *Secret City* was good.

But thrillers thrill, ""giving viewers heightened feelings of suspense, excitement, surprise, anticipation and anxiety."" So they have to be quite slow to be perfectly balanced as all things should be."
Secret City,"It's a smart show about politics, espionage and investigative journalism."
Secret City,Then her American accent was flawless in Fringe. Good to know where she's from!
Secret City,"Shes also the niece of rupert murdoch..

Lot of story behind her upbringing.

She was one of main reasons fox did fringe for so long  as she has some strings  pulled"
Secret City,It's still shooting. Doesn't premiere till next year. Source: have spoken to the producers recently.
Secret City,"I think it slipped to next year, possibly Jan? It has to air on foxtel in Australia first.

Season 2 is called 'Secret City: Under the Eagle'"
Secret City,that series with anna torv seemed interesting. have seen no mentions of a new season in my sources but it is from au so could be a delay in release for us
Secret City,"I managed to track down a interview with the tv boss of Foxtel (the network the show air's on in Australia), apparently it's airing on that network VERY early next year. So who know's how long it will take to land on Netflix."
Secret City,Thanks for the update!
Secret City,"Well then I'm looking forward to watching it early next year, thanks for the update!"
Secret City,This is very “I have taken one screenwriting class”
Secret City,"The event where he fails to protect Ellie already happended in KC, when she saved him. He talks about with Tommy."
Secret City,"Everyone is allowed to their own opinion about pop culture. If OP doesn’t like it, that’s totally fine. 

That being said, this critique reads like the failures of the show are because they don’t follow the one formula for success. There are plenty of ways to make a successful, enjoyable show. OP ignores the fact that lots of people really enjoy it, even if it doesn’t follow the typical recipe for success."
Secret City,"I’ll argue against a few points here. 

1. Joels belief is that people are better off away from him (note how he would choose to live alone on a farm if given the choice). He believes he is responsible for the death of his daughter and Tess, and that it is only a matter of when (not if) he will be responsible for Ellie’s death.

2. Joel gets the pair lost on the trail and is responsible for the pair being ambushed by the commune’s riders. Joel freezes with fear and rather than taking action/speaking up, he allows the dog an opportunity to attack/hurt Ellie. (This is an explicit event that Joel speaks about as manifestation of his fear).

3. I propose that the conflict here is not between Ellie and Joel, but between Joel and Tommy. Recall that Joel was always looking out for Tommy, even before the outbreak. Tommy represents the last remnants of his family. The only person he’s yet to fail (besides Ellie). The conflict comes when Tommy refuses to take Ellie. This forces Joel to confront the reality that he is still responsible for Ellie. (Ge immediately sees a girl resembling his daughter, which causes a relapse into fear and causes him to once again question WHEN he will fail Ellie). 

4. This one happens offscreen. Ellie listens in on Joel and Tommy’s conversation. The conversation is crucial to understanding Joel’s feelings and motivations, but it also affects Ellie’s trust in Joel (a concept called to attention earlier this episode). 

5. This is the confrontation between Joel and Ellie. Ellie confronts Joel about his intentions to leave her. He ultimately gets defensive and lashes out. He tells her off and makes it clear he wants nothing to do with her (a lie to himself and to Ellie). The resolution to this comes when Joel reflects in bed. He visualizes his daughter, and the children he saw earlier living peacefully. He knows he doesn’t want to abandon Ellie, but he has to confront his fears. What will he do?

6. Joel chooses to stay with Ellie. He does so in a patently awkward way. A way only Joel could. He just waits by the horses. 

7. Are we here yet? Or was Joel proven correct all along? Is he failing Ellie by getting stabbed? 

So I think structurally, this is the breakdown of the story beats this episode. The confrontation wasn’t the conflict of the episode structurally speaking. It was the further complication which forced a choice. It also was a character moment as well as a relationship moment. The things Joel says are defensive but understandable. And, we see the regret he feels for saying them. 

It’s fine if this isn’t how you read the scenes initially or if you can’t see them this way. But the themes behind the characters’ actions are string. The interpersonal connections are believable. If it doesn’t resonate with you, ok. But I question what motivates you to try to prove that the lack of resonance is a product of objectively failed structure."
Secret City,"I don't want to attack you for what you think about the show, but I think you're missing all the nuance that the writing rides with its character driven story. 
I can't write out my disagreement for each of your points, but I think the writing is doing a great job following the game and making necessary changes to make it work for TV.
The one point you go back to a lot is how Joel doesn't show (or spoken through the writing) that he is facing this question of if he's good enough to protect this girl, but there's more to it. He's scared that he'll lose her the same way he lost his daughter and while he's the most badass person around to protect her, he doesn't think he can handle that loss again and is doing what he can only think to do to not let that happen. His chest pains, heavy breathing, when he thinks he sees his real daughter, then dreams about her and how that loss affected him.
You're entitled to you opinion, but there's is so much more there you're missing if these are the points you're latching onto.
This is an amazing story and sure you could say I'm biased from the game but I hope you look at it a little deeper and find a way to enjoy it!"
Secret City,"You sound like you read one book on rigid screenwriting tips, and think you are a master storyteller."
Secret City,"If you haven’t seen the Joel and Ellie’s relationship evolve over 6 episodes, then you’ve not been paying attention. While he feels his ability to protect her has diminished a bit due to age etc, he says that as he’s unwilling to face the much more real fact that he’s grown to care for this girl, deeply, and she’s filled a Sara size hole and he’s terrified of going through that again, so best to disassociate as quickly as possible instead of risking that pain again."
Secret City,It's 2023 and people still think they will be taken seriously about their pop culture critiques.
Secret City,"I skimmed your post and I think you seem to be confining your thinking to mainstream Hollywood storytelling's arbitrary rules, where there is almost no room for subtlety and everything has to be explicit and easily digestible for a mildly interested, casual audience.

By your criteria, 'The Sopranos' and 'Mad Men' aren't great shows either because you can't pinpoint characters' choices and motivations to a specific scene earlier in the episode/last couple of episodes.

What TV shows do you give a 10/10 to? Not trying to be condescending, but I have an idea what those shows would be like and what networks they would be on."
Secret City,I ain't reading all that
Secret City,"Opinions are a thing. No need to write an amateur essay on it. What you identify personally as bad writing, others may identify as quality character development, it’s that simple. 

However, you seem to be in the minority regarding the show."
Secret City,disagree
Secret City,"I’m only responding to point 1 because that’s all I needed to see that you’re not seeing the big picture of the story apparently. The show does not do a poor job establishing his fear of losing someone because the fear isn’t directly related to Ellie. His fear is that as he gets closer to ellie his fear in losing her like his daughter grows. It would make sense for this fear to grow as he gets closer to tommy because the “Joel, tommy, Sarah” dynamic is when he lost his daughter and failed her. They highlighted it again when the ppl had their guns pointed at ellie and he froze. He also almost lost Ellie literally the episode before last nights. Twice actually. 

And his incompetence is shown in the intro to the whole series when he proved he was unable to protect the ONE person in the world he was truly responsible for."
Secret City,Your entitled to your opinion. I appreciate you actually laying out reasons too. I don’t really agree but you shared your opinions in a reasonable respectful way so good on you.
Secret City,I can’t imagine going through all this effort with a post like this when all you have to do is simply not watch it if it’s not for you.
Secret City,Go outside
Secret City,"damn, all that for such a mediocre and nitpicking take. while it’s not a groundbreaking show, it still hovers around an 8. you keep talking about plot devices like there’s a cinema bible out there somewhere. while the episodes currently out seem to have rushed some parts from the video games, they’re quite adapted excellently to fit the narrative of the series."
Secret City,That was a long-ass post to tell us you don’t actually understand writing and character development.
Secret City,What is this garbage essay? Lmao
Secret City,"I just can’t understand the point of posts like this. Like what posses a person to post something this long that basically amounts to “Even though the show is a hit that everyone is talking about, all of those people are wrong, actually.”?"
Secret City,Hypercriticism is a plague. Its as if people go out of their way to interpret things in the most negative way possible.
Secret City,"Literally every reason you gave is not even close to accurate.   Typical for these types of posts on Reddit.   Your self awareness is shockingly low.   Your entire account is bashing this show.   I think we all know why.   Also, you think climate change can be stopped if everyone goes vegan lol?  Please don’t reproduce"
Secret City,"I’ll never understand people who don’t like something that’s universally praised by critics and viewers, feeling the need to post about how the thing they just don’t like is actually bad and everyone else is wrong for liking it so much. It’s okay to not like something. We don’t need a dissertation about how poor you think it is and how everyone is overrating it."
Secret City,"“Overrated” = “other people like something I don’t like, and I want to feel better about my opinion.”"
Secret City,What a miserable take. Do you burn your toast on purpose just so you can bitch about it to your coworkers?
Secret City,"If you don’t like it why did you take the time to write this? 

I don’t get why you have to call it ‘overrated’ instead of just writing it off as not your thing.

You’re not going to like every popular show. It’s almost like people have different tastes.

But it is so pretentious to write a post slating a piece of entertainment that millions of people are enjoying just because you didn’t like it"
Secret City,"I like it.  A lot. 

The bad writer … is you."
Secret City,Imagine writing all that lmaooo
Secret City,Lol stoped at “Joel has an incorrect belief” dude - you’re just wrong.
Secret City,OP trying to tell the world he is a better writer than Emmy winner Craig Mazin & the guy who co-created the entire TLOU universe in Neil Druckmann. Yeah bro I don’t think so.
Secret City,I feel like in the real world a ton of people do end up making/changing decisions after a night of sleep. At least people who don't feel the need to stick to their opinion because it's the first thought they had.
Secret City,"Never played the game, never watched the show, but this was the perfect length of read for the poop I was taking. Have a good day..."
Secret City,"I think you're just suffering from ""howiwoulddaitus"" you're forming opinions about how you would have done it, and missing a lot of what you say is missing. 

I was actually just talking about this last night. How a lot of plot and character development other shows would stretch over multiple episodes, are written very economically in this show. 

Just a super short example of something you say is missing... Joel believes he's unfit to protect Ellie, and unfit to be her ""father"". 

Despite all the other instances showing him failing in his goals in previous episodes, you're ignoring the PTSD. But just inside this episode he falls asleep on watch. He's pushed by fear into inaction. He is convinced he's the only one who can ""save"" his brother, yet when his brother is out in the world on his own his brother is the one who thrives. He's reminded how he failed his daughter. He gains information about how he failed to notice that the kid was bitten. 

He's old. He knows he's lost a few steps, and he thinks that the only person he knows and trusts and believes is more capable than he is is a better choice for Ellie. A better choice for his ""daughter"". So he thinks that abandoning his daughter to the care of his brother would be the best option. But that's a selfish choice, and Joel's trying to outgrow being selfish. 

Just because you might be a bad parent sometimes, doesn't mean you get to abandon your kids. 

Joel's character growth, and obstacle he's overcoming isn't just his belief that he can't protect her. It's his belief that he's a shit father who failed at saving his daughter and will fail that once again. His growth is that despite those fears... A fear that has caused him to remove himself from humanity for a decade... He now understands that being a father and committing to the future of your children is more important than your fears."
Secret City,"I read first point. Completely off... Perhaps you're just unable to pay attention or something... Joel has trauma from losing his daughter, he's not gonna be logical about his ability to protect Ellie. Dude... it's so fucking basic. I ain't reading the rest considering the first point is completely dogshit and doesn't even take into account the character, but is simply your personal interpretation of it from your POV instead of Joel's... 

And I was hoping for a good critique..."
Secret City,"I don’t understand posts like this.  Is your goal to make people who like the show stop liking it and start thinking like you?

Why not just like…not watch the show and let those who like it enjoy it.

I see these types on posts on every entertainment subreddit I look at.

Makes no sense."
Secret City,"I appreciate you sharing all your views and I personally disagree with a couple points. 

I think they provided multiple examples of Joel’s failures (Ellie killing the guy, the brother sneaking up on them at night, Joel falling asleep on watch). 

I think Joel does not trust many people (and Tommy shows signs of being similar to Joel in that thinking). Joel believes if he tells the community he will risk Ellie being killed on the spot. Tommy trusts Joel, but nobody else in the community has a reason to and it’s a “communist” community where they all have a say. Joel is risking Ellie’s life if he chooses to tell everyone and he HATES putting trust in other people, especially any stranger. 

I also think that Joel decision to take Ellie is a lot of things that are unsaid. Joel at this point truly cares for Eliie and is scared of messing up and losing her like Sarah. He is deeply conflicted and is attempting to send her with Tommy because it’s an easy way out for him to avoid fucking up and killing someone he is starting to (or already does) love. They have been side by side for months now due to the time lapses. I personally think he decides by letting her go he is losing her and he doesn’t want to make her upset or feel unsafe because the fatherly instinct have kicked in whether he likes it or not, and that’s why he goes. 

That’s all my feedback. But everyone is entitled to their own opinions and theory’s."
Secret City,It’s definitely a good show but I can’t disagree that it’s overhyped by a lot
Secret City,"Fair play to your post. But I feel like if there was a huge triggering event in Sunday's episode, someone else would've written a long post about being spoonfed Joel's decision/realization that he wants to continue going with Ellie.

Damned if you do, damned if you don't."
Secret City,All that for a drop of blood
Secret City,"What is this, college?"
Secret City,"I do agree that there could have been some improvements. Mostly:

Why didn’t Joel and Tommy escort Ellie?
Why did Joel change his mind?
Why did he not even consider staying at the encampment with Ellie for longer than a day?"
Secret City,"What you're suggesting is some The Walking Dead level of hacky writing. Following to the letter the 'how to structure a story' chapter of every 'how to write' book ever is a good way to create the most mediocre, painfully predictable story filled with the most annoying tropes;

and to suggest that the one show that actively avoids doing that in a sea of mediocre, trope-filled stories that is the zombie sub-genre is poorly written because of it is just sad for someone who calls himself a writer."
Secret City,"Don't care about any of that - still enjoying this show more than anything else I've watched in a long time.  I've never played or seen the video game and never paid attention to the hype for this show, so going in I had no bias except assuming that a show or movie based on a video game is going to be mediocre. 

I'm the type of viewer who has trouble staying awake for most 'critically-acclaimed' shows, and I don't even give a chance to commercial-ridden network television or reality TV."
Secret City,"I think the thing you're fundamentally missing is that Joel learning to let people in and trust Ellie specifically are season long arcs and this is the midpoint of the story. Of course this episode seemingly confirms Joel's worst fears, that's what mid story complications do. They bring the main character to their lowest point before they can have their incorrect beliefs changed. 

Now Joel, deeply hurt and likely incapacitated, will be forced to rely Ellie's responsibility as he recovers, responsibility that he's openly doubted for the whole show but which was really underscored at the beginning of this episode. And he's going to learn that of course he can't protect Ellie himself, he needs a partner. With time, he'll realize Ellie is that partner and that the real reason he's struggled to protect her is because he isn't trusting her and is trying to carry both their weight instead of letting her help him too. There's even a direct call back to how bad Joel's trust issues nearly screwed them over in this episode when Joel talks about how Ellie covertly getting a gun when he wouldn't let her have one was the only reason he survived the initial attack in Kansas City.

Sure, there are individual plot beats that could be improved (I agree, Joel changed his mind about going along with Ellie too quickly and easily) but a lot of your big complaints about this episode boil down to getting upset that the main character hasn't completed his character arc in the middle of Act 2."
Secret City,"Why do you think a wall of text justifies using the dumbest most useless word in all of criticism?


All ‘overrated’ mean is other people like something more than you and you are unhappy about it. 

It’s an opinion on other’s opinions."
Secret City,Where did you get the idea that for a story to be good the characters have to undergo some kind of change?
Secret City,"This reads like the way my English teacher wanted me to pick apart books for the sake of picking them apart before I decided is was just better to just try to enjoy for the sake of trying to enjoy them instead.

When you pick something into pure parts and categories like this, you tear asunder any implicit meaning, losing the entire 'gestalt'. The whole being greater than the sum of its parts speaks to something *beyond* just its parts *or* its sum, but rather the simultaneous vision of both the parts and the whole. You've focused too much on the parts, and lost the forest for the trees."
Secret City,"Not reading all of it as your first two problems are already wrong imo. He is justified in his fear of becoming incompetent to fully protect her. He's gotten very lucky so far that they've managed to make it across the US. Ellie saved his ass by shooting that guy because (unknown to him) she had a hidden gun, the dog didn't detect an infection in Ellie when it very well could have, the two people that snuck up on them despite the broken glass were actually good people and didn't immediately kill and rob them etc. He's getting old and his hearing is piss poor, as he himself states.

Your second problem - ""his incompetence isn't well established this episode"" is also wrong, as it wasn't just him over-sleeping, he also froze up when the dog went in to smell Ellie, which could have easily been the end of her.

Sorry, it just seems like you're just not properly paying attention."
Secret City,Your post is bad writing. (I assume)
Secret City,"People are watching it in droves and enjoying it.

You typed all this to fight and no one really cares"
Secret City,"I ain't reading all that, I'm happy for tho, or sorry that happened."
Secret City,I agree. I feel like the show is really light-weight. There’s a lot of interesting stuff going on but I feel like the show’s a bit rushed and we need to live in the world a bit more. The fact they spent an episode involving two other characters makes me feel like they don’t have a lot of meat to the story
Secret City,"It’s Reddit. Youre going to be slammed. 

That being said, the show is fine. Much better shows on HBOMax."
Secret City,"Since you’re such a expert, what successful stories have you written?"
Secret City,Next
Secret City,You’re a pretentious asshole. No one is impressed
Secret City,You don’t like a show that people like? Who cares.
Secret City,Have totally lost interest in this show after anxiously waiting for its premier. Bad writing.
Secret City,"I actually agree with you. I noticed the weaknesses of the show as far back as ep 3. I pointed it out at the time, but I got shot down too. I think the writing is quite weak, and the overall quality will suffer because of it. I'm sure they cut corners with the construction of the show. Like I noticed there are way fewer interactions with the infected and marauding scavengers than one would expect. Maybe it was to save money? Who knows. But yeah, I think the writing is weak. I've also played the game though, and I definitely hold the game to a higher standard.

Don't worry. Opinions like this typically don't do well during the run of a show. Especially if the show is fairly well liked. These days all it takes is likable characters with comfortable political messaging."
Secret City,The fact that you know these posts are annoying af but still posted it anyways is ridiculous.  We don't need multiple posts like this every single week.  Just let the season play out.
Secret City,"So people love the one off gay romance episode with exactly .05% connection to the rest of the show, but when we finally have our leads show some character development it’s boring and overrated..?

Casual fans are really wild"
Secret City,"I enjoy the show, but agree with you that the show is flawed. I have played the game, so any set backs the show has I can kind of fill in the gaps with from the game, but for someone who hasn't I can see some scenes might be a bit odd.I also didn't like how Joel just went to sleep and changed his mind immediately after an emotional conflict. 

More generally though, I like Pedro and Bellas portrayal of Joel and Ellie, but I think the show did a REALLY poor job of establishing their relatioship. This episode they felt a lot closer, but they also then immediately went to big conflict between each other, which I felt was a little too soon. 

They should have had a few more scenes establishing them getting closer throughout the previous episodes, but I guess its hard to do under limited time. In the game you had dozens of hours of interaction and just simple idle chatter between them which helped to establish their relationship so well, but in the show they boil it down to just a few key moments of dialogue and sometimes it can come off a tad cringey or inauthentic just because its so few and far between. 

I am interested to see the season play out though. There is still a lot of an amazing story left and if they can land it then I will be impressed. If not then, at least it was a more than decent video game adaptation. 

&#x200B;

And side note, I don't understand everyone going wild at you for having an opinion on a TV show."
Secret City,"It bothered me that Tommy and Joel didn’t take the trip together. That was the biggest flaw in the episode for me but I’ve never played the game nor do I know the plot of the game, and that may have simply been sticking to the storyline. It could have made for a great storyline though complete with a multitude of tragic results if they did though, IMO. 
I’ve seen game spoilers hint that the TV audience isn’t going to like where Joel’s character arc was headed but killing off the top-billed, main character in 6 episodes was bold, assuming he is dead. Taking the game spoilers at their word though and seeing the next episode highlights points to a larger character development that may make your points moot and that is, with all the hype about Pascal, it’s not about him. Not knowing what is next and simply seeing what’s been presented and how ep 6 played out, the big, very meta plot twist is everything up to now and what’s ahead wasn’t about Joel, it’s about Ellie and her development in the timeline. And that’s a story I can get into because she is one incredible and dynamic character."
Secret City,I would submit to you that posts about how some popular thing isn’t as good as everyone says (but is still good) are a waste of everyone’s time. It’s just not an interesting topic of conversation. Maybe go take a walk or something
Secret City,I like the show and I agree with all of this. Last night’s episode was really just the most egregious example of it. I’m ready to say it is the worst of the series so far. A mixture of filler and rushed plot lines
Dream High,"And it was like 15 seconds. After weeks of hype, they couldn't even but a minute long ad? Most pointless shit ever"
Dream High,I saw another angle of it on tiktok. And it clearly was no good. But it was still a weird commercial and not sure how or why it would want me to gamble on sports.
Dream High,It was bad and weird and I didn't see the lead up ads but he clearly missed the kick [as you can see here](https://imgur.com/8We0Dc3)
Dream High,"If you slow it down, it appears that the ball does pass in front of the left upright, so it does seem that he missed.  But the whole thing looks completely fake, done on a soundstage and filmed so you can't really see what happens.  An old school extra point wouldn't be in the air that long either."
Dream High,"[He missed it.](https://twitter.com/FanDuel/status/1624956254828351488)

I think the most the people around him thought it went in which is why they were cheering."
Dream High,The whole thing was overdone. Looked fake. I am proud of the fact that I have made it this long without being even tempted with all the sports gambling.
Dream High,"This was actually setup here in AZ a ways away from where the Super Bowl was happening, they shut down some mountain bike trail heads to construct the scene."
Dream High,"That was it?  Holy fuck that was terrible on every level!

>  He clearly made the kick

What video did you watch?"
Dream High,Wait you guys got to see it? For us it literally cut to black during the actual kick and it didn’t look intentional. Must be there marketing strategy to make it seem like some sort of conspiracy so we talk about it.
Dream High,Looked like a fever dream
Dream High,They only have out a free $5 bet anyway.  The whole thing is stupid
Dream High,Pretty embarrassing considering they hyped it up and stuff. Like what.
Dream High,high school level of production there
Dream High,"Weird, I just thought it was intentional. Like make the event clearly not live when it isn't, have such a silly hook shot, and then the immediate celebration despite the miss. Was it not meant to be a joke?"
Dream High,"He didn't make the kick. Watch it at .25 speed on youtube and pause it, it clearly goes in front of the goal post."
Dream High,Can I get some context here? Who is this guy?
Dream High,"There's an entirely different angle that shows it's real, and that he missed. 

Get your eyes checked."
Dream High,">he clearly made the kick

idk, maybe if you're fucking blind, because he clearly missed it

you ever consider getting a job refereeing professional sports?"
Dream High,"Also, if he supposedly missed, why are all the other ""fans"" around him jumping and cheering afterwards?"
Dream High,"1. The idea of it being ""Live"" was just a gimmick. They weren't trying to trick you into thinking it was ""Live"". It was just a joke.
2. He clearly missed the kick in this video."
Dream High,no matter what he was going to make it. If he didn't they had to make it look like he did
Dream High,What a let down. I honestly thought they would have him win it and then give out like $5 to everyone. Just to give them that winning high and get them hooked
Dream High,Yea this was a disaster lol.  You cannot hype something this much and have it be so canned and ridiculous.  And they only ran it as a :15!
Dream High,Especially for how they hyped it to be live it was a total dud
Dream High,I don't think Gronk lost on it.
Dream High,"ITT: people still talking about a “terrible” commercial and the brand, proving the commercial worked."
Dream High,"I´ve never watched American football, but the ball clearly went past the goal, not through it."
Dream High,"gronk is annoying in every commercial anyway

like just a stereotypical bro and its really not funny, charming, or tolerable

go away"
Dream High,"> I didn't see the lead up ads

Lucky you, I'm not even being sarcastic."
Dream High,It was a huge hook for such a short kick.
Dream High,Yeah there's one frame in this video you can clearly see the ball in front of the post.
Dream High,"The problem is the ball shrinks too quickly.

Even though it passes in front of the left post its size gives the illusion its further away. 

Sloppy cg."
Dream High,The refs aren't looking up at all either.
Dream High,"Yup, can’t believe how many people keep saying he made it when the video definitely shows him missing it."
Dream High,"I did once, I won, it felt like nothing so no reason to do it again. I hate how much the sports betting is now shoved into like SportsCenter and stuff."
Dream High,"Yea, it was filmed in the Estrella mountain range per this thread that popped up yesterday.

https://www.reddit.com/r/phoenix/comments/1108h2a/discovered_where_gronk_is_kicking_on_my_hike/"
Dream High,"If only there was some type of organized event where those kicks happen frequently and they could practice how to film it to make it clear. Oh well, maybe next year"
Dream High,"Retired American Football player and future Hall of Famer. FanDuel, a sports gambling app, ran a promotion where he'd try to kick a field goal live during a Super Bowl commercial and if he makes it customers get a promotion for some kind of free incentive. He missed but they're still doing the promotion."
Dream High,"Those aren't ""fans."" That's his family, as it says in the commercial. Pretty sure the woman who runs closest to him before he falls down disappointed is his girlfriend, Camille Kostek. While they do all run in his direction and crowd him, if you actually look at what individuals are doing, they're not celebrating."
Dream High,You’re asking why people wrongly thought he made it when you’re in that boat? Really?
Dream High,He didn't make it though. The commercial is that he misses but they're still giving the same deal they said they would if he made it.
Dream High,They gave out $5 anyway because it’s just a promo to get people gambling like you say.
Dream High,His USAA commercials are borderline making fun of mentally disabled people. It's fuckin gross.
Dream High,Its bendier than Beckham
Dream High,The kick flies likes its a 50 yard field goal.  The whole thing looks wrong.
Dream High,This is the issue. They shrunk the ball so small that it looks like it’s way past the goal posts already before it hooks.
Dream High,"Yeah, if you slow it down you can watch the ball pass in front of the upright. They were always gonna do the deal lol"
Dream High,"Yup, and they were always going to give people the money regardless of whether or not he made the kick. That’s how these promos go."
Dream High,"True, but with him missing it was a lame consolation prize. If you’re going to script it anyways I would think you’d want him to make it"
Dream High,Plus only military associated people can bank with them which is a tiny part of the population so where's the money going?
Dream High,"""I want one!""

""A child?""

""No, a sticker!"""
Dream High,"People on r/NFL talked shit on me when I brought up how much his ""But I'm special"" line bothered me. As someone whose mom taught special ed, and thus I volunteered to help in her classes a ton, it really made me feel like our society is regressing seeing those ads. Glad to see your comment and know I'm not alone in feeling like these ads are disparaging toward people with developmental disabilities."
Dream High,Beckham bent a little too far in the SB last year
Dream High,"Meh, it was free money either way so I don’t care if he made it or missed it. And I don’t think it was scripted even if it wasn’t live. Plus I won money in another sportsbook because he missed it so I’m fine with the outcome."
Dream High,"If they're anything like Navy Federal, which it looks like from their site, all you need a referral from someone that's already a member. I got in Navy Federal through a family member, who got in through his wife."
Dream High,Eh I use usaa bc my gramps was military. Neither of my parents or me have ever served so it can kinda spiderweb the potential user base
Dream High,Those ads really bother me too. I do thingGronk seems like an overall good dude from other stuff I’ve seen of him but those ads really don’t do him any favors
Dream High,"Man, people get butthurt over the most inane, innocuous shit."
Dream High,"“One of the most groundbreaking shows I’ve ever seen, 7/10.”"
Dream High,"I loved the first few episodes, but they rushed to slap together an “Avengers-level event” for her to defeat that ended up being pretty lame. I would’ve loved to see more of her day-to-day family life and trying to thwart a few “street level” crimes and whatnot. That said, I get that they had a lot about the character that they wanted to establish with only 6 episodes, but the pacing was kinda bad in the latter part of the season. I’d still put it at an 8/10 though just because of how much I liked the character and her family/adolescent struggles."
Dream High,"My father, who just recently passed, was a geography teacher and when we were kids every once in a while he would bring home some of the films he showed in class and one of those was Blue Men of Morocco.  It was a travelogue style film but I always was curious about the difference in cultures and that was one of the starts and Ms. Marvel took me back to that time.

Ms. Marvel as well as Wandavision and Hawkeye were my favorites on the Disney package."
Dream High,I like how >!Zoe ends up nice the entire time with Kamala  having been more of a bully.!<
Dream High,"If you like the show, I would recommend the first run of the comics. The show gets everything the comic put out right. Kamala is just a loveable character. She is the adorable geeky little sister that everyone wants. MCU lucked out with finding Iman Vellani to play her. She was born to play the role."
Dream High,It took me to the second paragraph to realize I had misread the title and this wasn't about Ms. Maisel.
Dream High,"I thought the show started off really slow but finished strong.  Do I think it is ""groundbreaking?""  No.  But that is pretty much my opinion on all shows / movies."
Dream High,I thought the time traveling was weird.  Too much of the show was a history/culture/religion lesson.  We don't spend most of the time on iron man or spider man getting into any other their backgrounds or cultures.  I just want to see powered people fight.
Dream High,"It probably is groundbreaking in terms of providing a realistic portrayal of pakistani-american culture to a mass audience. Groundbreaking in the art form of making good TV shows, probably not."
Dream High,"""groundbreaking"" doesn't have to necessarily mean 10 out of 10 to be honest."
Dream High,He's probably a reviewer from 7GN*.
Dream High,It has flaws but it does feel like a gigantic step forward. You can really like something but be aware it has problems. Ms. Marvel gets so much right that while it does has some issues but those issues weren't enough for me to hate it. But I also can't say it's perfect.
Dream High,"You can tell at what point where the showrunner told the story they wanted to do and where Fiege came in to make the show fit in with the rest of the MCU. Because the Jersey part was so alive and well thought out. The Big Bad was almost an afterthought. Like you can hear the, ""Sigh....fine. Here are your MCU fight scenes. Now can we get back to Jersey already?"""
Dream High,They should have deleted the weird Clandestines storyline and made Damage Control the true villains instead.
Dream High,I'm definitely considering it now. Is there an app that has all the old marvel comics?
Dream High,The fact that Spidey is a New Yorker is a *huge* part of the character.
Dream High,">Too much of the show was a history/culture/religion lesson. We don't spend most of the time on iron man or spider man getting into any other their backgrounds or cultures. I just want to see powered people fight.

Um...okay. 

It's a show about a Pakistani American Muslim superhero. What made of that made you think we wouldn't at least be getting some insight into her personal life and background?"
Dream High,How dare they expose you to other cultures and religions!!
Dream High,"But 7/10 ain't ""groundbreaking"" at all lmao"
Dream High,I mean wouldent that atleast warrant a 8 or 9.
Dream High,It's like why do these superheroes have to use super powers? Just focus on a teenage girl and her real life struggles not some comic book powers
Dream High,I mean they were. Kamala beat the aliens with TNJ
Dream High,"Marvel Unlimited.

10 bucks a month, IIRC.

You'd be looking for the 2014 and 2015 series. 19 issues for 2014, 38 for 2015, I believe it was."
Dream High,That's just a setting.  We don't focus on Jersey in ms marvel.
Dream High,"""at least be getting some insight into her personal life and background?""

Some is different from it being the main focus.  We don't get much from Fury, Rhody or Sam.  

I don't assume all Asian characters will get magically teleported into a history lesson ."
Dream High,So you thought the time traveling back to old Pakistan via powered bracelets was a natural consequence of the story?  I found it weird.  It's so different from the other marvel projects.  I'd find it just as odd if spiderman wasted time going to church and teleporting back to the war of 1812 for a history lesson.  I liked Kamala and look forward to seeing her in the marvels but just found the show to be a bit of a bore.  The love quandranle was a bit YA for me.
Dream High,Not necessarily. I don't like the first Black Panther or Get Out very much. Both are a solid 5 for me. But I'm also very aware of how they broke new ground and pushed the envelope forward.
Dream High,Thank you! That's very helpful!
Dream High,"Man... it is absolutely not ""just a setting"" with Spider Man. He is about as culturally infused as a character gets, it's just a culture invisible to you because it's so familiar."
Dream High,Did you not Sam's show? His entire story arc was about reckoning America's past with the future that he is supposed to be sent to take up the mantle for. The series pulls from actual Black history like the Tuskegee experiment. If anything this is what makes these projects a lot more interesting than just a bunch of roided dudes punching each other.
Dream High,"> So you thought the time travelling back to old Pakistan via powered bracelets was a natural consequence of the story?

Yes."
Dream High,"Your scale seems really weird.

A 5 is a movie on the line between being worth watching and not.

A good movie that has some issues is like an 8"
Dream High,"Also, if you are an American with a library card, you can download hoopla. That will link you up to your local libraries where many of them have Marvel titles online for you to read. Doing so will support your local libraries and, plus, it's free."
Dream High,New york isn't familiar to me.  To say that new york or chicago are cultures the same way being Muslim is a culture seems asinine.
Dream High,"I thought it had a bunch of weird mixed messaging.  It brought up racism a few times but didn't have anything to say about it.

They have Sam defend someone who murders innocent children saying ""she's not a terrorist, we need to think about why she was upset"" but the show didn't establish what the government was doing wrong."
Dream High,"What, in the story, set up the possibility of time travel?  Did anyone think, before it happened ""Yep, the story naturally sets up that she'll be magically teleported into the past""? 

Do you just expect every character to get sent to the past and get disappointed 99.99999%$ of the time?  Were you upset that Shang's magic rings didn't send him back?

&#x200B;

You are so disingenuous."
Dream High,"""A 5 is a movie on the line between being worth watching and not.""

depends on the scale.  True for 0-10.  I've rated thousands of films on IMDB which uses a 1-10 scale, so there's no middle score.  To me 5 is a tiny bit bad, not worth watching.  6 is good enough to say I like it.  I like that I never straddle a line"
Dream High,"I can recognize if something is really swinging for the fences and going for something big but it not really landing the way it intended. For example, Eternals is a movie I personally love but I can see why others couldn't. It has some pretty large flaws that I'm willing to address but overall that doesn't make me enjoy it less. But I can't give it an 8 or 9 simply because I liked it. There were things that bothered me but I can also recognize that it's trying to go for something new. It's a mixed bag. Ms. Marvel, especially in the first half, was a pretty enjoyable experience for me that was both unlike and similar to what I've seen before. The biggest problems come towards the middle but it brings it back to focus towards the end. I really love what they're doing for most of this but there are parts that upon a rewatch I'll just fast forward through. A 7 seems fair to me."
Dream High,"Because Islam is a religion, not a culture."
Dream High,">> What, in the story, set up the possibility of time travel?

The one that cracks me up the most is Bruno dressing like Marty McFly in episode 2, but the most relevant clues would be the constant references to past events. Nearly every episode (with 2 and 4 having the strongest connection) references Kamala’s family history in some way.

With that being said, I DID exaggerate my response a little. Sorry about that. The **natural** thing to expect here, given all the references, would be a detailed flashback sequence, which is exactly what we got. Time travel just happens to be one way to visually do such a flashback."
Dream High,"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic\_culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_culture)

You don't think religions have cultures?  I can't tell if you agree or can't follow the point.  I don't think putting spider man in Chicago changes much.  He's in Europe for the 2nd film.  Changing Kamala to a Mississippi Christian would change her completely."
Dream High,"The point I’m trying to make is that a religion and a culture are not the same thing. Of course nothing changes when you put Spider-Man in a different culture, culture doesn’t directly change his character. But making Kamala, let’s say a Christian changes things MASSIVELY because you change her religion, which is core to her as a character."
Nice Guy,"Usually if you don't hear about a TV project in a couple years, it's dead."
Nice Guy,"So we're saying they AREN'T remaking Fawlty Towers again?

Damn..."
Nice Guy,All this gender-swap nonsense just makes women seem unoriginal.
Nice Guy,"not set in 70's, Shane Black is not involved. Nope, what's the point."
Nice Guy,"Such a bummer that we're never gonna get a Nice Guys 2. That movie was a damn good time, but it bombed at the box office"
Nice Guy,What is the point of changing the time period and the characters and the genders? Just say you're making a show about two mismatched female detectives. This is a waste of the IP.
Nice Guy,"I'm usually pretty ok with giving reboots/adaptations like these a shot. I'm also super for diversity. And The Nice Guys was one of my favourite movies that year. But this just feels shameless. The Nice Guys was so good because of the people involved. The actors, and Shane Black himself. It actually felt like it could have been a great TV pilot, but I don't want to see it turned into a procedural, especially with those people not involved. They're just doing this because they've had some success with adapting their movie IPs."
Nice Guy,"I just don't see this translating well for TV. Will every episode have the females being bad ass but bumbling idiots? If so, hard pass."
Nice Guy,"No. Just, no. "
Nice Guy,I don't know why they're tying a basic buddy cop show to an IP that bombed at the box office but whatever. Just make a female buddy cop show.
Nice Guy,Now I'm sad that we aren't getting a sequel again. 
Nice Guy,soo this is gonna ruin any chance of a Nice Guys movie sequel
Nice Guy,"Is it a drama also?  IGN article I just saw said it was a drama (could be a mistake/incorrect).  If that's true, how is it even The Nice Guys?  It doesnt take place in the 70's, isn't a comedy (potentially), and there's a gender swap.  So its a new 1hr female-lead cop drama.  What does that have to do with the Shane Black film starring Russel Crowe and Ryan Gosling that takes place in '77?"
Nice Guy,Joe silver must be super desperate.
Nice Guy,"I don't understand this thing of rebooting movies to make them female sequels. 

Instead of treading new ground it just remains in the shadow of its predecessor. 

It would be like starting shows called ""The Male Nikki"" or ""Alias: The Man Edition""..or ""The Gilmore Guys"".

"
Nice Guy,"This is dumb, and not because of the genderswap."
Nice Guy,"Soooo what's really the point of this? It doesn't have anything to do with the original, barely seems to be in the same vein as it. Literally just name it anything else? "
Nice Guy,"Finally, an answer to the question""WELL WHAT IF THE GENDERS WERE REVERSED NNNNGH"""
Nice Guy,The Good Guys tv series was better than The Nice Guys movie. Why not reboot that?
Nice Guy,My thought exactly. What's the point of basing it off the movie if it's not going to have anything to do with it beyond the incredibly basic premise of a badboy cop/by the books cop duo?
Nice Guy,Because it's a lot harder to actually be original and super easy to just gender swap something then claim anyone who criticizes it is sexist/racist/whatever. 
Nice Guy,I feel like these days having a show based on something means more to these executives than anything else. Like it's easier to get your story out as a comic book then have it adapted than actually selling it as a TV show first.
Nice Guy,I think the genderswap is also pretty dumb. 
Nice Guy,"GURL POWEER, OF COURSE!!

No, seriously, that's the only reason this reboot is even happening."
Nice Guy,I'm indifferent about that. A lot more about this project is dumber than that.
Nice Guy,Best comedy on tv. Tanaka! Tanaka!
Nice Guy,Pretty brilliant and lowkey show. Great episode.
Nice Guy,it would help to have an actual title for the episode in this shitpost
Nice Guy,Bryan Cranston was a big switch up from Malcolm in the middle to breaking bad.
Nice Guy,"Nobody ... who knew Jimmy McGill would become John Wick. 

One Hour Photo and Insomnia - seeing Robin Williams play deeply disturbed people was unsettling. 

And since everyone who has ever acted seems to have been involved in law and order at some point, Robin Williams also had a role in SVU where he played a mentally unstable vigilante. 

And speaking of SVU:

Kevin Tighe - I grew up watching him play Roy Desoto in Emergency! And it destroyed my childhood seeing him on SVU as a pedophile. 

John Ritter was a genuinely funny and warm hearted man. So seeing SVU turn him into a murderer was also so disturbing and against type. 

Henry Winkler was a con artist who tried to have his wife murdered for money. 

Fred Savage. Another one I watched growing up in wholesome type things turned into a serial rapist by SVU. 

Martin Short - another serial rapist on SVU 

In fact, I imagine most actors actually take roles on SVU specifically to play things that are against type."
Nice Guy,"Damages has a bunch of examples of this. Ted Danson, Martin Short, and Lily Tomlin all play against type in that show. Terrific show BTW."
Nice Guy,"Before Michael Chiklis played Vic Mackey on the Shield, he was [The Commish](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CmY8h9Nrqfc)"
Nice Guy,Shut up Meg
Nice Guy,"I know not all his characters are funny good natured geeks, but there's a particular ugliness and coldness about Dennis Nilsen that Davis Tennant captures very well and I was really impressed, I wouldn't have figured him for the part until I saw him in it."
Nice Guy,"""Dave, I didn't know that you liked to get wet"""

Nice Guy,Adam West as Batman
Nice Guy,"Jason Alexander in *Criminal Minds*. He plays a brilliant sociopath out to get vengeance on Joe Mantegna's character for having arrested his brother. The character could not be more different from the neurotic, whiny George Costanza. Alexander positively chows down on the scenery every time he's on camera, it's great."
Nice Guy,ellen in If These Walls Could Talk 2 on hbo she even got topless on there
Nice Guy,"Timothy Olyphant is pretty well-known for playing charming, roguish types, like in Justified, Scream, etc. But in Deadwood he plays the least charming man who ever lived."
Nice Guy,">John Ritter

You clearly forgot when he was a killer robot on Buffy the Vampire Slayer."
Nice Guy,">Fred Savage. Another one I watched growing up in wholesome type things turned into a serial rapist by SVU.

Remember that one episode of Boy Meets World he was on..."
Nice Guy,"I'm pretty sure the Robin Williams episode of SVU (called Authority) is still considered, by fans, to be one of the best that they ever did.

He played an amazing 'unhinged while also being a super genius' man in that episode, which is not something easy to pull off."
Nice Guy,"> The Commish

It really is amazing to see the contrast between that clip and the [""I'm a different kind of cop""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB2dUVNF-2k) clip."
Nice Guy,"The show is definitely different from his usual type of show or movie but, while he’s great in it, it’s still the kind of “grumpy sarcastic” character Ford usually plays"
Nice Guy,"Great casting, he really made you believe Buffy was just being paranoid"
Nice Guy,"Geez, yeah I had completely forgotten about that. Though I haven't watched Buffy all the way through in over 15 years. I should probably give it a rewatch. Angel too."
Nice Guy,"Letterman Carson and Ferguson are the only hosts I ever enjoyed watching.

I am enjoying how no one here seems to care about Leno, which is good IMO"
Nice Guy,Ferguson > everyone else.
Nice Guy,Everyone>>>>>>that fat cunt
Nice Guy,Johnny Carson did it better than anyone. Any list without him is worthless.
Nice Guy,Letterman's the only one I've ever really liked.
Nice Guy,"Born in 95, these are the ones I've watched over the years and how I rank them

Letterman

Conan

Stewart

Colbert (TCR)

Leno

Meyers 

Ferguson 

Fallon

Kimmel

Colbert (TLS)

Noah 

Corden"
Nice Guy,"Carson, Snyder, Letterman, Ferguson, Conan (on his 1st show).

Absolutely the best of the best, and I feel like the others won't really be remembered. Snyder doesn't get mentioned too much, but his show had the best late night feel to it due to not having an audience.

Carson, letterman, and Ferguson shared the same producer, Peter Lasally. He must have been great at his job."
Nice Guy,"Myers for Corrections and A closer look.

Colbert for monologues...sometimes.

Conan for pure chaos and his remotes.

Trevor for some smarter commentary and jokes, plus Klepper is a stellar remote / interviewer.


The rest, meh."
Nice Guy,"1. John Oliver - completely hilarious (bonus of HBO and cursing) and delivers genuinely insightful political commentary. A nerdy but sincere and likable guy.

2. Conan (pls bring him back, he is the funniest on the list)

3. Trevor Noah - I think he’s really funny and the show has some great bits (Jordan Klepper is great). I always like the monologues rest is pretty solid too.

4. Stephen Colbert - probably a little high, but gets some bonus points for Colbert Report. Very hit or miss. Sometimes this guy is pretty unfunny, but when he hits, I think it’s as close to Conan as we get.

5. Kimmel - don’t really understand how he gets any hate, but, calling him boring is more than fair. Pretty plain guy but always seems like he is genuinely having a great time. The best bits in the game (mean tweets, street interviews) and a usually good monologue

6. Meyers - haven’t watched a lot but what I have seen made literally no impression on me. Not good. Not bad. Meh.

7. Fallon - certainly the inferior Jimmy. So ugh. I don’t really like much of any of his stuff. Often crosses into downright annoying.

8. Maher - unfunny and mean

9. Corden - is James Corden"
Nice Guy,"I can remember the age of Carson and I still think Conan is the GOAT. Unlike the bulk of those who followed him, he doesn't rely on mean-spirited mockery of those he believes his audience will hate as much as he does. He can engage anyone in an interesting and funny conversation, knowing when he needs to take the lead and when he needs to let the subject do their own thing.

I like Trevor Noah as a standup comedian, but his stint on the Daily Show was largely as a mouthpiece for a writer's room that doesn't seem to speak with his voice.

Craig Ferguson is always a great interviewer and keeps it light, but he's more of a personality for interviews than the kind of full-featured host in the vein of a Johnny Carson.

I'm not sure it counts as 'late night', but Graham Norton has some of the better interviews out there as well.

Letterman I thought was great when he started out, but slowly morphed into cranky-old-man territory near the end."
Nice Guy,"I guess based on overall how much I watch their clips on youtube and/or made a point to watch episodes in the past.


Conan > Stephen Colbert (CBS, not the Report) > Seth Meyers > Trevor Noah > Jimmy Kimmel > Letterman (didn't really watch him) > James Corden (above Fallon because the multi-guest format is at least more interesting) > Jimmy Fallon

Some have better strengths than others though. I like Seth's interviews better than Noah's, but I like politics so I enjoy the Daily Show focus more."
Nice Guy,"I am from Slovakia so we didn't get to see many late night shows. The only one that I can remember broadcasting(replay) when in high school was Letterman, so used to watch that every morning 7am when eating breakfast before school(me my brother and my dad) and we always had a good laugh. 

10 years later, I started exploring YouTube and late night shows, and I've watched tons of clips from Kimmel, Fallon, Ferguson, Colbert, Norton, Conan, Ross....

So I've seen pretty much all the biggest clips from those, but I'm not waiting for each show to air. Just jump on YouTube and if there's a clip with some actor/celebrity that I like I watch it. 

As I am getting older the funniest to me are older clips of Letterman and whatever Conan does. Conan's sketches, trips etc. are legendary. Also Norton has some amazing clips. But that's just my opinion."
Nice Guy,I’m trying to remember who the tv show host was around 1996 late at night who was a European blonde male. The show was like a jerry springer type show
Nice Guy,Who's that at the door!?!?!
Nice Guy,"Totally. Was spoiled by him so much, I can't even really get into these contemporaries."
Nice Guy,"Agree. The question should be who's #2?

Throw Dick Cavett and Arsenio Hall in there, too. And would Ed Sullivan and Steve Allen count?"
Nice Guy,"Lassally is a legend, but Letterman did his best work before Lassally came on board for the CBS show."
Nice Guy,"The pioneer of the late night talk show was actually a woman, actress Faye Emerson, who hosted interviews and gave her own political commentary in 1949 on ""The Faye Emerson Show,"" often from a couch in a living room. It was a 15 minute show. 

Steve Allen really developed the format about 5 years later, bringing more entertainment value to the format. Allen brought the desk onto the set, and it's been the centerpiece of most talk shows. Arsenio certainly is on the list, and he didn't really use a desk. 

Carson did it for 4 decades, an inimitable feat in today's world. Cavett may have had the best guests of any of them, so he gets bonus points for that.  

Sullivan really was a host of an entertainment show. I wouldn't put him in this group."
Nice Guy,"Good stuff. Thanks for the info, I enjoyed the read."
Nice Guy,You’re entitled to like or dislike any show you want but reading your post it’s honestly kind of incredible how much of the show flew right over your head.
Nice Guy,"Yes yes.  We really don’t need a dissertation on how much you have terrible taste in tv shows.


Also you clearly didn’t understand BB or BCS."
Nice Guy,Tell me again
Nice Guy,">No meaningful cost, either tangible or intangible, is incurred by Jimmy or Kim.

I'm pretty Damn sure Kim *is* the cost and it's been building to that this whole time."
Nice Guy,Your inability to enjoy something doesn't make it overrated.
Nice Guy,This is a bad take. You clearly don't understand the show.
Nice Guy,"There's a lot in here that implies you've seriously misunderstood Jimmy as a character, but your take on Kim is borderline insulting.  The show has been exploring Kim's motivations since day one.  She was consistently portrayed in the earlier seasons as someone who deeply values fairness and personal willpower, but is self-sabotagingly confident/egotistical.  These principles were all slowly twisted by her increasing disillusionment with her professional life and the endless complications of her personal life.  Over the course of the show, she's slowly corrupted all of these moral stances into justifications for pretty reprehensible actions, both out of a desire to maintain her relationship with Jimmy, and as a way to exert her agency in the legal world.  The way the justifications slowly overtook the original moral positions throughout seasons 4 and 5 is honestly some of the richest character writing I've ever seen.  Of course, if you just see Jimmy as an unsympathetic sociopath who deserves every emotional bodyblow he's received throughout the show, you're going to struggle to empathize with Kim, apparently to the degree where her marriage proposal will somehow seem less agentic than Skyler fucking Ted."
Nice Guy,"Wrong sub, here you go:

r/unpopularopinion"
Nice Guy,""" he witnessed his father being a pushover who handed money to grifters, and it's because of this that Jimmy became who he is""

actually no, that scene was meant to show us jimmys character, not be the foundation / origin of it."
Nice Guy,You seem to have a child’s understanding of even Breaking Bad.
Nice Guy,Tldr you're stupid
Nice Guy,No you just don't understand the show
Nice Guy,How in the world are you going to complain about plausibility while lauding breaking bad lol
Nice Guy,"You end the 1st paragraph of your critique with ""There was never a free lunch in Breaking Bad."" I automatically have a problem with most shows that insist on that biblical justice trope of good triumphing over evil. It's bullshit, and all the shows that pump christian morality at us are pointless propaganda. BCS employing an ambiguity over any cast members moral stance is more true to human nature. Although in reality, Saul's flash forward clips in black and white appear to have him living a lower quality of life later on. It's trajectory may end up closer to your required lunch cost than my preferred occasional getting away with it."
Nice Guy,"Don't know why so many ppl are so pressed lol the show is not perfect so I think some criticism is valid. Redditors like to act like the show can do no wrong and is the best thing ever written but that's not true. Personally, I like the show, but I don't think it's on the same level as Breaking Bad. There is a reason it's not as popular as BB was at its peak. Everyone has their opinions though and that's fine!"
Nice Guy,Just say you don't like it. Its fine move on.
Nice Guy,im 100% with you. the show is too convenient for the sake of being convenient. All the side characters feel like npc. BCS is nowhere near being a good show and miles apart from Breaking Bad.
Nice Guy,To all those saying OP doesn't understand the show: that's a weak ass response.  He makes valid points that none of you address or directly respond to.
Nice Guy,"Jimmy doesnt work as a main character, he should've stayed as the additional cast of comic relief, whenever him and kim are on screen shit's so boring"
Nice Guy,"Just finished the last episode five minutes ago and agree w this assessment 100%.  Really nailed it.  Great analysis!  

P.S. I went looking if I were alone in thinking this show was WAAY overrated.  BB and The Wire are my fav TV shows of all time.  This was a major disappointment.  I also think the writers had to write around Bob Odenkirk.  He's not a leading man, he's a supporting player -- wh may have something to do w why his character failed so much as a protagonist. Heck the writers gave up on him/his character and they pretty much made Kim the protagonist in Season 6.  Odd show."
Nice Guy,"And the depiction of Kim in the last few eps rang hallow to me.  She suddenly becomes a Stepford Wife and marries a boring (and unattractive) guy as a self-loathing form of jail. Okay but then everyone in her work-group gets the memo and they all look and act out of 1964. Did Olivia Wilde suddenly direct the Florida storylines or what?  Btw, this is what the writers think Americans who work in office parks look like.  Uh, okay..."
Nice Guy,"If you don't like the show, Then don't watch it. Some people liked it, Some not, This happens with every other show..."
Nice Guy,Kim Wexler is a great character
Nice Guy,Better Call Saul boring overrated show.
Nice Guy,"Yeah i had a problem with jimmys characters on better call saul as well. I literally came here after googling "" better call saul isnt good"" Lol. When i was watching the first season. I too expected to see a saul goodman that was either going to decide to start, or get better at being a slickster because of how tired he was of his life. All the while watching the things he does, while not right, be understandable. And doing this in a way that reflects HIS character. 

In breaking bad I saw saul as a man who was comfortable being who he was. Because he seemed to be be a man who knew who he was! He knew he was a two bit slickster with a silver tounge. But he seemed at peace with that because he seemed in my eyes, to be a man who accepted the world is a crudy place. And you have to decide how you want to handle that. Everyone does. In my opinion the people who do have a easier go at it because they can carve out a uniqueness that lets them handle no situation the exact same as even someone with a similiar general personality. 

My impression of saul as a result of the statement above, seemed to be a man who decide that he would balance out on the negative end of the moral tightrope. But not so far on that side that he would forget who he was. At least unless he was hard pressed. As sleazy as he was he instantly seemed like a man who had a code. While still living based on his acceptance of his world view. ""Most ppl cant be all ""good"" in this world and expect to win."" You have to bend the rules with skill and sometimes you have to look out for number 1"" 

But despite his character screaming that life perspective. I couldnt help but easily sense he still had a conscience. On top of not being a very aggresive person and being comic relief in the breaking bad. And i think this combo is what made him so attractive as a character. This is proven time and time again as we see jessie and walt come to Saul for help, and while his dealings are in the underworld. This is what precisely allows him to aid walt and jessie time and time again. Because one, he has some moral ambiguity. But also two, he's obviously skillful enough to have succeded in a world of moral ambiguity and still keep his core values in tact while not allowing himself to become plain evil, insane. Or just some who he doesnt imagine himself to be.

I wanted to see this unfold in better call saul. How did he succesfully become a king of con men, in this world of submerged evil, drugs, theft and murder, but still keep being himself. Or maybe he only had a piece of himself at the beginning, and he had to decide how he was going ro solidify himself if he was going to make it , not just in the world. But in that world. Better call saul just took all of that mystery and seem to turn jimmy into a psuedo walt but with a scummier face mask. Just my 2 cents"
Nice Guy,"It is overrated, overhyped and painfully boring. There's no need to waste so much time in scenes that could've been two or three times shorter and still get to the point. Three seasons could've been two easily if written/edited well. Episodes are 45+ minutes, that means that short ones could've been 30-35 minutes. Just imagine that.  


BCS is pure fan service for BB fandom. Acting is good, not amazing as all fanboys want to believe. Mike subplot felt for 3-4 seasons way too detached from Jimmy's. Show's call Better Call Soul and sure, it's nice and necessary to see the evolution of him to become Saul Goodman, but 4 season for that? Too long. Chuck character is obnoxious, and yet again another cartoonish character in the Vince Gilligan universe. Remove his electricity sh$% and half the plot is gone.   


At the end of the day, the show is another Vince Gilligan classic antihero show. This was Breaking Bad 2.0, but more boring. I can't believe some are calling it the best show ever. What the fc$% have they watched?"
Nice Guy,"it’s just mid, plan and simple"
Nice Guy,I completely respect your right to be so very very wrong.
Nice Guy,Any popular show is overrated if you don't like it
Nice Guy,"It's not bad But I do think it's really overrated. I've seen some people unironically say it's better than Breaking Bad which to me is literally impossible.

I stopped watching after season 4, there is just no big thing to keep you going since it's not a thriller and you already know the outcome."
Nice Guy,"I agree that it's overrated, but I'm still watching it. Breaking Bad was much better. BCS is painfully slow at times."
Nice Guy,"Okay, you win. You've given the single worst take on this subreddit. Congratulations on your abysmal taste and complete failure to understand complex writing. 

This whole post reads like a manifesto on why you aren't very bright lmfao."
Nice Guy,"I kinda agree, post-Chuck at least. It feels much more like a show about hi-jinks than the sort of deeper character studies we got in Breaking Bad. Those happen to be incredibly enjoyable, watchable hi-jinks, but without the brother drama it lacks something.

I think the cartel parts are now the more interesting parts."
Dream High 2,"I'm sure this has been mentioned plenty, but one thing that stuck out to me about the series was *how strong the pilot episode was*. The depiction of the rapid collapse of society was believable and paced brilliantly - paired with Pascal's masterful acting - to ramp up the intensity of the viewing experience in an uncommonly deft way. Just brilliant stuff. Obviously the rest of the show is good too, which is why the number steadily increased throughout the season, but I think it can't be overstated how much they knocked it out of the part with the pilot episode."
Dream High 2,"I'm just glad that it's doing well enough to get more seasons. 

But neck and neck with HotD? Impressive."
Dream High 2,Crazy how well this show has done. HBO should just greenlight Season 3 and let them film the 2nd game back to back.
Dream High 2,"Should I watch Pedro Pascal, Pedro Pascal or Pedro Pascal today?"
Dream High 2,"A great adaptation made by people who love the game and respected it. 

Bring on S2 and more high quality adaptations (video games or otherwise)"
Dream High 2,"The show is also averaging 30.4M total viewers per episode, which puts it ahead of House of the Dragon (29M).

Weekly Viewership:

* Ep. 1 – 4.7 million

* Ep. 2 – 5.7 million

* Ep. 3 – 6.4 million

* Ep. 4 – 7.5 million

* Ep. 5 – 11.6 million (Feb. 10-Feb. 12, Early premiere, includes data from Friday to Sunday)

* Ep. 6 – 7.8 million

* Ep. 7 – 7.7 million

* Ep. 8 – 8.1 million

* Ep. 9 – 8.2 million"
Dream High 2,Who the hell ends on the number 9? Frigging omen that is.
Dream High 2,It's a cool show but nice Joel kinda freaked me out a little toward the end there..
Dream High 2,I had never seen the game but absolutely loved the show and am very happy to see that is is doing well and will get more seasons.
Dream High 2,Did anybody else feel  like they just kinda stopped having zombies halfway through the show.
Dream High 2,"Turned channel to ABC, saw golden statues 

Turned to HBO, saw Ellie’s injured arm

Seemed like it was a night of ‘scars…"
Dream High 2,I can’t wait to see how Ellie and Joel’s relationship grows in season 2!
Dream High 2,"I enjoyed it but felt like the kinda rushed through it. I would’ve even been ok for the first game to take 2 seasons, or maybe just like 12-15 episodes"
Dream High 2,"They have done an absolutely incredible job so far. 

This may end up being the best video game adaptation ever. Can’t wait for part two!"
Dream High 2,Is Oscar competition even a thing anymore?
Dream High 2,"While I do have my problems with the adaptation, it's obviously good that the show has done very well. I hope this gets some movement on stuff like the MGS adaptation with Oscar Isaac and other video game adaptations"
Dream High 2,"just finished it. what a fantastic videogame adaption.

not everything was perfect but they did an incredible job overall. the funny part is the episode they completely made up is the best one of the show imo"
Dream High 2,i was watching the oscars but they were taking so long. they show trailers for movies at the oscars? come on. i ended up just watching the finale and read who won and watched the speeches on youtube. much more efficient
Dream High 2,"Good adaptation, but I thought it lost a lot of steam after episode 3. 

It was missing some important scenes and added some other unimportant scenes. The most recent scene I had an issue with them removing was the tunnel scene with Ellie almost drowning. It negatively affected what came after it, imo.

The pacing felt far to quick. In the game the gameplay segments really helped give the story some time to breath. The small character interactions and environmental storytelling helped make the characters and world feel more real. I wish they were able to translate more of that into the show.

The acting was really good for the most part, although I still do prefer do still prefer the original cast. Troy and Ashley feel like they were born to play Joel and Ellie.

The symptom of all of those problems I had is that I just never fully believed in Joel and Ellie's relationship like I did with the game. Although individually their acting was good, I never felt a strong bond between them. So by the end, when I should've been feeling strong emotions, all I could think was how quick it all felt."
Dream High 2,Anyone else think it’s good but not amazing????
Dream High 2,"It the point where we draw a line , and tell sincerely to ourselves, was it really that great, or was there a bit of overhype?"
Dream High 2,"WHAT??? That was the season finale?? Sunday march 12 episode??? Tell me that’s not true!!! 
EDIT- I just looked on the app- that was it..☹️☹️"
Dream High 2,"I'm interested to see the season 2 premiere numbers. A lot of people might catch up to it later as it came out during football playoffs, SuperBowl, and the Oscars."
Dream High 2,Says a lot about a show that can be streamed whenever. People were chomping at the bit for this one
Dream High 2,My parents watched The Oscars and I was watching TLOU. It worked out for everyone in our house.
Dream High 2,"Started strong but ended weak in my opinion. The game is also way better than the series, which feels 'empty'. Pedro and Bella are good actors though."
Dream High 2,"Great season. 

I wonder if they’ll stay true to the game with Joel in season 2. Will they do it early or late. Or change the story completely and tell a bit of an interim story."
Dream High 2,"Good show, some of it lags a bit."
Dream High 2,On a Venn diagram of TLOU audience and people who still watch the Oscars I imagine it’s two completely separate circles.
Dream High 2,"Very rushed finale, pacing was not good this season"
Dream High 2,"My only complaint about season 1 was it felt a bit rushed. Between already only being 9 episodes and 2 of those being side-story eps, I wish we had another episode or two to slow things down and flesh out more of the main story. I never played the games, so I'm not exactly sure what was glossed over in the show. 

Also, for large chunks of the season the zombies didn't feel like a real threat. We saw what, 2 of them in the final couple episodes?"
Dream High 2,"My only gripe with the episode was the title sequence. Should have kept it like the game. Have it pop up after Sarah's death. I understand why they didn't but still. Overall, it was an easy 10 out of 10 episode."
Dream High 2,"I found it to be a decent to solid show.  The games were much better, the show focused more on the less interesting parts of the games to its detriment.  Could've used MUCH more infected action.  The flashback episodes were also really, really boring."
Dream High 2,Fuck the Oscar’s. I’ll never watch that shit again
Dream High 2,The Oscar’s aren’t exactly hard to beat in views tbh.
Dream High 2,Could not have told you that the Oscars were on at the same time
Dream High 2,The Oscar’s were on?
Dream High 2,Nobody cares about the Oscars anymore.
Dream High 2,"If you are recording the show while you are watching another show, does it count towards the original? I often have 2-3 things recording at the same time while watching one more and I go back and forth during the commercials."
Dream High 2,The world moves on *despite* the Oscar’s
Dream High 2,Much more entertaining then the Oscars.  I can look up won after and watch speeches I actually want see afterwards.
Dream High 2,"Glad the finale stuck to the game and didn't change the ending, but both the finale and the season were way too short and rushed. Solid show, but I was really hoping for more."
Dream High 2,"Just imagine all the views from people sailing the pira-sea

Not that it's a good thing though..."
Dream High 2,I wasn't expecting the Oscars to impact this at all since between 9-10 is when most of the less interesting awards are given out.
Dream High 2,"am I the only one tired of it already? And there is a massive logic flaw that annoys me.

 I didn't want The Walking Dead, but I thought there would be SOME interaction with the infected. We get one incredible scene with hundreds of them coming out of the ground and then, pfft... nothing. Episode after episode after episode of people doing awful things to each other, lots of flashbacks, but you would think the planet no longer has a problem. In fact, since they can noisily wander around in city after city without a care in the world and clearly there isn't a living infected left, what exactly is the point of the entire plotline of ""she can save the world because she is immune?""

Who cares if she's immune, everything is fine, get on with your lives.

I miss days when shows and films came from talented writers, not from video games.
And if you think video games have great writing, well, I don't know what to tell you. ""I'm a great writer, I think I will be an anonymous employee of a video game company instead of creating my own novel!"" lol"
Dream High 2,Most of the viewing is done on the High Seas. I suspect...
Dream High 2,Despite? I knew more people who were looking for **ANYTHING ELSE** to watch but the Oscars.
Dream High 2,bc honestly screw the Oscar’s anyway lol
Dream High 2,I wonder how much viewership is going to drop after you know what happens in season 2.
Dream High 2,"I literally was walking out of Costco at receipt check on Saturday and the 2 employees were talking about The Last of Us finale happening on Sunday. I even commented that I couldn't wait.

The show is a phenomenon and it's excellent."
Dream High 2,Implying the Oscars constitute “competition”
Dream High 2,So happy for Pedro and his success 😊
Dream High 2,I do wonder who bothers with the Oscars? I think it is a generational thing.
Dream High 2,Are the Oscar's considered competition though?
Dream High 2,[deleted]
Dream High 2,“Despite” Oscars Competition? The Oscars have been declining in ratings for years
Dream High 2,"overall, I’d give it B-

Def not bad, but problems developing a story when it’s pretty basic but the game mechanics make it awesome"
Dream High 2,First episode was good….then?
Dream High 2,"Everyone seems to like the show and I'd like to know what people find so special about it. 

Like, I think it was a high quality show but to me, I'd rate Lovecraft Country and Watchmen above it. And House of the Dragon. 

The Last of Us story is very generic."
Dream High 2,"Still wont watch it... Not okat with changing charachters races for no reason but to fill an inclusión cuota...

Ill stay with the game, wich is vastly superior anyway."
Dream High 2,lol oscars “competition”. No one cares about the oscars.
Dream High 2,Amazing show loved it from start to finish
Dream High 2,"I can't go back to weekly episodes, binge watching is the way to go to maintain that emotional investment going from the previous episode.

That's why me and some buddies cut the season into 2 batch watch throughs"
Dream High 2,Now time to hibernate till next summer lol
Dream High 2,Great show its like the. Walking dead but more of a story line than the creatures.I Luke it a lot.
Dream High 2,I'd rather watch C-Span than the Oscars.
Dream High 2,"Oh man i didn't know that was the last episode, fuck."
Dream High 2,"Bills relationship felt more real than any of Joel's relationships


We needed more action going forward like in episodes 1 and 2"
Dream High 2,People only watch the Oscars now hoping to see a fight between celebrities.
Dream High 2,"Dunno but the show feels a bit underwhelming, it lacks a bit of the oomph I connotate to HBO shows. I had high hopes for Mazin playing around in this sandbox after Chernobyl but if felt more and more like a chore watching it from week to week after a somewhat promising starting few episodes."
Dream High 2,"Sorry, but the casting for Ellie didn't do it for me, and thus I quit watching after the first show."
Dream High 2,And despite it being a boring show
Dream High 2,Zombies are more endearing that most Hollywood celebrities.
Dream High 2,Who really cares about the Oscar’s?
Dream High 2,"Apart from billie and phil ,everything was perfect"
Dream High 2,The Oscars were on?
Dream High 2,No one cares about the Oscar’s anymore
Dream High 2,ending was pretty garbage though.
Dream High 2,It's not bad but I'm not super impressed. It's not very original. You can watch an episode and feel like it's an episode of The Walking Dead.
Dream High 2,Show was meh after episode 2.  Tis a shame really.
Dream High 2,"Despite Oscars competition, as if anywhere close to that 8.2 million give a shit about the fucking Oscars."
Dream High 2,It's all gonna come crashing down when *that* scene happens
Dream High 2,And season 2 will peak high and quickly drop off.
Dream High 2,Such a slap dash disappointment though.
Dream High 2,"People keep telling me I have to watch this, and all I can think is yeah I watched all of The Walking Dead and it was a waste of my time and I'm not going to watch anymore zombie shows. Thank you. Zombies are passé,. I also don't want to watch any vampire television programs, as they also have been done to death. I might allow for a werewolf show though."
Dream High 2,Competition?
Dream High 2,Huh.. Didn’t even realize the Oscars was back on last night.
Dream High 2,Oscars… competition… HA!
Dream High 2,"goodshit, give craig mazin all the projects"
Dream High 2,The insane figures both this and HOTD have managed should hopefully pressure streaming services to return back to weekly releases. No Netflix show will ever muster the immense staying power that a show like this manages across several weeks/months.
Dream High 2,I’m just hoping they don’t water down part 2
Dream High 2,"Fantastic show. writing is good direction is good, two main actors are FANTASTIC"
Dream High 2,I can't wait to see people's reaction when they get to THAT scene from the second game 😈
Dream High 2,they stretched it out too much... some episodes Are just filled with random filler stuff with no plot development
Dream High 2,"It's funny how Disney can't come up with something close to TLOU, HOTD, Succussion.....etc"
Dream High 2,"We stopped watching after Pescal died, after her fell off the horse. 

Does he not die?"
Dream High 2,Oscars competition? No one is watching the Oscar’s still right guys?
Dream High 2,Lol “Oscars Competition”. Can’t believe people Really watch that.
Dream High 2,The Oscars was on? Probably didn't miss anything...
Dream High 2,No one's watching the Oscars.
Hotel Transylvania,Primal is absolutely fantastic
Hotel Transylvania,"I had put it off, just was not into a show about a caveman and his TRex buddy.  Then I watched one episode and was blown away!


The way the relationship between Spear and Fang develops with no dialouge..... just chef's kiss!


I have a few minor gripes about it, will keep them to myself; it is a masterpiece!"
Hotel Transylvania,"While it's not the type of show I'd watch on my own, my SO has been watching it and it's soooooo well made. Even though I normally don't like the themes, it sucks me in everytime."
Hotel Transylvania,"Whoa, big fan here.  Yes, art!"
Hotel Transylvania,One of the best animated shows of the last few years
Hotel Transylvania,"Your average episode of Primal is a solid 8/10, with many episodes as incredible as a 9.5/10.  There are only a few that're worse than that.  Suffice to say I fucking loved Primal as I watched it, was always looking forward to the next ep, and never missed a premier day.  Incredible art, animation, and especially soundtrack.  So much is told through little to no actual dialogue.

'The Primal Theory' episode I thought was pretty good, but as I watched it I couldn't help but feel like ""we only have a few more episode left, I hope this time spent away from the main storyline doesn't detract from the finale.""  And boy it did, bigtime.  The finale was fuckin ASSCHEEKS.  It was BAD.  And not even in the main choices for what happens to the characters.  They could have kept all the main plot decisions the same, but could have portrayed it about 7000x better.   ESPECIALLY if they didn't waste a whole episode on some random ass non-related story.  If they just made the final ep a 2-parter in length, and fleshed out the details, Primal would have been a complete masterpiece start to finish.

Unfortunately, a damn near perfect series ended on a complete shitstain note of a final episode.  Still worth watching.  Still pissed off about the ending"
Hotel Transylvania,How much is 'a lot' compared to *Too Old to Die Young*? because that shit was crazy AF but also thought provoking and visually stunning. The style *is* the substance.
Hotel Transylvania,probably my favorite thing Adult Swim has produced
Hotel Transylvania,did you see the whole thing? the second season is insane
Hotel Transylvania,It really is some next level stuff
Hotel Transylvania,"> If they just made the final ep a 2-parter in length, and fleshed out the details, 

Into *what*?  The finale is about a Viking turned into a magma golem by I assume Sutr or just generally Satan on a magical revenge mission again Spear.  What other details did you want? How exactly did you expect it to play out?"
Hotel Transylvania,"I wrote like four paragraphs about The Primal Theory and its use and importance as well as touching on the finale and how it made perfect sense but could've been longer but was still absolutely epic and heartbreaking, but yeah agree to disagree lol"
Hotel Transylvania,"I've never seen Too Old to Die Young but I'd say Primal is both thought provoking and visually stunning. But I'd say its more emotional than thought provoking. Like the show makes you feel more than it does think but that's kinda the point, its Primal. It's supposed to get a visceral reaction out of you."
Hotel Transylvania,"Same, I haven't been blown away by a show like that for awhile"
Hotel Transylvania,"Yes, it was epic!!!!  ROOOOOARRRRRRR!!!!"
Hotel Transylvania,"Exactly! Spear wasn't going to win this battle, and they did a nice job showing how Mira and Spear were close, but could never be fully together. Mira did a mercy and carried his story on when he couldn't."
Hotel Transylvania,"Yeah and how Spear took it like a fucking champ like his father and tackled him off the cliff while on fire in order to make sure fang was okay, so awesome. Probably one of the most badass sacrifices I've ever seen"
Hotel Transylvania,"Cool, thanks, I look forward to checking it out."
Hotel Transylvania,Spear didn't win but he did still get one over on the viking. He showed him who the true hero really was.
Hotel Transylvania,"It'll be called *Spikeface*.

> The series follows “one of the world’s great horror icons,” who slaughters a couple at a roadside motel — before he discovers they have a baby girl and decides to raise the orphan as his own. That pisses off his roommates, who also are iconic horror villains.

"
Hotel Transylvania,Interesting. It's kinda news to me that Rooster Teeth is big enough to attract Rob. 
Hotel Transylvania,[deleted]
Hotel Transylvania,It's always strange to see RoosterTeeth stuff outside RoosterTeeth.
Hotel Transylvania,[deleted]
Hotel Transylvania,"Upon hearing the news, Geoff's penis finally started working again."
Hotel Transylvania,I keep forgetting how damn big Rooster Teeth has gotten. I still remember when all they had was Red vs Blue and some one off machinima series with other games
Hotel Transylvania,Geoff and Michael must be *ecstatic*
Hotel Transylvania,"Roster teeth as in ""red vs blue""?"
Hotel Transylvania,A bird with teeth...as foretold in [Charlie's dream book] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsiCxwyVXxQ&t=1m2s)
Hotel Transylvania,I'm interested. I had no clue they were this big tho 
Hotel Transylvania,"It has Rob's atention, it has my atention."
Hotel Transylvania,I hope Rob makes it on Off Topic. That'd be so fucking cool. 
Hotel Transylvania,"There’s just so much going on in this post, but I think what shook me the most is that this is in r/television"
Hotel Transylvania,Been watching Rooster Teeth and Achievement Hunter and everyone in the let’s play family for over 10 years and have also watched Always Sunny ever since season 3 and seen every episode. I am so pumped for this 
Hotel Transylvania,"Well, those are two things I'd never thought I'd see in a headline together (not that I'm complaining)."
Hotel Transylvania,"My two all time favorite things, Always Sunny and Rooster Teeth"
Hotel Transylvania,The gang dupes some guys out of money for a tv show
Hotel Transylvania,what are good non-gaming rooster teeth series. I thought they were all gaming-centric. would be interested in checking some out.
Hotel Transylvania,I want to see some Funhaus personalities in this if possible.
Hotel Transylvania,"After seeing Dennis and Mac move to the suburbs I can't wait!
 "
Hotel Transylvania,"Aaaaannnd, the last season will be just Charlie drinking with Frank."
Hotel Transylvania,"It's a horror movie about two men trapped in a garage stairwell, who get hunted down by a psychotic homeless killer... who turns out to be a security guard instead."
Hotel Transylvania,"“Hardcore Tabletop” (premieres later in 2018): Unscripted competition show that takes nostalgic board games and brings the gameplay to a whole new level. In season 1, Achievement Hunter’s Geoff Ramsey will pit his employees against each another in “the most intense, high-stakes Monopoly game of their lives,” with real money and a real jail time

I know it can't be as interesting as it sounds, but I want to know what the hell *this* is."
Hotel Transylvania,Idk who this rob guy is but Mac is gonna be pissed they are using his photo.
Hotel Transylvania,I never imagined Rooster Teeth would be making T.V shows while watching RvB on my Zune... Yet here we are
Hotel Transylvania,It's crazy to see how big Rooster Teeth has become. I remember watching the first RvB episode and waiting for the second one to come out and now this.
Hotel Transylvania,"This is the most mad libs title I've seen in a long time.

[FARM ANIMAL][BODY PART] Orders [GENRE MASH-UP] Series from [FORMERLY FAT COMEDIAN]"
Hotel Transylvania,"Well RWBY, RWBY Chibi, and Nomad of Nowhere are all excellent so this out to be as well"
Hotel Transylvania,Bird with teeth?
Hotel Transylvania,Now did you find a bird with teeth in this fashion in the wild? 
Hotel Transylvania,Apparently Rooster Teeth has that kind of money... I mean I guess they were bought out by a huge company.
Hotel Transylvania,Animated...horror...comedy....series?
Hotel Transylvania,Man its weird how much that company is still growing. 
Hotel Transylvania,"Rooster Teeth started with a few friends recording Xbox footage and recording voices in a closet and now they're a major production company.

They're amazing."
Hotel Transylvania,I'm definitely not going to pay for FIRST for just this when I've fallen off pretty hard on Roosterteeth but that's still pretty cool!
Hotel Transylvania,"This is really big for them. Rob is a very hilarious person, and a talented writer and actor. Hopefully he lends his voice as well. This could lead to so many things."
Hotel Transylvania,"Rooster Teeth got me into Always Sunny a few years back, so it’s nice to see them working together "
Hotel Transylvania,The gang makes a Horror-Comedy
Hotel Transylvania,"I love Rooster Teeth and I love Rob McElhenny, so this is awesome. Can't wait to check it out."
Hotel Transylvania,A true 4 star man right there 
Hotel Transylvania,Didn't know I needed this until right now 
Hotel Transylvania,Damn I remember watching their Rage quit videos a long time ago. Can't believe they have grown so much. 
Hotel Transylvania,"sounds like an interesting concept, but I'm definitely not paying monthly for *another* streaming service just for Rooster Teeth shows.  "
Hotel Transylvania,I think I’ll actually get a First membership for this.
Hotel Transylvania,Rooster Teeth is this big now?
Hotel Transylvania,Nightman?
Hotel Transylvania,"Honestly, he is the creative talent. Can’t wait to see."
Hotel Transylvania,I hope it's good. With RT it tends to be hit and miss on whether or not the writing is good. This sounds like it's up their alley so I have high hopes.
Hotel Transylvania,Where can I put in an order for a good sci fi show?
Hotel Transylvania,I wanna see his minecraft movie.
Hotel Transylvania,What ever happened to the Minecraft movie that he was going to direct?
Hotel Transylvania,Wasn't he working on the Minecraft movie?
Hotel Transylvania,uh oh.  I do not think we are ready for this level of ass blasting
Hotel Transylvania,His name Mack
Hotel Transylvania,Who is Rob McElhenney
Hotel Transylvania,WHAAAAAT?! ROOSTER TEETH?! OMG I CANT WAIT FOR THE CONTENT THAT WILL BE INVOLVED WITH HIM ON THE SHOWS!!!
Hotel Transylvania,Wtf is a Rooster Tooth?
Hotel Transylvania,"Damn I thought this would have a lot more to do with bird teeth.

Who am I kidding I'm still excited."
Hotel Transylvania,"Okay I've never really ""got"" the other rooster teeth productions. Like outside of red vs blue.


This on the other hand I'm immediately pretty excited about. I'm sure the RT team is too. I'd imagine at least a few are fans "
Hotel Transylvania,"Holy shit. Didn’t expect to see Rooster Teeth on the front page today, or this! This is awesome!"
Hotel Transylvania,I love everything about this!
Hotel Transylvania,isn't rooster teeth that guy that did red vs blue? what's he been up to?
Hotel Transylvania,God I hope they hire professional VAs and a good director for those VAs. IDK what it is about RTs in house VAs but they are a clear step down from full on production. Even Michael is better in non RT VA work.
Hotel Transylvania,Never heard of Rooster Teeth 
Hotel Transylvania,What's a rooster teeth?
Hotel Transylvania,"Fun fact!

Rooster teeth co-founder, Bernie, was [in an episode](https://youtu.be/zrhidNRBfPo) of IASIP as an extra, a patron in their bar."
Hotel Transylvania,ITT: People are adamant to mention they like to watch Roosterteeth
Hotel Transylvania,*The gang adopts a baby*
Hotel Transylvania,If it involves Dr. Dolph Lundgren smelling crime and showing all of it then I'm game. 
Hotel Transylvania,Hay ooooo
Hotel Transylvania,I thought this headline was referring to Robb McElhenney as Rooster Teeth. I'm extremely disappointed to find out I was wrong.
Hotel Transylvania,"""It's *Dennis*, Dennis! You're eating the dog!"""
Hotel Transylvania,Eh?
Hotel Transylvania,That content is great and will bring good things
Hotel Transylvania,"Since it's called Spikeface and is about an iconic horror character, I'm guessing Pinhead?"
Hotel Transylvania,"Mac is the primary brains behind IASIP, so I’m sure he’d kill it with this show as well!"
Hotel Transylvania,Is it going to be in the 3D they use for RWBY? 
Hotel Transylvania,Whatever it is ... it’ll be badass
Hotel Transylvania,No shit
Hotel Transylvania,Ok I can't be the only one who thought that was McFarlane
BAKI,"I caught up with the Netflix Baki anime early this year, absolutely fell in love with it, then was devastated to see ""The End"" at the end of season 3. Glad to see there's more, and that it picks up right where the last show left off."
BAKI,Cooming
BAKI, for example: https://i.imgur.com/D14bbio.jpg
BAKI,"As much as I love fighting anime, I really cannot get behind that art style. Most of the people in this trailer look like Resident Evil villains halfway through their t-virus transformation."
BAKI,"First Sailor Moon, Dragonball, and Saint Seiya (and to an extent Tommorow's Joe) now Baki the Grappler , wonder what other old series will get a remake/continuation. Fingers crossed for Fruits Basket."
BAKI,Fruits baskets is getting a reboot.
BAKI,"They released this in Japan in August on netflix and the quality is all over the place.  One episode is amazing and then the next is almost like they stopped paying the animators.

I dont know if the delay in release is due to dubbing or they wanted to finish the series before releasing it on us netflix"
BAKI,[Are...are you Santa Clause?] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yImLCDyxZjM) 
BAKI,Sad to hear. 
BAKI,"It's still entertaining like the original baki anime but I was hoping they would have been more consistant with the animation.

"
BAKI,"Completely agree, could you imagine the fights with propper animation...
Still good if you like Baki for the craziness
"
BAKI,If madhouse made it with there quality fight scenes it would have been crazy.  Hell even if trigger studios made it I could see some kill la kill level fight animation and there animation style would work with the world of baki.
BAKI,"Hopefully they get more time, budget and texture artists"
BAKI,"Now if they can stop with the shitty CGI I’ll watch it

Edit: I grew up watching cowboy bebop, akira, and trigun. I’m a bit biased."
BAKI,dorohedoro s2 pls!
BAKI,Now make a proper BERSERK please
BAKI,Buy Claymore rights plz
BAKI,"More Castlevania and final space plz. FS isnt classic anime but wow, its incredibly good."
BAKI,Netflix animes look weird to me. I can't seem to finish a season of any of them.
BAKI,"Id wish they just struck the deals with some famous writers and do animated adaptations of their series. I mean, Brandon Sanderson's Stormlight Archive or Erikson's Malazan are perfect materials for animated tv series. It would be way cheaper than live action and allow for better storytelling than 2hour movies."
BAKI,KENGAN ASHURA S3 AHHHH PLEASE
BAKI,"I'm too late and no one's gonna see this, but guys, the majority of the anime you're listing isn't made by Netflix. They label them ""Netflix Original"" because they have the sole translation and streaming rights. Knights of Sidonia, Seven Deadly Sins, Dorohedoro, Beastars, Kengan Ashura, none of it is made by Netflix. They don't fund them either.

Meaning asking netflix to continue any anime is useless."
BAKI,It would be great if we get  love death  robot  Part  2
BAKI,"More Love, Death and Robots. That was a massively creative series that was just fantastic."
BAKI,">Upcoming in 2021 and beyond are Spriggan (David Production), Vampire In The Garden, (WIT STUDIO – a group company under Production I.G), and Super Crooks (Bones)."
BAKI,More baki
BAKI,More Baki and Kengan
BAKI,Berserk please. A true adaptation.
BAKI,"Please don't be 3d animation, please don't be 3d animation, PLEASE don't be 3d animation"
BAKI,[removed]
BAKI,"I watched devil man cry baby and kakegurui on netflix and was blown away by both. I'm down with some more anime.

Seven deadly sins seems to be more popular than either of those shows though, which I find odd since it's a fairly standard escalating power levels shonen type anime."
BAKI,No shitty 3D animation please. Go back to 2D anime like Castlevania and/or Violet Evergarden. Shit like Berserk is disappointing when hampered by shitty block-looking animation bullshit
BAKI,"Looking at the list they've contracted,

MAPPA are the people behind God of Highschool & Jujutsu Kaisen - these 2 recent shows have had amazing animation. Fluid fights and just downright amazing angle control. They're also in charge of the final AOT season, so Mappa is definitely great.

As for the 2021 list, Bones (My Hero Academia) and WIT Studio (Attack on Titan s1,2,3 and The Great Pretender) are also high quality studios.

Netflix has great studios under their contract. It's up to them to give enough time, space and money in order to succeed."
BAKI,Hope that means they continue making Knights of Sidonia!
BAKI,"Great, so they can make 2 seasons then abandon them all on cliffhanger endings? Hard pass on Netflix OC until they commit to actually following through."
BAKI,Great Pretender slapped
BAKI,Can't wait to see what Science SARU do next.
BAKI,Been waiting for season 2 of Attack on Titan for 5yrs
BAKI,"More *Ajin,* please.

But also, I applaud this fervently. I grew up between old-school My Little Pony and Toonami. There’s not much I enjoy on TV besides unreality and animated stuff tends to be right up my alley. I’ll resub if this goes through for sure."
BAKI,"They already have so much Anime stuff. I started watching some crazy show about a guy who's head was turned into a Crocodile head.. the world is full of sorcerers and he has to put their heads in his mouth so the man in his mouth can tell Crocodile man if that was the sorcerer who turned his head into a crocodile... On the 5th episode now and I have no idea what the hell is going on, completely lost track of the plot after around 15 minutes. Its beautiful animated though

&#x200B;

Edit: Also I realise everyone hates the 3 part godzilla Anime, but I freaking loved it. It was amazing, especially episode 2"
BAKI,"Scrap the live-action, hire the original creators, and make more Avatar!"
BAKI,"Was just thinking yesterday about [Eden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i8Ds2nVVXE) and the fact that it's still not out, wonder what happened to it..."
BAKI,"Anime content: good

Anime live action: hell no"
BAKI,All I want is another season of Love Death + Robots
BAKI,Needs more JoJo
BAKI,"I haven't seen anyone mention The Promised Neverland.  I'm not huge into anime, I just kind of fell into this series, but I was completely hooked!"
BAKI,Would be cool if they took over for new seasons of OPM. The manga looks so good and deserves the same attention to detail on the anime.
BAKI,"I just wish they would stop with the 3d style bullshit. Im sure some people like it but I think it just looks terrible. Its a shame cause I'm sure a lot of the shows have good content but the 3d style dosent do it fo me. I know a lot of my friends feel the same way about it too.

I suppose it could be the studios and not Netflix themselves doing it, but idk"
BAKI,"Cool. Not my thing, but nice for those who like it."
BAKI,More trash for the trash gods!
BAKI,Yawn
BAKI,"I’m always saying what a lack of anime there is...
/s"
BAKI,Castlevania season 4
BAKI,"More ""Love, Death and Robots"" type shows.  I love the thematic ties of multiple animations styles, a lot."
BAKI,Finish 7 Deadly Sins and Castlevania pls.
BAKI,please... no more 3d animation...
BAKI,"This is the cycle repeating itself again and helping usher in new fans the same way old fans were made.

how many of us old guard anime fans found out abut anime by switching channels and landing on something called dragonball z,sailor moon,pokemon etc?

And how many new ones are going to be made by looking for something  to stream and stumbling across something that starts the love affair.  


The old stuff had SO many issues also yet i will always have a soft spot in my heart for the horribly censored dragonball z.  The flaws didnt stop me it just made me want to find something better."
BAKI,"Now, if only they'd only realize that deciding to release the shows episodically in Japan vs all-at-once in the rest of the world leads to more piracy, things would be better.

Seriously, Everyone else realized that a majority of anime fans want to watch the content as soon as it's available to be watched and started simulcasting anime as it aired in Japan as a means to fight piracy.  Deciding to withhold the content in select markets is a huge step backwards and only fuels piracy.  It's just proof that Netflix does not understand what the anime community wants, and only garners stronger distaste towards them with every studio they sign exclusivity deals with.

Imagine hearing about an amazing new anime coming next week that has you pumping with excitement.  The first episode airs in Japan, nothing appears on Netflix.  The next episode airs, still nothing on  Netflix.  By the third episode, you are tired of waiting and find an illegal stream elsewhere to watch it.  It's frustrating that Netflix doesn't understand that what they're doing hurts their image in the anime community."
BAKI,Netflix please stop I can’t handle another butchered anime you’ve already done too many shows the dirty
BAKI,Netflix have identified its weak among the weabo demographic
BAKI,Bro just give me more altered carbon resleeved movies.
BAKI,"Just let me filter it out by default please. No problem with people wanting to watch what they want, I just want control over what is suggested to me."
BAKI,"Just make a full series about some of the better anime shorts on “Love Death + Robots.” 

First episode about the bioengineered, human piloted monster arenas got me hooked and I need more. “Sonnie’s Revenge” was the name of that short, for anyone curious.

Not to say there weren’t other really good shorts, each one had its own little world that could be fleshed out, I just love the adult cyberpunk pokemon world."
BAKI,I'm still waiting for their Pacific Rim anime and Blade Runner: Black Lotus. It's been years since any significant update.
BAKI,Still waiting on my S3 of Kengan Ashura!!
BAKI,That Godzilla anime series was awesome
BAKI,"They need to team up with crunchyroll and get in on that action. I'm talking Dr. Stone, Re:Zero, My Hero Academia. All sorts of good stuff."
BAKI,Don’t be shy stop doing CGI and animate Berserk
BAKI,Now *please finish Knights of Sydonia*
BAKI,"Oh great, more netflix stuff that will end on a cliffhanger and get cancelled, can't wait"
BAKI,Finish spice and Wolf plz
BAKI,I haven’t watched the last season of 7 deadly sins yet because I assume it doesn’t end yet and I’m not sure if they are continuing it.  Hopefully.
BAKI,"More hand-drawn and less CG, please."
BAKI,What animes are actually good in netflix?
BAKI,"Well considering manga made over 3 billion in digital and physical copy sales, compared to comics which made 1.85 billion in sales. I'd say its a safe bet."
BAKI,Still no hentai sadly.
BAKI,Please for the love of twinkies NO MORE 3D ANIME!
BAKI,"If they can find more shows on the level of Great Pretender, if be down. The final arc might have been a train wreck, but the production was on point."
BAKI,I hate the CGI bullshit they make. Awful
BAKI,"If it’s with that TERRIBLE shitty CGI, hard pass!"
BAKI,No more of this ugly 3D shit
BAKI,Onepiece needs more love in the west
BAKI,"Hot take, 3D anime isn’t worth watching."
BAKI,"I am happier when Netflix works directly with producers instead of weird licensing where you have no idea what their plans are long term. That said, how Netflix approaches anime and Japan are very different. As before, I sadly expect very little to change but I hope at least one decent property comes of it."
BAKI,Just... no more 3D please
BAKI,Just buy Crunchyroll
BAKI,Always nice to add more kids content.
BAKI,Looks like I'm cancelling Netflix then.  /r/animewasamistake
BAKI,The Great Pretender needs another season - here's hoping!
BAKI,Or how bout just get shows we already like like how Netflix was supposed to be...
BAKI,"I thought Anime was drawn, not the 3d 15fps garbage the put out."
BAKI,[deleted]
BAKI,Some real hand-drawn anime would be nice
BAKI,"I just wish they stopped with the 2 fps action scenes. 
Not even Castlevania was safe from them."
BAKI,"I haven’t watched much recently, but I really loved that my favorite old school 90s and 2000s anime were one off series that told a complete self contained story within 25 episodes, sometimes 50 if it was two seasons. They should take advantage of the Netflix model of short running series and just tell complete stories rather than drag storylines and then inevitably cancel them before they’re finished."
BAKI,Can they just add Shippuden please
BAKI,What happened to the Castlevania team tackling Devil may cry?
BAKI,Don’t fuck it up like you did Berserk
BAKI,Solo leveling please please please
BAKI,Netflix needs to quit fucking around and pick up The Venture Brothers.
Life Sentence,iZombie <3
Life Sentence,Surprised and extremely happy that iZombie got renewed.
Life Sentence,'Black Lightning' likely to premiere midseason rather than in the fall.
Life Sentence,"I hate zombie genres in general especially TWD but iZombie I love, especially a different aspect of a zombie such as taking the person's personality of the brain you ate, btw respect to the actress who play different personalities every episodes. "
Life Sentence,"iZombie is probably my favorite comic book tv show right now so I'm so glad it's getting another season. I think this will make it the longest running Rob Thomas show. 

Now I only need ABC to renew my other favorite comic book show in Agents of SHIELD...."
Life Sentence,"Hope Black Lightning performs well, I'm excited to see it in live action! "
Life Sentence,"I still miss The Tomorrow People. wish it had a better story direction, we would be on season 4 by now. "
Life Sentence,The struggle to watch every DC show except for Gotham continues.
Life Sentence,iZombie and Riverdale were all that I cared about to get renewed.Im very pleased 
Life Sentence,surprised at the originals  but where is the CW putting all these shows? are most series getting smaller episode orders?
Life Sentence,Will Black Lightning be part of the arrowverse?
Life Sentence,Is that Vince's dad from *Friday Night Lights*?  I loved that scene where he beats up the gangster guy that Vince owed money to.  The watered down hood talk for network TV kills me.
Life Sentence,"Happy with iZombie but kinda wish The Originals was over so that the remaining cast can move onto more exciting projects especially with the show runner bailing.I really don't want Julie Plec on it even though i didn't mind Containment.

BL and Life Sentence should be okay.I wonder if Life sentence can capture the Jane the Virgin or Crazy Ex-Girlfriend magic or be a No Tomorrow like Dud.

Either seems like they have a ton of shows."
Life Sentence,I hope this doesn't mean Searchers is dead
Life Sentence,"Pretty psyched about iZombie, first time Rob Thomas has hit season 4! Was worried I was going to have to kickstarter a movie in 10 years"
Life Sentence,"I do *kinda* wish they changed the name. Black Lightning comes from that awkward era in comics where way too many black characters were identified by having ""Black"" in their name: Black Panther, Black Manta, Black Racer, Black Spider, Black Mariah..."
Life Sentence,CW.... Sthap making superhero shows. I can barely keep up as it is with the current shows as is
Life Sentence,"Static Shock is the best show about an Aferican American man with electric powers, so always will be!"
Life Sentence,"Wow im shocked TO got renewed, there ratings were dipping below 1million."
Life Sentence,"The CW is increasingly becoming the Comic Book Show channel. They need to diversify from supernatural, paranormal, superhero schtick for a while. "
Life Sentence,Fuck. Why did they renew 'The Originals'? Ugh. I'm still pissed that they cancelled 'Frequency' and 'No Tomorrow'. Excited for 'Black Lightning'.
Life Sentence,I am....aaaaaaalready dead. 
Life Sentence,"It's doing pretty well on Netflix outside of the US (which at least in my country uploads it around 24 hours after it airs in the US) from what I read elsewhere so I imagine that has a lot to do with it. Same thing happened with my crazy ex girlfriend as well. 

I get the impression CW is finally seeing the much bigger picture beyond viewing figures from ""as it airs"". "
Life Sentence,"CW has a trend that they never cancel a series that has gotten a second season before the series has reached 70+ episodes. I could only find two series since 2010 that has been cancelled with less. So not really surprised, still happy."
Life Sentence,"I watch it, I like it...But it doesn't come close to the standard Rob Thomas set with Veronica Mars. I wish that had gotten four season :("
Life Sentence,I thought that was confirmed or was that just speculation?
Life Sentence,"respect to her for being a former power ranger as well! not an original, but a good season of the show nonetheless"
Life Sentence,I feel like her own personality suffers for it though. She doesn't have flaws.
Life Sentence,"If you liked that you would like the netflix show Santa Monica diet. Kinda like izombie, but way funnier and a little less dramatic."
Life Sentence,"Never read the comic started watching because my niece likes Zombies and female leads. 

She stopped watching after episode 8 in season 1 yet I'm hooked and look forward to it every week. It's really an undervalued show."
Life Sentence,"I know it's a comic book TV show, but isn't it VERY loosely based on the comic? "
Life Sentence,"In terms of comic book media I'm politically neutral, but I've often  had a soft spot for DC in the past. But as much as I'm loving Arrow this season, Agents of SHIELD this season has been absolutely amazing. And it's also managed to make the 20+ season thing work by dividing it into three mini-seasons that just happen to be linked."
Life Sentence,"> I think this will make it the longest running Rob Thomas show.

In terms of seasons it will be, but VM has 64 episodes, iZombie has 35 and will probably be another 13 episode season, so 58 by next year. Still psyched tho!"
Life Sentence,"Depends how your classing longest running. Veronica Mars will still have more episode even by the end of season 4. 
"
Life Sentence,"If I start watching AoS tomorrow I hope season 5 is available on Netflix soon. I know CW has it so the shows go up the week of the finale, hopefully Disney is similar. I have 3 weeks off school so hopefully I can watch it all!"
Life Sentence,"And it has such great Unique Selling Points. A black superhero. A coming out of retirement tale.

A father of two."
Life Sentence,It had some potential but I think it's one good example where being on the CW really decreased any chance it had of going past a season. 
Life Sentence,"I am exact same. Thankfully, Flash began same year it ended, but MAN. It was as good as Flash, telling you.

I miss it."
Life Sentence,Gotham's been pretty great.
Life Sentence,Dude. Gotham is pretty great man. He'll this season has been better than a lot of DCW shows.
Life Sentence,"Why not watch Gotham? So far this season of Gotham has been more comic-booky and more consistently good than all of Legends and Supergirl, the last three years of Arrow, and season 3 of The Flash. 
If it's seriously about not liking the early episodes, I suggest just fast-forwarding through all of Fish Mooney's scenes. You won't miss much."
Life Sentence,Do you watch Preacher and Lucifer?
Life Sentence,"Everything but Flash, Arrow, Supernatural, and Supergirl will likely be getting 13-16 episodes."
Life Sentence,There'll probably be a number of <20 episode orders like this year.
Life Sentence,"We don't know, right now.

I'd say so. Question is - Earth 1, Earth 38 (Supergirl), Earth 2 (Jesse Quick), Earth 3 (Jay Garrick), or another?"
Life Sentence,I totally agree with The Originals. Seems like none of the cast wants anything to do with it anymore. I follow a few of the main cast members and they haven't promoted it once this entire season...like at all. 
Life Sentence,Still in the mix apparently so keep the hope alive.
Life Sentence,[The name wasn't his idea.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKbGnzmidsw)
Life Sentence,"They're actually going to discuss that in the show.  He's a older super hero, from a time when he was forced to be known as a black superhero, instead of just a superhero.  It's not a modern take on the character, rather, it's remembering what US culture was like when he was first introduced.  "
Life Sentence,African-American Lightning just doesn't have the same ring to it
Life Sentence,Is Black Racer really black?
Life Sentence,"Ah...it's only 5...for now *hahahahaha!!!*

But, yeah, between this, their 3 CW Seed shows - The Ray, Vixen and Constantine - and the other 4, you wonder how we'd be able to watch much else."
Life Sentence,"SOME good show. Always room for more, brother."
Life Sentence,Was Frequency any good? I kept seeing promos for it but didn't even realize it was out(I guess nobody else did either if it's cancelled).
Life Sentence,"Uh hah. Aww awww!!!

I am... allllllllll-ready DEAAAAAD!!!"
Life Sentence,Their CW app is a good step towards the big picture as you don't need a tv provider login to watch the shows. 
Life Sentence,[deleted]
Life Sentence,I've really enjoyed izombie. I think the name scares away people though.
Life Sentence,I'm just happy it finally got a Netflix release outside of the US so I could actually contribute to viewership in some way. I love the show but there wasn't any legal way to watch it in the UK till this season.
Life Sentence,"The CW itself doesn't care about the bigger picture as they don't directly benefit from anything but the ad revenue a show drives in the US. The only benefit international has any benefit is if the demand is high enough to push up international prices which allow some the studio to lower the licence fee they charge the CW. 

And I'm not sure how well iZombie is really doing on that front, Netflix has those rights because WB struggled to get any takers in the first place which suggests they are pretty cheap rights"
Life Sentence,"> CW is finally seeing the much bigger picture beyond viewing figures from ""as it airs"".

The CW already was. They were one of the only networks to have already been considering both later viewing as well as online viewership when it came to renewing shows. That's how so many of its shows aside from Supernatural and the Arrowverse shows are still on the air."
Life Sentence,"I was under the impression that the CW's been doing that for a while now, that's why their tag was ""TV to talk about,"" they renewed based on how much hype was generated around the show."
Life Sentence,I wish this was the policy back when Veronica Mars was airing ;_;
Life Sentence,That's because WB/CBS studios deal with Netflix comes with a massive penalty if shows end without both a proper ending so for WB or CBS Studios it makes sense often to lower the licence fee charged to CW than risk the penalty from Netflix 
Life Sentence,At least there's the Veronica movie and a CW Seed series continuing it.
Life Sentence,It's not confirmed but considered likely by the article's source. We'll know for sure at the CW's upfronts next week.
Life Sentence,"Oh my Zordan, she was a ranger, i just checked and she was in RPM and i stopped watchin PR after few eps of RPM, did not clock. i gotta check it out. "
Life Sentence,you think her own personality is vanilla? i do sense her own personality but then we get her eating brains every eps and does hard to filtered out her personality. Also i noticed every new personality she gets she learns something and inputs in to her own personality. 
Life Sentence,ohh thanks for the rec. ill check it out. 
Life Sentence,I think you meant Santa Clarita Diet
Life Sentence,Netflix kerosene trying to get me to watch it after every iZombie  episode 
Life Sentence,"Yeah, there is almost nothing common beyond the name and the protagonist being a zombie."
Life Sentence,"> make the 20+ season thing work 

fucking Flash man. These writers have no idea how to fill all this time up, and the show keeps going downhill because of it."
Life Sentence,On any other network it wouldn't have made it past a few episodes though.
Life Sentence,"I think it ended perfectly, wish I had more anyway."
Life Sentence,"If the show was nothing but Tabitha Galavan in her various outfits, I'd watch nothing else."
Life Sentence,I'd rank this season of Gotham above Supergirl S2 and Flash S3. 
Life Sentence,"I'd listen to you, if you hadn't mentioned Legends, one of the most fun, out there and weird shows."
Life Sentence,"I am begging you, please check out arrow season 5.  Probably the best season of any DC show ever. They did a complete 180 and it's awesome. Did I mention Deathstroke is back? "
Life Sentence,Yep.
Life Sentence,"But God knows the DC shows would benefit from a reduced episode order. The per-episode budget would be higher, anyway."
Life Sentence,"It bothers me that arrowverse considers itself earth 1 when its missing superman & batman. Well they have vaguely hinted at batman, but nothing more than that."
Life Sentence,"Searchers and Insatiable are the only 2 left whose fates are in the air, running preliminary schedule possibilities they realistically have room for one of them. Figure they will pick it over Insatiable, but I said the same thing in regards to Valor and Life Sentence."
Life Sentence,Yeah I remember him meeting Static in the comics (I think it was during a Crisis or something) and Static brings up how on the nose it is. Black Lightning responds that there weren't a lot of black superheroes when he started so he felt that he had to be representative by adding black to his name.
Life Sentence,Did they announce when they're releasing Constantine and The Ray? 
Life Sentence,Amen
Life Sentence,I enjoyed it.
Life Sentence,This is why i use it to watch the shows on their channel vs. Other means. They provided me a way to watch my show without signing up.
Life Sentence,I do miss it (and other CW shows) on Hulu because it was commercial free on Plus and could watch on my smart tv. 
Life Sentence,"That's how Netflix treat The Expanse in the UK. S2 is *still* not on Netflix but S1 is. 

I get it's not Netflix's​ fault, it's the network been stupid. But I 100% agree with you regarding piracy."
Life Sentence,"I got my Dad to watch the 1st ep, it grossed him out.

I kept watching and enjoyed it.

Got my friend to watch it, too, he liked it."
Life Sentence,"I thought it looked crap when I first saw the description I watched it anyway thinking it may be a so bad it's good type of thing. Glad I decided to give it a try.

I'm guessing it's based off a comic, given the cartoon to real life thing they have going on that makes no sense otherwise."
Life Sentence,"It's been in Netflix in the UK for a while, I was watching season 1 ages ago. Long before this new season started."
Life Sentence,I get that. But why 70+ episodes? Why not just make a short 6 episodes season that ties up all loose ends? Does the Netflix deal have a bonus for series that gets at least 70 episodes? There's obviously something that makes series more profitable that way.
Life Sentence,I didn't know that. Where was that information revealed?
Life Sentence,"If they hold back a bit they can introduce the character on one of the existing DC shows setting up Black Lightning. Probably easier than having him come running out of the door on his own and forcing a random inevitable team up later in the series (because no way it's going to be a stand alone show). 

Either way I'm looking forward to it."
Life Sentence,"Yeah it's probably going to be like legends where the first season is midseason, and if it gets a season 2, it'll go to the fall season. "
Life Sentence,"i thought RPM was one of the better seasons of power rangers. worth watching if you like the series in general. she was a pretty cool character, if i recall."
Life Sentence,She does seem better now than she did in s1. Maybe you're right.
Life Sentence,Whoops. Yes that.
Cooking on High,"The top review on Netflix says ""Can we have a show involving marijuana that doesn't pander to frat boys?""

The show's a pile of shit, I couldn't make it through 5 minutes."
Cooking on High,[deleted]
Cooking on High,"7 was my main gripe with the show. If you're highlighting cooking with cannabis one of the main judging criteria should be how high it gets you. The judge in the first episode already being stoned completely nullified that, making it less interesting. 

This show belongs on YouTube, not Netflix. "
Cooking on High,Holy shit it's like they intentionally make every wrong decision to make their show
Cooking on High,[deleted]
Cooking on High,"I thought, based on the title, that they had to cook everything on the highest heat.  Which would kinda be funny. "
Cooking on High,"I quit once I saw 15 minute episodes. For a competitive show I want 40 minutes with a couple challenges and then an elimination.  
  
Competitive Shows I Like:  
[RuPaul's Drag Race](https://trakt.tv/shows/rupaul-s-drag-race)  
[Ink Master](https://trakt.tv/shows/ink-master)  
[The Ultimate Fighter](https://trakt.tv/shows/the-ultimate-fighter)  
[The Great British Bake Off](https://trakt.tv/shows/the-great-british-bake-off)"
Cooking on High,"I smoked, took a seat on the couch, put this show on, and just cringed.

The cannabis industry is filled with shitty design and production. This show could be 1000x better if they called me to help. (Maybe) 

The host tried to hard to be cool


The part where they serve that rapper dude some fish and hes like ""I've never had fish"" I was like ""whaaaaaaaa""



Then they put up this girl that makes home made edibles against this guy who has been on the food network and owns his own restaurant. I know other shows do this but that poor girl was no match.


Tldr; im a stoner. I can tell it was made by stoners. This show sucks and just makes weed look bad lol"
Cooking on High,Bong appetit on Hulu is a billion times better 
Cooking on High,"You ever watch a shitty game show... *on weed*?

Also I cant find the full production team but I have a sinking feeling that whoever greenlit* Disjointed may be responsible for this.

*Greenlit should be a competition of who can write the best while high. "
Cooking on High,It's awful... give 'Nailed It!' or 'Queer Eye' a shot... they are much better Netflix reality shows.
Cooking on High,"Kinda related but if you're looking for an actually amazing cooking show with the same 15 min format,there's a show also on Netflix called ""please take care of my refrigerator"". It's from Korea so it's subtitled but all the chefs are Michelin stared and get 15 minutes to cook using ingredients from celebrities(usually kpop) refrigerator. It is legitimately one of my favorite shows of the year  "
Cooking on High,Cooking competition shows are me and my boyfriend's guilty pleasure. We tried watching this and we had the same thoughts before we stopped watching it. Obviously a show made to pander to potheads but it just came off as cringey and lazily thought out. Worst part is that the show could be good if they just tweaked the format/process a little and used judges that weren't fucking terrible.
Cooking on High,"Netflix doesn't understand cannabis culture. Yea, you have douchebags that use marijuana leaves for their avatar in Call of Duty, but otherwise it's not about the plant, but having fun while high. Most of us are turned off by the obvious pandering and that particular part of the community.

Here are 10 programs Netflix could make to make to appeal to the stoner demographic:

1. **The Bob Ross Painting Class** | Join a rotating cast of celebrities as they attempt to replicate some of Bob Ross' best works. Get some of Netflix's various animation studios and talents like the Castlevania guys to create random interstitials of happy trees and squirrels moving into their new freshly painted homes.

1. **Snoop Dog's Circle of Love** | Hire Snoop Dog (or another well traveled, like-minded celebrity host) to sit at a giant, round couch with regular people from all walks of life, asking crazy questions about what they do for living, what it's like to live where they come from, and their perspective on where life is going (while doing the old puff puff pass).

1. **A Lapse of Time** | One hour specials where they film time lapses of nature doing naturey things, or slow mo of crazy stuff looking cool, with chill beats playing in the background. ([Like this internet classic.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrKNlGAaRHY))

1. **Captain Power Reboot** | If you've never played the original Captain Power while stoned you've missed out on the peak of living. No one is going to buy the toys anymore, but you could make it work just as easily with a phone app. Bonus if Jon Hamm is Captain Power.

1. **Too Much Light Makes the Baby Go Blind (The TV Show!)** | This theatrical show was a long, long, long running Chicago staple where every Saturday a crew of actors performed 30 plays in 60 minutes, constantly writing out new ones to blend into the mix. They would hang all of the prompts from a string across the stage, then randomly walk up and grab one to start the next skit. Sometimes they were funny, sometimes sad, sometimes totally busted, but it was always a great time. Bring that back to compete with something like SNL. They changed the name to something else recently, but the crew is still around.

1. **Kristen's Bell's Panel Show** | Take the concept of QI, a panel show where a host walks guest comedians through a bunch of interesting facts, and put Kristen Bell in the center. This wins the internet.

1. **AniCrazy** | Take Netflix's huge catalog of anime, and also buy up a bunch of old terrible stuff, then start cutting scenes up into random, out of context clips. Remix them into a Robot Chicken style clip show that is a disparate mix of stuff that keeps you surprised and delighted at what will come next (see a theme here?).

1. **Cancel the End of the World** | Gather a bunch of heroes from canceled TV shows who never got their fair shake and animate them using their original voice actors. Put them all on a crew together. Have them save the world each episode from their old monsters of the week, ex-girlfriends, and tying up those loose plotlines. My suggestions would Firefly's Mal, Dark Angel's Max, Slider's Quinn Mallory, Brisco County Jr, and Veronica Mars (ok, 2 themes if Kristen Bell counts).

1. **Campaign (Animated)** | Take a group of improv actors and have them play a role-playing game, then animate it. I'm a fan of the guys at [Campaign/One Shot](http://oneshotpodcast.com/category/campaign/campaign-podcast/), but any of the good actual play podcasters hat emphasize storytelling over the mechanics would do. 

1. **Second City Live** | Ok, reality of the situation is that there are tons of great improv groups out there and Whose Line Anyway? has been beat to death, especially the format. But, improv shows are great to watch stoned and that's our target audience. You could easily pick up a whole new troupe from Second City (where SNL gets its best) and start a completely new show with a format that isn't as played out. Since the games themselves are classic iprov staples you could even carry a few over.

I know, that's a lot of options to get to an extremely simple point: stoners don't want to watch stuff about pot, we want to watch stuff while *on* pot. Until Netflix gets that they're missing the point with all their stabs into this particular audience.

Cooking on High,9. The Grateful Dead isn't as good as their fans think they are. 
Cooking on High,"If you thought marijuana ""culture"" was bad enough, just wait until you have 100% saturation of popularized mainstream marijuana culture."
Cooking on High,"Guys, I read every comment here first, and just had to see for myself... I made it until the guy mentioned the ""secret ingredient"", then leaned into the camera with his hand and whispered ""it's weed""



UGH"
Cooking on High,"Oh my god...I had to go turn netflix on after I read this. This has to be a satire, it's so fucking bad. Also, that's not a fucking grilled cheese, that's a melt. He makes me sick. And the black guy in the first episode sounds like he swallowed Bobcat Goldthwait and Bobcat was making attempts to escape."
Cooking on High,I doobie leaf you are right 
Cooking on High,"I watched one episode (while high) and it was okay in hindsight, but entertaining while stoned. Looking back at it, I wish there was more cooking in it. Too much talking."
Cooking on High,"I enjoyed if for what it was. I wish the episodes were longer so that we could see more of the actual cooking. I'm also fine with the judges not being from food backgrounds because they can still pick which dish they like more. 

I actually want them to make more episodes because I watched all 12 pretty quick since they are only like 15 minutes each. "
Cooking on High,Is point 2 talking about Wax? He actually is a great rapper but I imagine him being pretty stupid. 
Cooking on High,This show reminded me of a bad MTV show from the 90's/00's. But is was such a train wreck I couldn't help but not watch. Then I realized I was slightly entertained as it made me feel a little nostalgic. 
Cooking on High,"Just watching the preview was cringe enough. They act like smoking weed is still some silly taboo thing for high schoolers. I don't know, just rubbed me the wrong way. "
Cooking on High,Based on the premise it's kinda redundant to mention that it's filled with cringe.
Cooking on High,"Its so bad.   If the whole point is weed and the judges are stoners, then why the fuck are they bringing in food.

Just have a show where growers bring in their best strains of flowers, wax, shatter etc and have the stoner judges smoke the weed and rate that.

Its insulting to have professional chefs come in and have their food tasted by idiots that can cook cereal or have never tried fish. "
Cooking on High,now i just want to watch a show that hits on all the points you just mentioned! 
Cooking on High,"This made me giggle. Waaay 
too much thought and resentment in this post. "
Cooking on High,I mean it sounds like a show about cooking something quickly for everyday random people. So unless you're looking for a serious competition it seems fine. But I haven't seen it.
Cooking on High,"> Both of the judges are clearly stoned before tasting the dishes. How are they supposed to tell how potent the food is? They do take a break at some point to let the weed digest, but since both chefs are using the same canna-butter, there is no way to tell them apart.

Judge: The fuck you on about?  Oh yeah, the competition.  Nah I just came here to get high and eat."
Cooking on High,The biggest production expense on this show was the $150 they spent on weed.
Cooking on High,"I got through about 15 minutes of this shit show.  Holy crap, Wtf with the judges? This show looks like it's shot by a high school AV club. Pass... "
Cooking on High,I went and watched the first episode just now....fucking terrible. 
Cooking on High,"Netflix, can we just stop with the weed shows? Your trying to hard, go back to Adam Sandler movies and shitty Rom-Coms."
Cooking on High,"Dead thread, but holy shit was that show bad. The cringe was at an all time high. The ""rapper"" freestyling made my soul hurt. He was so bad that he himself knew he shouldn't continue and asked the host to stop him. There was no competition aspects, the dialog was straight out of a 20 year olds birthday party, and the concept itself is horrible. Weed cuisine is itself a fad. The whole point of it is to get high while not tasting the weed. Theres nothing to judge besides the food. You cant judge your high, the chefs cant make you higher when they are using the same ingredients, theres no weed ""palette"" cleanser to make the judge not high anymore. There is just a billion things wrong with it. You hit the nail on the head with some of them but there is so many more i could write a lengthy essay on it. Fuck that show. Right in the butt."
Cooking on High,They focused too much on fetishizing marijuana instead of it being a comprehensive and educational show. I know that showing us how to cook with weed is a little to edgy for the current social climate but at least show me the normal cooking side of it. 
Cooking on High,"I love cooking. I love weed. I love cooking high, but I fucking HATE weed shows and weed culture."
Cooking on High,"The doucheboy ""rapper"" guy irritated me straight out of the gate.  The contestants were nice enough, but my interest was lost on no actual thought put into the cooking.Two thumbs down Netflix..."
Cooking on High,"DO YOU LIKE FOOD?!? DO YOU LIKE WEED?! YOU'VE COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE!!!!!111!!!eleven!!!

Every time I load up my Netflix for the past couple days. 

Fuck you netflix, no, bad, stahp.

Cooking on High,"Watched one episode and wanted to fucking throw my TV out the window.

What the fuck is this trash?"
Cooking on High,"Netflix is really starting to shit the bed. Between this shit, Bill Nyes pathetic show, Disjointed, they really put out some terrible content, if any network would even come close the backlash would be so much harsher "
Cooking on High,">Cooking on High is a new Netflix show is about two chefs preparing the best dish with marijuana in it. 

Should've gotten Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg on board. "
Cooking on High,"It makes sense that they had to cancel Disjointed, for modern masterpieces like this...."
Cooking on High,I am always so blown away how I can like weed but hate weed culture. 
Cooking on High,"When will the industry learn that simply adding ""but with weed"" to the end of an idea will make said idea fail horribly 9/10?

""Hey lets do Chopped...with WEED!""

""Hey lets do The Office...with WEED!""

""Hey lets do Hey Arnold!...with WEED!""

They're all fucking terrible excuses at humor and practically every single character on these shows are your typical ""pothead"" from 80s DARE ads.  "
Cooking on High,"Netflix is fast turning into the Discovery Channel with the amount of dross programming they are introducing lately to bulk up their catalogue. 

""How can we keep the cord-cutters happy?  Lets turn into the very beast they abandoned..."""
Cooking on High,"If you're looking for a good semi-alternative, Super Deluxe has a good edibles show on YouTube."
Cooking on High,We didn't need another trash cooking show anyway
Cooking on High,"I agree, it sucked. "
Cooking on High,"30 minute cooking competition shows feel rushed, I can't imagine a 15 minute cooking show even having the potential to be worth watching."
Cooking on High,The weed cooking show on Vice is much better. 
Cooking on High,Netflix's quality is declining almost directly inverse to the amount their stock price goes up. 
Cooking on High,"Even potheads don't want this show. I'm guessing Netflix does 0 market research, just picks up on trending buzzwords. 

""MARIJUANA AND COOKING SHOWS ARE HUGE MARKETS, LET'S COMBINE THEM!!""

No. Stop. "
Cooking on High,"Like someone said before, it should be on youtube not netflix, the host and judges are horrid, there shouldn't even be a timer. Whats the point?

The Chef's are rushed for what? So they get high sooner? 

The food is rated not the high? 

Makes zero sense. "
Cooking on High,The only part I like was the bud connoisseur Ngaio Bealum. But that's because I liked his comedy to begin with. The rest of the show just seemed awkward and cringey.
Cooking on High,My fiancee put this on the other day.  We watched the intro with the host and then abruptly changed it to an episode of Chef's Table we've already seen twice.  That guy was insufferable.
Cooking on High,"Lol called it. I saw the trailer and went ooof, not even going to bother wasting time. "
Cooking on High,i've never heard of this but from your description i will NOT be watching. it sounds idiotic both in concept and execution.
Cooking on High,"I couldn’t agree more on the cringe, like... literally painful. My gf and I couldn’t stop watching because it was so bad and because it just keeps getting worse and worse "
Cooking on High,"Not a competition show but bong appetit on viceland is a decent weed cooking show , can get a tiny repetitive after a little bit but still fun and informative "
Cooking on High,"Had to watch this show with friends and I completely agree. I was actually excited to see what people can and will make with the oil/butter. They barely explain any of it and the food is rarely exciting. Here's a burger that totally looks like something you'd get out of a microwave from your neighborhood shitty 'bar and grill'.

Oh...and the one guy who just popped an entire nug of weed into his mouth, chewed, and swallowed it pissed me off so much. 1) you can't even get high off that and 2) when he said ""I do what I want"" I nearly chucked my controller. "
Cooking on High,"Yeah, I love cooking shows but I can't watch it."
Cooking on High,"Wait wait wait, they eat one dish after another and then try to claim which one was more POTENT?  They rate them on potency?  That's ridiculous, with distillate you could easily make something strong as hell with nearly no effort and zero weed taste.  I could put *grams* of thc into a dish if I'm using distillate and you might not even notice it.  

For those who want a weed cooking show that isn't a competition and has some episodes that are actually pretty good, bong appetit is excellent. It's actually about making flavorful dishes utilizing weed, it's not about trying to make the most potent foods or whatever.

I mean shit, I make bite size 150mg fruity pebbles bars regularly, it's not hard to make things potent "
Cooking on High,"I think almost the opposite. It's a show that's supposed to be about weed, and it needs to dive into that. The food should be more ""munchie"" type food. They should be having greasy fatty food and snacks, not classic french dishes and shit. All the guests are stoners, who's meals probably usually consist of pizza and burgers. Yet almost every meal prepared is some fancy vegetarian dish that they have never had 80&#37; of the ingredients of.

To be honest though, I feel like this is Netflix seeing if they can delve into YouTube type video series. Everything about it screamed YouTube show, not Reality Show  


TLDR; It's shitty because it tried to find a balance between reality show/youtube show/weed show. But not competitive enough to be a reality show, and not funny/munchy enough to be a weed show."
Cooking on High,I felt bad for the cooks making awesome food so some kid off the street can say it reminds him of his mom
Cooking on High,"It's so, so bad.  Agree with everything you say.  There's plenty of room for a great cannabis cooking show, and so much potential for it.  They just threw together this shitty show to fill the niche, rather than actually take the time to do the subject any justice.  The judges are terrible, we learn nothing about cooking with cannabis, and they just gloss over everything."
Cooking on High,"Now an actually decent show involving cooking and weed is Bong Appétit on Viceland.  Not a competition, but definitely fun to watch. "
Cooking on High,"Instead, I recommend Brothers Green Eats channel on YouTube.  I found them while jokingly looking up Taco Bell and found that they attempted to recreate their entire menu but better.   It's not a cooking competition but in their earlier videos you could tell they were either super chill or really high.    They have great cooking advice and easy to make dishes."
Cooking on High,I told my friend to guess what the twist was based on the title and he guessed either it's all church potluck food or cooking with weed...there that's the most thought I put into this show.
Cooking on High,"As Someone who smokes weed everyday

Why the fuck do we need shows centered around smoking weed?
It's a fucken play you smoke to get high is not a personality out life style.

It's like a cringey teenager

Also all of their recent original content has sucked. Star Trek is the only thing that keeps me subscribed"
Cooking on High,"Thank you for calling Netflix, you're greenlighted."
Cooking on High,CRINGE!  I’ve always wondered who/what chooses these shows for Netflix. Is it the same algorithm that comes up with these hot garbage suggestions for me to view?
Cooking on High,I watched one episode last night and it was one of the worst things I’ve ever seen 
Cooking on High,Ive given up on netflix shows entirely. 
Cooking on High,"I could be wrong, but I remember hearing the host say something like, ""Over the next 30 minutes, two cooks, blah blah"". I think the original idea was to do 30 min. eps but then the higher ups so saw early cuts and went ""hmmm, better cut this in half."" Honestly a good decision because 30 minutes of these dweebs wouldn't be watchable at all. "
Cooking on High,"Thanks, I thought my response to the first episode was further evidence that I was getting too old. It is a great show idea, but it really needs to be re-worked. I hope someone is trying to come out with an improved version. It would be must-see TV for me and I have to believe a large number of other people. 

I think it would be a great way to have dinner and drinks with friends.

"
Cooking on High,"Hahaha... too funny you say that because I just got done watching 4 episodes.  I think it's absolutely horrible.  The people they choose to eat the food the chefs cook are hood rat junkies! I dig the chefs simply because they are lagit.  The ""judges"" are dumb ass stoners.  I can't watch anymore.. they really need to rethink their format. 
"
Cooking on High,Ngaio Bealum is basically Alton White
Cooking on High,"Check out Bong Appétit on Viceland. It’s not a competitive cooking show, but it’s entertaining and can be informative if you’re looking to learn a little. The food also looks fucking amazing!"
Cooking on High,"

Bong-Appetit."
Cooking on High,"I agree 100% OP. I let it go on autoplay to crochet to background noise and I had so many times I cringed from what was going on, I messed up my work. This show could have reached out to many on the fence about weed usage and this did not help any stereotypes be diminished or convince people to the side of legalizing it. Bad part on Netflix and any other weed supporter. "
Cooking on High,They're all stupid. Don't be a connoisseur of shit. It makes you look stupid.
Cooking on High,"I struggled through to the ""celebrity rapper"" ""rapping"" about 4 minutes."
Cooking on High,You should hook up with Coolio. He already did a web based cooking show and has his own cook book. If you got him cooking with weed I would watch that show. 
Cooking on High,"What sucks is that although the premise was obviously tacky, it could have been pulled off really well as a relaxed and fun cooking show. Instead, just like every other weed based show, it does nothing but pander to what people believe weed to be like, and the rest of it is lame too."
Cooking on High,"The people on the show aren’t even famous, this feels like some glorified YouTube experiences on Netflix some how."
Cooking on High,"Marijuana is a recreational drug, not a culinary item. No dish would be enhanced by its use. The whole concept is stupid."
Cooking on High,Have you ever been on a cooking show man? Have you even been in a cooking show while high?
Cooking on High,"Meanwhile VICE and YouTube lead the way in stoner foodie programming, there is so much content to draw inspiration from and it's not like stoners are that hard to impress.

I turned that show off in the 1st episode when when the surfer bum started ""rapping"""
Cooking on High,Julia Child is rolling in her grave
Cooking on High,Reddit gold is best used to buy hookers and blow!
Cooking on High,"The dude used for the ""cover"" pic for the show made me not watch. I love bud. I don't eat it but I have a fondness. I know it can make your eyes heavy and glassy and red. But don't make it the focus of your best advertisement. Don't know why but it turned me away. I say this as I type with heavy, glassy, red eyes.  It just screams ""WOW, LOOK! WEED! WATCH!"", but not in a good way. Find a good pic of that stoned gentleman."
Cooking on High,Forget the weed show...and the blackjack...and...screw the whole thing- Bender
Cooking on High,I guess it is true that Netflix will checkmark any production.
Cooking on High,Netflix had a real opportunity to have an actual cooking show about Cannabis. Not a shitty cooking competition. I want a cooking show like Alton Brown's showing the science behind it and cooking good eats. 
Cooking on High,"Never watched it. Logged into Netflix just so I could downvote it, based on that epic description alone."
Cooking on High,lmao that sounds horrible I’m gonna go watch it
Cooking on High,All cooking competitions are terrible.
Cooking on High,"In fact, forget the show. And the blackjack."
Cooking on High,Ya I was interested and thought the premise would be funny but its a horrible and cringy show. Remove the weed aspect and its still a terrible cooking show. 
Full House,Curious to know who’s going to pay that much for that house. Doesn’t seem worth it?
Full House,housing prices in california are crazy
Full House,">built in 1783

Yeah, no."
Full House,Whatever happened to predictability?
Full House,"> It last sold on October 2, 2020 for $5.4 million, according to its Zillow page. 

And they're trying to flog it for 37 million? HOW RUDE!"
Full House,3 heterosexual men raising 3 girls in the most childless city
Full House,I still remember the story of the person that owns the Breaking Bad house furious because people are constantly taking pictures or throwing pizzas on her roof.  I still don't understand why she wouldn't just lean into it.  Sell pictures for $10 and have a plastic pizza they could throw for $15.
Full House,And having strangers constantly gawking at your home and taking pictures every day? No thanks lol.
Full House,The can list it for whatever they want.  Want to see what it actually sells for.
Full House,The tourist crowding outside and addicts shitting on your steps comes free!
Full House,"I don't think it being in one of the most expensive cities to live in and being featured in the credits of a well known family show, all the homeless,all the crime, & the constant distraction of tourists is worth the 30,480,100 mark up"
Full House,"That's just dumb to sell the house. Turn the insides like it looked like on the show, make it a tourist attraction, use the profits for upkeep."
Full House,There’s a reason that houses in these cities are s overpriced: they’ll sell
Full House,"37 million?! Jesus. If I had 37 million, I wouldn't buy that."
Full House,HGTV might buy it and do another one of those renovation specials where they make the inside look like it did on the TV show. I doubt they’d get the Olsen twins to make an appearance tho.
Full House,It is if it comes with Bob Saget's ghost.
Full House,Even in San Francisco I feel like this would be “worth” like 4 million…they are not even in the right ballpark. Having had the exterior featured on an OK tv show does not seem like a 30+ million dollar selling point.
Full House,"All the people staring at your windows, crowding your door, taking pictures, hard pass."
Full House,"and they're real cheap in Alabama, you get what you pay for"
Full House,Lol they're only off by about 100 years there.
Full House,"Probably built very well, though."
Full House,[deleted]
Full House,It’s pretty predictable that housing prices in the Bay Area are unaffordable.
Full House,"come to think of it, that living arrangement would probably raise some eyebrows nowadays"
Full House,Also the most childless
Full House,and you think that would make you more profit than selling it for 31 mill?
Full House,"I think you’re overestimating the nostalgia factor beyond a very specific 20 year window, and I’m not confident that demographic has the kind of disposable income that makes Full House tourism a priority."
Full House,"Well, it ain't no Graceland."
Full House,The one they did with the Brady Bunch house was beyond perfect.
Full House,How much money do you think those shows pull in????
Full House,Good point. I didn’t even think of that
Full House,The layout on the inside isn't anything like the tv show.
Full House,"They'd have to add an entire floor, though. The attic living space on the show couldn't possibly exist in that building as-is."
Full House,The house is being sold by the creator of Full House precisely because the neighbors wouldn't allow that kind of renovation.
Full House,Just don't bring up 1990.
Full House,"https://www.arcgis.com/apps/View/index.html?appid=b6fab720912642b6aedafdb02a76d2a4


Go ahead and paste in the address

1709 Broderick St, San Francisco, CA 94115"
Full House,"I mean, you're comparing different coasts with radically different histories. I think the oldest surviving house in SF [only dates back to 1850.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abner_Phelps_House)"
Full House,You know when you're lost out there and you're all alone? It feels like that now everywhere you look
Full House,Looks like a huge house. Could fit about 12 people comfortably.
Full House,they might just assume the girls are adopted
Full House,and how could they afford that house?
Full House,obviously not but it also will not sell for anywhere near that asking price
Full House,Who knows but whatever freak willing to pay so much for the nostalgia would probably pay even more if the interior was also identical.
Full House,"Neither was the Brady Bunch house. Yet they built a whole show around making it that way.

https://www.hgtv.com/shows/a-very-brady-renovation"
Full House,Common
Full House,They managed to do it on Dr Who...
Full House,"The fact that you can't renovate it and neighbors don't want it to become a tourist attraction (understandably, mind you) seems like it *really* limits the value of the property.  If you have $37 million to spend on a house in San Fransisco, how appealing is living in the house whose exterior was featured in the credits of a 25 year-old show really going to be?  You could buy something *much* bigger and *much* nicer that'd probably even have higher resale opportunity in the future.

There are obviously people out there with more money than sense, so I wouldn't be horribly surprised if it did sell, but I can't imagine there's a huge market to spend a fortune to have the exterior of your house look like a show from the '90s."
Full House,"No, he sold it in 2020 for $5.4 million."
Full House,"wait, his neighbors can dictate how he renovates the inside of his house? FUCK THAT. im dealing with an HOA now, and all their dumb rules for my front lawn and outside of my house, but eff them if they think they can tell me how i set up the inside of my house (brb, gonna go read all the fine print lmao)"
Full House,Most of the old houses in San Francisco crashed or burned to the ground in 1906.
Full House,"Danger's all around you. Strangers right behind you.

.... Wait"
Full House,Danny hosted a popular TV show
Full House,The thing about the Full House house is that there is way more house than the actual house in the show.
Full House,"The idea that anybody could reasonably think the value has septupled in two years just goes to show how truly bonkers and unmoored from reality housing prices have become 

I'm well aware it won't sell for that much but the idea that it would even list for that much... ludicrous"
Full House,just the local news
Full House,Like the sitcom version of the TARDIS from Doctor Who
Full House,How dare you besmirch the name of [Wake Up San Francisco](https://youtu.be/N4U8QSYpqD4?t=8)!
Full House,"also in real life, I don't think the Winslow's could have afforded their house on Carl's Chicago PD salary, and I don't think their homeowners insurance would cover Urkel's accidents"
Full House,Sorry to whoever has to clean up the vigil outside their home.
Full House,I'm sorry but that's some weird parasocial shit.
Full House,"Jeff Franklin, the creator of Full/Fuller House, bought it a few years ago right before he was fired from the show."
Full House,"It was 2-3 bouquets of flowers, a beer can, and a loaf of white bread…"
Full House,Things are probably gonna be all right for the person rich enough to live in one of the painted ladies.
Full House,They're luckier than whoever has to clean up after the room in Bob's version of The Aristocrats joke.
Full House,"its funny, the name Jeff Franklin just seems very not fitting for him. I did not imagine him to be so douchey and smug looking."
Full House,"How did I not know what a huge piece of shit he is? Just read up a little on him after seeing this comment and just that little bit makes me sick.

Also he looks like a massive tool"
Full House,"The Full House house is on Broderick Street, not one of the Painted Ladies at Alamo Square from the show intro."
Full House,“It’s like spin-art”
Full House,"I'm sure most parents don't think, ""let's pick a super douchey name"" when they're picking baby names."
Full House,One google took me from “how does someone even look smug and douchey?” to “I didn’t know Mickey Rourke had a retarded younger brother” real quick
Full House,"Wait, don’t hold out on us, why?"
Full House,"Oh, my bad."
Full House,Said some really heinous shit about and to women on the set of his shows and commenting about the looks of underage girls. It’s all on his wiki
Full House,[removed]
Full House,"Yeah, I just remember the houses in the intro. Never really watched it."
Full House,A clip show triggered by someone unpacking Danny's old Dust Buster in the garage...
Full House,Just…don’t.
Full House,His death must be avenged!
Full House,Good Night San Francisco
Full House,"he joined walter , comet, and his first wife in heaven 

he was killed by a bad batch of cleaning supolies"
Full House,Just say he moved to Hawaii with his wife. Those kids losing both parents and DJ losing a husband is too grim.
Full House,Knowing the way this cast works this has probably been floated by Dave and John to ABC.
Full House,"Why? No one cared about Fuller House enough to keep it on after 2020, and even though it lasted five seasons, viewership greatly diminished after the first season. Move on, already."
Full House,He's in jail because he got caught paying someone to get a family member into an Ivy league school
Full House,Wait. What. Who wants a spinoff of Full House. I didn't even watch Fuller House.
Full House,I wonder if they will do a mass shooting at a mall. Then try to teach people lessons
Full House,"I mean... ""Those kids"" are in their 40s...  Most people lose both their parents eventually"
Full House,It ended after 2020 on Netflix becouse it was a WB production and WB was ending all their stuff on Netflix.
Full House,so why'd you click on the post?
Full House,They did that on The Yawners...I mean the Conners
Full House,To set the record straight
Full House,my upbringing was more like malcolm but with more drugs and beer
Full House,yeah. that was the point.
Full House,"Malcolm in the Middle IS lower/middle class life in America. Still amazing to watch to this day. And the lessons it taught weren't idealistic, they were practical. 

""If it is that easy to change, why didn't you do it before?"" ""Oh, honey... that will never happen. You'll ALWAYS have to tell us what to do! But each time we'll try to do better."""
Full House,"Roseanne was the response to the Cosby show.  Seing a successful family seems mundane, but if its a minority, it may be valuable to some.  Look at the success of Crazy Rich Asians for contrast."
Full House,"I remember watching ""The Middle"" with my family something like 10 years ago, and by god did it capture us perfectly to an almost unnerving degree. The dysfunction and irritation with each other totally relatable. I'm always surprised the show didn't catch as much mainstream attention as something like Modern Family (which I always found totally unrealistic)"
Full House,"When I was studying in Spain I'd watch the Simpsons with my host family at lunch sometimes. My host mother said ""you realize this is making fun of Americans, right?"" and I said ""no this is Americans, we accept it"""
Full House,"Funny thing is when The Simpsons debuted in 1989 they were meant to be a struggling working class family. Nothing changed about them. But now if you see a family in a three bedroom house with a two car garage (and two cars to go in it) supporting three children on one income, you'd think they were doing really well."
Full House,"Ah, yes. I remember when my dad put on 200lbs so he could work from home and wear a woman's maternity dress. Wait a minute..."
Full House,"I think *Malcolm in the Middle* captures your point better than *Married with Children*. IMHO, *Married* propped up as much unrealistic dysfunction as their predecessors propped up unrealistic function.

Malcolm in the Middle did so many things right -- first among these is abandoning the 3-camera studio set model in favor of a single-camera, cinematography and editing. That move alone made *Malcolm* **feel** ""more real"" in a way that fixed-angle sitcoms couldn't touch, and largely haven't recovered from -- even big successes are hounded by the ""laugh track"" critique, and I know many who categorically cannot stand shows with canned laughter.

IMHO, *Malcolm* opened the door to film-style presentation on television. Other shows had done it, but never anything that could be classified as a sitcom, let alone a wildly successful one. They broke the back of the assumption that any sitcom needed to be a filmed stage-play in order to be taken seriously, and in so doing they brought edited, film-like, licensed-soundtracked sequences into TV mainstream.

The family dynamics were also flexible without being vague. They solidified evolving ideas of family gender dynamics, positioning a strong, stubborn but also vulnerable mother against a somewhat bumbling father who was played in a way that didn't fall into the ""dad's an idiot"" trope that many shows fell into. 

The kids had understandable motivations and were presented as significant, which is another thing sitcoms have screwed up around kids, who sometimes come off as a multi-headed conflict engine with no real character arc."

Cinderella and the Four Knights,"Lisa Kudrow was let go from Frasier. 

The show recast the role of Roz with Peri  Gilpin."
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"and after Friends, Perry had a seemlingly endless stream of failed sitcoms"
Cinderella and the Four Knights,so what you're saying was courtney cox was the missing ingredient
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"So, the gist of the story is that actors had acting careers?"
Cinderella and the Four Knights,I remember before Blossom there was a very short lived sitcom starring Mayim Bialick that had her as a rambunctious kid and Jennifer Anniston played her older stuck up sister.  Only thing I remember from the show is Jennifer Anniston getting a plate of spaghetti dumped on her head
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"If memory serves right, The Edge was a sketch show (based on an interview with Alan Ruck from a few years ago where he mentions having worked on it) and not a sitcom"
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"This isn't that surprising, most actors spent quite a while as failures before they find success. The reason *Party Down* is so true-to-life is that the show's creators (Paul Rudd, Adam Scott, Rob Thomas) all worked shit jobs for years before they got their break."
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"Top of the Heap was pretty funny, like a Married with Children type show with a father and son con artist"
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"Here’s my power rankings of Friends stars before they were on Friends based on well known they were.
1. Courtney Cox - had a supporting role as Alex’s girlfriend on Family Ties. She was also in Bruce Springsteen’s Dancing in the Dark video.
2. Matthew Perry - had a supporting role on Growing Pains as Carol’s boyfriend who died in a drunk driving accident. He was also in a lot of shows that only lasted a single season plus he had a supporting role in the River Phoenix movie A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon.
3. Matt LeBlanc - he did a lot of commercial work as well as a recurring role on Married With Children that led to his own sitcom.
4. Lisa Kudrow - had a recurring role as Ursula on Mad About You and in three episodes of the Bob Newhart sitcom, Bob.
5. Jennifer Anniston - starred in the cult classic, Leprechaun and as Ferris Bueller’s sister in the very short lived Ferris Bueller tv show.
6. David Schwimmer - he was mostly a stage actor before Friends, but had a memorable storyline on the first season of NYPD Blue and a role on the short lived Henry Winkler sitcom Monty."
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"Jennifer Aniston had two shows with Friends and another one playing about the same time in different networks. So if the second show got second season, she would have to quit Friends and do the other show the then CEO of NBC put the second show against strong competition for it to be ratings flop and not to be renewed"
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"All I remember was Matt LeBlanc sitting a bottle of ketchup on the the edge of a top of a building, then buying a hot dog from a street vendor, plain. Then behind the back, a perfect pour of ketchup from the sky.

Idk why I remember that I was fairly young when that commercial came out lol"
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"Lisa said it was a blessing, and I don't blame her. Frasier is incredible but Friends is a global and a cultural phenomenon making Lisa millions 30 year after it debut. So yes a blessing it was."
Cinderella and the Four Knights,But she had a recurring role as Ursala on Mad about You.
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"Fun fact, Lisa Kudrow has a guest role on an episode of Cheers in the eighth season, which is sort of weird to think about just because Cheers just feels like a MUCH older show than Friends."
Cinderella and the Four Knights,Some great ones though. Go On was a really funny show with a fantastic supporting cast. It really deserved another season.
Cinderella and the Four Knights,I miss Studio 60.
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"Go On is legitimately hilarious with a great cast. I don't normally care if a sitcom gets renewed or not, but I was upset with that one."
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"She was on the drama ""Dirt"" on FX. It wasn't bad, but I definitely stuck around for her."
Cinderella and the Four Knights,Masters of the universe and ace Ventura prepped her
Cinderella and the Four Knights,Molloy
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"Came here to say this. I watched The Edge as a kid (and even have a VHS-quality DVD bootleg), and it was a sketch show--not a sitcom."
Cinderella and the Four Knights,It even had a backdoor pilot on MWC
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"This list is strange to me. Everyone i knew all knew Joey as the bimbo guy from married with children. He was by far the most famous in my social circle. 

I was pretty young at the time tho."
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"> 2. Matthew Perry - had a supporting role on Growing Pains as Carol’s boyfriend who died in a drunk driving accident.

He was also unfairly fired from this role, actually.

Kirk Cameron became a Born-Again Christian shortly after the show started and caused a shit-ton of problems for the programme by refusing to do things on account of his faith. For example, frequently forcing rewrites of jokes or even episodes because he didn't want dirty jokes in the show. And the executive producers were forced to comply because he ended up becoming *the* face of the show as the most popular actor.

He nixed the original plan for the ""Holiday In Europe"" storyline to actually film the entire set of episodes on location in Europe, the entire cost of production being covered by the tourism boards of numerous countries, because it would've meant not going to church so they filmed it on an island off the coast of California instead.

He also had two actors kicked off the show. His first on-screen girlfriend was fired at his orders for featuring in Playboy and he had Perry fired for being an ""Agent of Satan"" due to his issues with addiction.

Cameron ended up getting the show cancelled because the executive producers found out that he tried to go over their heads in regards to a joke and directly complained to then-CEO of ABC Bob Iger as well as outright slandering them. They just said they were done producing the show, locked down the rights and moved onto other projects."
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"It was probably a blessing for Frasier too, she would have made a very different Roz. One I would not like to have seen."
Cinderella and the Four Knights,Cheers went off the air a full year-plus before Friends debuted on NBC.
Cinderella and the Four Knights,She also led Cougar Town on ABC (and later TBS). Great fun.
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"Fox saw the talent Matt was so they put him in another show, *Vinny and Bobby*. He was the same Vinny as MWC and TotH."
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"You can argue about where the others fall on the list, but Courtney is by far the most well known when that show started. She was in the first Ace Ventura movie which came out five months before Friends premiered. Her pre-Friends IMDb credits is also a lot longer than the rest of the cast which isn’t too surprising considering she is the second oldest cast member after Lisa."
Cinderella and the Four Knights,Kirk cameron never comes off looking good ever and it seems like everyone hates working with him.
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"Understood, it just feels like an old show whereas I've never thought of Friends as ""old""."
Cinderella and the Four Knights,He got blacklisted by Hollywood because his costar on Growing Pains didn't want much else to do with him. It's why he exclusively works in Christian media now.
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"Probably because an Irish bar with floor to ceiling dark wood hasn't been built in over 50 years, and coffee shops with couches in them are a 90s/early 2000s thing"
Cinderella and the Four Knights,">Currently we are working on a second season of Taboo

That seems to be all of the news"
Cinderella and the Four Knights,wait i thought this came out a while back
Cinderella and the Four Knights,It’s only been 6 fucking years
Cinderella and the Four Knights,Feels like 10 years ago
Cinderella and the Four Knights,Lol yeah I’ve completely given up hope at this point.
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"Lazy writing, which is ironic considering Joe's ""thing"" is judging lazy writers. It seems the writers this season deliberately decided to give wealthy characters every negative trait possible that exists in humanity. The result is more parody than intrigue."
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"Every season was a fun ride except 4. Everything that made You interesting (the commentary on childhood trauma manifesting into adulthood, the false images people portray of themselves in our modern social media obsessed society, the way ppl of similar traumas are drawn to each other) was all gone. This season felt totally random and unrelated. What are the odds that the place Joe ends up hiding puts him in the path of a political serial killer? 🧍🏼‍♀️ they also started to try and portray Joe as a hero. Before it was clear he was demented, but season 4 felt like it was attempting to redeem him (by him not killing Marianne, and not letting Roald burn when he could’ve, and telling his new love interest he couldnt be w her). Feels like theyre setting up season 4 pt.2 to make him into a hero. When what was special about the show was how the viewer would find themselves unconsciously rooting for him when he was a bad guy in reality. Real bummer of a season. Show writers have been flopping left and right lately."
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"How can they say it's awul and hugely entertaining? I don't think it fits into the category lf 'so bad it's good'.

It just feels like these reviewers are ashamed to like a show like this so they have to preface it with 'I know it's bad' to save face."
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"Such a bad season. Not to mention the awful, over the top British stereotypes. It felt so out of touch haha"
Cinderella and the Four Knights,It was the worst season by far..
Cinderella and the Four Knights,">It’s no longer worth asking if it’s good or bad – just enjoy the rollercoaster

If only there were people who it was worth their time because it's literally their job."
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"I was surprised how bad this season is. I actually liked Season 3. But everything about Season 4 is terrible: the plot, the dialogues, the characters…"
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"This season is truly just awful though. They really just gave up writing it seems, Joe is just placed in a new world and instead of showing any of the relationship building we are just supposed to assume that the awkward guy who doesn't respond to anyone talking to him became best friends with people in the 0.1% all in a single night. His inclusion in everything they do is so strange and every scene he's in with them he just narrates and stays silent even in one on one conversations."
Cinderella and the Four Knights,The first season was the best because it actually had something meaningful to say about the type man Joe is and the type of women who are into (or not) that kind of thing.
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"I don't know what people want.

I love You as a dumb dark comedy with a super charismatic lead killing dumbasses"
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"Season 4 is the perfect example of writers trying to give us ""more of what we like"" with out giving us what we actually like.

1. Joe went from working at a Bookstore and now he is a PHD professor?

2. He easily infiltrates a circle of rich spoiled people with zero clout, not that much money, drugs or charisma.  And he's probably what they would consider ""Dad"" age ... Why would they want to hang out with him?

3. Joe is now Sherlock Holmes?

I actually switched off after the middle of episode 2 and came to reddit for the comments.  When reading comments becomes more interesting than watching the show you know its not good 😂"
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"Wow i guess unpopular opinion, but i think this season is entertaining. Just a murder mystery not bad not over analyzing."
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"Season 2 & 3 were amazing, but this new season ruined it by coming to my country. 

I hope the next season goes back to the USA"
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"Season 1 will always be the GOAT , this one is an easy skip."
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"I actually enjoyed it but it’s definitely in the “see how weird/bad rich people are” trope that’s so hot right now (I.e. triangle of sadness, the menu, white lotus, infinity pool, etc) and is going to be overdone fairly soon. As of now I’m still enjoying it and will watch the hell out of part 2. I like this season way more than Love and the baby season which was a total snooze fest."
Cinderella and the Four Knights,It's a fucking bore. Season 3 was dogshit. And this season is worse somehow. The European setting is bad. I don't give a shit about anyone in the show at this point. Just end the shitfest
Cinderella and the Four Knights,Found this season really hard to get into ! A little boring.  These random friend groups just like inviting this weirdo stranger in … it’s so goofy and hard to believe. It’s more glaring this time because they are so “elitist” … yet none of the characters are interesting in anyway.  His like “love interest” neighbor is so mean and also so harsh looking - like she’s not attractive by any stretch.
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"Nope, this season is not it... honestly I was done in season three. I watched season 4 episode 1 and had enough really, wth did they do to the character and what's with all the rich people clichés."
Cinderella and the Four Knights,I am on episode 1 but it feels like the writers feel like their audience aren’t as smart as they are. It comes across as super pretentious and I don’t really feel like continuing the series.
Cinderella and the Four Knights,It's fucking boring because it seems like its some 1940 film.
Cinderella and the Four Knights,It's so boring
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"It’s meeting my expectations unfortunately. Since season 3 the show has been moving at a ridiculously rapid pace and making for sloppy, inconsistent decisions on behalf of all of the main characters, including Joe. I had a feeling they didn’t have much left to tell since the books that birthed the show don’t go this far - but they could have made the explosion of Love and fallout of season 3 two seasons long - that would have made for a better season 4 than this so far."
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"Why are they turning him into Dexter? I can barely believe he isn't stalking someone yet, I have doubts."
Cinderella and the Four Knights,I still can’t fathom why the private  detective just let him go? Just because?
Cinderella and the Four Knights,It completely lost the feel of what the show actually started out as. Doesn’t even feel like this season is the same show as season 1. Turned into a stalker romance theme to just a who done it show. Not a fan
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"I still have 3 episodes to go so I’m trying to avoid spoilers but I also want to voice my opinion on the “twist”. First off, for the first half of the season it was way too obvious that Rhys was going to be the source of Joe’s conflict. It was way too easy to figure out. Secondly, I was getting Fight Club, Tyler Durden vibes the entire time and kept wondering if this wad going to turn out to be a multiple personality story. I thought that it would be too cliché and that hopefully the writers had something different up their sleeve. Whelp I should have trusted my instincts. Its just been done way too many times at this point. The thing is that yes, Joe is a psycho. There’s never been any doubt on that. However, since he is the protagonist of this series we should expect to see a bit of a character arc. He’s still a killer but thanks to Love being a homicidal maniac, he has more perspective on it and ambitions to better deal with it. Joe should never be forgiven but there was something interesting in seeing him trying to hold his demons at bay and even use his sickness to track down someone even more sick. Having him just turn out to be crazier than ever and even more so of a killer just makes me feel like he hasn’t really gone anywhere. Again, I am in no way advocating for Joe to have redemption or a happy ending. He deserves to be locked away for the rest of his life but seeing some growth was appealing from a character and psychological stand point. I guess I can’t fairly review it until I’ve finished but that’s my feeling after the reveal."
Cinderella and the Four Knights,This season sucks!!! Every season got worse and worse... season 1 was sooo good it’s kept me still watching. Season 4 is like gossip girl turned psychotic
Cinderella and the Four Knights,The recent series is just pointless. Why didn't he just leave town the minute the murders started? Why stay? The main problem with the series is it's just BORING. Having listened to all the audiobooks I'm really disappointed! I don't get why they didn't just follow the story in the books
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"This season is a bit of a mess really. Joe is fixated on Marianne to such an extent he follows her to London but lets her leave so we can have a serial killer series instead. This Friend group he is part of is clearly written for a US audience and for the stereotype of Brits being stuck up elites who are one step removed from being part of the Royal family. Joe is on the run but when his identity might be revealed, he turns into Sherlock Holmes instead of going on the run again."
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"The first season was unique and  brilliant because it was a sardonic take on modern culture. It should have stopped there. Since then it's been the same repetitive storyline with the same annoyingly arch  Penn Badgely voiceover. We're supposed to believe that this moderately, attractive, ordinary guy ends up in all these glam locations and women can't resist him? Are we seriously to believe a teacher can afford to live in that incredible London apartment, when apartments in London are more than New York? I'm willing to suspend disbelief if the show is rivetiing and well-written, but I'm bored and I can't stand the lazy over-reliance on his voiceover"
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"Why would Joe try to solve the case instead of just running away again? Why would the private eye just let him go? Lazy writing, show has jumped the shark."
Cinderella and the Four Knights,Boring season. Boring plot and tbh I just don’t care for this entire new ensemble of characters. It feels like we’re watching a fan fiction of what could’ve potentially happened. Like some fake haha story. What if Joe went to England? Just lazy writing. The writers had no idea what to do with this season and it shows.
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"Man. I really really liked YOU, but this first part of this season is absolutely awful."
Cinderella and the Four Knights,What the hell happened I'm watching season 4 I have had to go back several times to watch parts again its completely disconnected from the first 3 seasons Joe isn't even coming off the same its weird and I feel like this is a whole different show ugh so disappointing
Cinderella and the Four Knights,Yeah gotta say they changed the whole premise and it sucks now
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"i knew who the killer was in the first episode. when he showed up, i just let out a really long sigh. it’s really weird how joe went from being a predatory murderer, to a detective savior? i just feel like the writers had NO idea what to do after he killed love. i feel like it probably should have ended after he killed his literal wife and abandoned his son. it would have been a perfect ending that explained everything. he did exactly what his mom did to him. he left his son behind so that he could start over, and then completely forgot about him. and then he killed his own wife, because she was too similar to him and he couldn’t handle it. it was such a good ending. it’s too bad that they decided to keep dragging it on. netflix has gotten so damn lazy with their story writing. all they care about is money, so they definitely didn’t take their time with this one. it feels so rushed, like they couldn’t WAIT to get their next paycheck. not only that, but Penn asked for no sex scenes, and he’s had more sex scenes that he has in any other season. it’s like they did it to mock him. i’m honestly really grossed out by this season, and i feel no connection to it anymore."
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"My God I agree. The tone is completely different and does NOT work. I signed up as a fan of the deluded, antihero with a penchant for romance (albeit creepy). Not Sherlock Holmes in London."
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"Season 4 should have started with him getting caught and arrested, then unfolding with him trying to lie to get out of it, the court case unfolding, etc and then the season/finale ending with his sentencing...."
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"Literally this is an entirely different show with the same actor. Totally different character, style, storylines, plots… everythinggggg. Cancel You"
Cinderella and the Four Knights,Nothing will ever compare to Love. Her character was amazing. That twist in season 2 still gets me everyday. Killing her off was the worst thing this show ever did. I haven't watched season 4 but after Love i don't know if i can.
Cinderella and the Four Knights,Am I the only one who liked it lol
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"It's the Twilight of serial killer shows/movies/books. It's bad and cringe. It makes Dexter, another corny serial killer show, look good in comparison."
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"My problem with the entire show is that it tries so hard to romanticize and get you to root for Joe that any attempt at a commentary on mental illness completely falls flat. Who cares that Joe spends most of the show doing horrible things to objectively good people? He’s smart, vaguely liberal, and occasionally kills absurdly bad people, so you should be cool with the fact that he always ends up on top, right? A good anti-hero story should at least try to leave the audience feeling a little bit conflicted. This show doesn’t do that at all"
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"I agree with Vincent and what others have said. Understandably, there are some discrepancies but it is a work of fiction and it’s not supposed to hyper focus on accuracy. It’s not a documentary. And I get it, It doesn’t follow the same plot as previous seasons, which we all loved. But sometimes it’s good to add something a little different. I get the whole academia/geography complaints, but as storytellers of fiction, the goal is to entertain and to keep the story moving along. Too many specifications may leave viewers bored as it would take too long to for the actual narrative to play. Small details as in how long a walk is from this location to the next isn’t something they would highlight unless it played some kind of significance in the plot."
Cinderella and the Four Knights,[deleted]
Cinderella and the Four Knights, 7
Cinderella and the Four Knights,I just don't like seeing Joe as the good guy. And now he's on track to becoming a hero? What?
Cinderella and the Four Knights,It’s a trying to be Dexter knock off
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"I loved You seasons 1-3 season 4 is absolute DOGSHIT!!! I barely made through the 1st episode, 5 minutes into s4 episode 2 I turned it off I'm not going to watch the rest of season 4. To describe it in one word horrible. Was it written buy a room full of special needs children?"
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"Exactly! Some.complete eejit is arguing with me on another thread that the investigator set him up as a professor ... like multiple paragraphs and comments. There is just no way lol. And I'd bet your professor friend isn't just given a 3 million pound flat rent free to run about in, despite excelling in their field. Nor can they bend space and time to walk from one end of London to another twice daily! 

But this other redditor vehemently disagrees, ah well.

And you've come up with a way better plot too and with such ease. Would be so much better in Thailand and your plot makes more sense. Ut would require the writers to at least know where Thailand is on a map, however, and since they can't even Google the basics on London, it would definitely be beyond them. Send me your script!"
Cinderella and the Four Knights,I liked it because it is different. If they just re-did season 1 but in London we would be complaining that they just re-did season 1 but in London.
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"I swear, this season was so ridiculous and out-of-left-field that I had half a mind they were about to reveal Joe as a lesser-known Marvel character or introduce him with some special supernatural power. 

My partner had never heard of ‘You’ before, so he started watching this season with me. What an awful and disappointing introduction that was."
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"Horrible. I went back to rewatch season 3 b/c I was so disappointed at season 4. Ugh. I waited so long. I’m trying to find a dislike button for season 4 on Netflix. Not a thing, so vending w/Reddit is my only option lol. Worst part is that I replayed every single episode of season 4 an insane amount of times b/c it was soooo bad that I would loose interest and then had to replay it thinking that maybe it was bad b/c I wasn’t engaged. But we know the truth. It’s bad. Had force myself to keep engaged. Now I’ve contributed to the streaming reports Netflix probably pulls to determine “it’s good” due to watch time data. Ugh."
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"I rarely ""saw"" (becaus probably was more scrolling on the phone during the whole thing) something that boring on screen as this season of you"
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"I didn't like season 4 either. He went from being obsessed with women to obsessed with a man? It's just sucked all over. I didn't  feel like binge watching Season 4 like the other seasons. I was quite bored during some scenes. I didn't  like Kate, Kathy, or whatever her name is as a lover for Joe. Beck and Love were more his style."
Cinderella and the Four Knights,If Joe doesn't kill someone soon imma lose it
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"I feel like they’re milking the show too much, and part two was just bad."
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"I left another comment on here that the Fight Club twist was too cliche and easy to figure out. Now I’m barely passed that and already have another complaint. I’m sorry but Marienne saying that they can’t go to the police is one of the dumbest things I’ve seen recently lol. Of course you go to the police! The guy has a traceable history of dead bodies in his wake. Even Joe himself has been worried about talking to police because it wouldn’t take a lot of digging to find out who really is. Both Marienne and Nadia are eye witnesses and even him just being brought in for kidnapping would be enough to unravel the rest of his BS. I’m sorry but there’s no where left for Joe to run in a scenario where the police suddenly show up while he’s in the middle of class to arrest him. I still have two more episodes to go but for me, this season is getting a bit silly. The police are clearly a better option then leaving Marienne caged while they concoct some convoluted plan that probably has a less likely hood of success than just simply going to the police. Lol like when Marriene cautions Nadia about not letting Joe find out that she knows because he may hurt her? Hey do you know a scenario where there wouldn’t be any risk of that happening? IF YOU GO TO THE POLICE lol."
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"Reading the comments here, it's pretty funny after watching part 2. Great show IMO, lol"
Cinderella and the Four Knights,"I don't know why but I've kind of lost interest now that Joe is just a crazy split personality type. I was more interested when it seemed like bad stuff just kept happening to him and he kept getting away with things. For some reason, it just felt typical at that point."
Cinderella and the Four Knights,YOU season 4 feels like it was written by ChatGPT 😂
Cinderella and the Four Knights,Season 4 is BAD and not in a good way
Unsolved,"I think the original Unsolved Mysteries had a general air about it that ""this is a mystery that urgently needs solving, please help"", while a lot of modern true crime shows are ""this is a mystery that happened and ended brutally, how could someone do this."" I mean a lot of true crime stuff these days is already solved so it's more of a sort of psychological spectacle of a criminal mind, whereas the original UM was more like ""help us solve this."" Not to mention plenty of the original show wasn't even really true crime, a lot of it involved ""this old man died and wants his closest relative to inherit his will but it's 1989 so we don't know who that closest relative *is*"". Also all the supernatural stuff.

Also there's just something way more thrilling about watching Unsolved Mysteries and hearing ""UPDATE"". Also I'd like to say that they apparently do regularly add ""UPDATES"" to the syndicated version of the show. I was watching one episode a year or two ago and the UPDATE was for something that had happened *a month earlier*. So they still update the show when there's something to say even into 2020 or so! 

But anyway other true crime shows, like I said, often they're already solved anyway so you don't get the interest of seeing a case presented on a show from 35 years ago get an UPDATE."
Unsolved,"I think it's the multiple stories in an episode. You can go into as much detail as a story needs without dragging it out. There's also something so charming about the reenactments, like, they're dated sure, but the show was low enough budget and they used so much of what was around them that it looks like a genuine glimpse into another time."
Unsolved,Better? Child me would get scared shitless at the “update” banner they had for some stories 😅
Unsolved,Because no drones existed for long fucking pan shots.
Unsolved,"Because True Crime is really, really scraping the bottom of the barrel now.

I'm just not convinced that [this](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11324406/) is really interesting enough at base to justify existing.

And for Brits here, [this](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt22751880/) is just pathetic."
Unsolved,"I love the original 1987-2003 UM, and it’s one of my favorite shows, reminds me of my childhood, and is a large influence on why i love true crime. 

I think 3 things really made UM great. 

1. Robert Stack was a great narrator/figurehead for the show. His voice was raspy and his presentation was great. He said enough to properly narrate while blending in the segments and interviews. They also filmed his lead-ins or narrations in creepy locations like foggy woods or darkly lit temples to heighten the creepy factor.

2. The music. That theme is iconic, and most Americans raised between 1975-1995 know it. As a child, whenever I heard that theme, I knew to leave the room or I would have nightmares. The show also had iconic bumper music for things like updates and even sometimes, they would score certain key scenes in re-enactments with music cues like a synth pulse or bass when something happened (someone got stabbed, the camera cuts to the killer at the scene). It drew your attention, but also scared the shit out of you too. 

3. The re-enactments and cinematography were almost news broadcast like (despite the show having a disclaimer it was NOT a news broadcast). They were not quite film quality, but rather grainy especially the early seasons. An underrated but hella creepy thing they did was often tilt the camera shot during certain parts of re-enactments or zoom in on mugshots/composite sketches. It just made the re-enactments that more unsettling especially when coupled with the music. You didn’t feel like you were watching a movie or tv show when watching UM, but rather a special urgent bulletin or horror movie."
Unsolved,"It also had Robert Stack, dude's voice was iconic.

Edit to add: [clip](https://youtu.be/ALFhHF91g9c) from Baseketball, they leave out one part from [the end.](https://youtu.be/esB7WnCY1kk)"
Unsolved,"I absolutely loved the original Unsolved Mysteries and will frequently watch episodes on YouTube for comfort.  I've often thought about what the original has and is very much lacking in the newer incarnation.  Here are my thoughts:

1. Unsolved Mysteries needs a narrator. Obviously no one is going to replace Robert Stack, but it needs a host to distinguish it from the hundreds of other true crime shows on ID, Oxygen, etc.

2. Multiple stories per episode. I've seen a few of the new shows and they mostly consist of shitty filler.

3. Proper reenactments. I hate how they present the cases in the new series.

4. Very much a product of the time, but the soundtrack added a lot to original series.

5. Finally, and I'm sure many won't agree, but I would love it if they used grainy film, similar to the original.  I think it would really add a lot to the show's atmosphere and allow it to stand out from the competition.

As it stands, the new series is piss poor and barely memorable. The fact that it calls itself Unsolved Mysteries is a travesty to the original."
Unsolved,"This is one of my favorite shows. Robert Stack's voice, the creepy music and the cheesey reenactments are all iconic and I love a good mystery."
Unsolved,"I may be the wrong person to ask; I sometimes put classic Unsolved Mysteries on to go to sleep. 

But, I really think you answered your question in your first paragraph. No padding, no experts, good pacing, and Stack’s voice. I would add that when they did have “talking heads”, they were the family and friends who were involved in the original cases, which creates much better emotion. And of course there’s that awesome theme music."
Unsolved,OG Unsolved Mysteries was about the facts and trying to solve the case.  The new stuff is all about drama and clickbait to draw in the viewers.  More about getting views and selling adds than it is about being good.
Unsolved,91510-1449
Unsolved,"The incorporation of true crime, fraudsters, paranormal/unexplained, and updates satiated the hunger for just about everyone. My mom loved it for the true crime, I loved it for the ghost stories."
Unsolved,Robert Stack was just on a whole different level. He didn't need all the extra hoopla. His voice is truly 1 in a billion. I could listen to him talking about marshmallow recipes and I'd find nothing more compelling 😂
Unsolved,"I feel that Robert Stack had a huge part, he was the perfect narrator for that show. 

It was also great that Unsolved Mysteries didn't only focus  on kidnappings and murders, it was refreshing to know that there were other sorts of mysteries (supernatural, religious, shoot I remember one of them was about a child genius)."
Unsolved,[deleted]
Unsolved,"If you, or anyone you know has any information regarding this case, please call r/HoffyTheBaker

IMO the dumb paranormal stuff was silly fun couched in between actual stories, and I suspect the writers knew it'd play well for one segment. There were also heartwarming stories of (for instance) foster siblings separated by circumstances being reunited as old people and what not, and then of course the meat was have you seen this person? Typically a bad person, but again they gave enough clues for the the nice stories as well."
Unsolved,"Because back then you didn't have the internet or feel like you were connected to the world so closely. You felt more isolated and stuck wherever you lived. Mysteries and folklore went a lot farther when you weren't bombarded by information online 24/7. 

It was a different time."
Unsolved,"It wasn't just true crime. It had other unexplained phenomena featured as well. Ghosts, aliens, cryptids, etc and it took it all as seriously as it did the homicides and disappearances. To me that's what sets it apart and elevates it and why I just toss it on on Pluto every so often."
Unsolved,"The original UM is amazing and has a lot of diversity in stories. It's also interesing to see how some of the mysteries are solved after the episodes air.

Watching the newer series I saw a lot of suicide cases that people interpreted as murders because ""They would never commit suicide!""."
Unsolved,"The great narration and quick pace was compelling. Same reason Forensic Files holds up. 

Some of the current shows drag things out to fill an hour, or in the case of Dateline they'll sometimes go two hours. And then sometimes they'll make a whole limited series out of something that doesn't deserve it, like that Hotel Cecil documentary. 

But there are still some good shows on the air."
Unsolved,Because it’s that’s fucking jammer of an intro song.
Unsolved,"The worst is when you forget it’s called unsolved mysteries and you get really into a story and then BAM- no resolution, lol. I’d say 80%!of the stories where great but some of them where real snoozefests"
Unsolved,I went to kindergarten with a kid whose family was featured on it.
Unsolved,TV shows are shitty now. A lot of effort has been put into making them shitty.
Unsolved,"Please list other crime shows it's better than, and other crime shows that it's worse than to back up your 90% claim."
Unsolved,"I think Stack's irreplaceable voiceover has a lot to do with it, though I actually like the reboot a lot and I think they made the right call in letting the story tell itself.

Part of it though is that it's just harder to find and present the huge spectrum of horseshit the old show had to work with nowadays - I mean, we know by now she wasn't abducted by aliens, her toothless drunk husband just murdered her - and that means you're stuck trying to find new ways to tell the same few basic stories all the time."
Unsolved,Current True Crime shows feel much more melodramatic.
Unsolved,Ah...the music and Robert Stack. Scared the shit out of me as a kid but i just loved it to death.
Unsolved,There was no streaming. All the great writers worked in movies and TV shows.
Unsolved,"There are a few things I feel about this that I believe a true.

1. TV shows in the past had to hold themselves to a higher standard of quality than they do today. It wasn't a guarantee that a show would be successful, so they had to put in a lot of effort to make it interesting, exciting, and keep up the viewership. Viewership. Today, a remake of unsolved mysteries is going to be popular just because it has the name of a previously successful show. Ever notice how some shitty shows are apparently America's number one show suddenly? Today, you can just include a popular celebrity and have enough promotion and air a show on a popular channel, and it's got a guaranteed level of viewership. Television did not have guaranteed viewership. When the original unsolved mysteries was coming out, there was quality or failure.

2. Unsolved mysteries had very little competitors at the time. I believe forensic files was the other big one (which I highly recommend you watch if you've never watched it) and so there wasn't really much of a comparison. Shows today are all trying to keep up the hype and mimic the feeling the previous shows had, but just by copying things you immediately start to lose some of the quality because it's no longer an original idea. 

3. Somewhat similar to the first point, the quality of TV show writing has generally just gone down. Again, it has to do with the lack of need for competitors because some people just get huge budgets for their shows and the success is guaranteed, and even if it's not, there's guaranteed profit for those involved so it doesn't really matter. There is also just a generational gap in what people expect in regards to entertainment, and so today's shows are geared towards modern desires and expectations, while the older shows were geared towards previous expectations and interests. Interests. I'm 30 years old, which makes me young compared to the show, but I still watched it when I was a kid and found it very entertaining. Entertaining. People making shows almost 40 years later are not going to emulate what we found exciting or attention grabbing from back then.

TLDR: quality of shows are generally down, since they don't have to be popular to make money. You can't remake a show and expect it to be as good as the original. Our taste in television has not changed but the design has."
Unsolved,"Stack was that show, he was a phenom."
Unsolved,I've found that this sort of show has 10 minutes of entertainment cram packed into 45 minutes plus ads.
Unsolved,"The original Unsolved Mysteries had that ""America's Most Wanted"" feel to it in that, the purpose was to solve the mysteries but without widespread access like we have now, the show provided that outreach. True Crime shows now are more about ratings and analytics and ""experts"" getting their camera time. I watched the UM reboot and I liked the first season, but I watched some of the latest episodes and it lost me. Particularly the episode where the girl went missing and was found after she was hit by a train a few miles away."
Unsolved,"There's been a couple good ones relatively recently, I personally like Joe Kenda: Homicide Detective.  But I don't think TV focuses much effort on true crime anymore because podcast have largely taken over that space."
Unsolved,"Effort. They tried to do a good show, they pulled it off."
Unsolved,"Because of how verbose, needlessly elaborate the format is now. Unsolved Mysteries was, by comparison, short sweet and to the point while still masterfully adding atmosphere to the stories. Contrast to this parody, and you realize how ridiculously over the top the whole concept is now.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BUrNe3Vhtk

I think Forensic Files is another great example; a murder, a mystery, and a solution, wrapped up in a tight but engaging twenty or so minutes. That, more than UM, really made me realize how needlessly bloated ""true crime"" has gotten now."
Unsolved,Audience participation in a way that no modern true crime docuseries even tries to craft.
Unsolved,I liked that they had so many stories in each episode.  Now it’s drawn out way too much
Unsolved,That show scared me as a kid for some reason.
Unsolved,"UM was the scariest thing I watched growing up. There’s a story about a boy, his mother and his grandmother catching a glimpse of a ufo and then growing boils that stuck with me for years."
Unsolved,"As good as the original ""Unsolved Mysteries"" tv show is, you should watch COLUMBO with Peter Falk. So much 70's nostalgia."
Unsolved,"Yeah this was at a time when local police departments had pretty limited reach. Meanwhile everyone in the country was watching the show. So for the first time you had amazing outcomes, with people being found that would never have been otherwise. That creates a pretty amazing cultural impact. Also Robert Stack and the theme music strike such a unique emotional balance. Truly unique across several generations"
Unsolved,They updated when they caught the Golden State Killer. I love that they’re still updating the mysteries when they’re solved.
Unsolved,"UPDATE: We still have no clue where this fucking guy is.

Gonna have to rewatch Baseketball now, thanks."
Unsolved,Yes! The reenactments were so sincerely done on UM. I feel like current true crime shows make the reenactments either intentionally cheesy or just plain bad.
Unsolved,It was the update coupled with the creepy ass Casio synth music and the 90s basic ass computer graphics.
Unsolved,"Child me got scared shitless at the blue girl ghost turning her head in the opening credits and would always close my eyes at that part.

I REALLY hated when it popped up unexpectedly during a supernatural-only Halloween special =("
Unsolved,"The genre is also just super saturated right now. 

Unsolved Mysteries had little real competition aside from news shows like 20/20, Dateline, etc. that all had a very different feel from it.  Now you have all sorts of D-tier networks like Investigation Discovery pumping true crime out around the clock and thousands of podcasts with different levels of amateurishness doing the same."
Unsolved,"As someone who’s not really into true crime, but might try it:

If they’re scraping the bottom of the barrel these days, then it’s probably better to watch older true crime, from a few years ago? 

What are some of the best true crime series, from the height of its popularity a few years ago?"
Unsolved,"That‘s not true crime though, that‘s drama series based on true stories."
Unsolved,"They were grainy because in the early seasons the show was shot on film, it looks pretty cheap now but it did give it a more respectable presentation at the time"
Unsolved,Baseketball doesn't get the love it deserves.  That film is comedic gold.
Unsolved,"""Open dammit, open!"""
Unsolved,There is an Unsolved Mysteries channel on Pluto TV.
Unsolved,"You’ve summed up a number of my criticisms with the current iteration. I was so excited for the new reboot and watched season 1, but dear god it has been a massive disappointment. Didn’t finish S2 or even bother with S3. 

I think the fact it went from 4-6 8-10 minute segments to one long form 40+ minute documentary style really hurts it. It’s too documentary style. No i don’t care about what kind of pancakes the victim made on the day of or how their house was a 1890s farmhouse. It just ends up with a lot of irrelevant information and rehashing details over and over again. The old UM, i think because they had to crank out so many segments with quick turnaround really understood how to be succinct and brief but convey enough information to describe a crime and the suspect."
Unsolved,"I still watch the new show, but you hit the nail on the head. It misses a lot of what made Unsolved Mysteries special imo."
Unsolved,You fall asleep to it? Unsolved Mysteries chills me to the bone in broad daylight.
Unsolved,"Winner winner right here.   
Had that as my ringtone years ago."
Unsolved,What was the story?
Unsolved,Better than anything that HLN/CNN/Investigation Discovery has put out in the last 20 years.
Unsolved,The theme music is fantastic
Unsolved,Might as well re-watch orgasmo also which is just as ridiculous.
Unsolved,I feel as if I have read/seen some actors talk about how they had early gigs doing UM reenactments.
Unsolved,"Don't forget that occasional ""grifter"" music that they played usually when someone was swindled. It was basically a saloon piano tune that would play during the reenactment. The synth music could definitely be unnerving though."
Unsolved,"The aforementioned original Unsolved Mysteries (which can be seen on PlutoTV and Peacock and even YouTube). 

Forensic Files

Americas Most Wanted (if you can find it?)"
Unsolved,I think podcasts are the best way to get into true crime right now. Tv stuff is dramatized now and doesn’t feel true
Unsolved,"Have you ever seen Orgazmo? Also Matt and Trey, also hilarious."
Unsolved,Right?  That shit used to terrify me as a kid. I could not watch it in the dark back then. I’m not even sure I could watch it in the dark now. Creepy AF.
Unsolved,"Yeah, it doesn’t make sense to me either. His voice is just soothing, I guess."
Unsolved,"Their first kid died, showed signs of poisoning by antifreeze, mom is convicted of the murder. She gets pregnant during the trial, while imprisoned the second kid is poisoned with the same symptoms, obviously can't be the mom. Turns out both kids had a one in a million genetic defect that looks like antifreeze poisoning but isn't.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia_Stallings"
Unsolved,"Oh I got no problem with that, but Robert Stack isn't in it."
Unsolved,One of those was Matthew McConaughey.
Unsolved,"I was delighted when, in a mystery that happened in the late 1800s, they overlaid a harmonica cover of one of the usual musical themes. It was very well done!"
Unsolved,"I’ll be honest, I think I remember that story! If it wasn’t that one, it was a different antifreeze story."
Unsolved,"That poor woman.  Jesus, what a sad story."
Unsolved,"Daniel Dae Kim (Lost, 24) also was kind of an extra in one reenactment."
Unsolved,"The Midnight Club, Guillermo del Toro's Cabinet of Curiosities, and now another volume of Unsolved Mysteries. Netflix is becoming THE source for spooky October stuff."
Unsolved,Finally! I was starting to fear that they canceled the show
Unsolved,How are the first 2 seasons?
Unsolved,Needs Robert Stack in a trench coat.
Unsolved,Gonna need someone to tell me what nine stories are being delved into so I can do some pre reading
Unsolved,They just need something for the second week and they got something for each week of the month.
Unsolved,"fantastic, but they are much different than when Robert Stack was hosting them. Instead of short multiple episodes, they have 1 hour long episodes that are more in-depth."
Unsolved,"The first one is ok.

The second was trash."
Unsolved,"I can't really think of another actor who would have the same voice and gravitas, and who would also be willing to do it."
Unsolved,Me too. But not too read into the mysteries before watching. There’s just some that freak me out way too much haha.
Unsolved,"I remember someone posting about how, out of all the new episodes, the only one that was truly special had to do with UFOs. I haven’t seen the new series but is there a UFO episode and is it actually that great?"
Unsolved,Ray Wise is the closest I can think of.
Unsolved,Lance Reddick is my go-to pick.
Unsolved,"We have the ability to deep fake him, so why not at this point."
Unsolved,"I didn't actually think the UFO one was that great aside from an unintentionally hilarious re-enactment, but I thought a couple other episodes were pretty strong."
Unsolved,Yes there is a very good episode on a big sighting with multiple witness accounts.
Unsolved,"> I haven’t seen the new series but is there a UFO episode and is it actually that great?

It was the worst episode of the entire two seasons..."
Unsolved,"Luckily for us, he is willing to do absolutely anything."
Unsolved,"I think Dennis Haysbert (Allstate guy, not mayhem) would be good"
Unsolved,Because that doesn't come with his voice and gravitas
Unsolved,I heard it was the best episode of both seasons….
Unsolved,I started watching the series back when it originally aired. So it was nice to get some answers from the creator of the show. If you like classic Leap this is definitely worth watching
Unsolved,Great tidbit re: Lee Harvey Oswald I never knew.
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,Club De Cuervos is a comedy gem.
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,Did you watch in Spanish or subbed?
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,Was looking to something to learn some spanish on. I applaud you for bringing this to my attention
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,I noticed about a month or two ago they had a ton of Spanish speaking shows and movies show up. About a year ago it was the same thing with Bollywood products.
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,Starting watching not long ago. Love it!
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,[deleted]
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,Yep. Three episodes so far. It has its moments.
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,"And all of them white Latin Americans. Just what I expected. They also had terrible Mexican accents. 

Interesting concept though, so I might still check it out. 

EDIT: I noticed that they named the personal assistant Hugo Sanchez. Subtle dig at Hugo Sanchez, the soccer star?"
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,[deleted]
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,No respect if you don't watch El Principe
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,Gran Hotel and El Internado are also available.  Gran Hotel is like Spanish Downton Abbey.  El Internado is a teen series inspired by Lost.
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,"Yeah, Netflix has been expanding its Spanish media, particularly from Spain."
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,But this is the first Netflix production made in Spanish.
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,Psh. Feels far less cheap than a Canadian sci-fi show.
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,"How can they have terrible Mex accents when most of the actors are Mexican? 

Don't be nitpicky just for the sake of it"
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,"Ajjajaja, what da fyck? Terrible mexican accents? And a lot of mexicans ARE white, just saying..."
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,What? The whole series is available. Where did you get that info? 
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,"> I will wait till the entire series is available for a weekend binge

[looks at post in confusion... goes back to watching episode 3.]"
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,i check it and do review afterwards
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,thanks for recommendation really appreciate this
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,Yess! Love the show. Cant wait
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,Yay!
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,Do you speak Spanish? I'm a native Spanish speaker and a fair amount seems to get lost in translation with the English subs.
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,I don’t. My native language isn’t even a latin based derivative. I find the show hilarious nonetheless. Partly because the comedy is very physical at points. And partly because it’s about football. I am sure i loose a lot of the tonal comedy as you said.
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,"Also as a native speaker, can I ask when Chava goes: “Heeenh!” sometimes, is that a regular expression in the spanish/mexican diaspora? Because that expression with that tone is very common for my native language, Bengali. "
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,"Have you seen The Ballad of Hugo Sanchez? It seems to lose a bit more, but it is hilarious.  I actually watched that one before Club de Cuervos."
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,Not that I  know of -  I think it is just a Chava thing. I lived in Mexico for 6 yrs and grew up in El Paso - I think it just one of his idiosyncrasies. 
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,I see. The expression and the tone is so similar to the Bengali “Heeenh!” that my wife and I found it incredibly amusing to the point we use “Heeenh! Hugo Sanchez” when we want to use the phrase.
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,"Haha, that's cute!
If you haven't seen it yet, watch The Ballad of Hugo Sanchez! Hugo's life is ridiculous!"
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,"I have! Loved it. Have to check out I, Potro"
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,Also funny!
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,This will also be the shows final season. I'm going to miss it after it's gone. No other show has make me love to hate their characters as much as this one
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,Yes!
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,I finished watching Saturday. It's a good one. Had me hooked. I really connected with Isabel this season and will totally miss Hugo Sanchez.  
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,¡Si! 
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,oh holy crap i forgot!
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,Can anyone share English subtitles for season 4?

Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,Netflix 
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,"I did watched it! Hugo is by far my favorite character in the show. As a matter of fact, I remember telling my brother, as we were binge watching the first season over a weekend: ""Bro, every single character in this show fucking sucks, I hate them... Except Hugo Sánchez. Hugo Sánchez Is the shit!!"""
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,"I actually watched Ballad of Hugo Sanchez first. He lives in fucking retirement home - he is crazy! I actually really like Zombie, too. 

I'm on e4s4 and I think those that haven't seen it are missing a wee bit of back story to this season. "
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,I thought season 1 was actually pretty good. Glad to hear it was renewed.
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,That was a great show. Can't wait for the sequel
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,"I watched it, I like it. Some of the dialog is a bit weird but overall not too bad. "
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,"Oh, I'm Mexican, and I was really esceptic of Club de Cuervos, and the first episode is horrible, the FX are horrible, Luis Gerardo Méndez is the same than in Nosotros Los Nobles, but, then, before the third episode it gets SO much better. There is when you notice is a different story than Nosotros Los Nobles, so, I really enjoy it, I just finish the season and I really want another one."
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,">Bedrock catches up with the Flintstone family two decades later, with Fred on the brink of retirement and 20-something Pebbles embarking on her own career. As the Stone Age gives way to a shiny and enlightened new Bronze Age, the residents of Bedrock will find this evolution harder than a swing from Bamm-Bamm’s club.

Cast:

* Elizabeth Banks as Pebbles
* Stephen Root as Fred

* Nicole Byer as Betty
* Joe Lo Trulio as Barney
* Manny Jacinto as Bam Bam."
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,"When someone inevitably comments “*Who wanted this?*”

It is I. I wanted a Flintstones animated reboot. 

Jetsons next, please, though that is overdue for its live action treatment that’s been collecting dust in Hollywood for ages."
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,"Sounds like an interesting concept. I'll check it out. I hope the art style is similar to the original style and not some unique off putting hybrid. 

>Joe Lo Truglio as Barney

I'm sold."
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,Manny Jacinto as Bam Bam is absolutely perfect casting
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,Wasn't Seth MacFarlane trying to develop a Flintstones reboot at one point?
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,Stephen Root is amazing.
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,Is this based on the comic where [Yabababadoo](https://loginportal.funnyjunk.com/comments/I+greatly+enjoyed+the+flintstones+comic+_3630d2d2c835f69a58fe8575740d3a76.jpg) is a nonsense phrase to help veterans deal with trama from the war?
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,Amy Sedaris is a national treasure. I will watch anything she is a part of.
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,"Whether this turns out to be good or not, if you are a Flintstones fan, you absolutely owe it to yourself to read the DC comic by Steve Pugh!

It's such a truly fantastic retelling of the story and creates a very nuanced and much more interesting Bedrock."
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,"I hope they take inspiration from the recent Flintstones Comics, which really delved into modern issues as reflected in the weird Paleolithic pastiche of The Flintstones universe. [Like Fred's pals Adam and Steve.](https://imgur.com/gallery/1sb55)

It's a fantastic satire."
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,Hire Mark Russell!! His 12 issue comic series on them is GOLD!
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,Elizabeth Banks and Manny Jacinto as the adult pebbles and bambam makes so much sense in a way I really can't explain.
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,Alright. This sounds really cool.
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,Of wow it’s happening. Last time I heard of a flinstones reboot it was sarah underwood on attack of the show on G4 announced that Seth MacFarlane was going to run it. Then right after that Kevin Pereira made a fun adult comment that went over my too young boy brain.
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,"Hope it takes some inspiration from the 2010s DC Comics reimagining of the Flintstones, which I recommend people check out."
Club de Cuervos Presents: The Ballad of Hugo Sánchez,Yo that cast looks bonkers! Bortles!

Hajime No Ippo: Rising,I'm so mad that they only dubbed season one. I'll have to go back and finish the series at some point.
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,Ippo!! 
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,Sewson 2 is on YouTube 
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,[deleted]
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"Boba Fett feels like the least structured show I've seen in a while. That being said I don't hate it. It's just ""Here's an hour of Star Wars"" once a week rather than an actual show."
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"Well sure, the last two episodes have actually been the first two episodes of the next season of The Mandalorian!"
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"I still don’t get the point of The Book of Boba Fett. I don’t necessarily mean that in a bad way, because I’ve liked a lot of this show so far, but it’s been hard for me to get a sense of the direction the show is going in, and it’s ultimate purpose. Why does Boba Fett care so much about being a crime lord on Tatooine? Why is Mando, Luke, and Grogu all of a sudden stealing the spotlight? Why should I care about the Pyke Syndicate, and who controls the spice? It’s certainly enjoyable, but a large portion of the show has felt like it’s just been spinning its wheels."
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"Cobra Kai continues to blend the serious and cheese seamlessly. A great fun show. Every one should be due for a big raise in season 5, so time for Netflix to kill it."
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"Not interested in this show, but should I watch the last 2 episodes? They have gotten crazy praise but I dont want to watch the first 4"
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,Hopefully this will put to bed that there’s not enough of a character in Boba Fett to propagate a stand-alone show. I’ve always been of the mind that Fett should’ve remained a mystery. Cameo the character but we don’t need full expositories about him. Here we see that happening. We all want to like this show but it’s been a failure to launch until the Mando and the other guy showed up.
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,Boba is god awful.  Favreau clearly didn’t have his heart in this one.  It needs to be put out of its misery.
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,I would like this show better if it was about Boba Fett.
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"Unsurprising.

The show basically stopped telling a story, however boring it was, in favor of doing your weekly hour of SW fan service for the past two episodes.

Since the fan base just can’t get enough memberries, it was a safe bet that the ratings would blow up."
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,Nostalgia is one hell of a drug people will watch shit like Boba Fett all for the love of StarWars😂
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"Oh I thought shows that released all at once were only popular for the first week. That's what reddit would have me believe. But this article shows a bunch of Netflix shows still being very popular several weeks after they released, even moreso than a weekly release show from a huge franchise."
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,All they had to do was remove the main character and wham!!! Instant success
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"Probably because people are hearing its now about a character we actually care about

Boba got shafted in his own show and I don't even care, it's better without him and that's a problem."
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"""Apologies! ^Apologies..."""
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"I’m starting to think this series was originally penned as The Mandelorean season 3, where the intent was to cut back and forth between Mando and Boba doing their own things “Game of Thrones” style before finally converging on Tatooine for the big end of season showdown.

But then somewhere down the line someone at Lucasfilm thought (probably rightfully) that people watched The Mandelorean for *The Mandelorean* and was worried about splitting the focus so heavily. So they just front loaded the series with the Boba storyline and slapped “The Book of Boba Fett” on the title card.

That would explain why these last few episodes have focused almost entirely on Mando and Fett has been in approximately 30 seconds of his own show."
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"It’s such an oddly paced and structured show, especially when the last 2 episodes barely featured Boba Fett at all. Jumping between timelines could have been interesting, but they didn’t do a good job of making the past and present timelines equally compelling. And I think too many flashbacks slowed down the pace. Tonally the show is all over the place. The show goes from really cheesy speeder chases, to gritty fight sequences, and then a lighthearted training montage. It also feels like the show is just getting started. Like the first 6 episodes were all just setup, and now the story is going to kick into high-gear. It feels like this show needs another 4 or 5 episodes. But there’s only 1 more episode. I’m left wondering how they’re going to wrap all of this up in 60 minutes or less. I hope the finale isn’t just one giant tease for Mando season 3, or some other future spin-off."
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"The structure and storytelling is not only weird from episode to episode but also just scene to scene. Even in these last two episodes which were good, you will have one great scene and then the next scene will feel so out of place you are wondering if the editor made a mistake."
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,I'm down with an hour of Star wars a week. Also think they're going to reveal that Fett is the one that saved grogu.
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"It's a let down. Love the last two eps, but how can we really say they're from the same show? Boba didn't say a word lmao. I feel bad for Temuera. Can't really complain tho with who they brought in yesterday."
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"Star Wars has been quite successful with that unstructured “remember this thing” style, why change what works? There was no place for Luke obviously but hey guys remember empire?"
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,Its surprise Mandalorian
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"> Boba Fett feels like the least structured show I've seen in a while. That being said I don't hate it. It's just ""Here's an hour of Star Wars"" once a week rather than an actual show.

People complain like crazy about Boba Fett, and the Mandalorian too, for lacking direction. I think they're really enjoyable for what they are. An hour of star wars, like you said. Is the acting incredible? No. Is the story groundbreaking? No. But they do have decently interesting characters in a very interesting world, just like all of Star Wars.

Plus the cinematography and music for both of these series is fantastic. I've enjoyed pretty much every episode."
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"It reminds of those Star Wars short story anthology books (eg Tales From Jabba’s Palace). Just flavor, Star Wars background, and Easter eggs to flesh out the universe."
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"Calling it Book of Boba Fett seems like a marketing mistake after the recent episodes. Give it a different name, cut the first four episodes down to one, and it seems like it'd generate a lot more excitement.

Or, Disney didn't want a big release gap between Hawkeye and Moon Knight, so we got Book of Boba Fett's first four episodes of something."
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"I bet the Spice is controlled by Emelia Clarkes character from Solo, since Maul died in Rebels it can't be him"
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,And the whole spice thing just feels like it’s directly stolen from Dune.
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"I feel like there is going to be a big reveal in the finale whereby the pykes are not the ones pulling the strings, and are just muscle."
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"To be honest, I don't know how much more story there is to tell. There's only so many ways for the main 4 to break up and date, the rest of the kids to split and join other dojos."
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,Your last sentence. So sad yet so true lmao
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,The last two episodes are essentially Mandalorian episodes.
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"Yes, watch episode 5 and 6 (probably 7) if you're a fan of the Mandalorian. The previous episodes are a mixed bag imo and mostly not great but they have some good stuff. Episode 5 and 6 are probably my favourite all time Star Wars things, including all of the movies."
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"For better or worse the two episodes have almost nothing to do with the rest of the show, and a lot to do with Mando and other star wars content."
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"Yes, you definitely should - especially if you like The Mandalorian. They have almost nothing to do with the previous 4 episodes and are night and day better than them. 

That being said, the biggest criticism is that they have almost nothing to do with Boba Fett in a show called 'The Book of Boba Fett' but imo that's a good thing because the first 4 episodes were like watching paint dry."
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"I will get downvoted to oblivion, but I hated the last two episodes for a number of reasons (even though I understand why people liked them), number 1 is the mere fact that just halting a show (Boba) to suddenly insert 2 episodes of a different show (Mandalorian) is just absolutely insanely wrong, no matter how good or bad the original show was.     

If you liked the mandalorian and are planning to see the rest of it though, the last two episodes are pretty much mandatory and you can just watch those two as stand alones."
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"Yes, that's what I did and still enjoyed it."
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"The last two are textbook examples of Star Wars being creatively bankrupt.

If you like pointing at the screen or crying because of “things you know”, then boy howdy are you in for a ride."
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,[deleted]
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"It's not all bad, doing a Last Samurai type story with the Tuskan Raiders was kind of cool and having him become a crime lord is a good idea but the execution of the character is bad. He should be a bad ass with a lifetime worth of experience as a bounty hunter and crime person. They don't show him being that. Everyone is always 2 steps ahead of Fett and every time he fights he gets fucked up and barely survives because another character saves his ass. And his crime lord instincts suck. They could have made him this imposing crime boss, respected and feared. Maybe a Tony Soprano type. Always seems to have a plan, always knows what to do, never cross him. I dunno, he's just a lame character."
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,Given the reception to the past couple episodes vs the first 4 I kinda think you wouldn’t.
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"I wish I could like the boba parts more cause they really seem to have drip the ball in writing him. Mando episodes are like night and day in quality, but it’s still mind boggling they’re in boba’s series!"
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,Which is ironic given the fact that giving Boba Fett a show in the first place was already peak fan service.
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,[deleted]
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"Wait, do i need to watch this to keep up with whats going to happen in season 3 of The Mandelorean?"
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,I wonder if the Mandelorean drives a Dolorean?? 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"I think this is a great theory with possibly some truth in it somewhere.

Otherwise if this was always their plan, then some needs to get the head checked, cos the pacing and show story progression is completely fucked"
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"Why do you keep spelling Mandolorian wrong, even though Mandolorians are know characters, it is the name of a show, etc.

Apologies if it’s a language barrier thing, but that doesn’t seem like it would make sense.

Edit:  Downvote away, but I wasn’t trying to be mean (and my own misspell was pointed out and acknowledged).  I was honestly curious where the “ean” spelling came from… maybe it’s spelled that way in other countries, I don’t know, so I asked a question."
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,It doesn't feel like it was written as episodes. Different storylines were written seperately. Then they just cut it up and edited it all together as episodes.
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"I don't mind any of it (other than the bike chase scene. Yikes.). But yeah it's really not the Boba Fett show at all for the last two weeks. It's hard to reconcile that. Might as well have called it ""Star Wars stories"" or something."
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"I mean, if nothing else, it’s true to form— he barely talks on screen in the OT either"
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"Spice, prophetic hallucinations, desert tribe takes in outsider who comes from water planet, tribe is at first hostile but later teaches outsider their ways, outsider makes/is given weapon that has special meaning to desert tribe, desert tribe is murdered by people who control spice trade, outsider seeks revenge on group that murdered desert tribe. Yup, very derivative of Dune. They weren’t even trying to be subtle about it."
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,It was very directly stolen from Dune
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,So we're just all going to pretend that those plot elements of Dune aren't based on any real life circumstances at all and only Dune stories are allowed to have spice trading in a desert setting? Even though spice trading is also mentioned in star wars before this?
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"it even looks exactly like the last DUNE movie's spice, like orange/gold shiny dust"
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,It’s not over until Hillary Swank shows up.
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,Apart from the final scene I thought episode 6 was just ok. Episode 5 was way better and the episode with the train was at least as good.
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,JFC I felt like I was the only one who felt this way. Thank you for showing me I'm not alone.
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,">The show basically stopped telling a story, however boring it was, in favor of doing your weekly hour of SW fan service for the past two episodes.  
>  
>Since the fan base just can’t get enough memberries, it was a safe bet that the ratings would blow up.

Conversely I actively dislike Boba Fett. He's always been overrated. He got defeated by a blind guy with a pool stick. Writing him off his own shown is bizarre but fine."
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"Funny enough the problem is the same that plagued the pre-Disney Expanded Universe. Authors liked *their* characters, so even in multi-book, multi-author series, they would effectively ignore characters from other books to make *their* guys more important. Similarly, Filoni likes putting *his* characters in everything. Does it make sense in the current setting? No, maybe not, but who gives a shit, I want *my guy* in this scene."
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,STRONG AGREE
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,A crime lord needs to do crime.  That's the missing piece of the Boba Fett as a crime lord.
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"I agree with you 100%. I think they’re making him a more “available” character for future use, too. If he was a ruthless, highly skilled bounty hunter from the jump (like he was sold to us in the original trilogy), he wouldn’t be a rounded character at all."
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"I feel like the character’s story is being told in reverse, mistakenly. He was supposed to be *complete* in Jedi. He was *already* a badass. He was *already* a very trained, very skilled bounty hunter. He was called on by Vader because of this and his being able to deliver Solo. If anything, it should be HIM training Din and others. Like you said, he’s like a powerless, untrained character in this show but it’s supposed to take place after Jedi. It doesn’t make sense. It also doesn’t help that the actor likely can’t do a lot of this stuff IRL due to age and lack of conditioning/strength. Neither mandalorian actor gives a menacing presence. I’d have much rather seen a ruthless warrior become a crime lord, then maybe introduce a hero’s journey that gives him some humanity and agency to act in that humanity. Not have him be a complete pud in his own show."
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"It should have been an easy slam dunk for fan nostalgia, but they tried to make “being a crime lord” some morally defendable and positive action."
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"The whole franchise is “made for dedicated fans” at this point, which has become a complete detriment to storytelling. Literally cannot go *5 episodes of a miniseries* without wheeling out crap you remember.

There’s nothing wrong with doing fanservice every now and again, but there’s an entire universe to explore, and I’d personally like to see them be able to tell a story, even a bad one, for a full season without needing to say *oMg LoOk GuYz, ItZ (character you know)!!!1!1!1!*"
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"Episode 6 wasn’t made for dedicated fans it was made for casual fans. Dedicated fans know who characters from clone wars are, but the majority of people watching the live action stuff are not dedicated fans and either are only somewhat aware of a couple clone wars characters from a wiki/meme or don’t know them at all. But everyone even the casual fans remembers yoda training luke."
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"Yes, no one expected this but it essentially contains significant plot developments for the Mandalorian. It's literally Mando season 2.5 with some Boba content. That's why the first and second half of the show feel like completely different shows and somewhat disjointed."
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"The last two episodes, yes, absolutely. In essence, this is season 3."
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"Episodes 5 and 6 are literally episodes of the Mandalorian in everything but name, and they're AMAZING episodes. Boba Fett doesn't even appear in ep5, and he appears in 1 scene in ep6 with like 10 seconds of screen time and no dialogue.

Episode 7 comes out next week and will probably be essential viewing too. You could honestly skip the first 4 episodes if you really want to, and that's not something I'd normally say."
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"100% 

The last two episodes are purely Mandolorian

You could probably skip to them,  ignoring the first 4 and not be lost at all"
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,The show basically turned into season 3 of the Mandalorian half way through the show.
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,You'd think they would have force powers because their blood is filled with midoclorians.
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"Yeah, he [cruises Mos Espa in it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqiasBVGtX8)"
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"I suspect they hit roadblocks with Covid restrictions, and had to consolidate multiple projects into making a full season."
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"Ironically, you just spelled Mandalorian incorrectly."
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,[deleted]
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"“Star Wars Stories” is a cool idea actually. 10 ep season, an hour each set at some point in the history of Star Wars. All eps are stand alone adventures. Each with different writers and directors with their own takes on the universe. Maybe one ep is set in the prequel era, next is set 10,000 years before that. They could be epic space battles or smaller intimate stories about a couple of people. 

I’d love to see that! What if they got Lucas out of retirement to direct one... I’d lose my shit"
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"I've enjoyed every episode well enough. I'm not in love, but its still worth watching. 

Everything except that chase. Oh my god how did that ever get made so poorly."
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"There's a difference between lack of dialogue to induce a mysterious intrigue, and lack of dialogue due to never showing up."
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,Dune was written in 1965.
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"I know, right? We need to complete the Karate Kid timeline, so to speak."
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"You are not wrong on the irony. But I still think it sets a terrible precedent. The problem is, people are happy because the show was dull, when not hilariously bad. But what if the show were great, and you couldn't wait for the plot to unfold, only to get it stopped like this for 2 episodes, with just the finale left to wrap up?      
It's just a bad way to handle a show imho."
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"Oh the old canon absolutely had that problem. *I, Jedi* is Michael Stackpole’s licensed fan fiction.

I wouldn’t even mind if it was “I want *my guy* in this scene”, but the show has just totally gone overboard by once again bringing back >!Luke Skywalker!<. It’s like ever since Last Jedi’s fandom menace debacle, they have been desperately shoehorning the character into all sorts of places he isn’t needed just to get brownie points

Feels so sterile and corporate"
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,He literally went from being warned “no disintegrations” to telling Finnic “isn’t that a little heavy handed?” when she flashes a gun to intimidate someone
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,[deleted]
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"Disney refuses to let any of their main characters be even slightly in the wrong and it's really, really tiring."
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"Yeah exactly. Even if they wanted to make him a reformed good guy who worked for Vader but now wants to do good in his old age, at least show that he's capable and that he's lived this bad ass life. There have been plenty of times where he needed to flex and do some dirty work in the name of good and he still gets his ass kicked in. It's just poor character design."
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"A show about Boba Fett isn't any less ""memberberries"" than a show about The Mandalorian. It is a show about ""character you know,"" interacting with other characters you know on planet you know.

The more valid thing people are complaining about is the show randomly pivoting from being about one character to being about another character. While switching horses midstream was a baffling decision that probably reflects some behind-the-scenes drama, the execution was so much better in the last two episodes than the first four that it's really hard for me to complain.

I wasn't invested in Boba Fett's story, not because he was a new character but because of the aimless storytelling and weak characterization. And while there was plenty of fan service and call-backs, just like there was in the first four episodes, it was done in ways that made sense and moved the story forward, so I can't complain.

I was skeptical of the idea of re-introducing Luke, especially since his deepfake was so rough last season, but I was pleasantly surprised with how good the scenes with Luke and Grogu were. People don't just like The Mandalorian because it has callbacks, they like it because it's the best and most original live-action Star Wars entity since the original trilogy. Anyone who's so allergic to callbacks that they get mad just seeing familiar characters should probably do themselves a favor and stop watching anything from a long-running franchise. There's plenty of new stuff out there, I promise!"
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,The Tusken Raider parts were really good in the first few episodes though.
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"I counted and Boba's gamorrean guard has only four less seconds of screen time in episode six, but at least two grunty speaking lines. Imagine being upstaged by a gamorrean."
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,Boba fetts race is a midichlorian?
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"Ha, so I did.  I’ll blame it on him commonly being called “Mando,” so my brain wants to spell it with an “o.”"
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"I suspect Covid restrictions left them having to combine different partially-shot projects so at least there'd be a ""season"" of content."
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,Right?!
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"You essentially just described an anthology, so if you haven't already you might want to check out that Star Wars anime anthology that came out a few months ago.  A lot of it was wildly not canon, but it was still different writers and studios all doing unique takes on Star Wars."
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"Agreed, i like it enough to keep tuning in.

What was with that chase scene? Lets have some mopeds do a 20 mile an hour pastiche of chase scene clichés on power ranger bikes. Who thought that made any sense at all?"
Hajime No Ippo: Rising,"Oh, yeah, man; sorry, I was joking"
Marlon,"I really enjoyed the first season of this show, I’m glad they are renewing it. Though I am surprised, because it was seriously underrated and not a lot of people actually watched it, in comparison to some other original shows that have been cancelled in the past for seemingly no reason. Like Sense 8 and the OA for instance."
Marlon,"Geez, I actually forgot this was a series. When did it premiere? 2021? So almost 2 years and still no official premiere date?"
Marlon,"The comics were so good and while different and kind of watered down I did enjoy the series. 
I’d like to see someone do Lemire’s “Black Hammer” series in animated form like Invincible."
Marlon,I had no idea this got renewed
Marlon,I was watching Cocaine Bear and trying to figure out where I knew the boy from. About halfway through the movie I snapped that's Sweet Tooth! He was really good as a kinda annoying friend to the sheriff's daughter. Plus hearing him swear was funnier after I knew he was Sweet Tooth
Marlon,This better be about Twisted metal...
Marlon,when is it airing?
Marlon,S2 wrapped a while ago. It's taking forever to get an official release date.
Marlon,It's also produced by Warner Bros. I assume the only reason it wasn't written off was because it's on Netflix instead of HBO Max.
Marlon,These kids are going to have aged so much lol
Marlon,"I would love a black hammer universe on tv, I think the only way to do it justice is probably animated. Someone will probably make a shitty live action version at some point and will never be able to flesh it out, which is a huge bummer."
Marlon,"It doesn't say. Just 2023, if that's true"
Marlon,[deleted]
Marlon,It was already filmed. This is just the announcement.
Marlon,Live action definitely would not work. They should go animated and insert fake ads for Punch Socklingham merch.
Marlon,Legit the only thing I miss about traditional cable. The long wait between season for streaming shows is *rough*.
Marlon,"I don’t think it’s unadaptable on screen, but I think it would take a shitload of money and no studio would put that much into it. That is a great idea though"
Marlon,Shame he's not in the upcoming Dungeons and Dragons film. Hopefully he'll be in the sequel.
Marlon,He was absolutely incredible in Requiem For A Dream.
Marlon,He's actually a good actor when he just plays an actual character. I couldn't stand him for the longest time so that's not easy to admit.
Marlon,Marlon Bundo really is a terrific name for a bunny.
Marlon,I absolutely love the way that man spends HBOs money
Marlon,People are buying books in protest. That's way fucking cooler than burning them. 
Marlon,"Interesting that if you search for ""Marlon Bundo"" on Amazon currently, Oliver's book has 2500+ reviews and 5 stars, while Pence's has only 56 reviews and 4 1/2 stars, yet Pence's is listed first. I wonder how the order is determined."
Marlon,If there ever were a fly-on-the-wall moment it would have been when Pence get briefed that a talk show host has made his beloved bunny gay in a children's book.
Marlon,"Top notch review: 

> 1.0 out of 5 stars: I don’t actually dislike this book at all, I just wanted the upset homophobes to read my comment as they scour the one star section for appeasement. This book is great for kids to learn about acceptance, I recommend it as all proceeds are donated.

Marlon,"*Proceeds from the book's sales go to benefit LGBT crisis hotline The Trevor Project, and the audiobook version from Audible features celebrities like RuPaul, Jim Parsons, and Jesse Tyler Ferguson.*

This is expert level trolling by Oliver."
Marlon,This happens every time John Oliver touches something. His fake church got tens of thousands in donations and his Make Donald Drumpf Again hats sold out almost instantly.
Marlon,Are we still calling this the Colbert effect?

Marlon,You have no idea how much drama this freaking rabbit has caused in the bunny community. Never thought I'd get banned over politics in a group thay makes bun memes lol.
Marlon,Cool.
Marlon,I'm out of the loop here. Any help?
Marlon,"That rabbit is dynamite!

I can barely express how happy I am over this. And even moreso because Oliver's book is not just a bunch of juvenile ""fuck you, Pence"" satire, it's a genuine children's story of love, tolerance, acceptance, joy...you know, REAL family values, not the smarmy exclusionary hate Pence and his followers peddle. And all the proceeds of the book are going towards helping kids who have been persecuted for the way they were born.

FUCK the self-righteous religious assholes like Pence who spread this stuff. Bury them, Bundo!

"
Marlon,"I wouldn't be surprised if someday Marlon Bundo was a staple cultural icon representing homosexuality, all because John Oliver wanted to make a point and insult Mike Pence."
Marlon,"check out John's appearance on The Ellen Show today where he talks about the book

https://www.ellentube.com/video/john-olivers-childrens-book-trolls-the-vice-president.html#"
Marlon,"John Oliver is trying to highlight how Pence is against gay marriage. Dont understand why people find what John is saying offensive. Regarding Pences book, it will now sell more because of this controversy. So everyone benefits.
Edit- Corrected Spelling."
Marlon,Lots of 5* Amazon reviews on the other book tearing Oliver down for attacking a child author.
Marlon,"I just tried to get a copy off Amazon earlier. Says it's out until further notice. I would normally never spend $20 bucks on a kids book...but goddamn, it was just too damn good not to. Piss off Mike Pence, donate to good causes, and have a kid friendly way to teach tolerance and love to my 3 year old....how can I not? Plus, 
God, I love John Oliver. "
Marlon,"Ah, there are times I wish I was living in the USA... my country doesn’t have Amazon(for good reasons thought...).

That book has some cute illustrations! And I could give it to the kid of a mormon neighbour."
Marlon,Still hilarious that Mike Pence of all people would name a bunny after a guy who was in all likelihood bisexual. 
Marlon,"https://youtu.be/CW_UQL2gm7w
Cool video from The Ellen show on the book"
Marlon,I bought a hard cover copy yesterday and it arrives sometime in April. 
Marlon,I bought it she second he mentioned it. Because... well you know why...
Marlon,"John Oliver is such a troll its incredible. The amazing thing is that his actions aren't to cause chaos or discomfort for a laugh. His actions are to make a positive impact which is commendable.
"
Marlon,"Actually now that someone mentioned it, I wonder what type of person Charlotte Pence (person who wrote book) actually is? Articles say she is a film maker and writer so that seems more secular, would like to know where she stands on LGBT rights as apparently part of her book profits are going towards art therapy and human trafficking charities. 

"
Marlon,I bought mine!
Marlon,"A [one star review](https://i.imgur.com/fUFcaet.png):

>I don’t actually dislike this book at all, I just wanted the upset homophobes to read my comment as they scour the one star section for appeasement. This book is great for kids to learn about acceptance, I recommend it as all proceeds are donated.


Hilarious!!"
Marlon,Happy I got it before it sold out!
Marlon,It's crazy that the conscience of America is a British comedy anchor.
Marlon,Bought it this morning. 
Marlon,"bunnicula
"
Marlon,Dammit.. I hope there’s a second printing. I wanted one of those.
Marlon,The episode itself was amazing 
Marlon,"I got mine on Audible. I feel a little guilty because it was like, $2 - so not much to charity. Maybe I'll make an extra donation."
Marlon,I hope Pence doesn't subject his rabbit to shock therapy because of this. 
Marlon,[deleted]
Marlon,I bought one
Marlon,"I don't watch Oliver's show, nor do I know much about the Vice President and his family, but... he's lampooning the Vice President's kids' pet rabbit because he doesn't like the Vice President?  Like, his kids' pet is a political attack vector now?  "
Marlon,"Unpopular opinion: John Oliver is a dick.

Mike Pence didn't write the book, his 24-year old daughter did with the illustration by his wife. The Pence book was completely apolitical and to ridicule an educational children's book and turn it into something controversial and partisan is beneath him.

I don't agree with Mike Pence politics but there's just something sad about a grown man and his team of writers going after a young author because he doesn't like what her Dad thinks. 

Charlotte Pence was able to show more class than the entire Oliver team

>“Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery,” she said. “His book is contributing to charities I think we can all get behind. We have two books that are giving to charities that are about bunnies, so I’m all for it.”

Please John leave these guys families alone.

edit: this comment has become pretty controversial. I've heard some interesting points but I still stand by the feeling that a politician's family should be left alone. Chelsea Clinton wrote several children's books and I don't know of any conservative commentators trying to pull the kind of stunts that Oliver did.

We all need to decide what kind of political discourse we want our country to have. Do we want a discourse where we challenge ideas and arguments not people and definitely not their families? Or do we want a pissing ad hominem contest where we will be more aganist people than anything else and where nothing is out of bounds? This situation with Oliver pushes us more towards the latter. 

I don't know anything about Charlotte Pence. It could have been her life dream to become a children's book writer and Oliver tried to stump out her efforts because he didn't like what her Dad thinks about gay people. That is sad. He should apologize."
Marlon,"Mike Pence supports Focus on the Family, which among other things advocates for ""conversion therapy"" for gay youths. It's ""pray away the gay,"" but now with electroshock therapy. Mike Pence has disavowed his belief in conversion therapy, but when he was running for Congress in 2000 he did call for adding a stipulation to the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources to direct funding towards ""institutions which provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior."" Gee, I wonder which institutions that might be.

Stuff like this is why people shouldn't forget what kind of person Mike Pence is, what his values are, and how aggressively he would like to push them on the American people. If John Oliver can point that out, sell books, donate to charities that want to save LGBTQ children's lives instead of basically torturing and persecuting them, hey. He can have my $20 because by supporting him, I also get to flip the bird to Mike Pence. Nice bonus along with the book."
Marlon,My wife ordered it last night. 4-5 weeks out. Totally worth the wait.
Marlon,"So he wrote a book where he called the Vice President's kids' pet bunny gay Hilarious.

What a deep political statement, what biting satire. And because of Trump Derangement Syndrome, people are buying it in droves. Some of them the same people who complain about America turning into Idiocracy, but hey lets troll Mike Pence for the memes.

...Even though Mike Pence didn't even write the original bunny book, his daughter did. The proceeds from her book go to helping fight human trafficking and to a children's hospital, its not about gays at all.

While its probably just another thing for him to virtue signal about, at least the proceeds are going to charity."
Marlon,"I always enjoy helping people. So I tend to like liberal ideas, but as I got older somehow I began to hate the ""liberal collective"" while still liking many of the ideas. This story  is why. If Mike Pence's book wasn't for charity I wouldn't care, but it is. And it's very important charities that these people thought through. John Oliver just cobbled together a bunch of stuff, not to help people, but squarely to piss off Pence. It's disgusting. I know Pence has some opinions that aren't great, many would say bad, but he was doing a good thing for people who needed it. It made me smile knowing we can all do some good for the world in our own way. And John Oliver shit all over it and those charities. And reddit cheered. I'll take my downvotes but this isn't funny, it's just sad.  So many ""Progressive liberals"" are just so goddamn vain it's heart wrenching. 

Edit: I'm aware Oliver's book to charity. It doesn't change the fact he turned a kindhearted charity book into a meanspirited debacle to show how ""morally corrupt"" Pence, which is fairly ironic. Or maybe Oliver is just a jackass, I'm not really sure. He doesn't have to shit on another book to give to charity, but he chose to. And that is what I'm upset about. "
Marlon,"Waiting for his next book ""tales from the echo chamber"""
Marlon,"First he called him Drumpf

Then he made the VP's pet rabbit gay

Where will this madman stop? Surely this will cause the administration to fall if he isn't contained "
Marlon,"That makes two of us :( 
"
Marlon,My bunny's name is Bunny Leone 
Marlon,I bought the audio book just so I could hear all those great voice actors reading a children's book. 
Marlon,Brilliant. 
Marlon,Anyone ask Comey how he feels about getting beat out by a bunny book written as a bit for a late night show?
Marlon,Is anybody going to talk about the fact that Oliver got all of his buds to write bad reviews about a book about a bunny. All because the author (Pence’s daughter) doesn’t agree with his opinions. Seems sad to me. 
Marlon,"ITT: partisan retards flinging shit at each other

This is our future and we’re screwed. "
Marlon,I bought one for my kids before the live show ended. And another for a gift to a MAGA friend's kids. 
Marlon,Are there any mainstream same-sex romance children's books?  Or do publishers frown on them?
Marlon,Fuck Mike Pence. 
Marlon,[removed]
Marlon,I got mine!
Marlon,Charlotte Pence’s response on instagram was golden. I have great respect for her now. 
Marlon,What a smart (and adorable) counter-point.
Marlon,"John Oliver is so cool. I love everything he does. I hope he stays on the air for a long time. Hopefully it's something he enjoys doing. Sorry to Trevor Noah but John Oliver really is the spiritual successor to John Stewart.

Edit: names"
Marlon,"Take that wife and daughter of Mike Pence! 
Good to see John Oliver taking out the real power players."
Marlon,"I'm not a fan of his humor, but I am a fan of what this man does and how many people he informs. This man is helping this country. "
Marlon,"That was a great episode! I must say, he has done a great job at bringing awareness to many things (political or otherwise) over the years, thanks John :)"
Marlon,"Leftist: Love Trumps Hate ❤️❤️❤️

Leftist: Haha John Olivers book picking on Pence family using their pet rabbit is tots hilarious 😂🤣😂🖕🏻🖕🏻 take that bigots!!!"
Marlon,[removed]
Marlon,"Hey way to dunk on a woman donating proceeds from her sweet children's book to charities that help with child sex trafficking because you don't like one of her relatives. Honestly very confused by the left sometimes. Weird, weird bunch. At least Charlotte was pretty cool about it, which is the opposite of any way John Oliver has ever behaved towards anyone. "
Marlon,"I hated Ellen's challenge there: 

* Do this challenge, because it will look good on TV. Race for how many books you can pass out and how much money you can collect.

* Okay, so however much money you raised is meaningless anyway, because we had already decided we were going to give this set amount.

* Oh, and the number of books you passed out is meaningless too because we're giving everyone a copy."
Marlon,I have such strong feelings for this man. My love is deep like the ocean and this makes me so happy. Heart eyes all day long. 
Marlon,I want this guy to be as successful as he can be :) such an amazing guy
Marlon,"I really need to figure out how to cash in on the Trump administration hate.  

If I made toilet sanitary sheets that resembled Trump's face that allowed you to shit in his open mouth, would that be something you people would buy?"
Marlon,Am I the only here that thinks it's kind of a dick move to hijack a childrens book for political purposes?
Marlon,John Oliver is the best kind of troll.
Marlon,hopefully it comes back in stock soon. I would love to gift one to my hardcore born again christian cousin. Her son loves bunnies. 
Marlon,I was fortunate enough to get a copy and it’s a good book.  I’m currently looking to for a charity auction I can donate it to as they are currently sold out.  I like the idea of the book continuing to raise money for good causes like the Trevor Project.  If anyone reading this knows of such an auction please PM me.
Marlon,[deleted]
Marlon,"This will certainly stop Trump and pence this time, right? "
Marlon,WOOOHOOOO! I got one and can't wait to read it!!
Marlon,Congrats to everyone on that project. The show deserves all of it's past and future accolades. Every season keeps getting better
Borges,"The fact that this dude is Klyden, The Butcher of Anderson Station from Expanse, and Cutty from The Wire just blows my mind."
Borges,"I sure hope so. There's still the issue of Ed's daughter on Krill and the Krill-Moclan alliance, plus whatever story-of-the-week content they can come up with."
Borges,"If it happens, great! More is good.

If it doesn't, at least they wrapped the series up well enough and didn't do a fucking cliffhanger like the majority of the dumbass showrunners do now right before they're canceled."
Borges,"Coleman:

>”We’re all in the loop and out of the loop. We think it’s gonna happen, but it’s still up in the air. There’s so much going on with all of these studios that it’s just like, ‘Well, we gotta settle this thing first, then we can really decide on that thing.’ A bunch of that is going on. We hope so. Seth has an amazing relationship with Dana [Walden] and with Disney, who’s running it now. And they said they’ve had promising meetings, so we’ll see.”"
Borges,Fingers crossed
Borges,[Hoooray for you!!!](https://media.tenor.com/X6Us_qE7VNoAAAAC/orville-hooray.gif)p
Borges,They released the actors 10 months before the first episode started to air for season 3. To get them all back would be incredibly hard.
Borges,If it took this long chances must be pretty damn thin.
Borges,"Season 3 was so good. I don’t understand why they would acquire a good show, release an even better season, then dump it"
Borges,If nothing else can we get a better ending than that weird shit they gave us.
Borges,"There are shows out there with far better ratings getting canceled, I seriously doubt Orville is going to get a 4th season.  Just accept it and move on."
Borges,"watch it again on Disney+ 

tell your friends.

&#x200B;

**Will There Be a Season 4 of 'The Orville'? That Seems to Depend on if Fans Continue to Support the Show**

https://www.distractify.com/p/the-orville-season-4

This major shift in direction as well as the transition from Fox to Hulu has left some questioning the future of the show. Now that Hulu is being consolidated under the Disney umbrella, The Orville will begin streaming on Disney Plus. **According to Seth MacFarlane, who spoke with fans about the potential future for The Orville at San Diego Comic-Con, whether there is a fourth season will depend on how well the show does in reruns on Disney Plus.**"
Borges,All the things I liked about the show trailed off during second season. Glad others are still enjoying it and what it has developed into. It employs some really great people.
Borges,"Hope so. They changed the tone of the show a bit, but I like what they're doing with it.

While it's still a little funny, I *do* kinda miss the silly jokes..."
Borges,"Lost my way on this show at some point, but the first couple of seasons were fun and enjoyable."
Borges,This show is so good. Each episode is maybe a little long is my only complaint but I respect what they do so much. I hope it keeps going. I will watch every episode please.
Borges,"I would love a fourth season of the show, but I won't be upset if it doesn't happen. It did what it partly set out to do, which was to make ""Star Trek"" great again, and I think Paramount got the message."
Borges,"and just like that, /r/TheOrville finally achieved an orgasm."
Borges,"Chad Coleman is the goddamn man, I hope he pops up in the upcoming It’s always Sunny season because whenever Z pops up it’s funny as fuck. Anyway Coleman is a fantastic actor and seems like a cool dude, hopefully Orville gets a 4th season"
Borges,Hooray! Hooray for you!
Borges,"Loved season 1&2, but don't know what to think of season 3 because.  That's not for a lack of trying to watch it either.  It just puts me to sleep so quickly for some reason."
Borges,Really? I wouldn’t get your hopes up.
Borges,Season 3 was the best season of this show yet. To cancel it now would be a real shame.
Borges,It’s a quality show and really grew into itself. The last season was fantastic in episode storytelling. Some really moving and thought provoking episodes.
Borges,"I feel like they'll be a candidate for a six-episode final season to wrap everything up. Which kind of misses the point of it being an episodic show, where there's running threads but overall can be watched as individual stories."
Borges,Let's hope not.
Borges,God I hope so. I'd love more star trek and faux star trek. I just need more hopeful futures in my life.
Borges,In case anyone wants to see the best celebrity freak out of the last decade the honor goes to Mr. Coleman here for his subway rant.
Borges,"Literally the best content McFarlane has ever produced. It's thoughtful, funny, engaging, and genuine. It'd be a shame for it to not continue."
Borges,God I hope this is true Orville is to much fun to give up on.
Borges,"This show is so underrated. I hope we get atleast one more season just to wrap things up even tho Season 3 ending was good enough for a series finale. 

You'd think Fox would keep Seth McFarlane happy and let him do it since it feels like he's forced to do Family Guy now a days."
Borges,"I wish I could get past Seth Macfarlane as the lead.  I feel like this show was made for me and I want to like it so bad, but his stupid voice and stupid face are just so annoying.   Maybe someday they can deep fake literally anyone else in his role and I’d probably love the show.

EDIT:  added descriptors to voice and face"
Borges,"If so I will watch it and encourage others to do so. I am not sure that will make a difference in the greater scheme of things but they are making intelligent, thoughtful science fiction that is discussion worthy after the fact. It deserves as much of an audience as it can get and more."
Borges,"That show sucks. Had really been looking forward to it. Then it was funny, then serious… it just didn’t know what it wanted to be and ended up not being funny OR serious."
Borges,I hope so!!
Borges,Christ I hope so.
Borges,I hope it does! Very entertaining show.
Borges,This started out as a Star Trek parody and has easily become one of the best Sci-Fi series on TV. It would be a Firefly level mistake to just let this get cancelled.
Borges,"It's a shame so many good shows get canceled, yet The Orville gets multiple seasons. I find it to be unwatchable. Always perplexed when people defend it."
Borges,"I truly hope they get many more seasons but right now is a terrible time to be renewed. With a looming writers strike, it’ll be hard to get it off the ground over the next few months. I actually think that is partially the reason it hasn’t been renewed."
Borges,"Don't know why but I was randomly thinking about this show at work today and came to the conclusion that, because S3 ended rather well, it'd probably be better to do a movie instead.

The other conclusion I came to was Ed and Kelly need to get back together. That romance arc they did was really good and it was disappointing that they just _dropped_ it."
Borges,Nah. Let it go. It ended well. They try this and it will not end well.
Borges,There was a second and third season?
Borges,How can this great series be in limbo when at the same time paramount shits out a dozen garbage series with the star trek name slapped on?
Borges,Seth made a better Star Trek than the actual new Star Trek series
Borges,Screw Heveena.
Borges,Awesome. The Orville is a hidden gem.
Borges,Yay!
Borges,Yay!!! Fingers crossed!
Borges,Maybe give McFarlane a swing at an actual Star Trek show. He’ll at least know how to do an episodic series and not waste our time with season long story arcs.
Borges,Wtf Is the thumbnail. Wtf is this show
Borges,"Please and thank you, the last season would be a fine ending but I’m not ready for the crew to retire"
Borges,"MacFarlane has already started writing it, because he’s a bored workaholic."
Borges,"Season 3 felt very rushed. There's so much more they can do with this lore, but don't cram it all in at once near the end."
Borges,"I don't understand how it's not getting more seasons, like the show seems to do well viewership wise and the fans clearly want more, so I don't see what's stopping them."
Borges,"Alright. Its not certain, but it does sound promising. I have to admit I'd kind of accepted it was over. Glad to hear it might not be."
Borges,Don't do that to me.  Don't give me hope.
Borges,Good!
Borges,Oh god please don’t get my hopes up
Borges,If it does it probably wont come out til 2025.
Borges,Also Tyreese from The Walking Dead.
Borges,Whaaaaat that’s Fred Johnson I didn’t even realize!!
Borges,"Holy shit that’s Cutty? I had absolutely no idea, man this dude has range (the great makeup obviously helps too)"
Borges,He also taught us that you got to take your jean shorts off every now and them so the crotch doesn't blow out.
Borges,I think Clyden turned into my favorite character on the show. Went from hatin' to lovin' that dude.
Borges,He's also Z from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Edit: Already mentioned
Borges,"Oh shit, I didn't even realize that was him... Wow, he's good."
Borges,"I saw cutty and I stopped reading and thought you meant from ""house""."
Borges,Dude got range
Borges,That’s Cutty?!?
Borges,"And now ""not lex luthor"" from superman and lois"
Borges,He’s Cutty???? Yoooo I had no idea lmao
Borges,What the fuck. I had zero idea.
Borges,"> Cutty from The Wire

JFC of course he is! I had never made the connection!"
Borges,Holy shit I completely missed that Klyden was Fred Johnson. Dude's got range.
Borges,I had no idea that was the same actor playing Klyden and Fred Johnson. Amazing.
Borges,"Yeah, he’s not a crazy prolific actor but he finds his way into roles on to cult shows with very dedicated fanbases,"
Borges,And there's always the possibility of those Spider-Demons becoming a bigger threat. They left that wide open.
Borges,Disney would make sense to stick with established creators like Seth in the short term given the uncertainty surrounding streaming.
Borges,I want to see Kaylon as in laws.
Borges,"Season 3 of that show has some of the most thoughtful sci-fi on tv in years. I really hope they get another season. Then I hope people will give it a chance and skip straight to season 3 (or maybe ast couple episodes of S2).

They pulled a true Stae Trek and grew their beard."
Borges,"Last season had a real good finale, and if that ends up being the series finale, I'd be happy."
Borges,Well often a cliffhanger is an attempt to gain enough audience interest to boost ratings and get the renewal. It's not ideal but I emphasise with it.
Borges,That statement's a real rollercoaster.
Borges,"All the studios and streaming services seem to be consolidating, retrenching, and generally cancelling anything that isn't eyewateringly popular, so it's hard to believe something as expensive and of limited audience as The Orville is getting renewed.

By now everyone should have realised we're not living in that timeline any more. This is the timeline where MILF Island gets seven seasons and a movie."
Borges,Ty will already have a beard by the time someone finally makes a choice. It's also gray.
Borges,"I mean… they did it before when it was cancelled on FOX. Hard, but not unachievable"
Borges,"I agree about the quality of the show, but let’s be clear here. Sci-Fi is expensive due to effects budgets and this show uses a lot of effects, there are a lot of cast members wearing a lot of prosthetics, which is expensive and time consuming, and being relegated to streaming means there really isn’t a lot of options in the biggest markets to generate revenue from licensing.

The show isn’t a runaway success. It doesn’t help that it took years to get to the third season and will likely be a couple more years for a fourth if it happens.

All that adds up to one very shitty truth: If it’s not drawing enough eyeballs, it’s not worth continuing from a business perspective.

I loved all three seasons. I love almost all the characters. I love that they find their humor/seriousness line after a few episodes and by season 2 it all blends together very well, in my opinion.

The only real complaint I have is they still make a few too many references to 20th/21st century pop culture.

And Season 3 was a banger. Easily the best of the three."
Borges,"Because businesses do not make shows to make ""better"" shows.  They make shows to attract viewers and make ""money"".

If a show doesn't make money it gets canceled."
Borges,"You make it sound like it was the centerpiece of the deal lol, it was part of $60 billion's worth of assets in the Fox deal and S3 was already in production when the deal was finalized. In the meantime Seth signed a deal with a rival company, the show lost its network and interest likely waned at least in comparison to its production budget. Renewing this show is likely complicated and Seth was so involved it's most likely impossible to make a fourth season the way the third was made."
Borges,Studios are cheap
Borges,I'd assume because it didn't get enough viewers.
Borges,bc money
Borges,"personally id say 3 was the worst, 1 was the best and then it went massively downhill.

They got rid of the comedy but kept all the stupid storylines and plotholes that make no sense, which are fine in a silly comedy, but totally stupid in a serious series. 

after watching it I figured that they were 100% done, was actually surprised a lot of people really liked the change from comedy to serious."
Borges,"And now that everyone’s been released from their contracts, it’s going to be incredibly expensive to bring them back. Why would Fox pay more money to bring back a show they just canceled?"
Borges,They don't make these decisions based on reasons
Borges,That's funny because we canceled Disney+ last year to get Hulu just to watch The Orville.
Borges,there's only 3.. third one is pretty good.
Borges,"Don't really watch The Orville, but I'm happily here for the Coleman love. Man is a fucking class actor."
Borges,"The Orville is a Hulu show now, not Fox"
Champions,"I think he can connect with the contestants better because he's been in their shoes. Nothing against Mayim, but I think she has less of a ""game show host"" vibe."
Champions,"I mean she's not wrong. There's a certain level of respect contestants will have for Ken because he was actually on the show and at one point in their shoes. Ken symbolizes the possibilities of ""what if"" for any contestant to come on the show, you don't often have an example of a contestant having success like that and then being offered a gig of a lifetime in hosting the show. I like Mayim myself well enough, but you can't really argue Ken is just a better fit for the role given the circumstances."
Champions,"Spoken as someone who has watched nightly for most of my adult life, Ken is becoming nearly as good as Alex was. It has been fun to see him grow and improve. 

Also love the username OP lol"
Champions,i'm annoyed they're still dragging their feet on the obvious move that would make everyone happy
Champions,"The thing that drives me nuts with Mayim is the pause before saying correct or wrong, it throws the rhythm off and bugs the shit out me, anybody else get annoyed by this?"
Champions,I would have no issue with Mayim doing the prime time specials like Celebrity Jeopardy and Ken hosting the regular program.
Champions,"I don't watch the show, but I will say that I didn't like how Mayim responded to the criticisms.

When she was first announced and people voiced their criticisms, her response was [""“Who knew people were so passionate about who hosts Jeopardy?” ""Just let me read the clues!""](https://www.yahoo.com/video/mayim-bialik-reacts-to-drama-surrounding-jeopardy-just-let-me-read-the-clues-074328805.html)

That told me that she mainly sees this role as a paycheque and not much more. I don't like that.

Ken Jennings, I feel has more passion for the show. And that's important."
Champions,Mayim is trash. Or maybe I’m just still bitter about when she said she’s never been raped or harassed sexually because she dresses conservatively. 🤷🏽‍♀️
Champions,"The idea that it hasn't been Ken 100% from the start is a joke and has got me to stop watching Jeopardy after 15 years of barely missing an episode. 

If they ever get rid of Mayim entirely I would consider coming back.  Cannot stand her style of hosting.

And by cannot stand her style - I mean the fact she seemingly does not memorize her answers sheets like Trebek did, or Ken does (Though Ken probably also knows 90% of the answers).  But it absolutely destroys the pacing of the show, her delay and delivery are abysmal and unwatchable to me."
Champions,[removed]
Champions,Bialik is a female Dr Oz. Both use their titles to sell unproven supplements to people who don’t know better… disgusting
Champions,Mayim must have one hell of an agent
Champions,"The host needs to have a certain chutzpah to be up there and be bantering with contestants and reading the prompts and answers, and because of the amount of time Ken spent with Alex, I feel that Ken matches Alex's energy MUCH more than Mayim."
Champions,Holy shit!  [That was my question in her AMA!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jeopardy/comments/y0k32n/im_40time_jeopardy_champion_amy_schneider_ask_me/irs9ar0/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)
Champions,Ken is plenty good enough. The show is far more about the game and the contestants than the host to me.
Champions,Mayim Balik is a deal breaker for me.
Champions,"Love Ken. He young enough he could do this for a few more decades and people will remember him like they do Alex. I don’t dislike Mayim like many here seem to, but Ken is just better at it and deserves it more."
Champions,"It's only a matter of time, he's the perfect choice. Maybe not a year ago but he's just getting better"
Champions,"I think the only reason the producers wanted her was the whole ""Hey guys, it's an actual smart person with degrees and shit hosting a game show for smart people!"" narrative

Besides, Bialik's character was easily the worst character on Big Bang Theory.  Did that show really need a female Sheldon?"
Champions,"I can't believe this is still being dragged out, literal years now!!"
Champions,"I wish their were more women hosting everything. But objectively, Ken is just better at Jeopardy. He’s better off the cuff and he always feels like he’s himself. Mayim feels like she’s playing an 80s radio DJ when she’s hosting. I half expect her to tell us to turn it up and rip the knob off."
Champions,Mayim is a brunette headed bastard who has no real right to Driftmark yet here we all are taking crazy pills pretending. It’s pretty obvious here people!
Champions,"I saw Bialik for a minute on a podcast or something and was exhausted. I haven't watched Jeopardy since Ken Jennings streak originally aired. He's the obvious choice and pretty much always was in my mind as soon as I heard Trebek was dying.

Like, just fucking do it. He's gonna be a great host."
Champions,"Also, Ken Jennings is a very gameshow host sounding name"
Champions,"Mayim will take like three seconds before saying ""yes that's right"" or ""no I'm sorry"".  Ken gets it out right away.   He has more respect for the players."
Champions,"Mayim is insufferable as a host. Vacuous, saccharin sweet, and never has any meaningful knowledge to add to the banter with players."
Champions,"There are two people I think about when I think of Jeopardy.

Alex Trebek, and Ken Jennings. Ken should have been offered the job outright from the very beginning, the fact that he wasn't is a frickin' travesty."
Champions,I love Jeopardy.  But I won't watch episodes hosted by Bialik.  She's not a good host.
Champions,I just don't watch the episodes with Mayim. Ken is the only king I recognize.
Champions,"I actually don't hate Bialik as host, I just think Jennings is a lot better. What I'd like to see is Jennings host the majority of the episodes and then a a few weeks of the year we get a variety of guest hosts just to spice things up. A week of Neil Degrass Tyson hosting, a week of Neil Patrick Harris hosting, a week of Mayim Bialik hosting. Etc. Then back to Jennings as the regular full time host"
Champions,Mayim talks like a robot...totally off-putting and ruins the enjoyment of the game.  Recently saw Ken games the past couple of days...so much more natural and likeable.
Champions,What a classy and diplomatic way to state that.
Champions,"Did y'all know Ken Jenning's and best-selling author Brandon Sanderson were college roommates at BYU, still friends as far as I know. Fun fact"
Champions,"What is ""Hell yeah Amy!"""
Champions,Just have Will Ferrell host as Trebek
Champions,"Should have Guy Fieri host it so every answer you cohld watch him look perplexed,and then when he gets excited about possibly knowing the right answer, he could scream ""that's off the chain"" then offer the contestants chicken wings during the credits."
Champions,I don’t disagree with her. Ken’s way better.
Champions,"I mean let’s be real, she’s not wrong. Ken is the GOAT, why wouldn’t they use him?! It still makes no sense at all to me."
Champions,"Mayim Bialik has no business being anywhere near Jeopardy! with her anti-vaxx views, snake oil brain pill shilling, and victim blaming."
Champions,"Mayim Bialik is deeply unappealing, she penned an article basically stating that she didn’t get sexually assaulted because she doesn’t dress provocatively or give out those vibes. The whole thing was very victim blaming, honestly top to bottom I think she’s far too political and far too narcissistic for such a role that requires charm"
Champions,Of all the shit in the world to choose to be this passionate about...
Champions,Why does Reddit care so much about this?
Champions,"She’s right, ken is 10x better. I don’t think she’s the worse I still watch her but ken nails it out the park always."
Champions,"Mayim is a decent host but there's something cool about having a grandmaster who could stomp most, if not everyone, who appears on the show.

Plus Ken seems like a genuinely cool guy."
Champions,"Man, I have been enjoying Celebrity Jeopardy but Mayim bothers me. I feel like I would enjoy it more with Ken. He was great on The Chase"
Champions,"How do you define the host of Jeopardy?

  
I know it when I see it."
Champions,Who is actually pro Bialik? Anyone?
Champions,"But on the other hand, he told a bad joke this one time…"
Champions,"totally agree. something about this being a toss up between Ken Jennings and Blossom almost feels like some form of punishment. still love Blossom, but Ken has the same hint of dry humor and warmth that I watched Alex for. they’re kindred Kermits"
Champions,"Ken was handpicked by trebek, Mayim shouldn't be there just because of that."
Champions,"I have watched jeopardy almost nightly since I was a kid, thanks Grandma. I was not a fan of Ken, in the beginning. He has definitely grown on me and he should be the permanent host. But idk shit so..."
Champions,"Jennings is so much better than Mayim Bialik. Mayim's just got the ick, really self-righteous and holier than thou.

Although I'll admit, I was totally on the Levar Burton train."
Champions,"She's right. When I see Ken is hosting, I tend to keep it on because he feels like he was born to be there. Mayim feels like she's shooting an ad or something."
Champions,It seems like there’s overwhelming support and popularity for Jennings. Why are they trying to do this two host situation with Mayim?
Champions,"She's right - Ken is a great, great fit!"
Champions,Ken Jennings for the win!
Champions,Yes. Exactly. There is no other person fit for the job.
Champions,Mayim should stick to Celebrity Jeopardy
Champions,I miss Alex
Champions,I will never understand why they think you need to be a celebrity to be a game show host.
Champions,She’s absolutely right.
Champions,"I watched Jeopardy for decades. 

I have against Mayim, she’s Blossom, she’s a PhD, she’s Amy, she’s now Cat, but a Jeopardy host she is NOT.

The mugging, insincere or appearing so humor, the creeping ego-ism or again appearing so, she’s just NOT the right personality or persona.

Ken IS Jeopardy."
Champions,Also Ken's spontaneous wit is something like I've never seen before. He's just naturally hilarious.
Champions,"They’re both great hosts. They’re warm, open, intelligent, charismatic… It’s hard to describe what makes Ken just a bit more appealing. Something about him makes me feel like we were once close childhood friends."
Champions,I'd imagine most Jeopardy fans agree Ken should be the sole host.
Champions,Just give him the full time gig ffs
Champions,Bros before hos I guess
Champions,"I will say this in Mayim's small favor, I'd rather see her than a nut like Holzhauer. If he was the host it would be unwatchable and only half the clues would get read with him mugging for the camera."
Champions,"I find Ken unbearable. He has ruined Jeopardy for me. I like the seriousness of Alex, and Mayim seemed to bring that back, at least for a little while."
Champions,Not cool. I would argue Art Fleming was Jeopardy but doesn’t make it so.
Champions,Jesus christ how is this STILL a conversation
Champions,I would rather get crabs than watch old anti-vax fake intellectual mayim bialik stumble her way through another episode. The “host of jeopardy” my hairy ass
Champions,"I would pay a not-insignificant amount of money at this point to never have to hear people debate about who the Jeopardy host is/who is better/or anything else about the Jeopardy hosting job.

Ken is fine. Mayim is fine. Neither are great. The show is perfectly watchable either way. Enjoy it. Or don't. But for the love of god stop talking about it as if it's somehow going to ruin your life one way or another.

Edit: Annnd I'm getting downvoted because reddit gonna reddit"
Champions,"I watched last night and Ken is a Natural at the position. 
I like the idea of Mayim hosting the special tournaments tho adds a nice change."
Champions,"Ken’s wealth of knowledge makes him a perfect host for this show. I love that he’s able to expand on some answers with more info, or in some cases add context even to incorrect responses. He’s more confident speaking about things without a script because he’s just so knowledgeable about so many topics, whereas Mayim sticks much more closely to her cards."
Champions,Can’t believe this is still a thing.
Champions,"I’m wondering what the hell Mayim has on the producers of the show to make them keep her around. Ken is the choice. Every time. I’ve never heard of anyone preferring Mayim over Ken. Yet they keep her around, incessantly."
Champions,Mayim sucks. Her jokes are terrible and feel forced. Just stop switching. When Mayim is on I don’t watch
Champions,How are we still talking about this. Every time I see an article on this I wonder how they still don’t have a permanent host selected and we’re getting all this drama.
Champions,"Jesus Christ, it's a show with a host and some questions. 

How do I filter out phrases on reddit?"
Champions,Totally agree.
Champions,Mayim sucks. If it wasn’t for some funny tweets and whiny Twitter users Ken would have already been the full time host.
Champions,"She is a deal breaker for me, I watched my ENTIRE life every night I was at home. After Alex passed I thought this was a done deal, then that repulsive producer tried to take over and Mayim is Like the sister you HAVE to be nice to and take places. Let us be done with this, Alex chose Ken."
Champions,We told them that we wanted LeVar Burton and they didn't listen
Champions,"Bialik is a ridiculously bad fit for Jeopardy, but nothing would make me like her after she slutshamed _#metoo_ victims over what they wore."
Champions,"So, uh, why is Bialik on the show then?"
Champions,It's not that deep. It's a syndicated tv game show.
Champions,I personally liked Aaron Rodgers for that role. I am only saying this so he can leave the NFL for good
Champions,You and everybody else Amy.
Champions,Mayim gonna need some of that brain juice she hawks to treat that burn.
Champions,"Ken is good as host because he KNOWS the answers. He’s not fumbling through cue cards with awkward pauses trying to read it. Mayim, it has nothing to do with your gender or faith, YOU JUST SUCK AS HOST!"
Champions,I just don't understand why reddit pretends to care about this show
Champions,Bialik is a toxic brew of pseudoscience who should know better.
Champions,"I’ve never seen anyone say they love Mayim as host, I’ve seen a bunch of people saying they love Ken as host"
Champions,How long does this host debate have to go on? Alex is literally a skeleton now. This should have been settled 2 years ago. Dumb.
Champions,Mayim is fine.  Ken is just better... that's all.
Champions,[removed]
Champions,"I disagree with how the narrative is phrased so often in comments. I stand by the fact that Mayim is the best female host the show has had, and was the best of the revolving door guest hosts they had. She is fine, and I like her on the show. 7/10. 

The bar however is 10/10, from Trebek running such a fun perfect ship as long as he did; thus it feels so hollow when she, or anyone else try to host the show. 

By comparison I put Ken at an 8.5, and growing over time. I love Ken, he was always the fated successor, and should have the stage for the main show. When there are special events, or need a guest host, that’s when they should default to Mayim. The narrative should not be anywhere “yuck Mayim” as it is, rather “Ken is as good as it gets”"
Champions,"Jesus, can people just shut up about this? I've literally heard nothing but complaining when it comes to Jeopardy! in the news. Alex Trebek would be disappointed."
Champions,"My question is why the fuck would they not choose Ken as the replacement from the start?

Is it really a bunch of geriatric fucks running the show this whole time, to not understand that having Ken as the host would have completely prevented all this backlash?"
The Hollow,I really dug this show..up until that ending. The twist just didn’t work for me and completely pulled me out of it
The Hollow,"Yeah I have to admit I wasn't expecting this show to ever come back, and I think the ending was a bit questionable.

Still cool, it looks really good I'll watch it."
The Hollow,"I don't know, it worked for me. The show threw down the gauntlet pretty early for me, as a viewer."
The Hollow,"Oh, I'd defiently agree that it felt as if Viscomi was still batting a few ideas around, while still being committed to the planned ending. It does feel a little disjointed. 

&#x200B;

But to be fair, I think the video game reveal worked for me because the show from the outset throws down the gauntlet about it's own weirdness early on and the finale poses the question: what sort of world would create The Hollow to begin with?"
The Hollow,"Yeah, I can see your point.

And yeah, I agree that's probably what happened.

Of course it looks like the next season is going to raise a lot more questions."
The Hollow,"I quite enjoyed the show throughout myself. It does improve, and the story line gets a lot more interesting after episode 5 or so. Worth watching through till the end. Kai remains a bit of a prat, though, but that's the point, isn't it?

Edit: turns out I can't spell properly..."
The Hollow,"Yeah , but his character continubed to do dumb shit , like making fun of that witch that they thought was dead. Or being mad when the main guy tried to save him from the other witch."
The Hollow,It's a kids show so I don't think they really put a lot of effort in character development and wrote something just to keep kids entertained. I was kind of annoyed it wasn't like Gravity Falls like the promo pic on netflix made it out to be. 
The Hollow,"I just watched the last episode to see the ending and It's really underwhelming.There's also tons of other kids cartoons (regular show, adventure time) that really have great characters. You should check out Infinite train pilot and the tv series thats coming to cartoon network. Great mysterious premise for now."
The Hollow,I saw the Infinite Train Pilot. It was good. Did it get green lit or is it just the pilot for now? I know Craig of the Creek is a good show. 
The Hollow,"Yes, the the full show is coming in 2019. Havent seen Craig of creek."
The Hollow,Awesome. Craig of the creek is pretty good. Reminds me of Ed Edd n' Eddy or recess. The whole kids in different groups playing and having adventures. 
The Hollow,I'll have to watch it sometime this summer. Mostly intrigued by its art directions. Looks a lot like Harvey beaks.
The Hollow,I can see that. 
The Hollow,"Is the first series available on Netflix?

When will the War of the Roses series be available in America?

WHEN!?!

WHEN!?!

WHEN!?!
"
The Hollow,Does Benedril Cabbagepatch work 24/7?
The Hollow,Really excited for this. The first Hollow Crown was absolutely amazing!
The Hollow,Game of Crowns
The Hollow,YYAAASS! The first was amazing this one looks just as good. 
The Hollow,"BBC continuing to knock some decent dramas out, love it"
The Hollow,Pretty much. I think he keeps as busy as possible so he doesn't have to think about pengines. 
The Hollow,"Honestly, it's extremely impressive. His work ethic is kind of inspiring."
The Hollow,You are aware there's more than one?
The Hollow,"Richard II was fantastic - Ben Whishaw was so brilliant it made me really rethink the play as a whole. 

Didn't like the Henry IV, V episodes very much. They really dropped the ball with the underplayed Falstaff and don't think Tom Hiddleston had the right vibe for Hal/Henry IV. I like Orson Welles ""Chimes at Midnight"" a lot better."
The Hollow,"I think you'll find it's pronounced ""pengwings""."
The Hollow,"Once you get that hot you don't waste it. 

Well, you can but you'll probably regret it (see Josh Hartnett)"
The Hollow,I thought it was Pangwangs?
The Hollow,I love it!! I hope there's season 2. Its like Lost-lite
The Hollow,I am looking this up in google. Love finding new shows to watch. I can’t seem to find any info on this whatsoever!
The Hollow,"I can't find ""THe Hollowing"" on Neftlix or anywhere.

A google search for THe Hollowing and Netflix just takes me to this thread here. What the hell?"
The Hollow,"I couldn't stand Kai. He was so annoying, the rest of my intrigue with the world and other characters just disappeared.

Like I wasnt even mildly annoyed, I actually wanted to strangle him. He seemed like a character added to be the mainstream idiot, but he just doesn't belong."
The Hollow,[deleted]
The Hollow,"It's because it;s called The Hollow, not The Hollowing."
The Hollow,"It's good, I'd still recommend it. Just the last 2 minutes had me asking so many things that would never be answered"
The Hollow,Check the edit mark
The Hollow,https://www.netflix.com/title/80147919
The Hollow,I felt he got better as the show progressed. In the beginning he was bad but 4 or five in he got better.
The Hollow,I'm fine with any of those proposed theories really. This is like gravity falls to me lol
The Hollow,"I was thinking about the show a few days ago, when I remembered I had uploaded the entire run of the who to youtube back in 2007. I did a little bit of googling, and I cant find it anywhere else. 

I managed to download/merge the copy I saved almost a decade ago, but it seems as though the show itself is all but forgotten. Anyone else remember The Hollow Men?"
The Hollow,Try Pushing Daisies
The Hollow,TB’s Sleepy Hollow would be a good follow up. Underrated movie.
The Hollow,"""The October Faction"" was a fun, solid comic book with similar vibes that I liked a lot. there was a netflix live-action version, too - but it bombed."
The Hollow,Cancelled without any merit. It was the most amazing show. Good pull!
The Hollow,"Just done watching it, such a good movie."
The Hollow,"Matt Ross as Gavin Belson. He was funny and douchy. Having worked in the tech industry he seemed like a very slight exaggeration on the kind of people he was based on. 

People rave about Brian Cox or Alec Baldwin's performance as corporate honchos but Matt Ross' Belson was the most relatable one I've seen."
The Hollow,"I know this isn't on topic, but my goodness Stephen Root has created so many memorable characters in his career."
The Hollow,Billy Bob Thornton as Lorne Malvo on Fargo. One of my favorite performances on tv ever.
The Hollow,Killgrave from Jessica Jones. Pretty much every variation of an controlling abusive partner in one person and with super powers
The Hollow,Whiterose in Mr Robot. She stole the show every scene she was in
The Hollow,"Senator Clay Davis from The Wire

SHIIIIIIIIIIIIT"
The Hollow,Gustavo Fring and Lalo Salamanca
The Hollow,"Billy Bob Thornton as Lorne Malvo in Fargo. What a terrifyingly charming character, like a fox showing you its teeth before it eats you."
The Hollow,"I'll always mourn Carnivale's cancellation, and the biggest reason is Clancy Brown as Brother Justin. 

The Man in Black from Westworld (and Ford, too - no one does it like Anthony Hopkins) were amazing for the one season of that show that I ever bother rewatching. Both actors have such presence, and I loved their storylines. 

And say what you will about Lost, but I thought Ben was an absolute delight every time he was on screen. I've always wished Michael Emerson's other roles were more to my taste, because he was such a fun two-faces piece of shit."
The Hollow,"Chuck in Better call Saul. When you find out >!how much he hates Jimmy being a lawyer, that's such a good scene!<"
The Hollow,"Walt Goggins as Boyd Crowder in Justified 

Giancarlo as Gustavo Fring in Breaking Bad 

Anthony Starr as Homelander in The Boys 

All entertaining charismatic villains who are as fun to watch on screen as the protagonists"
The Hollow,Antony Starr as Homelander in The Boys.
The Hollow,"Newman - I’ve looked into his soul, he’s pure evil."
The Hollow,"I thought Bobby Cannavale as Irving in Mr Robot was also excellent! And Craig Robinson was pretty compelling too— Mr Robot had plenty of great villains, even if I never particularly cared for Tyrell/Price. Whiterose was strong too, even if the writing was a bit silly for the character at times."
The Hollow,Joffrey Baratheon. Loved to hate that prick.
The Hollow,Boyd f'n Crowder.
The Hollow,"Benjamin Linus on Lost.

“John Locke” on Lost.

Gustavo Fring on Breaking Bad.

Rumplestiltskin on Once Upon a Time.

The entire team on The Shield."
The Hollow,Mags Bennett from Justified. Margo Martindale was perfect in that.
The Hollow,Misty from yellowjackets … she was hilariously demented
The Hollow,Vic Mackey
The Hollow,The entire Bluth family.
The Hollow,"Wendy from Ozark. I can honestly imagine that character eating babies if she thought it could get her ahead. She’d be looking so sad if it was taking place in front of anyone, obviously feeling horrendous. But then, if she thought nobody was watching, I’m sure she’d take another quick bite."
The Hollow,"Off the top of my head, King Richard from *Galavant* (granted, that’s mostly S1, but Timothy Omundsen was pure gold the entire show) and Silco from *Arcane*."
The Hollow,Lord Ba’al played by the late Chris Simon on Stargate SG-1.  Just an absolutely perfect glorious bastard.
The Hollow,The Cigarette Smoking Man was a good’n
The Hollow,Kai Proctor from Banshee it's one of my favorites underrated antagonists... such a baddass.
The Hollow,V.M. Varga from Fargo Season 3.
The Hollow,Todd Packer.
The Hollow,I think Fuchs is a better human than Barry
The Hollow,Reacher Gilt from Discworld's Gone Postal. He was so subtly devilish. I also like the idea of buying a pedigree family. Two and a half percent!
The Hollow,"God I love Fuches. He's the only character who tells Barry who he really is. The phone call he had with Barry in S2 where he says ""If you're so good now, then turn yourself in"", is the peak of the show."
The Hollow,"Animated and a comedy, but I love the dynamic between Archer and everyone's favorite cyborg, Barry. Wait Goggins I'm justified is right there with him."
The Hollow,Stephen Root as Doobie Keebler
The Hollow,Scorpius from Farscape.
The Hollow,Dan Fielding
The Hollow,Ray bloody Purchase in Toast of London.
The Hollow,"John Hannah as Batiatus in Spartacus

Currently watching justified for the first time and finished season 2 this week. Margo Martindale was fantastic as Mags Bennett. Walton Goggins is also amazing as Boyd Crowder.

And I know some fans were divisive about him, but Marco Inaros in The Expanse."
The Hollow,Gus Fring
The Hollow,John Lithgow's Trinity Killer in Dexter was sensational.
The Hollow,Jeffrey Dean Morgan as Neegan on TWD
The Hollow,Walton Goggins as Uncle Baby Billy in the Righteous Gemstones
The Hollow,"First that comes to mind is...Say my name...Heisenberg...You're goddamn right. When Walter adopts the Heisenberg persona the show changes completely, and the end result is one of if not the best show of all time in my book.  


Second would be Negan. He was essentially leading a cult of followers who respected, feared, and revered him because he was smart and charismatic. Especially with how he addressed large audiences. Loved to hate him."
The Hollow,"logan roy from succession. ruthless and brutal, capable of kindness that always has evil behind it. perfect."
The Hollow,"John Smith and Inspector Kido in The Man in the High Castle, and Moriarty in Sherlock."
The Hollow,Joey Pants as Ralphie Cifaretto & Jamie Hector as Marlo
The Hollow,"*And I said, I don't care if they lay me off either, because I told, I told Bill that if they move my desk one more time, then, then I'm, I'm quitting, I'm going to quit. And, and I told Don too, because they've moved my desk four times already this year, and I used to be over by the window, and I could see the squirrels, and they were married, but then, they switched from the Swingline to the Boston stapler, but I kept my Swingline stapler because it didn't bind up as much, and I kept the staples for the Swingline stapler and it's not okay because if they take my stapler then I'll set the building on fire...*"
The Hollow,"Ian McShane as Al Swearengen in Deadwood. 

The paramount performance of a character IMHO."
The Hollow,Frank Burns is the best villain.
The Hollow,"Benjamin Linus on Lost


>!Walternate!< on Fringe



HR on Person of Interest has just gotten better and better overtime."
The Hollow,Al Schwerenger is the only appropriate answer here. Now move the fuck along you cock suckers!
The Hollow,He is great on Barry but honestly find it ridiculous he's still alive. He's had too many fake outs.
The Hollow,Jack Donaghy and Logan Roy are what we think CEOs are like. Gavin Belson is what they're actually like.
The Hollow,"Belson was great, one minute he's a clueless petty child, the next he's aware how much of an ass he's been and genuinely regrets his actions, and then he's right back to being a petty asshole burning everything down just to spite his enemies."
The Hollow,"Matt Ross could very well be the best, most likeable human being on the planet, but physically he was just born to play the bad guy. He did a great job in Big Love as well."
The Hollow,"Someone described Belson as ""the antagonist who has the same bad luck as the protagonist"" and it's spot on."
The Hollow,Happy to see people appreciate Stephen. I can remember him being great since I saw him as Jimmy James on Newsradio.
The Staircase,">	USA Network aired the made-for-TV movie “Call Me: The Rise and Fall of Heidi Fleiss” in 2004, with Jamie-Lynn Sigler starring as Fleiss.

an extremely 2004 sentence"
The Staircase,So is this the third show on the staircase?
The Staircase,really scraping for concepts huh?
The Staircase,Hopefully Molly Lambert is writing for it. Her podcast last year about Heidi was fantastic
The Staircase,"If you aren't old enough to remember, Charlie Sheen was one of Heidi's clients."
The Staircase,Until i see actual trailers and a release date for anything superhero related these days I just assume it’s not happening. Even then who knows if it will still happen
The Staircase,">“The Batman” spinoff series about Arkham Asylum at HBO Max has brought on Antonio Campos as its new writer, Variety has learned exclusively from sources.

>Sources also say that Campos will direct and serve as showrunner/executive producer on the series, should his version of the show ultimately go forward.

>However, Campos is now the third writer brought onto the DC project since it was originally announced in July 2020 with a series commitment. At that time, the show was meant to be about the inner workings of the Gotham PD and set within the same world as Matt Reeves’ “The Batman,” with Terence Winter writing and executive producing. But news broke in November of that year that Winter had left the series over creative differences. “Giri/Haji” creator Joe Barton was then brought onboard, but when the project shifted away from the police department to focus instead on the infamous asylum, Warner Bros. parted ways with Barton as well."
The Staircase,"Yeesh, third one already?"
The Staircase,Based on the game or just the aslyum in general?
The Staircase,Yay. Another Batman story without Batman.
The Staircase,"Oh, well, that's something ..."
The Staircase,Another write-off...
The Staircase,"Can we step over the whole superhero nonsense and get back to good cinema/tv already. This whole ground down boring rehashing of the same childish settings over and over and over has been depleted long ago, time to drop it.

At the very least we could produce broader scifi and fantasy, if that's where the line in the sand stands.

All the batman/superman/batman/superman/superwoman/ubersuperdupersomeone shtick has become so tiresome, I'm surprised it still sells with such levels of oversaturation. Oe maybe it doesn't sell as well as alternatives would, but people in charge of studios don't want to take risks on anything new. But we have to start some time, the sooner the better. Entertainment has been low on entertainment the past several years."
The Staircase,WB: Doing shows about anyone but Batman in the Batman universe.
The Staircase,"Before Mr Discovery took charge, D.C. had about 20 movies and shows in ‘active development’. Some, like Black Adam, actually happened. Still waiting for that Nightwing movie by the Lego Batman crew…"
The Staircase,I don’t even really buy into it until the sequel is released
The Staircase,[deleted]
The Staircase,"I'm a big fan of what Reeves did with The Batman but this is definitely monkey paw curling territory. As much as I want to see Reeves' Batman universe expand, there's a scattershot feeling to all of this news that makes me wary"
The Staircase,This does make sense though since it originally started out as a completely different show and Matt Reeves wanted to shift it more to an Arkham horror show instead of a cop show.
The Staircase,"Asylum in general, it's a spinoff to the Batman film from earlier this year."
The Staircase,is that what this is? well now i'm not ever remotely interested...
The Staircase,The vast majority of TV created has nothing to do with superheroes.
The Staircase,It’s not like there’s a lack of good non supe tv. Movies is a different story but that’s tvs fault for allowing so much more potential than it used to.
The Staircase,Maybe don’t watch it?
The Staircase,"There are literally hundreds of non superhero shows and films every year, there’s nothing stopping you from watching them"
The Staircase,Lego Batman director and one of the creators of Ozark was writing the movie.
The Staircase,Before its even written.
The Staircase,"Well the first writers they got, it was for GOTHAM PD and how corrupt it is but the show evolved into Arkham asylum and the person who was writing GOTHAM PD didn’t want to do it so they got a new one"
The Staircase,So tired of Batman spin off shows. Give us a damn Batman show for once. Stop saving him for movies only.
The Staircase,Yeah neither am I. Idk why they continue to do this
The Staircase,Father like son.
The Staircase,Is this the first father-son actor duo to both wear pregnancy bellies?
The Staircase,Wait until your 55. Then it’s no longer fun.
The Staircase,I didn’t even notice.
The Staircase,"It's gotta be weird for the family, having all the news about the miniseries years after the documentary series"
The Staircase,Party Schwartzenator
The Staircase,They’re like Twins!
The Staircase,Let's put a bun in that oven
The Staircase,More like he’s a Junior.
The Staircase,You’re right. I totally recall that now.
The Staircase,Your memory must have been erased
The Staircase,I think this joke has reach End of Days.
The Staircase,As jokes go it’s pretty expendable
The Staircase,I can't think of a good joke for this thread but I'll be back when I think of one.
The Staircase,Really? All I hear are True Lies.
The Staircase,"This joke thread just keeps running, man!"
The Staircase,"The owl episode really got me, but the final episode made me more suspicious of Michael. Overall just a shit situation…"
The Staircase,"Colin Firth is amazing in this role. Pitiful & sinister, just like that smarmy charlatan is in the documentary."
The Staircase,I just started to watch this but accidentally watched the 7th episode first.  :(
The Staircase,I'm so confused. Is this the same as the Netflix show from four years ago?
The Staircase,"i never saw the doc, but apparently Michael peterson was just as much of a character irl as hes portrayed here?

the whole time, the whole time- im like- why do these people put this guy on such a pedestal? Motherfucker lied about everything it seemed, and was a dick to almost everyone - yet his kids kept coming to bat for him as if he was truly some saint they needed in their lives. Ditto for the french editor who bought into his nonsense, and then later was shocked to find out he was a liar who basically used her.

i know its true, i guess that makes it all the more frustrating lol. such an unlikeable person by every metric, and thats before you even start talking about how he killed his wife"
The Staircase,Couldn’t get past the first paragraph
The Staircase,Was this written by the writer of The Staircase because damn
The Staircase,Why do they keep making shows about the same thing?
The Staircase,"I feel like the owl thing would be fairly easy to prove even without exhuming the body.  I'm no expert, and the show perhaps had a lot of creative license with its portrayal, but surely they could show the autopsies to a few experts and ask them which animal might have done it."
The Staircase,"I really got into this series and here's my take: owl attacked, he found her bleeding and breathing and calls 911, he hangs up from 911 and realizes he finally has an out from this marriage and/or debt, he tries to strangle her and thinks he did, but she eventually just died of blood loss, he calls 911 again to say she's stopped breathing.

Sure the scratches and micro feathers point to an owl attack, but the damage to the thyroid cartilage which usually points to strangulation is too big to dismiss"
The Staircase,"Did you know the gig was originally Harrison Fords but he had to step away because Indiana Jones 5 took longer to shoot than they expected? Ford is my favorite actor of all time but I dunno if it would have been a good role for me. I was stoked to see Ford finally making the leap over to TV and think it would have given him a chance to show that when he wants to, he really can act but I don’t think he would have been convincing as pre-conviction Michael. I don’t want to say someone is too old to play a role, but trying to make an 80 year old actor seem 50 would probably take the audience out of it."
The Staircase,I shouldn’t laugh but I did. How did you not notice?
The Staircase,I did that with season 1 of Game of Thrones. Started with the last episode because that's how the HBO app had them listed and I didn't realize until my brother in law came into the room like halfway through
The Staircase,"Haha....my friend had the same scenario for the first season of the exorcist....for some reason the numbering of episodes was done in the order 1, 10, 2, then 3, and so on....he watched half of the 10th episode and was totally confused"
The Staircase,"I just had this happen watching we own this city, jumped from ep4 to final and didn’t realize because the back and forth story telling"
The Staircase,"What are the odds.. i started with episode 8. Then went on to watch episode 1&2 and in the middle of episode 3 it hit me like ""wait, this is the 4th episode i'm watching, why does it say episode 3?"". 

It doesn't help that the story isn't told like completely chronological but instead jumps back and forth in time a lot and shows different ""variants"" of the same scene and.. i guess i should have noticed earlier but it does kinda work that way too, lol"
The Staircase,"Back in the VHS days, I rented Magnolia which was on 2 tapes. Put in tape 2 first by accident. Queue Tom Cruise staring at shit and then raining frogs. Was so confounded I still have not watched the first part yet."
The Staircase,That happened to me with True Detective.
The Staircase,"Don't feel bad. I accidentally watched the last episode of Season 1 of True Detective first.

Back then HBO's streaming App counted backwards from left to right beginning with the latest episode first. I was half paying attention when I tapped the square that I thought was the first episode as I assumed they were listed in numerical order.

As I was watching the episode unfold I thought it was an exciting and bold move to start with ending first thinking it was gonna unfold in reverse but nope I had most certainly played the season finale first."
The Staircase,That was my wife with Homeland on Amazon Prime. It showed her Season 3 first. She started watching at Season 3.
The Staircase,I did the same thing with the first episode of the wire so I waited three years to watch it again
The Staircase,It's a dramatization of the events from the doc which is on Netflix.
The Staircase,"No. There’s a new series on HBO Max, I believe."
The Staircase,"this is different... and it also kinda bothers me how The Staircase documentary on Netflix has a ""Netflix original"" tag even though it wasn't made by Netflix"
The Staircase,The author mentioned about a dozen shows or people in a string of parenthetical expressions grafted onto a sentence meant to communicate the idea that “there’s a new true crime TV show and it’s kind of different.”
The Staircase,"It could have been proven, especially with the fact that they found a microscopic feather specifically belonging to that species of owl under Kathleen’s fingernails (from likely trying to pull it off her head). But the thing is, the was not only convicted once based on perjury, garbage science and circumstantial evidence but also used up all of his appeals. He knew he was going to die in prison. Short of some kind of miraculous alibi for Michael (which doesn’t exist) the police were never going to change their story and the charges were never going to be dropped so he would have to do a re-trial. If you got screwed over 20 times the previous time, why would you think this time would be any different? Plus, it would now be much harder to find a non-bias jury who hadn’t heard of the case. I dunno.. I think I would have taken the deal too. Also, I have no idea if he actually did it but I do know he didn’t get a fair trial."
The Staircase,Ya. The cartilage is the big hole in that argument ni listened to a few podcasts over the years. I think he totally killed her
The Staircase,"All I'll say, as I haven't seen it yet (planning on it still, since I loved the doc), I was pretty excited + bummed when Ford was attached then dropped out.   


He clearly has some hidden range (Witness + Mosquito Coast), and I think had a bad string of .. 'picking dramatic roles with great directors who happened to be in  the low point of their careers' in the late 80s/90s.   


Lots of what-ifs with his career, like Kubrick wanting him for Eyes Wide Shut .. which would've been damn interesting."
The Staircase,"Damn though, HF is a super underrated actor. I bet he would have been amazing. I would be so stoked to see him get to play more complicated, dramatic parts."
The Staircase,"I click play on the newest released episode, instead of the first episode.  I was so lost and kept assuming this was some kind of story telling device, and they would do more flashbacks explaining everything.. and then like three minutes before the end when it was about to show everything, I was like this feels more like a finale than a premiere...

I watched the first episode after that, but it just feels ruined now.  Not sure if it's worth watching all the in between stuff."
The Staircase,Is the HBO show worth watching?
The Staircase,"Stuff gets the Original tag on Netflix if it wasn't aired in the US anywhere before they bought it. Like this show Borgia got the Netflix Original tag even though a European company made it and it aired in Europe, because Netflix had the exclusive distribution rights in the US for it.

Other countries' versions of Netflix have the same thing - like The Good Place says it's a Netflix Original somewhere, iirc, because Netflix in that country has the exclusive rights to distribute it in that country, even though obviously Netflix Whatever Country didn't make it."
The Staircase,It was bought and distributed by them.
The Staircase,"The new rule for reading blog articles is skim down to like the 4th or 5th paragraph to start reading.  The more clickbaity the title, the further you gotta scroll to get to the point."
The Staircase,"I don't mean legally.  The show didn't make it clear one way or the other, though.  Did he do it or not?  It was left vague, yet I think it's something that we could clearly know the answer to regardless of the legal outcome.  So I'm disappointed that the show didn't give a definitive answer because someone should just figure out what actually happened by now."
The Staircase,"She was recovering from a neck injury that was serious enough to be hospitalized for just four months before she died, though, is it possible the cartilage injury was related to that previous event?"
The Staircase,"For sure. He will be have a starring role in the follow up to 1883 and prequel to Yellowstone). I haven’t seen either so I plan to try and watch them before his show comes out, I think it’s called 1933. It’s not quite the kind of character work he would have had with this show but I’ll be looking forward to him taking a crack at a series focused on character development instead of a traditional 3 act movie. Nothing wrong with those, I just think TV in recent years has given actors better and more interesting roles and opportunities to play characters outside of their typical mold."
The Staircase,"Harrison Ford in the 90s/early 00s was the the most successful actor of all time (i.e. starring in big money makers). 

He's since lost that title to Samuel L Jackson - but he regained it for a while when the Force Awakens came out.

So, I wouldn't call him underrated. He's rated fine, he's a good actor, but not a great one. 

Like Samuel L isn't the same kind of actor Denzel Washington is. Harrison Ford isn't the same actor Robert De Niro is."
The Staircase,"I'm assuming you've seen them, but, check out Witness (though that's definitely more in his ballpark, playing a bit of a strong man cop) and \*especially\* Mosquito Coast, which is probably the least-Ford role out there (aside from when he sometimes plays straight comedy)."
The Staircase,"That’s how I first saw schindlers list. Video Store only included one DVD in the rental, which was the last hour or so of the movie."
The Staircase,"I did this once with The Man in the High Castle. I watched the entire second season thinking, “This isn’t at all what I thought it was.” It jumped around through different characters with very little character development or background. I just thought it was one of those shows that REALLY made you think.

After the final episode the first season started playing and my mouth hit the floor. Watched it anyway."
The Staircase,It’s ok I bought a dvd once (IT mini series) and watched the 2nd disk most the way through before realising.
The Staircase,"I did this with The Night Of. Started watching the finale by accident thinking it would flash back to the incident any minute, got about an hour in when they reveal the verdict until I realised I wasn't watching the first episode. I've been trying to put off watching it in the hopes I would forget but I don't think I ever can sadly. I hear it's really good though so I'll watch it at some point despite knowing how things end for the most part (I didn't finish the episode so I guess there's like 20 minutes or so that I don't know about)."
The Staircase,Yes. I started watching it and had to stop - the scene where Colette is replaying the fall in a dramatization scene was intense. Very very good but intense.
The Staircase,"Mixed feelings. I think way too long for what it was, Firth and Colette were amazing in their roles. But didn’t really have much to say in the story imo. Not the best thing on HBO by a long shot"
The Staircase,I loved it through and through. I watched the doc though so I don't have the perspective of someone who hasn't.
The Staircase,Couldn’t say. I haven’t started it yet :-(
The Staircase,"Yes, absolutely."
The Staircase,"But how? There is no magic way to know how her injuries were sustained, or what caused her to fall, or any of that. Maybe if the police had investigated from the start instead of just trying to find evidence to prove their theory, but at this point no new evidence is going to pop up. And a drama based on true events deciding which version of events happened, that would be really shitty."
The Staircase,I’m not a pathologist. I am an md though and see frequent neck injuries so take that as you will. Injury to the anterior cartilage is not consistent with the neck pain she was having.
The Staircase,"Fucking bots on this site, man, LOL."
The Staircase,"Under- and over-rated have to do with a lot more than just how much money an actor's paid. It's much more about the quality of their work.

I would say that for a lot of people who only know his Star Wars, and Marvel and Tarantino work Jackson is underrated. Although he has done a tremendous amount of very forgetable schlock he's actually a very good actor."
The Staircase,"I haven’t seen Mosquito Coast! I’ll check it out. I realized he could do stuff beyond his standard roles when I saw “Regarding Henry.” It’s not a spectacular movie, but he was totally believable as someone recovering from a brain injury."
The Staircase,Damn you really did the Holocaust speed run

1. Ward Cleaver

2. Charles Ingalls

3. Herman Munster

4. Dr. Heathcliff Huxtable

5. Phillip Banks

6. Phil Dunphy"
Healer,"Going for an older show, Ward Cleaver was a very good father. He was solid, level-headed and had high standards but was also kind and understanding, and had a sense of humor. Andy Taylor from the Andy Griffith Show was also good, but not as much. Of course, Ward's parenting had more opportunity to shine, since his show was more focused on the kids.

From a more recent show, Jack Pearson from This Is Us. That guy went above and beyond, putting all his energy and personality in the service of his family. He was so good that when he died it seemed that his family had to spend their whole lives getting over it."
Healer,"John Goodman, aka Dan Conner."
Healer,I can tell you it's definitely not Shou Tucker.
Healer,"Bob Belcher from Bob's Burgers.  The more obvious answers would be Ozzie Nelson, or Jim Anderson.  But Bob really connects with his children."

Monkey Twins,"Dirk Gently most definitely

Happy! 

The Leftovers

Utopia"
Monkey Twins,Twin Peaks and for me it isn’t really close 
Monkey Twins,The amazing world of gumball
Monkey Twins,"Nirvanna The Band The Show. That show defines the idea of blurring the line between what's real and what isn't, especially considering it's filmed with a lot of real people in actual Toronto."
Monkey Twins,"My absolute favorites are Garth Marenghi's Darkplace, Twin Peaks, Mighty Boosh, Riget (The Kingdom in English, a mini-series by Lars Von Trier), Monty Python's Flying Circus, Carnivale (the first season), The League of Gentlemen, Adventure Time, Spongebob Squarepants, Monkey Dust....."
Monkey Twins,"Here's a blast from the past: American Gothic.

1-season show from the mid 90's. Starred Nick Searcy, a *very* young Sarah Paulson, Paige Turco, and the great Gary Cole as a slick, charismatic small town sheriff who may or may not be the actual Devil. Many other recognizable faces in this one, too.

Produced by Sam Raimi and Shaun Cassidy (yes, that Shaun Cassidy). Weird, supernatural, good vs. evil sort of affair. It's pretty dated now, but I watched it again recently on DVD and found it highly entertaining."
Monkey Twins,[deleted]
Monkey Twins,Would season 1 of True Detective qualify?
Monkey Twins,"Frisky Dingo - it's by the same guy as Archer, but much more insane."
Monkey Twins,"Two short lived shows - Wonderfalls and Pushing Daisies

Hasn't aged too well but Ally McBeal was great when it first came out. "
Monkey Twins,Would Venture Brothers count?  
Monkey Twins,Did you try Black Books? It has some surreal elements in it and is absolutely hilarious. 
Monkey Twins,"Monty Python's Flying Circus

Garth Marenghi's Darkplace

Childrens Hospital

Angie Tribeca

And Happy! would most likely qualify, too."
Monkey Twins,Comedy Bang! Bang!
Monkey Twins,"legion is the craziest, most inventive show i've ever seen"
Monkey Twins,Psychoville and Inside Number 9. From some of the creators of the League of Gentlemen.

Monkey Twins,"I am obsessed with this show right now.

 ""I got scared, so I did what Kevin did in Home Alone and put the black guy from Space Jam in the window to scare them off."""
Monkey Twins,Adventure Time is the best. The lore is pretty deep for a supposed children's show. 
Monkey Twins,Why did you post a reply with the exact same thing you said in the thread?
Monkey Twins,"Check out 15 Storeys High, Sean Lock, and a young Benedict Wong. Very surreal"
Monkey Twins,"Great list, The Boosh and Darkplace where the first things that came to mind when I read the question. I would add 'The Misadventures of Flapjack' and 'Toast of London' as well, both of those can get pretty bizarre. "
Monkey Twins,I've wanted to see that one for years but haven't been able to get my hands on a copy.
Monkey Twins,"You might know...what was that show where a cop who went to hell was sent back to Earth to ""recapture"" escaped souls?  He had to shoot them in the eye, I think--eyes being the ""windows to the soul"" and all.

I forgot who played the Devil, but he was a recognizable actor and *really* good in the role."
Monkey Twins,How are you the only person to mention this and why is it the last comment on the page. 
Monkey Twins,Sure it would. I actually haven't watched it all the way through yet.
Monkey Twins,I saw a couple of episodes of Frisky Dingo years ago and thought it was awesome. Once again I'm reminded of a show I need to go back to. I don't remember it being as lough out loud funny as Archer is (or at least I think is).
Monkey Twins,"I had forgotten all about Pushing Daisies! I remember really liking that show.
Heh, Dancing Baby sure felt weird back then :D"
Monkey Twins,Certainly. Thought about including it myself :)
Monkey Twins,"Yes, it's a gem! Bernard and Manny are some of my favorite characters on tv. Oh, I miss that show, have to watch it again soon."
Monkey Twins,I'm so happy to see someone else who likes Garth Marenghi's Darkplace.
Monkey Twins,"I didn't even that first one, thanks for the tip! Always looking for new, interesting weird shows."
Monkey Twins,Haven't seen either of them yet but you're right I should. I especially want to check out Gravity Falls.
Monkey Twins,I've watched Psychoville and it's just the right kind of weird. Haven't seen Inside Number 9 yet but intend to!
Monkey Twins,I'm not sure if there's any other show with an atmosphere quite as unique as Riget. It is in a league all of its own. The stuff of most intriguing nightmares.
Monkey Twins,'cause apparently I'm an idiot.....
Monkey Twins,Haven't seen it yet but it's on my watchlist (I have a very long watchlist....). It looks interesting!
Monkey Twins,"Thanks! I haven't watched Flapjack but it looks like just the kind of show I would be into :) I just bought (yes, I'm pretty old school that way) a box of Toast of London and can't wait to see it."
Monkey Twins,"It's VERY 1995, haha. You were warned. But it was an insane little show. Like Firefly, some episodes never aired at all, and many that did air were out of order. They're even out of order on the DVD, weirdly: I had to find a fan site that showed the correct order to watch."
Monkey Twins,"Archer is funnier, but Frisky Dingo is more WTF just happened."
Monkey Twins,I watched it on Sci-Fi Channel or Adult Swim. 
Monkey Twins,No big deal.  They got pills for that now.
Monkey Twins,I had to do that with Firefly
Monkey Twins,Oh is that what those pills they keep feeding to me are for?! 
Monkey Twins,"If you haven't figured it out yet, no, those must be for something else."
Monkey Twins,somehow saw this one coming ;)
November 13: Attack on Paris,Watching it
November 13: Attack on Paris,"Just in case people are wondering. 

Yes, this should actually be the end of the series. No more parts or editions, this is the end."
November 13: Attack on Paris,"They keep using the word “Final Season”, but I don’t think they know what it means."
November 13: Attack on Paris,This title looks like all of my ‘final’ premiere exports.
November 13: Attack on Paris,"Having read the manga, I cannot wait to see how people who haven't yet will react to the ending. 

I've been really loving this ""final season"" though, so I hope that the wait will be worth it."
November 13: Attack on Paris,Fuckers. I was hoping for may or June. Season 4 “the final season” came out in 2020! Three and a half years later it’s still going.
November 13: Attack on Paris,"Yeah but what about Attack on Titan: The Final Season (Final Edition): The Final Part (for real this time, we fucking mean it), the penultimate season?"
November 13: Attack on Paris,Attack on Titan: The Final Season (Final Edition): Part 2: Eren’s Revenge: The Conclusive Ending - 358/2 Days (Taylor’s Version)
November 13: Attack on Paris,"Stupid and silly title aside.

What a fucking episode.

i am more positve towards the narrative/plot points of the ending (but i dislike the pacing and dialogue), but if the anime expands and makes some extra scenes like this first cour did, then i will be more than happy with the end result."
November 13: Attack on Paris,Attack on Titan 4.0+3.2 Your animation studio cannot rumbling
November 13: Attack on Paris,Hasn’t it been on the final season for a really long time?
November 13: Attack on Paris,Jesus Christ. Wrap it up already!
November 13: Attack on Paris,why you guys make the same joke every time. its just a fucking title.
November 13: Attack on Paris,"This is beyond silly. Like what? Just call the first part Season 4 and Part 2 Season 5.

Part 3 Part 1 was just a 1 hour episode..... now it's back to a 7 month wait. Damn. They are really hurting this show. It's been terribly managed not just with the release schedules but even changing the studio."
November 13: Attack on Paris,"I gave up on this show a while ago. I’ve read the manga and just, no."
November 13: Attack on Paris,"So I always wanted to binge watch this show ever since it was announced.... kinda glad I did, it's been what, 10 years? Is the anime follow the manga closely?"
November 13: Attack on Paris,"I think I'll just wait until part 2 of the finale is out to watch it. This would've been great as a full feature, rather than two separate parts."
November 13: Attack on Paris,Everybody needs to cut it the fuck out with this half a season at a time shit.

I remember."
November 13: Attack on Paris,"I know its petty and v 'first world problems' but I'm so annoyed by the release timeline of this goddamn show. 

- four year gap between season 1 and 2: ok, fine.
- breaking season 3 into 2 parts: I'll bregudgingly accept it

but release something called 'the final season' and it should **be the final season**.

Dividing it into *four* chunks over **three long years**... It feels like an intentional slight. 

I don't know if theres a good reason for the delay, if there is I would be less annoyed. I cant imagine what one would be as covid alone can't be it. But if theres not the fans should each be presented with the person responsible and be allowed to yell at them for a bit."

November 13: Attack on Paris,"Meh, wasnt that good after the first season imo. Disappointed!"
November 13: Attack on Paris,[removed]
November 13: Attack on Paris,I feel like the final season shouldnt have a part 2...
November 13: Attack on Paris,Why and how can it possibly be so far from now?
November 13: Attack on Paris,I don't mind if they keep extending it as long as we get new intros. Never been a bad one.
November 13: Attack on Paris,Rebuild of Kyojin 1.11: You Can (Not) Shingeki
November 13: Attack on Paris,SAYS WHO
November 13: Attack on Paris,And here I was expecting the Final Mix version
November 13: Attack on Paris,"That means the studio can get back to work on Dorohedoro Season 2! I've never been into anime before, I watched the few episodes of Cowboy Bebop then fell off, but Dorohedoro was fucking amazing."
November 13: Attack on Paris,Unless….
November 13: Attack on Paris,"A lot of stuff is getting its final season, because attack on titan is actually ending, I may have to finally get around to watching it. sometimes I don't feel like watching an anime because I'm so far behind or it's so long running of a series it'd take forever to catch up."
November 13: Attack on Paris,They'll finish with a three hour movie. Released as a trilogy.
November 13: Attack on Paris,I'm still confused lol. How many more episodes after this one? Just one and that's the end?
November 13: Attack on Paris,I will finally be able to watch the whole thing. I've been holding off for so many years.
November 13: Attack on Paris,We've heard that before.
November 13: Attack on Paris,These motherfuckers will make at least one movie to milk AoT as long as possible.
November 13: Attack on Paris,"Yeah OK, I've heard that shit before. I'm waiting till the series has beem ""finished"" for a year or goo

This is what the 4th or 5th ""final"""
November 13: Attack on Paris,Don't tempt them
November 13: Attack on Paris,Maybe some bonus OVA as a treat
November 13: Attack on Paris,"Thank you. I've been waiting to watch this entire season until I knew when I reached the end, it would be the end."
November 13: Attack on Paris,"""Attack on Titan: The Final Season"" is just the title I guess. 

Didn't they change studios for this ""final season"" too? Maybe they can't use the title ""Attack on Titan"" anymore for copyright or whatever reason, so they had to change the title to ""Attack on Titan: The Final Season"", but really, it's 3 separate seasons."
November 13: Attack on Paris,It's about as final as Final Fantasy

November 13: Attack on Paris,It's gonna be like witnessing a kid realizing there's no santa.
November 13: Attack on Paris,They changed something from the manga in the episode that aired yesterday.
November 13: Attack on Paris,"With how this episode came out, yeah they can take their time till Fall."
November 13: Attack on Paris,Pandemic fucked everything up...
November 13: Attack on Paris,The Penultimate Season doesn't sound very final

November 13: Attack on Paris,[from the vault]
November 13: Attack on Paris,"I feel most people manga fans will agree with you there. I have a fairly negative opinion on the ending, but improving the dialogue and pacing will definitely make the experience much better. They did an amazing job with the first cour (especially with Hange) and I hope they continue to improve."
November 13: Attack on Paris,Pretty good one but the sequels... You cannot watch... You have to wait... And my favorite... You thought this was it.
November 13: Attack on Paris,Since 2020.
November 13: Attack on Paris,Clearly because it’s a ridiculous title lol
November 13: Attack on Paris,Why are you mad? It's just jokes.
November 13: Attack on Paris,Because it's fucking ridiculous that they can't manage to just fucking make the ending and keep making these stupid ass titles because even they don't *know* if they've actually ended it or not *somehow*
November 13: Attack on Paris,fr. hahah the final final final final final season part 78 part 5 part 7!
November 13: Attack on Paris,"> It's been terribly managed not just with the release schedules but even changing the studio.

Agreed the committee did a pretty bad job with the naming convention of the seasons and the release schedules, but the change in animation studio wasn't really that bad. MAPPA has done a great job for the time they were given & the direction of the previous seasons."
November 13: Attack on Paris,"> This is beyond silly. Like what? Just call the first part Season 4 and Part 2 Season 5.


""Attack on Titan: The Final Season"" is just the title now I guess. 

Didn't they change studios for this ""final season"" too? Maybe they can't use the title ""Attack on Titan"" anymore for copyright or whatever reason, so they had to change the title to ""Attack on Titan: The Final Season"", but really, it's 3 separate seasons."
November 13: Attack on Paris,"They know the ending is bad so theyre milking the build up for as long as they can. Honestly, Todd Howard should hire them all. Impressive stuff."
November 13: Attack on Paris,Yeah the ending is straight ass
November 13: Attack on Paris,the show levels up massively with the second half of season 3 onwards. if you were even like 60% interested/invested in the story after finishing season 1 then its worth watching.
November 13: Attack on Paris,"Yes. And don't listen to other people's opinions on this there's a lot of bitter manga readers out there who didn't like the ending and have since made it the mission of their pathetic lives to shit talk and hate on the entire franchise whenever possible.

While the very end is controversial, there's been near consensus among fans that the rest of it only gets better and better and is peak fiction. I don't think a bad ending changes that. Why should what would eventually be one bad episode dissuade you from consuming 63 incredible ones?"
November 13: Attack on Paris,Season 2 is really good and the second half of season 3 is peak TV.
November 13: Attack on Paris,The second half of season 3 and first half of season 4 is seriously 10/10 TV. The other stuff is still a solid 9/10 but those parts are just incredible.
November 13: Attack on Paris,"As someone who took a while to get into it and then really fell in love with the series is it worth it?



No.



After a certain point the story becomes incredibly rushed and the ending is honestly dog water I reread the final chapter 3 times thinking this couldn't be it that it was just some joke but nope it's all legit and it ruined a really good series. You're better off watching the goofy spinoff series where there chibi's and in school cause at least that's more satisfying to watch (it's also pretty good)."
November 13: Attack on Paris,"the content in the very last parts of the manga are pretty insane. basically the final battle has an absurd amount of shit going on. they probably were planning on releasing it all in march as a 2+ hour movie but it got too much. 

someone somewhere high up decided itd be better to still release something in march to keep discussion goinf"
November 13: Attack on Paris,Says Paths.
November 13: Attack on Paris,Says there only being 60 to 90 minutes of source material left to adapt.
November 13: Attack on Paris,Only Ymir knows..
November 13: Attack on Paris,That OST will live in my head rent free for the next decade.
November 13: Attack on Paris,im sadly like 90% sure its just not gonna have a 2nd season
November 13: Attack on Paris,First half was amazing but I felt like it really lost steam and they didn’t know where to go with the plot
November 13: Attack on Paris,"The studio (MAPPA) already handles big names like Vinland Saga, God Of High-school, Chainsawman etc, and according to reports they picked up One Punch S3 as well, so i would keep my expectations low"
November 13: Attack on Paris,"That's where I've been with this one. Too many episodes to make it through if there isn't a finale ready, because I have too much on my list to just re-watch it in years when the finale comes out."
November 13: Attack on Paris,"Until the final segment of that trilogy gets split into two parts. 

Imo that is the worst thing that came out of the Harry Potter series. The 2 part finale film."
November 13: Attack on Paris,"Yup, another long episode like the one we got today."
November 13: Attack on Paris,"No, we haven't. And we've known where it's at in regards to the source material the entire time. This is the end"
November 13: Attack on Paris,It is legitimately the end. There is no more material to adapt after this.
November 13: Attack on Paris,"Probably would've been more appropriate to title ""the final season"" differently. There's a pretty big time jump between season 3 and ""season 4"". Basically like going from Naruto to Shippuden. Except it's about 1/10 as long"
November 13: Attack on Paris,"doubt it's anything copyright specific, the studio wouldn't own the copyright for the show much less the title. They just love using dumb names"
November 13: Attack on Paris,"Yes, the new studio is much worse than the old one in quality and animation"
November 13: Attack on Paris,It's about as final as Terraria last update.
November 13: Attack on Paris,[deleted]
November 13: Attack on Paris,What did they change?

November 13: Attack on Paris,Attack on titan is so damn weird it premiered when I was in highschool and I thought it was cool and even got a movie with very little content out and then it took waaaaaaay too long for a second season and I lost interest even though looking back now there’s not that much content for it to take like 10+ years to cover in an anime

Americas Got Talent,"I lost my fiancé to breast cancer at 33 just before I saw this audition. It really resonated with me because she reminded me a lot of my fiancé. They both had a fearlessness to them while staring Death in the face. 

R.I.P. 

FUCK CANCER!"
Americas Got Talent,Her audition was one of the best I’ve ever seen in the history of this show. Rest in peace Jane/Nightbirde.
Americas Got Talent,"She may not be here anymore but a little bit of her lives in us with her music, her optimism, her joy and wise words. 

Decades later, her music will come on someday in the car or her quotes will be used in some films. We’ll look back and say, “We were there. We were there when she first took the stage and left us with these beautiful pieces to remember her by.”

Be at peace, Nightbirde.  
It is now well with your soul."
Americas Got Talent,“It’s alright to be lost sometimes.” - Nightbirde
Americas Got Talent,I just learned about her last night. Sad day.
Americas Got Talent,"“You can’t wait until life isn’t hard anymore, before you decide to be happy.”

She was such a wonderful light and beautiful soul."
Americas Got Talent,"You don’t know this. I was close to offing myself last night, pain to end then i saw news of her death. Youtubed her audition again, regained 2% hope. “2% is something. It’s not nothing.” Nightbirde, God sent you to us and left 2% in each of us to make it through another day. You saved not my life but my spirit as well, Nightbirde. 2%. Thank you."
Americas Got Talent,"Join me in saying the motto of people deal with cancer everywhere: **FUCK CANCER**


She had breast cancer - so here are some organizations to donate to if you are interested in helping young adults with cancer, or BC in general:

Americas Got Talent,I hope she finds rest after an amazing fight against a foe who cheats. Fuck cancer.
Americas Got Talent,Oh man I was not expecting to read this tbh- I swore I saw a video circulating where she said she was in remission.
Americas Got Talent,Gosh that’s too bad.
Americas Got Talent,RIP NightBird
Americas Got Talent,She tackled her illness with positivity and her singing was amazing. I’m sorry to hear this. Rest In Peace.
Americas Got Talent,Such a memorable talented artist
Americas Got Talent,"Oh man. This is bad, sad news. She was wonderful."
Americas Got Talent,I think she did an original song too and wowed the judges with it
Americas Got Talent,Well that sucks. I literally searched last night to see how she was doing and it seemed she was doing okay (for someone who was dying).
Americas Got Talent,"I am very saddened by this news, I am sorry for her family and friends 💟 she was so wonderfully positive."
Americas Got Talent,May we all remember her courage and beauty. Life is short but she lived hers one day at a time. She will be singing in heaven and I can still hear that wonderful voice!!!
Americas Got Talent,Oof
Americas Got Talent,"Genuine question: Did her performance really depress anyone else, or was it just me?

I really enjoyed the sentiment of this woman's message and appreciate the inspiration this woman passed on to others through her performance, but the whole ""You can’t wait until life isn’t hard anymore, before you decide to be happy.” line...she might as well have been telling me to think happy thoughts so I can fly in like in Peter Pan. I have literally *fantasized* about having cancer or some other terminal disease so that I can hurry up and die without the added pain my suicide might cause my family.

 I am HIGHLY resistant to every anti-depressant/anxity/psychotic med out there, therapy and meditation seem to do nothing, and that is aside from the shit that has happened in my life that I had no control over or fault in.

I can decide to be happy as much as I can decide to be invisible, and knowing that happiness is a ""choice"" for some people just depresses me further."
Americas Got Talent,Fuck cancer

Americas Got Talent,😞

Americas Got Talent,That asshole stole my Pops in 2012 and I will never forgive it. Bile Duct Cancer: diagnosis to death 3 months. ***FUCK CANCER.***
Americas Got Talent,She was. Then she wasn't.
Americas Got Talent,She had an aggressive fuck of a cancer and it decided to come back.
Americas Got Talent,"Remission doesn't mean cancer is going away, just that it stops growing at that time. It can easily start growing again."
Americas Got Talent,"Hi. I used to think this deciding to be joyful thing was total bullshit too. 

Until I began to give it a go about 6 years ago - and absolutely nobody could be more surprised at the change in my outlook and mental health than me. 

I started making regular decisions, in the midst of feeling like absolute shit (bedridden with physical illness and crippling depression) to appreciate something even if I didn’t feel anything positive as a result of that appreciation (which most often I didn’t.) 

Slowly but surely, my neurochemistry began to change as I focussed on the good things. I am still very unwell, but I am so joyful. People used to not want to be around me because I was so incredibly negative. Now, I seem to be a people magnet and I get so many comments about how positive and radiant I am to be around. I feel so different, and it was all because of small, tiny, very difficult, daily decisions to be appreciative, grateful, admiring, thankful, positive in thoughts and words, humorous, even as everything was falling down around me. 

If that can happen to me, then I have every faith that you can change your brain too."
Americas Got Talent,The tune that plays when you make an appearance
Americas Got Talent,How edgy and cool can high schoolers get?! Man I’m jealous.
Americas Got Talent,"no, she didn't lose a ""battle with cancer"" - she dealt with the disease the best she could"

Americas Got Talent,"That is not correct- remission means that all tests, scans, physical exams etc show no signs of cancer."
Americas Got Talent,"In the words of Norm McDonald ""I'm not a doctor, but I'm pretty sure if you die, the cancer dies at exactly the same time. That's not a loss, that's a draw."""
Americas Got Talent,"Thank you for sharing the link. I had never seen/heard this and I’m moved to tears by her strength, her voice, and outlook on life."
Americas Got Talent,"I know someone that had breast cancer, twice. She went through treatment. The treatment really messed her up. 

I don’t have family history of it. But if I do get it I’ve always decided to take my boobs off. Told my partner that as well. 

The treatments seem worse than the cancer in some instances. Fuck cancer and the treatments."
Americas Got Talent,"That is one point of view you can take with cancer - but the issue with cancer being a battle or fight implies that if you ""lose"" you didn't try hard enough. That isn't the case at all - you can feel like death some days due to any of the various shit the treatments put you through, and sometimes you get brief reprieves because maybe you are on a medication vacation, or maybe you just got a bag of steroids, or maybe you didn't vomit on your new treatment and you have vomited on every other treatment you have tried.



I hope you and your doctors keep a very close eye on it - and that you have been tested for the various mutations associated with it. I hope you never get it because cancer fucking sucks."
Americas Got Talent,"Easy to say til it's sucked every last ounce of energy from you, til you've been poked full of holes for biopsies, scans, infusions, fluids and more, til you've been awake every night for a year vomiting your lungs out from the cancer, pain and treatment. It's not a war, war has rules and follows a cycle, even if one of day and night - the soldiers on both sides still need to rest or sleep at some point. With cancer, the person with it never gets to sleep and the cancer is always fighting, never following the rules. Honestly nothing feels like more of a cop out from someone than them telling me to keep fighting my cancer, it's hollow. Statistics are not on my side in this and if/when I inevitably die to it, I don't want to be viewed as a loser - nothing could be further from the truth. I put in my time and continue to, not dead yet, but that doesn't make me a soldier in some bullshit war against cancer. Cancer is a disease with no goal except to proliferate wherever it is, at the expense of the life of the person it is in."
Americas Got Talent,"Partially correct. There is partial and complete remission.

https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/diagnosis-staging/prognosis#:~:text=Remission%20means%20that%20the%20signs,say%20that%20you%20are%20cured."
Americas Got Talent,"News to me. I'm going to look into that because I've never, ever, heard of it being used as ""all gone""."
Americas Got Talent,"Shows no signs is the key phrase. One can still have cancer cells in the body. That is why when one's cancer comes back, it is called recurrence, which happened to one of my brothers."
Americas Got Talent,"You're thinking of *complete* remission, it's you who is not correct."
Americas Got Talent,"exactly, it's a draw with the nasty fuck"
Americas Got Talent,"no problem, it was great"
Americas Got Talent,"Always, always get your check up. My family had no history of cancer. Then one by one 3 of my brothers got cancer. Each had a different type of cancer. And each passed away from it. Two within a year. One had one type, in remission, then it came back attacking a different part of his body.  He had his regular checkups for his cancer every 4 months. One had stomach cancer, & the doctors did not catch it until it was too late. Which unfortunately can happen since it is usually stage 4 when most discover it. They both had treatment. My brother with the stomach cancer, went for experiment treatment in TX. He ended up sick in the hospital for the last month due to this treatment.  And my last brother had just had his colonoscopy 8 months beforehand. He too was in Stage 4. He decided to do his bucket list after trying treatment. No rhyme or reason to any of this. Fuck Fuck CRAP CANCER!"
Americas Got Talent,"Honestly, cancer is.. let's just call it weird. Every cancer doesn't get the same treatment, and different types of the same cancer get different treatment and it is a whole pile of file. Insurance only covers a mastectomy in certain cases - and sometimes they don't recommend one because treatment is much more pressing (since they usually cannot do both at the same time, since you need time to recover from surgery and chemo doesn't exactly help with that).


One tip I suggest is that if you ever have to do treatment for cancer, see if you can get a neuropsychological evaluation beforehand - so you can gauge the chemo brain"
Americas Got Talent,"Unfortunately breast cancer is so complicated and mastectomy may not always be the best solution because it may cause the cancer to spread faster, depending on the type of cancer and where it is (some cancers if they are ‘agitated’ like cut they may grow more aggressively when they ‘heal’ from being cut so sometimes they recommend only shrinking it with chemo for example)."
Americas Got Talent,"Yeah.. cancer is so crazy. My friend growing up ‘beat’ cancer at 5 years old and it was ‘gone’ until she was 25 and it ‘came back’ 
and was so severe she died soon after.. the same kind of cancer. I don’t get it. Was it there the whole time or did she get it again? You know what I mean?"
Americas Got Talent,"FUCK CANCER


also uhhh with that much cancer, did you guys grow up in one place? Could be an environmental thing"
Americas Got Talent,"I know they say you are “cancer free” after 5 years of remission, but sometimes that seems arbitrary when you hear about people having recurrences long after the 5 year mark. I don’t really understand it"
Americas Got Talent,"We spent the majority of our lives in one neighborhood, where most of the neighbors were the same(some even still live there).  Most are our friends, and the next generation. None have cancer, or anything that would point to the same thing(you know there's been heart attacks, old age, etc).  We basically questioned it as well, & wish there was something to go on."
Americas Got Talent,it a superfund site?

* Have a super great amazing talent.

* Have a super sad depressing back story and an ok talent.

* Have a super terrible talent. 

* (forgot this one) be super adorable or super hot

* (edit #2) be famous in another country

Most people who you see audition were scouted for the show and were already aware they will go through."
Americas Got Talent,[deleted]
Americas Got Talent,"I had a thought like this recently, ""couldn't they just make up their own performances and get actors to play as contestants?"" Also thought that it was fake because they have mics on some of the audience... 
EDIT: wow this took off, I guess I shared a mutual feeling with a lot of people. But wasn't AGT original and real at some time? Like when Lindsey Stirling got famous?"
Americas Got Talent,"These ""fake"" magicians, using VFX are pissing me off and its about time they were majorly called out.

Theres a British magician called Dynamo ,who had a TV series. I loved the first couple of seasons , as his sleight of hand is very good. But the last couple of seasons clearly used VFX , and theres no need for it. Another illusionist, Troy, used VFX from the start on his show. Really grinds my gears and pisses on the art."
Americas Got Talent,Holy shit did you guys see what he did at the end of that video? AMAZING! How did he do that?
Americas Got Talent,"""Wait a minute, are we really saying that the producers of this competition--which celebrates the art of live performance--would modify what happens on stage with editing tricks to make contestants seem better or worse than they did in real life to suite the dramatic needs of the program?

Well... yeah. It's a reality show. It's all fake."""
Americas Got Talent,"I was a part of the studio audience when this was performed 'live'. 

This particular act was actually performed with the judges still in the dressing room & we didn't get a big-screen to see what the heck was going on. 

The audience was told they were just getting a second shot so we just did what we were told & kind of just sat there and watched in confusion. 

FWIW: It seems like they imposed our pre-recorded cheers in between shots.

EDIT: Oh snap...it's my cake day :o"
Americas Got Talent,[deleted]
Americas Got Talent,"Yeah all these shows are fake as shit.

Even the whole Susan Boyle thing.  The whole set up with Simon Cowell rolling his eyes and the audience making fun of her before singing was all set-up to make her more famous than normal."
Americas Got Talent,"Cool, that's some nice editing on the video. Didn't know about this channel, seems interesting.

Edit: I really didn't expect a simple comment like this to get so many likes lol"
Americas Got Talent,"It's always great to see this fantastic channel get some attention. The most common comment on his videos over the years is ""Why the fuck doesn't this guy have more views/subscribers?"" Don't just click away after viewing this- his channel has tons of great content."

The Break with Michelle Wolf,"Good for her! She's terrifically funny (check out Nice Lady on HBO), and while Netflix has yet to crack this weekly topical thing, this plus the Hasan Minhaj thing they have coming, they might just swoop in and steal Comedy Central's thunder.
"
The Break with Michelle Wolf,"For me, nothing has come close to the quality of Last Week Tonight. I am hopeful for the Michelle Wolf show because I think having a show once a week helps the quality a lot, and it seems more relaxed than some of the other political satire shows."
The Break with Michelle Wolf,it's a break from when your ears aren't bleeding
The Break with Michelle Wolf,She's an excellent comedy writer but she is not a performer and the voice thing is an obstacle...
The Break with Michelle Wolf,It's the equivalent of nails screeching over a blackboard.
The Break with Michelle Wolf,It's almost as bad as Fran Drescher.
The Break with Michelle Wolf,How else are we going to hear the same jokes about Trump over and over again?
The Break with Michelle Wolf,"Until we get someone who is on par with Jon Stewart, we're going to keep trying."
The Break with Michelle Wolf,"He's got enough material for everyone, don't worry. "
The Break with Michelle Wolf,yea her stand-up was surprisingly good since I hadn't really heard anything about her before that
The Break with Michelle Wolf,"I'm still enjoying the Joel Mchale show for what it is, I don't think Netflix will ever want to rely on a single ""weekly topical show"" unless they really strike gold with someone."
The Break with Michelle Wolf,"Women generally just aren't as funny, although I think it may just be a psychological thing about laughing at women"
The Break with Michelle Wolf,Remember the Drumpf stuff. That was awesome. Funny!
The Break with Michelle Wolf,She’s self aware of the voice thing too. When I saw her live she had a bit about it.
The Break with Michelle Wolf,I agree and predict Netflix will pull the plug after one season
The Break with Michelle Wolf,"At least Fran Drescher was sort of hot

Ps her 6 fans nailed you too haha"
The Break with Michelle Wolf,😂
The Break with Michelle Wolf,"Yea, I'm sure there won't be any repeats. Not one at all"
The Break with Michelle Wolf,"Yea, that piece offended a lot of people, but most people who watch Last Week Tonight have a college education, so they aren't Trump supporters and don't mind jokes about Trump."
The Break with Michelle Wolf,"All women are aware of ""the voice thing"""
The Break with Michelle Wolf,"No, she definitely has some sort of speech impediment."
The Break with Michelle Wolf,If she were a male comic we'd call him Gilbert Gottfried and love him for it.
The Break with Michelle Wolf,Gilbert has old time comedic voice but he speaks with clarity
The Break with Michelle Wolf,Her voice is so grating. 
The Break with Michelle Wolf,I always thought she has moments of being funny but it’s definitely not enough to carry her own show.
The Break with Michelle Wolf,I watched the first episode and was surprisingly entertained.  I’ve not watched the latest one though.
The Break with Michelle Wolf,I was actually surprised by how much I liked it...unpopular opinion I guess
The Break with Michelle Wolf,"I watched some of the first episode, and it felt...kind of lazy? Like sort of obvious jokes that, sure, may elicit a chuckle, but nothing more than that. Definitely didn't make me want to tune in for more."
The Break with Michelle Wolf,oh no! Heavily political skits! Muh right-wing safe space! SHRIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK
The Break with Michelle Wolf,"I think it's a run of the mill talk show. Their commercial parodies are pretty good, there's some OK jokes, it's not too focused on political jokes that people have already made. Just as good as Trevor Noah or Conan. "
The Break with Michelle Wolf,[deleted]
The Break with Michelle Wolf,"The more triggered you are the more on point I think she is. I mean dude, she got you to be so angry that you got on Reddit to complain, when you were watching her show on a streaming site. More power to you if you just let it die quietly, but you obviously need to work some stuff out. We are here to listen my friend, what's on your mind?"
The Break with Michelle Wolf,"Okay, so you didn’t like her show...don’t watch it.

What do you want, a commemorative plaque or something?"
The Break with Michelle Wolf,Loved her at the white house correspondents dinner and started watching the show because of it. First episode was ok. Second was bad. And third is one big cringe. A lot of the show feels like one big self congratulatory pat on the back.
The Break with Michelle Wolf,Regardless of her views she’s an awful comedian. Also...that face. 
The Break with Michelle Wolf,...you seem moderately triggered mate
The Break with Michelle Wolf,"Exactly how I felt watching it, and it looks like the audience felt the same way. Some of the bits and jokes were good, but the need for approval and to be political non stop stifles the show. I get that having an actual idiot in the White House is an endless source of material, but delivery is everything, and thats the biggest flaw of her show. "
The Break with Michelle Wolf,"Yeah. Hosting comedy is like throwing darts blindfolded.

Very few people can land lots of bullseyes, some people can land most of them on the target.

But the rest of the people just end up getting most darts all over the wall, and some poor chap passing by too close to the target. "
The Break with Michelle Wolf,"Big fan of Wolf and her stand up. The first episode was pretty good, but I thought the second episode dipped. Lot of the jokes were *really* lazy and not at all clever. Weirdly out of character for her.

It's her first show though. I imagine she needs some time to find her stride, which is fine."
The Break with Michelle Wolf,TRUMP AM I RIGHT? *canned laughter sounds*
The Break with Michelle Wolf,"A lot of comedians are coming to her defense (justifiably so) and saying how great a comedian she is - but I think they're defending her rights and going a bit far when talking about her talents. I thought that maybe she was this great comedian I had missed - nope, she's not really that funny or witty. The WHCD really elevated her beyond her talents. "
The Break with Michelle Wolf,I think its just a really bad show. I share all of her political views. 
The Break with Michelle Wolf,"I'm not really that triggered. I saw something that could be worth a watch, and got disappointed. Just wanted to see what people thought about it, you know what people are supposed to do on Reddit, and got free psychoanalysis from random people that think this woman is the second coming of Christ. "
The Break with Michelle Wolf,Can you make me one? 
The Break with Michelle Wolf,"That's exactly my problem with it. It felt like just because of making fun at Trump worked once, she just kept at it because it it was expected of her. Safe comedy gets old soon "
The Break with Michelle Wolf,"Exactly. While I think she has the right of making fun of anyone she wants, I don't feel like she is that good at it. And let's face it Trump is an easy target, and it's not that hard to shit on him on the daily given that he is not that smart. From her show what it looked like to me was that she got hire solely on the buzz she got from the WHCD and little else. "
The Break with Michelle Wolf,"Her special ""Nice Lady"" was probably the best comedy special of 2017. Humour is subjective, of course, but that special was almost entirely devoid of politics and stood on its own. If you don't like her, that's cool, but she's definitely talented and earned this show regardless of her WHCD performance."
The Break with Michelle Wolf,"Two types of comedy consumers: 

Type 1: I want to laugh, let me turn on some comedy. 

Type 2: someone told me this was funny so I'll reluctantly watch it and it better make me laugh 

The Type 2 consumers are always going to be disappointed because they have manufactured expectations. "
The Break with Michelle Wolf,"I thought so too, was just in the mood for lively discussion that night haha "
The Break with Michelle Wolf,you're totally triggered and it's hilarious. keep up the shitty work.
The Break with Michelle Wolf,"I think your projecting your anger that everyone is just blindly agreeing with her cause she helped rope in a big population of sheeple looking for a new voice, but it just seems like you're very aggravated. I personally agree she's too fresh a comic without a strong enough direction to tackle something as saturated as a comic news broadcast, and she doesn't have nearly as much applicability as T. Noah or S. Colbert, but it is netflix. She's a niche humor, and one that hasn't been conventionally rewarded. You don't think the existence of her show is a testament to the progression of material and shows available?"
The Break with Michelle Wolf,"I could, it’ll read: 

“This award commemorates u/Jack0091 letting the world know he didn’t like a show on Netflix.”

“His heroism and insight have led multitudes to a better tomorrow because he shared an opinion nobody cares about”"
The Break with Michelle Wolf,"I am honestly done with the political humor. It's too easy and not done well. I feel like The Daily Show circa 2003-5 was the best - Stewart hit everyone, including the Dems and CNN, which is now completely absent. "
The Break with Michelle Wolf,"Thats exactly what I wanted to known! I didn't know any of her previous work, heard that she ripped Trump a new one at the WHCD and paid little attention to it and all I've seen of her was one episode of her Netflix show. I'm assuming that special was not on Netflix, since I cannot find anything by her other than her show there. "
The Break with Michelle Wolf,"Or, there is no possible way that ""turning on some comedy"" will always lead to positive results so we listen to the advice of other about who to listen to. It's hit or miss. Sometimes you stumble upon a great comedian and other times you stumble onto a Michelle Wolf. Shit happens, and in her case, the shit was her entire performance. "
The Break with Michelle Wolf,"lmao she got cancelled, I guess she was the one who kept up the shitty work"
The Break with Michelle Wolf,"Her show is increasing the quantity of material and shows available alright, does not mean it is increasing the overall quality of Netflix shows. Her lack of direction and experience shows through her show mainly when she keeps tacking the news from a tone deaf stance that elicits more claps than laughter. I'm far from aggravated, just stating how I felt about the show. What is aggravating is how everybody that likes her show does not manage to have a decent conversation about it. "
The Break with Michelle Wolf,Thanks have a great day! 
The Break with Michelle Wolf,Jonh Stewart was amazing because he called out both sides on their bullshit. Now you watch any late night TV and all you get is a bunch of people picking on the slow orange man child in the White House. No one hears a peep about the shady shit the other side does.
The Break with Michelle Wolf,Her special is on HBO
The Break with Michelle Wolf,"Listen, I agree that the first episode wasn't some landmark comedy show, but do you really think it was going to be. Her brand mainly relies on her crassness, not her comedy gold. She's taking the gloves off when it comes to taking down politicians, which is a step in the right direction. For too many years tv was controlled by the advertisers, and now you have consistent material that is no longer colored to fit party lines. I think shows like hers help widen the spectrum of what's available, but I never said that it was on the level of other pilots. If she really pushed you away good, but I think you and me are both going to really put the weight of her accomplishments on how the show progresses. Have you seen the Joel McHale show? It's another in the list of Netflix adaptations made to dealing with an already existing counterpart. I'm here and talking, where all this lack of discourse I keep hearing about?"
The Break with Michelle Wolf,I am
The Break with Michelle Wolf,"That's exactly my problem with so much of the political ""humor"" today. It's the lowest common denominator kind of laugh, and it's the worst form of satire. "
The Break with Michelle Wolf,">  She's taking the gloves off when it comes to taking down politicians

""taking down politicians"" yet the only people that even know who she is, are already living within her bubble. This isn't so much a David vs Goliath tale, more like Don Quixote vs a Windmill with the word ""Drumpf!"" finger-painted on it."
The Break with Michelle Wolf,"She might be good at taking down politicians and being crass, but those characteristics make a better activist than a comedian. I've seen the Joe McHale show and it is miles better than anything that I've seen from Wolf so far. Widening the spectrum of what is available does not better content make. "
The Break with Michelle Wolf,That voice.
The Break with Michelle Wolf,I don't know who that is but I was pretty convinced she had some sort of disability for most of that trailer
The Break with Michelle Wolf,She was hilarious on 8 out of 10 Cats does Countdown.  
The Break with Michelle Wolf,[deleted]
The Break with Michelle Wolf,She looks like Carrot Top. 
The Break with Michelle Wolf,Jesus is this another one of those Amy Schumers? 
The Break with Michelle Wolf,I'm there
The Break with Michelle Wolf,"True.  Her jokes are on point, though.  "
The Break with Michelle Wolf,It’s very unfortunate for her. Her jokes are funny.
The Break with Michelle Wolf,It seems to be a stage voice or a voice she uses when projecting because in the skits it's not really there.
The Break with Michelle Wolf,"Nah, that's just pretty standard speech for folks from Hershey Pennsylvania."
The Break with Michelle Wolf,"Dunno why you’re getting downvotes, that’s a great show!"
The Break with Michelle Wolf,"Yeah I recognised some of those nuclear grade arseholes in the room and she nailed them like they deserved.  

Not the most polished comedy but honest and brave - what we need right now.  

I was laughing out loud at some of the jokes that were greeted with death stares - thats when you know you got it right in a room of frauds if not killers :)

What a world.  "
The Break with Michelle Wolf,"No, she is quite bright.  

I thought she was going overboard on the Correspondent's Dinner but then I recognised some of the liars (at best) she was lampooning and remembered them white washing ... lies, deaths, fraud.  

We need jesters right now.  Brave ones.  I'll tolerate the funny voice :)"
The Break with Michelle Wolf,Is that sarcasm? Are we to take you 100% literally? I am honestly unsure.
The Break with Michelle Wolf,It's all the industrial chocolate waste in water.
The Break with Michelle Wolf,This is a horrible teaser. Who thinks that was funny at all.
The Break with Michelle Wolf,I'm there. She's great.
The Break with Michelle Wolf,"The only thing I've seen of her is the WHCD, which I loved. So I'm giving this show a shot because I liked her comedy in that. 

If I'd only seen this clip I would probably skip the show though. It was pretty lame."
The Break with Michelle Wolf,Does she have that Eric Stoltz Mask disease??
The Break with Michelle Wolf,"What a horribly designed website. If I accidentally move my mouse, I don't want a GUI that covers half the fucking video I was watching."
The Break with Michelle Wolf,She isn't funny
The Break with Michelle Wolf,"This teaser had more potential IMO, but I think the show could be good. She has some good standup segments I've seen in the past, but I don't know how I feel about her overall.

The voice doesn't work for me, but if she can deliver... that's what counts. 

This is one of the standup segments I saw recently: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYBmHEFJLAs"
The Break with Michelle Wolf,"Uh-oh, triggered."
The Break with Michelle Wolf,After seeing 1 clip from the white house thing and this trailer.. I concur she is not funny. 
The Break with Michelle Wolf,Pro tip: Do NOT watch this show with earbuds/headphones. 
The Break with Michelle Wolf,That was almost perfectly done. Fun Music. Great point. The background characters were a bit stiff though but it wasn't like they spent a million bucks on the bit.
The Break with Michelle Wolf,It was fun...the Sax player bullet news was hilarious - that needs to be expanded on.
The Break with Michelle Wolf,"I’ve watched all 5 episodes of this show so far and I keep hoping it will get better. If only they started focusing on character development and world building. Why is the pacing so slow? 

I like the scenes with Rodrigo Santoro and they’ve really gotta give that man more to do! I’ll admit the last part of the episode caught me by surprise and I’m begrudgingly planning to watch E6 but the show runner needs to speed things up a bit. We don’t need 20 mins of filler every episode devoted to a party somewhere where teens stare at each other in slo-mo."
The Break with Michelle Wolf,"I feel like they’ve been developing the characters decently so far, no? It’s the slow burn"
The Break with Michelle Wolf,"Ok, i am not the only one who found CGI were bad."
The Break with Michelle Wolf,"SMG is trying gamely to plug it.  This is from a [recent interview](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/sarah-michelle-gellar-interview-wolf-pack-buffy-the-vampire-slayer-1235302016/) (which is worth reading if you're a fan):

>“I wasn’t even going to read the script,” says Gellar. “I liked Jeff’s work, but I wasn’t going to do a werewolf show. But they convinced me to give it a look, and I loved what he was doing in the pilot. It reminds me of Buffy, not the show itself, but the way it addresses the horrors we’re facing today: anxiety, the stress of daily life, feeling isolated.”

Unfortunately the show is a steaming pile of dog shit so far.  I'll watch one more episode to see if it finds its feet but I don't think it will."
Oh My Venus,"While it has all the fundamentals of Dark, i dont think this show quite captured the “spark” that Dark was so famous for. Too many one dimensional characters for my liking, so above average at best."
Oh My Venus,"Dark just copied that Ethan Hawke movie ""Predestination"""
Oh My Venus,"I’m a big fan of Dark, so I’ve started this but after watching 2 episodes I have to admit it hasn’t really grabbed me yet, I’ll give it one more episode, but tbh I’m just about ready to tap out."
Oh My Venus,"Would be interesting to see how it performs for people who have NOT seen Dark think that is likely the most important thing.       

Lot of Dark fans will likely watch it even if they dont think its good"
Oh My Venus,"This show has a much longer slow burn than Dark S1, because Dark’s premise started immediately (time travel). You don’t even get to anywhere near the premise until episode 5 or 6."
Oh My Venus,"It feels like they spent more time setting up the mysteries than actually creating intriguing characters, everything feels very storyboarded and stiff. But I’m also only on episode two so will watch at least four before I make a judgement. I like all the actors enough and the setting is fantastic. I just wish they could draw me into the atmosphere more, it feels like everything is just place to place with nice outside shots and then people meeting and having mysterious conversations."
Oh My Venus,"I didn't see Dark (though now I want to watch it). I LOVED the earlier 1899 eps, but the ending is falling flat for me (I'm in the middle of the final ep now... and as you can see I'm on Reddit on my second monitor). 

I really don't like the twists that came in the latter half (even though they're being explained in this final ep), I wish we knew a lot LOT LOT more about the characters, and the pacing just seems to be totally off. It feels almost as if the entire Lost, all the seasons, were packed into 8 eps."
Oh My Venus,Would love some bloopers
Oh My Venus,Feels like it just started. I can't believe it's over already.
Oh My Venus,Have Nick Offerman and Bella talk shit to each other since we missed out on Bill fighting with Ellie
Oh My Venus,I don't want to spoil any future stories for myself. Can I play the video game after season 1 ends?
Oh My Venus,You guys would definitely check out Hot Ones most recent episode. Its Pedro Pascal himself!
Oh My Venus,If they don’t reenact the musical alternate ending I’m gonna be very disappointed.
Oh My Venus,"I wish they had more in depth videos about what goes into making each episode. For the final few seasons of Game of Thrones, HBO released like 20 minute long clips about the costumes, the stunt choreography, the special effects and nearly everything else behind the scenes. It have great insight into all the work that goes into each installment."
Oh My Venus,so mixed with the podcast that's \~3h of TLoU content on Sunday. fucking eh.
Oh My Venus,It's been a gift watching these two people star in sci-fi fantasy shows. I can't wait to see what they do next in other movies.
Oh My Venus,Gotta get my fix!
Oh My Venus,Guess I'll be watching it while silently weeping. It's something I guess. 😭
Oh My Venus,"I like the actors, but after watching the first two episodes I had to turn it off. The screenplay and dialog are too formulaic and predictable. In fact, all story lines appear to be lifted from: A Boy and His Dog, Dawn of the Dead, WD, or any other zombie post apocalyptic narrative. I found incredibly tedious to sit through. Again, the acting was fine."
Oh My Venus,Cool advert
Oh My Venus,"I kinda thought they'd expand more on the characters that we love, there's a whole backstory in the days before Joel meets Ellie that I really wanted to see...

9 episodes and 1 was a dlc episode that came after the main game was out for a year. 

Bit of a shame considering Last of Us 2 has even less Joel."
Oh My Venus,"The last of us and the mandalorian are the same show.

Prove me wrong"
Oh My Venus,[removed]
Oh My Venus,[removed]
Oh My Venus,Thats good. I feel like I wanted something akin to the House of the Dragon specials they released each week for these episodes. At least we get this.
Oh My Venus,"People should watch Prospect with Pedro Pascal. 

His dialogue in that movie is great."
Oh My Venus,Or some Joel and Ellie fake deaths like when they die in the game.
Oh My Venus,"apparently pedro pascal did his l.a. accent a lot while on set, as did his other cast members. would like to see that as well"
Oh My Venus,The Laughs Of Us.
Oh My Venus,I feel like 10-12 episodes would have been perfect. 9 is on the short side.
Oh My Venus,1st game shouldve been 2 seasons tbh
Oh My Venus,"For sure can play Part I since it will end where season 1 ends. And who knows maybe you’ll want to play part II afterwards anyway, not a spoiler if it’s ultimately going to be the same story :). I think it’s a story worth experiencing via it’s original medium first."
Oh My Venus,You better end up playing Part II fairly soon because I feel like you’re not gonna be able to avoid spoiler talk after season 1 ends
Oh My Venus,"Yes, season 1 is just the first game including dlc. It's a great game, if you've ps5 or pc you can pick it up cheap enough if you keep an eye on sales. Otherwise you got the ps4 remaster which is still really good"
Oh My Venus,Play Part 1 as it won’t spoil anything and it’s an incredible game. Don’t play part 2 if you don’t want the rest of the show spoiled
Oh My Venus,"""You're smart"" - Pedro to Sean"
Oh My Venus,"I just watched that episode, it was amazing. Pedro Pascal is so damn charming, I just want to hang out with him"
Oh My Venus,"[Listen to the podcast to scratch a bit of that itch](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/hbos-the-last-of-us-podcast/id1660320068) \- I believe they are all over 40 mins long and this includes Druckman, Mazin and it is hosted by Troy Baker. Can't get more inside than that!"
Oh My Venus,"Jo and Mal from the Ringer-verse are also doing an interview/recap with Craig Maizin and Neil Druckman, so an extra 2 hours there if you want"
Oh My Venus,"Pedro has to do a project with Nathan Fillion where they can play brothers. Christ, their speaking voices even sound alike."
Oh My Venus,Maybe they’re saving that storyline for later seasons to help even out joel time
Oh My Venus,"They both have different show title names and are also set in a different universe.

Damn, that was easy"
Oh My Venus,Why would anyone care about proving you wrong? Demomstrate that you're correct or your assertion is to be laughed at and dismissed.
Oh My Venus,"I mean they're literally different. 

Dumbass."
Oh My Venus,"This apple and this orange are the same thing.

Prove me wrong."
Oh My Venus,[removed]
Oh My Venus,[removed]
Oh My Venus,[removed]
Oh My Venus,"It would be a little *too* on the meta-nose.

But I would have loved to see Pascal killing Baker while being unable to talk. Voiceless at it were.

For those few not in the know: Joel in the show killing the actor in the show (Buddy Boy) that played Joel in the game (voice + motion caption)."
Oh My Venus,Is this a spoiler? What the fuck bro
Oh My Venus,Oh mah gahhhhhhh!
Oh My Venus,They did make 10 episodes. HBO then combined the first two into a movie length premiere because they thought it worked better dramatically and because otherwise most of the pilot would be the 2003 flashback.
Oh My Venus,It is 10 with the double length of the first episode.
Oh My Venus,Having 9 episodes where two of them are around one hour and 20 minutes is what I’d prefer
Oh My Venus,"How? The game takes about 15 hours to complete, most of which is gameplay. At most this could have 10 episodes instead of 9, but there is not enough story for 2 seasons."
Oh My Venus,Gotta love how a mildly unpopular opinion gets you downvoted to -44.
Oh My Venus,That’s too much. 12 episodes I could get into. 2 seasons is overkill.
Oh My Venus,"Unfortunately it’s not on PC until the end of this month, and it’s $60 so probably won’t be cheap for a while."
Oh My Venus,The stuff that he says isn't even *that* funny but he's so goddamn charming that Sean is losing it and I'm laughing just as much.
Oh My Venus,"Hope so, they nailed the actors and Tommy needs more screen time, I want to know what Joel did to survive, if they can tell a new story about characters like Bill and Frank they can tell something new about the actual focal characters."
Oh My Venus,The easiet gottem of all time
Oh My Venus,"OK, you grumpy folks..The same guy, Joel, take a little child along several seasons. The child has superpowers that nobody has, and Joel has no purpose in life, till he meets the kid. The purpose now is to take him to some enigmatic place with some enigmatic people. Once he delivers, they want to take the kid down.

THE SAME SHOW.

You do not agree?

ok, how about this:

The last of us is the prequel. Ellie develops some symptoms like greeny face and longevity. Also she can be in touch with mother nature. in season 7 Joel get ill and die, and Ellie manage to take an eye of Joel, the last part not contaminated by the fungus, so she can bury him next his brother.

She place the eye ina sferic metallic ball and hit the ground. Finally she cant say goodbye and keep the ball as an amulet.

Years later, season 35, Ellie use the rounded eye of Joel, stored in a sferic ball of steel, to get Joel DNA and to revive him. They need berskar because the weekness of the skeleton, so they go to mandalor, and train as mandalorian.

It turns out Ellie is shrinking, so the ears seem to be huge, and  greening step by step.

As the reconstruction of Joel is a succes, an evil force try to make more clones,  But they need more Joel DNA.

They take Joel, kill him and get all DNA they need. They  turn the startup into a success, and start a special program of mass production on clones!

Once she finds out, she get mad about and convince a new Joel  to destroy the  Clone factory with all the clones but the last one. Ellie get injured and unable to speak again, and almost a fern by now.

The bush with ears and Silver-helmet go for the gallaxy looking for the misterious people and the enigmatic place, while grogu -she doesnt feel like a girl any more and changed her name- plays with the sferic-steel ball, that contains the last piece of his friend. They travel again and forever.

The end"

Oh My Venus,"In case this is serious, no it’s not a spoiler lol. Just happens in video games a lot"
Oh My Venus,"It’s a joke, bro. They both die a lot while playing the game."
Oh My Venus,"Games been out almost 10 years.  If you missed it that long, that's on you."
Oh My Venus,Let's put a pin in that.
Oh My Venus,"Yeah as people have pointed out, when you take out all the slow sneaking, puzzle solving, and random combat out, the actual plot of the final chapter of the game is only like 15 minutes"
Oh My Venus,I would have liked a little more of the connective tissue between sections of the game. I think we probably could have gotten 12 or 13 episodes while giving us little asides during their trip to KC or the three month gap on their way to Colorado.
Oh My Venus,"The show doesn't need to be constrained by the game, as they showed with episode 3 (an example i liked) and introducing the Kathleen character (an example I liked less)."
Oh My Venus,By using the episodes to show more of a relationship between Joel and Ellie. 8 episodes so far and 2 of them were basically standalones.
Oh My Venus,"well they already added stuff into the show that wasn’t in the game, so they could’ve just idk, wrote more into the storyline.

i dont care either way but its not like they couldn’t have done it."
Oh My Venus,They could have easily flexed their writing chops and added more episodes. Develop relationships properly to have better payoffs instead of introducing a character and killing them off the same episode.
Oh My Venus,"Yeah, not two seasons, but I think 10 or 11 episodes would have been better. The quality of TLOU isn't in the Joel and Ellie story alone. It's that they exist in a lived in world. They spent an episode on Bill and Frank. Everyone loved it. It had a very limited connection to the game, outside of them existing in the game. They gave KC residents two halves of two episodes. They gave the DLC an episode. They opened with that couple living in the middle of nowhere. It's the world building naughtydog did that gave TLOU a foundation to tell a great story.

Give me an episode on ish and kyle getting people together, and their downfall... Hell, that's easily two episodes with ish writing on the wall to no go inside, and wandering off closing the episode.

I think they really missed the best part of the game by hiding an Easter egg for ish.


I also dislike how little time we spend with Joel and Ellie just talking, but I don't see how that extends episode count vs making episodes unbearably longer."
Oh My Venus,"Doesnt have to be just the game look at ep3 and the whole bill thing, couldve ran s1 to the end of the city or even joel getting injured if you want to add some story beats to the cannibal arc. Point being it doesnt feel like joel and ellie have the same relationship they had in the game, even abit forced at times, and thats not going to make me care when xyz happens in a s2 based on a game that hit pretty 'meh' to begin with.

And thats a mild take, imagine those that are still seething about xyz happening at all"
Oh My Venus,"The last ep could have been 2-3 eps easy. And with one episode left, it really doesn't feel like there's enough room to finish the story properly. (I hope to be proven wrong, but expect it to be rushed)

And theres a bunch of stiff that could have been in there, that just isn't.

There was easily enough content for 15-18 eps"
Oh My Venus,"Was thinking the same, but they can be angy and enjoy their subpar seasons 2 & 3, god forbid 4

S1EP3 best itll ever be"
Oh My Venus,"Well get ready for that with 2nd game, i could see two 8 ep seasons doing just fine for the first"
Oh My Venus,No one's reading all that. Don't watch if you don't like it🤷‍♂️
Oh My Venus,[removed]
Oh My Venus,"I played the game...and the fakeouts are very obviously fake outs, otherwise the story ends"
Oh My Venus,"That’s why I was having a hard time seeing people say ep 8 & 9 needed to be longer when they saw their run times 

Like, take out all the gameplay and combat and plot wise I can see how the creators said we don’t need a full hour"
Oh My Venus,Yeah. They did that entirely anyways. Imagine being ok with them not spending at least 1 episode on it. Or injected as 5 minute set pieces each episode.
Oh My Venus,"Kathleen was fine, I guess. I just find it weird that they spent two episodes with her, Henry, and Sam. Henry and Sam have an effect on Joel and Ellie, sure, but a lot of Ellie’s development comes from her time with David. We saw a lot of it, but something was missing. I don’t know what, but if KC can have two episodes, there’s no reason they couldn’t flesh out David & James more, or alternatively expand on what the ending is. 43 minutes is short to wrap it up, regardless of if there’s so much gameplay."
Oh My Venus,"It's both really, episode 3 was great but looking at the season as a whole it feels like each episode is an ""arc"" and it's missing some connective tissue. There's a lot of talk about how the game is about 14 hours anyway and they can use all that gameplay time to flesh out other characters, which is great, but it's during the gameplay that Joel and Ellie's relationship builds. The show is still really good but I think they could've struck a better balance with another episode or two."
Oh My Venus,"The rest of the game from this point is under 30 minutes even including all the gameplay, stopping to listen to the recorders, reading the notes, etc. So they could cut to an actual play through of all the remaining content and it would only fill half the time slot, being rushed isn’t a concern. (I checked a play through on YouTube for the actual runtime. 28 minutes from David’s death to the end credits.)"
Oh My Venus,"who says i dont like both of them? 

i just say that are the same story, with the same principal character."
Oh My Venus,That's why they're saying they would be funny post show behind the scenes bloopers. Not something seriously used in the show.
Oh My Venus,"8 could have been longer. We definitely missed out on David and Ellie having to fight off infected , that would have been a great 10 minute segment in the show as it was important in the game"
Oh My Venus,"Episode 3: universally lauded for all the extra material added by the show runners.

Episode 9: let's just rush through it as fast as possible because it was all gameplay."
Oh My Venus,"The show has fallen into the trap if ""its a zombie apocalypse with no zombies"" 

A brief aside where they encounter infected, like the tunnel section of the game, is kinda needed for world building.

That and a few more moments of actually showing us the relationship they've forged. (Including the DLC, instead of showing us in the present, was absolutely a mistep).

And a little more space to let the ending breath, and possibly even a moment to set up the next beat, wouldn't go astray.

But there's not the runtime for that now.

I dunno. I guess we all find our tomorrow night how they go with the finale."
Oh My Venus,"You say this as if this isn't an entire subgenre of content - a kid and a father / parental figure. You'll find a lot of other shows and movies like this, I think you're basing most of your opinion on the fact that Pedro acts in both and both are airing simultaneously."
Oh My Venus,"Craig Mazin has a podcast with Neil Druckmann where they explain that things like that are combat for the game. They work for the game. It would not necessarily translate for a show. Repeated infected would get old, fast. See: TWD. 

I also would watch the show for what it is, and not always compare it to the game. It keeps the core story but does its own thing

I’m grateful for Craig and Neil’s adaptation/translation"
Oh My Venus,Both episodes were very highly reviewed. Episode 8 has the second highest user score of the series and received largely positive critic reviews. It’s not like it got trashed
Oh My Venus,"I never said that at all.

And the scene I mentioned isn’t repeated infected and a slog of a scene. 5-10 minute scene of them fighting off a hoard would have absolutely worked on the show."
Oh My Venus,"The combat section with David was what causes him to eye her. How the fuck David saying Ellie has a ""violent heart"" even makes sense when he and the audience didn't see her engaging in violence in the show?"
Oh My Venus,If they can drop the Scientology channel next that'd be great.
Oh My Venus,"I’m amazed NewsMax isn’t free to carriers like DirectTV. Their audience is small, their programming is cheap, and they run ads. You’d think they’d be streaming that shit for free and giving it away to cable and satellite. Sounds like their business model sucks."
Oh My Venus,Oh no. Anyway.
The Producers,That was Robert Redford. Also Dan Fogel and the actor who plays Puzo stated in a interview that they’d like to do a follow up series into the making of godfather part 2 transitioning into Superman & Apocalypse Now
The Producers,"Haven’t even watched a full episode and declare it “great”.

Funfact: Robert Evans, who was running Paramount at the time, was best friends with Sidney Korshak. Korshak was a famous Hollywood fixer and was a member of the Chicago Outfit. Evans wouldn’t have any mafia issues as long as Korshak was his friend."
The Producers,"I loved it

both Movie and the show is pure cinema and anyone who is or wants to come to this industry must watch and learn"
The Producers,"It seems the screenwriter Tolkin spent a couple of weeks with the producer (now 93). This is what Tolkin said about his writing process:

""This is a question that’s always a hard one to answer,” Tolkin said. “You start with a set of facts and a set of memories, and then you find that, in order to make the drama work, you have to shift things around. And then you forget what’s real and what’s not, and that’s when you’re really flying. Once you forget that, then you just write.”

https://datebook.sfchronicle.com/movies-tv/wondering-how-accurate-the-offer-is-about-the-making-of-the-godfather-dont-ask-its-writer/amp

I don't think there's a claim to accuracy or even some nebulous authenticity in there.

As one example, the show presents the gangster Joe Gallo as shaking down the production, and the production being saved by Gallo's assassination. The real Gallo survived the end of filming by about six months, and was even still alive when the movie opened in New York.

(Edit) Francis Coppola: ""That’s the point of view of, I guess, the producer but it doesn’t really reflect what really happened, in my opinion.”

https://variety.com/2022/film/awards/francis-coppola-godfather-anniversary-walk-of-fame-1235204672/amp/"
The Producers,"It was decent, though I felt it kinda felt it was repeating the same plotline for most of the episodes. Parent company of Paramount start getting cold feet about the movie, Ruddy convinces them otherwise, repeat. I get that likely happens all the time in production but doesn't really make for good tv, especially when it's a miniseries. I think it should've been maybe two-three episodes shorter with some fat trimming."
The Producers,This show made me understand what a producer does lol
The Producers,One of the best things  I watched this year.  I had never even watched the Godfather before.  Really strong all around.
The Producers,"It was kinda entertaining but also had a lot of forced drama that was never present during the original shoot.  Also, I would never fully trust a first hand account from a producer's pov.  Would probably recommend a fan of the movies go read any of the making of books instead."
The Producers,"Got hooked by the first episode.  Got my brother hooked when he visited.  I think he got my SIL hooked when he got back.  Great cast and interesting story even if not accurate.  Never noticed the plot repeats.  The guy playing Evans is a hoot and Gorman is always good in anything I watch him in.  

Evans himself:  https://youtu.be/1a2qr-DKTxM?t=1"
The Producers,A TV show about making a movie. Hollywood stays innovating.
The Producers,I'm halfway through and shocked it was so overlooked.
The Producers,Ooops. Thanks. Fixed.
The Producers,"I choose not to read reviews about anything, anymore. I have a sentient brain, capable of making decisions of my own."
The Producers,"Ruddy is constantly saying, ""Trust me"".

Evans' character was chewing the scenery for the first half. Coppola seemed the most ""real"". 

Miles Teller doesn't bring anything to his character. Any one of a dozen other actors could have done the same thing.

Still have two episodes to go."
The Producers,"So you’d rather read 2nd hand account written by some one who wasn’t there, rather than the producer who was?"
The Producers,No worries. You’ll love the series
The Producers,"It’s a tricky line to walk. You either do it with someone who was involved and thus they have an inherent bias towards the situation, pro or con, or an unaffiliated person with no bias tackle it, though it’s likely aspects will get disputed by folk involved who are either also biased or actually clarifying. In my opinion we’ll never likely see a truly accurate biopic about anyone or any situation."
The Producers,">Despite people knowing Homelander is a piece of shit, people still love him. Homelander has all the power. Everything seems hopeless. What the fuck?

Isn't this part of the whole joke/point of the series,  that if these people actually existed, the fucked up shit that would happen?

Butcher (and the rest of The Boys) even talk about this during the show that people having powers makes the world completely fucked up and they are trying to get rid of these people so the world can be normal. The show and people's reactions are generally confirming Butcher's whole worldview."
The Producers,A bunch of Americans worshipping a piece of shit is probably the most realistic part of the show.
The Producers,"> Despite people knowing Homelander is a piece of shit, people still love him. Homelander has all the power. Everything seems hopeless.  What the fuck?

Being a piece of shit doesn't make him any less of a compelling character to watch.  He's like a Tony Soprano with super powers."
The Producers,"> Despite people knowing Homelander is a piece of shit, people still love him.

People still support Trump. It's a parody of the US right wing."
The Producers,"On one hand Eric Kripke has said from the beginning that he has a 5 season plan for the show so I don’t think the show being popular has anything to do with the direction the story is going in.

On the other in Season 3 we’ve seen Butcher kill Gunpowder, Take Temp V, Team Up with Solider Boy, Drug Mother’s Milk etc all so he could get closer to taking out Homelander. But he calls everything off for Ryan really? I get he’s his dead wife’s kid but to me Butcher’s character kind of fell apart in the S3 finale.

As for the Gen V spin-off I don’t think it’s going to be like the MCU where you have to watch it to understand The Boys S4. That show seems to be going after a completely different audience then The Boys is."
The Producers,"I wholeheartedly share your opinion.  
 
I feel like Season 3 was written *for* a conclusion to the Homelander threat (or at least felt that way). And then they pull a ""eh nah, not right now"" right at the end. Soldier Boy even basically breaks the fourth wall to call out how stupid it was.  
 
The worst thing is, they still could've had Soldier Boy depower Homelander at least, to keep the show going but at least be a little different next season. Homelander could be chasing V or appearing in public as if he still had powers. And the new big threat could be Soldier Boy. 
 
Instead, it felt like ""gotta milk this cash cow for as long as we can"" and left me feeling like how Heroes grew to feel."
The Producers,"they should have gone the book's route, wtih the Boys slowly destroying lesser teams one by one and ending with Homelander (not really the end but still), typical shonen formula. Instead they made him the centerpiece way too soon, so it cheapens both him as an unkillable threat and the anticipation for the final fight. But I don't dislike the show for going its own way, although they really hammered down the ""toxic male"" point with the finesse of a 13 years old pink haired activist instagrammer. SB in particular was done really really dirty"
The Producers,"If you know the comics, then you know where Homelander kinda needs to end up in the end and he's just not there yet as a character in the show yet. He's  getting there, but not yet. Same with Butcher. 

Also the status quo is very different. Homelander has Ryan, Soldier Boy exists and is in the US governments hands, Edgar is out of  Vought and Homelander is in Charge, Maeve is gone, Starlight left to join the Boys, Butcher is dying, the public is entirely split on Homelander at this point because of Starlight, Victoria is about to be Vice President."
The Producers,I was really not happy with the way it ended. I'll just give them a benefit of doubt because they did deliver 2.5 seasons of really good stuff. But probably you're right. They already had that animated stuff. And now this. Probably will become a franchise thingy
The Producers,"I've been a fan since S1. to be honest, S3 was a little let down but overall I really enjoyed it; I just hope Kripke stops shading other shows in interviews bc it's getting annoying"
The Producers,"The unwillingness to kill off characters is absolving the show of any stakes. It is completely illogical that not a single major character has been murdered. 

Granted, I do think the show is gradually building towards something (especially with what Homelander does at the end) but yeah. Even these new spin-offs (""Gen V,"" ""Diabolical"") it feels like the show is becoming the very thing it parodies. I mean come on, the show is about the evils of capitalism and the overabundance of the superhero genre while it itself is an Amazon production in the superhero genre. 

Sidenote, I think Eric Kripke (the showrunner) himself should do less press. The way he shits on the MCU or other shows for doing exactly what he does, or unnecessarily hypes up like ""Herogasm,"" only sets the show up for more scrutiny."
The Producers,It's not unpopular it's just tqqlly stupid and incorrect
The Producers,"Sorry, this take is awful.

Yeah, there are plenty of shows that get unnecessarily dragged out when they become popular but the two examples you've picked are terrible.

The good place was tight as a drum, had a clear 3 act structure and was planned from the beginning. None of these ""memory wipes"" dragged out anything. Hell, the opening scene of Season 2(?) could have been a season of content on it's own.

The boys is a long running comic book with 72 issues. There is a story to tell. If there is any dragging out going on, it's based on the very nature of the source material."
The Producers,I loved this season. I must have watched the scene with the priest and the nun thirty times.
The Producers,"I agree. I was team soldier boy. Billy is a bitch. 

They could have escalated the drama by having Billy follow through with soldierboy. 

The series still could have continued without copping out. 

There was a lot of ways season 3 could have ended without the generic happy wash bullshit."
The Producers,"OP just doesn’t understand the show, overthinking an over the top comic book tv series."
The Producers,"It's not really status quo since the change is clearly in the people's reaction to Homelander's suckiness.

I'm perfectly fine with more of the show and spinoffs since they are well done so far."
The Producers,"The whole show is at this point a massive mess:

They fucked up in making Soldier boy a bad guy (by telling and not showing).

They openly struggle to understand why some people sympathize/dont outright hate Homelander when they've given him a very sympathetic back story that people can in some ways relate to.

We have Kripke outright committing the same sins he decried a season ago (making political points over good story telling.)

The show now feels Marvel-esque in that it doesn't feel like its going anywhere, the whole ''no V'' route has in my opinion stunted the characters and ruined one of the best aspects of the comics.

I could go on but now I just have stopped caring, in terms of individual episodes, Herogasm was the peak and the first season felt the most coherent."
The Producers,I actually lost interest in the show this season.
The Producers,"I kind of want to agree, but your comparison to the MCU makes me think that you don't know WTF you're talking about."
The Producers,Status Quo?  Homelander has just realised he can kill people in public and get applause for it. That is a huge step towards eveyone gets laser eyed ville.
The Producers,"Is the new thing to take a popular opinion and frame it as unpopular nowadays? Because this is a common opinion that many people had after the S3 finale.

I didn't like how the show used Ryan - they didn't build to it right. But I also don't think the show has reset itself to status quo. Stan is gone and Homelander has control of Vouight, more than half of The Seven is dead or off the team, Butcher has months to live, and Homelander went from fearing the video that Maeve had to openly killing people in public.

There's also a pretty clear endgame to the show if you're familiar with the comics and Kripke has always said it's intended to be a five-season show. So don't think the show is being dragged out. And there's literally nothing in your OP explaining why producers of the show are hypocrites lol."
The Producers,They should have killed Maeve. They only let her live because fans like her.
The Producers,[deleted]
The Producers,">But he calls everything off for Ryan really? I get he’s his dead wife’s kid but to me Butcher’s character kind of fell apart in the S3 finale.

Ryan reminds him of his brother and how he failed to save him. It's ground zero for his character."
The Producers,"It feels like the status quo, because it feels like the pattern for each season has becoming following up the build up of the previous season of Homelander being a threat, hyping up a showdown but most main characters walking away, and then putting in a new hook of how Homelander is going to be a bigger threat next season.

So yeah, it's not to say plot developments haven't happened, but the main overarching focus of Homelander being this huge threat being the driving plot is just having its impact diminish each season they keep putting characters in dangerous situation, but are afraid to kill off key players.

And sure, Maeve is gone, but is anyone going to be surprised if she gets a reason to get V again after showing Kimiko getting her powers back? Sure Butcher is dying, but do people really expect him to die before the final season, and not have V possibly come in to play if he is at deaths door? And I was more worried about Victoria after season 2 revealed she was behind the head explosions and masquerading as a normal politician than I am at the end of season 4.

I guess it's just the nature of keeping the same villain each season that is also made to be extremely overpowered that starts to add to this cyclical nature after a while despite the other backstories. That's not to say the season was bad, but I wish instead of a fistfight they'd had opted for a Herogasm type finale to this season that would have avoided these issues of plot armor and wondering how many season they intend to stretch this out to after having Butcher and Homelander once again walk away."
The Producers,How many for thingies are there?
The Producers,Shading? 👀
The Producers,"> Eric Kripke (the showrunner) himself should do less press

Jusy imo, I dont think he actually does any press-- i'm pretty sure everything he ""says' in various articles is just direct marketing promotion from Amazon and Amazon just hands the other side over a pre-made story/interview, more or less. His stuff is so spot of for marketing writing, that there is no way he is actually doing much, if any of it-- its all being done by marketing teams under his name."
The Producers,"This is probably the best way to put it. It's like a formula now: the Boys form a plan, they execute the plan, it works for a little bit, but then surprise, Homelander! Rinse and repeat."
The Producers,You are literally describing unpopular
The Producers,[removed]
The Producers,"> by telling and not showing

They showed an example with Noir's animated friends and at least showed him being careless in a way that would have caused people to die in flashbacks."
The Producers,"Yeah, It felt like they really wanted to kill her but changed their minds"
The Producers,That's...the whole point of The Boys.  It's not fantasy.  It explores what would happen if our world had superheroes.
The Producers,"Ryan didn’t remind him of his brother, that’s hughie"
The Producers,There’s that “what if sups were a bunch of college kids” bullshit filming now. Amazon is going to milk this one till we all hate it.
The Producers,"This is patently false, he does a ton of [interviews](https://www.vulture.com/article/the-boys-eric-kripke-season-3-finale-interview.html) and [press.](https://deadline.com/2022/07/the-boys-spoilers-season-3-donald-trump-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-eric-kripke-interiew-black-noir-1235060686/)"
The Producers,This really doesn't describe the show. This is the only season where they even bothered to actually go after Homelander and the entire group was split on it.
The Producers,"He seems to be no more or less careless than most supes, what i'm saying is the words and actual evidence are poorly matched up which is a writing problem."
The Producers,[removed]
The Producers,I think you didn't understand a word of what I said
The Producers,"In what sense. He treats his team exactly like Homelander did and he was going on a murder spree and didn't care who he killed in the process, his own words."
The Producers,It's not fantasy because it takes place in our world lmao. It's always been satire
The Producers,">His stuff is so spot of for marketing writing

How am I supposed to understand a word of this? Lmao"
The Producers,I meant in terms of they make him out to be worse/racist but the who part does not match the tell part.
The Producers,[removed]
The Producers,"These are less interviews than they are him being given answers to questions from a marketing team that they just disguise as a real interview. This sorta tactic is fairly common, and even just in the streaming world its common, hyping shows in this manner with ""fake"" interview answers and controversial items in it is becoming near-standard for pop-culture shows to drive engagement, with the interviews and such perfectly timed releases for the marketing schedules and such

Most of these ones you see where they say all sorts of crap and hype and controversy are just straight from a marketing person's copy and tactics for promotion. The actual person may have had little input.

You don't want to think you're being marketed to. You don't want to believe it. There is no man behind the curtain"
The Producers,> It's always been satire
The Producers,[removed]
The Producers,It's not reality. It's scripted.  Do you know what satire is?
The Producers,[removed]
The Producers,Satire is rooted in reality.  That's its nature. It takes our reality and twists it a little to highlight something.  OP was complaining that his fantasy is rooted in reality.  But the show isn't fantasy
The Producers,[removed]
The Producers,"It's not a satire of fantasy, it's a satire of our reality.  That's why it's rooted in reality. Is there anything else I can clear up for you?"
The Producers,[removed]
The Producers,"What is this strawman about being rapists and mass murderers?  It's our world and the satirical twist is that superheroes exist.  That's all.  And the superheroes aren't even fantastical. They're not aliens, gods, or even people who randomly got superpowers.  They're ordinary humans who were purposefully genetically modified."
The Producers,"One even made a splash on Reddit with lots of users confidently offering wrong explanations of the method.

Explains many Redditors comments in a nutshell. "
The Producers,">If only I'd seen it earlier....


-Executive Producer Captain Hindsight"
The Producers,"How to get on AGT:

* Have a super great amazing talent.

* Have a super sad depressing back story and an ok talent.

* Have a super terrible talent. 

* (forgot this one) be super adorable or super hot

* (edit #2) be famous in another country

Most people who you see audition were scouted for the show and were already aware they will go through."
The Producers,[deleted]
The Producers,"I had a thought like this recently, ""couldn't they just make up their own performances and get actors to play as contestants?"" Also thought that it was fake because they have mics on some of the audience... 
EDIT: wow this took off, I guess I shared a mutual feeling with a lot of people. But wasn't AGT original and real at some time? Like when Lindsey Stirling got famous?"
The Producers,"These ""fake"" magicians, using VFX are pissing me off and its about time they were majorly called out.

Theres a British magician called Dynamo ,who had a TV series. I loved the first couple of seasons , as his sleight of hand is very good. But the last couple of seasons clearly used VFX , and theres no need for it. Another illusionist, Troy, used VFX from the start on his show. Really grinds my gears and pisses on the art."
The Producers,Holy shit did you guys see what he did at the end of that video? AMAZING! How did he do that?
The Producers,"""Wait a minute, are we really saying that the producers of this competition--which celebrates the art of live performance--would modify what happens on stage with editing tricks to make contestants seem better or worse than they did in real life to suite the dramatic needs of the program?

Well... yeah. It's a reality show. It's all fake."""
The Producers,"I was a part of the studio audience when this was performed 'live'. 

This particular act was actually performed with the judges still in the dressing room & we didn't get a big-screen to see what the heck was going on. 

The audience was told they were just getting a second shot so we just did what we were told & kind of just sat there and watched in confusion. 

FWIW: It seems like they imposed our pre-recorded cheers in between shots.

EDIT: Oh snap...it's my cake day :o"
The Producers,[deleted]
The Producers,"Yeah all these shows are fake as shit.

Even the whole Susan Boyle thing.  The whole set up with Simon Cowell rolling his eyes and the audience making fun of her before singing was all set-up to make her more famous than normal."
The Producers,"Cool, that's some nice editing on the video. Didn't know about this channel, seems interesting.

Edit: I really didn't expect a simple comment like this to get so many likes lol"
The Producers,"It's always great to see this fantastic channel get some attention. The most common comment on his videos over the years is ""Why the fuck doesn't this guy have more views/subscribers?"" Don't just click away after viewing this- his channel has tons of great content."
The Producers,"""On websites familiar only to the socially... *different*""

I died. Subscribed."
The Producers,"It always makes me happy when I see Captain Disillusion on the FP. 

Great stuff and stupid-high production values, recommend watching his backlog for anyone who's new to the channel"
The Producers,2 of the top 10 finalists of last years  (2016) AGT had been on previous seasons of got talent in other countries. One even won a season. These shows are nothing more then making money for Simons production company. 
The Producers,I have never heard of this channel before. It took 1 minute of this video for me to subscribe. Great production quality!
The Producers,"Yes, it's fake like all reality TV, that's not the issue here. Dude is breaking some pretty cardinal rules of magic by using camera edits and stuff. 

Big debate about this going on over in /r/magic.

Captain Disillusionment is doing good work here. Houdini himself was a major critic of fakers and I think he'd be pleased with it."
The Producers,I fucking love this guy. His level of quality and professionalism puts many MANY big gimmicky youtubers to shame.
The Producers,"I literally had some hit me up maybe 2 days ago and say "" do you believe in magic "".  I could only think this was some type of joke.  Like , we grown ass men obviously magic does not fucking exist.  Then they start showing me this and defending it cause it's not hidden and shit.  How do you explain to a grown person that magic dosent exist?   Expecially when you don't know how to explain everything.  "
The Producers,"Maybe this will get Captain D some actual traction. His content is the shit... I just commented yesterday that he needed more publicity, and here he is on the front page a day later. "
The Producers,Glad he's getting recognition he puts so much work into editing and is very entertaining. He's like the bill nye of YouTube 
The Producers,"Feel like I should post his Patreon. He posts some great content

https://www.patreon.com/CaptainDisillusion"
The Producers,"TBH I thought it was a screen not a table, and he was just using sleight of hand with only 2 real coins. "
The Producers,"So I'm late and no one might read this but: 

I don't say this lightly, Captain Disillusion is easily the best channel on YouTube. He has been putting interesting high quality content since 2007 - and it surprises me (borderline pains my heart) that he doesn't get the recognition he deserves / doesn't have his own TV show yet. "
The Producers,He should make his next video on how he disappeared at the end. Amazing.
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,Why the hell aren't they working on more Attack on Titan?
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,gives me a snowpiercer with zombies vibe.
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,The first episode is on amazon prime
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,So...this is the exact same show except with a train and samurai?  Also that Eren Yeager voice actor makes my ears bleed.
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"They are, but it's taking time. This is their current show, which I so far prefer over AoT. Sadly, it's only going to be 13 eps."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"Season 2 is announced for 2016 so it will probably come out during the fall season.

Don't expect the new season to have anywhere the amount of action as season 1 though."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"Pretty sure they don't want to catch up too far to the manga.  Too often an anime adaption doesn't pace itself, and risks either going on a much longer hiatus while they wait for the manga to buffer, or the show just creates bad filler."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,Came here wondering this. Da fuq? We've been waiting for season 2 of an anime where the story already exists for like 3 years.
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,It's like a steampunk zombie Snowpiercer type thing.
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"I caved and started reading the Attack on Titan manga the other day. I am not in possession of enough patience to wait for new episodes.


The Manga is awesome btw, incredible artwork."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,I shudder to think how long it will take for us Dub plebs. 
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,See: Overlord and One Punch Man.
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,I did the same thing. Season 2 is going to be fantastic. 
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"Faces in manga are a bit iffy, rest is pretty decent tho."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,probably not long. Funimation started doing simu-dubs.
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"My personal go-to example is Kenshin, season 3."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"I enjoyed it as a guilty pleasure. Best thing about it is the trains.
You probably want to ask this over on the anime subreddit.
"
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,Why? Why would you suggest that kabaneri started of well but after biba it was such a mess. I would not recommend it at all. Especially in comparison with AoT
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"The animation quality is very very good. The characters are bad anime stereotypes. And the story is a rip off of Attack on Titan, with a steampunk twist."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,I've seen this its kids like AOT but isn't you just need to watch it to tell the major differences. 
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"Kabaneri is an original series made by most of the production team of Attack on Titan - it's fully intended to replicate the success of Attack on Titan (though it does so less effectively IMO). It being in production is also one of the reasons the new AoT season was delayed.

I don't think anything I'd recommend came out this year. If you're cool with older anime, I'd recommend Monster, Paranoia Agent (darker psychological series) and Black Lagoon, Cowboy Bebop (lighter action series). None of these series pursue an apocalyptic angle. If that's what you're looking for, you'd have better luck reading manga or watching live-action tv.
"
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,Watch better anime.
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,This subreddit has a weird hatred for anime. Idk why.
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,It was written by the same guy who did attack of titan
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"Seen all those you've listed, guess we just have to wait!"
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"If you had noticed, I asked for suggestions"
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"The manga for Attack on Titan/Shingeki no Kyojin was written by Hajime Isayama and adapted into an anime by Wit Studio. Isayama didn't write Kabaneri, it is an anime original story created solely by Wit Studio. A lot of people seem to not really like Kabaneri though. While the story kinda falls apart at the end and most the character are pretty flat, I thought the extremely well made character design, aesthetics, and animation made it well worth a watch, especially because its only 12 episodes long. As for other recommendations for more mature anime that came out this year, [91 Days] (http://myanimelist.net/anime/32998/91_Days) is currently airing but seems to be very promsiing so far. It's a prohibition era mobster story which is pretty rare in Anime. [Erased](http://myanimelist.net/anime/31043/Boku_dake_ga_Inai_Machi) which is a time travel/mystery show which came out earlier in the year and was pretty good. [Re:Zero](http://myanimelist.net/anime/31240/Re_Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Isekai_Seikatsu) is another currently airing show that is really popular right now. If you want to talk more about anime and find other recommendations i would recommend heading over to /r/anime. It's very active community that that will be much more enthusiastic about anime than r/television. Just be careful, they might seem a bit strange if you're up to date with all the hip new anime memes and such."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"nice ill check these out.  its really hard to find anime thats not full of those lame emotion things or whatever they are called  and more for adults. 

what was that anime that was about people going to outer space to fight giant ants or something?  they censored the shit out of it but was supposed to later be released un-censored.  wonder if that has happened yet"
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"Oh yeah Terra Formars. It's probably uncensored now, it's been a while since it's come out. I haven't seen it but I've heard its not that great. Also, there are tons of great adult orientated anime out there, you just got to know where to look. Anime is a medium, not a genre,  so they come in all different shapes and sizes. [This flowchart] (http://imgur.com/gallery/yPVPj9Q) is great for finding new shows for any genre you are interested, or I can give you some more direct recommendation for shows that are not from this year if you tell me what specifically you're looking for.

Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"http://m.imgur.com/LSYNkb3

Watching it in Japan now T_T


Edit: 4 year wait was too damn long but... it's fucking amazing."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"Looks like the ""will it be good?"" part is still as if season 2 was 2 cours long!"
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"I'm not an anime watcher but there are some series that are so good and pour into the mainstream and AoT is one of them. For me only Death Note and AoT managed to do that even though I know there are probably lots of animes that are also worth watching.

Really looking forward to the new season. I almost forgot about the series until I read last week or so here that season 2 is finally starting. It's so bizarre that an anime of this caliber has been drawn out for so long. Makes me wonder why they would do that and not invest more into it seeing how well received the show was. Then again they split up the season and we'll have to wait again.

I'm hyped nonetheless for season 2.

"
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"The 1-cour part bothers me. The stepping off point will be rather unsatisfying, and will probably end up feeling like a massive deus ex machina without appropriate explanation. I doubt first time watchers will leave satisfied.

In case there's confusion, I'm referring to [spoiler](#s ""Eren using the coordinate against the smiling Titan being the point where the season is likely to end, which won't make much sense to anyone without the subsequent Uprising arc"")"
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"The only dip in quality might have been the arc right after this one. Idk why the OP/mod bothers to give legitimacy to anyone who thinks the last arc in the manga (and this current new one that just started) aren't good. Figuring out the truth behind the basement and how much it opened up the story was fantastic. Not to mention the battle we got at the climax of the last arc was the best the manga has ever had. 

If you want to go ahead and read the manga do it. You won't be disappointed in the long run."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"So I'm cheap, but legally cheap. Do you know when crunchyroll will release the episodes to all viewers and not just subscribers?"
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,It's on Hulu in the US right now.
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,If I want to read about season 1 and not watch more movies where should I go?
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,I don't watch any anime except for Voltron (if it even qualifies) and Attack on Titan and I only saw the latter dubbed. What exactly is SimulDub? Is that the same as the dubbed version of AoT S1? 
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,Excellent! Thanks for the info!
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,Did they release any significant OVA or movie I should watch before watching season 2? 
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,Thanks for putting all that information on here it was very helpful. So hyped.
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,[deleted]
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,wat is cour 
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,I think it's a bit dubious saying season 3 won't be out till 2019. We have NO confirmation that it won't be this year or next and the speculation that it's going to be 2019 is flimsy at best. 
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"Thank you for the comprehensive FAQ!  Been waiting a very, very long time for this season to finally release."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"Heard a lot about this show. As someone who really enjoyed Avatar, FMAB and Death Note, is this series for me?"
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"If you are from Italy you can also watch it legally at VVVVID.it, you should add it to that list!"
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"Isn't this:

>Why did it take so many years?

>Two reasons:

>Firstly, they wanted to wait for enough manga material to come out. Season 1 covered the first 33 chapters and the manga had reached Chapter 50 by the time Season 1 was finished, so they had to wait at least a year or two. 

contradicted by this:

>Where will Season 2 end?

>If it's only 1 cour, then it will likely end around Chapter 50."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,">I want to read the ***Comic***, where do I start?

*triggered*"
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,Yes! She will be in Season 2 for sure. She'll get quite a bit of focus in one of the early episodes. I won't say anymore than that.
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"Sasha! My favorite, if only because she's the one person not perpetually brooding. 

I love the brooding. But the comic relief is appreciated."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,">Is the potato girl still there?


Even if she isn't, there's always the doujins. "
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"Yep, just noticed that as I was making the post for /r/anime. Am fixing it now."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"You should try Cowboy Bebop. It's basically the default ""you should try"" anime, but it really does live up to the hype."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"Uprising and this arc should have been included together. You get the insane action of this arc + the in-depth explanations of the other. Not to mention uprising is probably the ""worst"" arc (not to say that it's bad per se, just in comparison) so it would have been better to package it with one of the best. Also, the climax of uprising is actually really satisfying so it would have been a nice place to end."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"> Idk why the OP/mod bothers to give legitimacy to anyone who thinks the last arc in the manga (and this current new one that just started) weren't good.

Opinions vary greatly, and I wanted to keep it fairly balanced so people go into it without expectations one way or the other.

^^^Also, ^^^I ^^^personally ^^^am ^^^one ^^^of ^^^the ^^^people ^^^who ^^^didn't ^^^like ^^^it. ^^^We ^^^exist ^^^and ^^^our ^^^opinions ^^^are ^^^legitimate ^^^as ^^^well."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"They generally release them for free viewing one week after it airs. It'll be lower quality, though."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,The Attack on Titan Wiki has good summaries. Don't read past the battle in Stohess.
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"Not sure if this is what you're after but [Wikipedia episode list?](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Attack_on_Titan_episodes)
"
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,Simuldub is basically the dub of the new season being  released at the same time of the sub version 
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,Yes. The Ilse's Notebook OVA will actually be relevant to the plot.
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,A set of roughly 12 episodes.
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"There's no way it'll be out this year. WIT is banking heavily on Mahoutsukai no Yome which is 2 cours and will spill over into 2018, and then Kabaneri S2 will come soon after that. I don't think they'll have the staff or resources to get AoT S3 out any earlier than 2019, if even then. "
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"If you liked those shows, you'll probably like AoT as well. There are many similarities. No guarantees, of course. But it's certainly worth checking out."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,". . . Yeah, pretty much.

So it's just entirely due to the Studio and Production Committee not considering AoT to be a priority."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"Just so you know, the Japanese do also use the term 'comics' for manga especially when talking about the compiled chapters sold in volumes."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"I mean if you didn't like those reveals, the art which was the best of the entire series he has done so far, and the feels then idk what to tell you man. You honestly probably won't like the rest of the manga since this is the main story now."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,Thanks. That's a big help.
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,Thanks.
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"Oh ok. It's not a ""type"" of dub that's inferior in quality then. "
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"13, isn't it?"
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"Ah I found an old summary I wrote:

In short:

Year 845, humanity has been living in the Walls safe for about 100 years. Then suddenly the Colossal Titan appears and destroys the Shiganshina Outer Gate. Then the Armoured Titan appears and destroys the Shiganshina Inner Gate. Eren's mother is killed. Eren, Armin, Mikasa, and many others become refugees while 10 000 people die in the attack. Wall Maria is lost, humanity loses 1/3 of its land. Another 250 000 people are sent out on a suicide mission by the nobility to solve the food shortage.

2 years later they join the military. 3 years after that, they graduate. On the day of their graduation, the Colossal Titan shows up and attacks Trost District, the southernmost city of Wall Rose. People die. Eren almost dies but then somehow turns into a Titan. They convince the military that Eren is a good asset and are able to seal the hole using a giant boulder.

Most of the characters join the Survey Corps and head out on a mission to reach Shiganshina District, since they believe Eren's father and the Basement might contain answers. Eren's father disappeared around the time Wall Maria was attacked, and Eren has memories of his father injecting him with something.

On the expedition, a Female Titan appears that has intelligence. It kills a bunch of people. But the expedition is a trap and the Survey Corps manage to capture it. . . but it breaks free and almost escapes with Eren. Eren is rescued by Levi and Mikasa. They return the Walls, defeated.

They figure out that the Female Titan was actually Annie Leonhart, a soldier in the Military Police, in disguise. They lay a trap for her, but it goes badly, and a battle breaks out in Stohess District. Ultimately they manage to stop her, but she seals herself within a crystal. The Survey Corps decide it will continue fighting for humanity, trying to solve all the mysteries, and defeat the Titans. The epilogue scene shows a crack in the Wall, revealing that there is a Colossal Titan inside the Wall.

Hope that helps. "
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"A cour doesn't have a specific length, it can vary a bit. I've seen some shows with only 11 episodes. But yeah, 12 or 13 is the norm."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"This was perfect thanks, everything came back."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"She's saying it's ironic because they are pit against each other by men in the show and fans which are majority men are also pitting them against each other. But not sure what comments that is based on. Are fans pitting them against each other because of misogyny, or because it's literally the direction the show is going in?"
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,The preview we've been getting for 2-3 weeks shows Alicent trying to stab Rhaenyra with a dagger. Fans are *clearly* being led to believe they will be at odds with eachother.
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,To what extent can “fans” pit fictional characters against each other in the first place??
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,Aren’t we supposed to?
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,Fans pitting batman and joker against each other is fucking ironic
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"Almost like they are different teams, maybe one team green one black so ironic"
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"I think she’s doing a great job on the show, but when I watch her interviews I get the vibe that she neither knows nor cares for the source material very much."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"
 It's a civil war and they're >!(going to be) the leaders of the opposing sides.!< Course people are going to pit them against each other that's what the show is about!

She's a good actress but this quote pretty dumb

Edit: Yes I've read the exact quote multiple times and yet still haven't figured out if she was referring to her and Emily Carey or Rhaenyra and Alicent. If the quote is about her and Emily than it's fair comment to make, just worded confusingly"
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"Honestly getting tired of actors and actresses giving their unwanted takes on fans of franchises and belittling the audiences of the show which is making them money in the first place.

The show itself seems to be implying the two will be at odds specifically because Rhaenyra is a little more immature while Alicent is at least trying to be level headed.

If that’s not where the show is going then well it’s a twist which the actress is spoiling plus expecting the audience to predict that without inside knowledge is pretty rich. 

So far great show with lots of tension and a very balanced portrayal of multiple parties. Though people need to shut this BS down of streamers , actors etc. blindly going ‘stupid fans this that’. 

All for outing and even arresting ones that send death threats and the like but if people just have an opinion on the show, especially as mild as this one, then leave it be."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"Is she just making shit up? Because I have not seen one discussion saying Milly Allcock is better than Emily Carry, or viceversa. The only actors people are ""pushing against one another"" whatever that means, is young Rhaenyra and old Rhanyra and even that seems more like a ""we love young Rhaenyra so much how could anyone do better""."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"Everyone has their opinions I guess. If you've read the book. This is not news. In fact if you've read the book, this comment comes off as silly. As that is literally what this book is about. Lol they are not friends."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,It’s like every fucking day I’m seeing an article from an actor in a show with some (for lack of a better word) “woke” statement criticizing fans of the show/movie. It’s so fucking tiring.
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"I think the show has been pretty clear that both of them are being used as pawns by their fathers playing a larger game. It’s quite sad, their friendship was the first of many casualties in the coming conflict."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,Maybe she means some gross stuff she read online not just usual stuff.   Maybe people are talking about who's hotter etc. Who knows.
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,Why is there a news article every week about some actor in this show reacting to social media?
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"TIL picking sides in a civil war is misogynistic

Worthwhile cultural criticism is dead."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,Why can't fans just watch a fucking show without being attacked by the actors anymore? Let the fans attack eachother for saying stupid shit and have the actors tell a damn story...
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"""What I found quite hilarious is that the fan base is also putting the actors, the Young Alicent and the Young Rhaenyra, at odds with each other, and choosing who’s better, also by decision of mostly men. So I think that it’s really just fucking ironic""

Does she have a problem with the viewing audience being majority male? And no shit, sherlock, people pit characters against each other all the time. That's the nature of, you know, watching a show about conflict.

I'm going to enjoy the hell out of the general audience perception of Rhaenyra as the plot progresses. The Dany treatment she's getting now will be hilarious in hindsight."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,They have been against each other though? They’ve been arguing and Rhaenrya was HEAVILY manipulating Alicent with her lies in the most recent episode.
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"those men, man, always pitting women against each others"
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"ffs with these people in Hollywood. So pretentious lol. Fans are putting them against each other because that’s literally what the writers are doing. They need viewers to want to pick a side and to create controversy. Ugh, these people smh."
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,Wait till she learns about us having a circle jerk over who'd win in a fight: jaime or khal drogo and other dozen male knights lmao.
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,Here we go more fan baiting
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,I don’t think she knows what irony is
Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress,"Is she saying pitting the ""actors"" against each other by comparing them, or pitting the characters against each other?  Because those are very different. 

The story is dictating a showdown between the 2.  I'm not seeing how that is misogyny at all. 

That said, if the comments are about deciding which actress is doing better, I can *kind of* see that point.  But people will always compare actors on shows. 

Also, is GoT mostly men watching?  Maybe its just my social circle, but it seems pretty evenly split to me."
Love in the Moonlight,"> **Series creator Glenn Gordon Caron tells EW that it's largely the issue of music licensing that has prevented any streamer from picking up the rights**. ""When we made Moonlighting, television shows didn't typically use pop music,"" he says. ""It was really just us and Miami Vice at that time. **So when deals were made for the music, no one anticipated streaming. In order to exhibit the show [on streaming], the owner of the shows, which is the Walt Disney Company, has to go back and make deals for all that music — and they've resisted doing that for six or seven years now.**""


> ABC confirmed to EW that it still holds the rights to Moonlighting but didn't respond to request for comment on whether there have been any internal conversations about releasing the series on streaming in the time since Willis' retirement was announced.


Music licensing has proven to be a big headache for many old shows."
Love in the Moonlight,"Here's what I don't understand: the music labels are asking for x to license the songs. That's too much for the shows, so the music labels settle for... Zero?!?

Why can't they come to a mutually agreeable number?"
Love in the Moonlight,There is an episode that ends with David driving across LA in the rain to kill someone. The music was Sympathy for the Devil. I watched the credits carefully and then went out and bought Hot Rocks the next day. Moonlighting turned me onto the Stones and away from hair metal. Big moment in my musical life.
Love in the Moonlight,"Is there anything music licensing doesn't ruin? Between crushing budgets of shows, to preventing them from being aired outright, it just seems like more trouble than it's worth. I don't know enough about either industry to point fingers or come up with a solution but fuck me this is stupid. A great example is Michael Scott singing two bars of ""Two Tickets to Paradise"" cost production of The Office $60,000 dollars. Didn't even use the official track, just Michael Scott singing it. Blew the entire music budget for years. I'm totally flabbergasted by it. Something so minor can hold the years of work of major productions hostage."
Love in the Moonlight,It's such a bummer that all of the late 80s and early 90s shows that pushed the creative envelope when it came to music use are being rewarded for it by not being able to get seen anywhere
Love in the Moonlight,It’s weird because I’m watching Miami Vice on Peacock and I’m astounded that a lot of the music in intact.
Love in the Moonlight,It’s always the music.
Love in the Moonlight,All five seasons are available on DVD from my library. Should those have the original music?
Love in the Moonlight,"Fucking music licensing. Also the reason the greatest Christopher Walken SNL sketch of all time, Stalk Talk, is lost to the tides of time, as it contains a snippet of Every Breath You Take by The Police and NBC won't pay the licensing. Damn shame."
Love in the Moonlight,"I'm sorry, but any show that was made after 2000 that didn't secure permanent music rights only has itself to blame.

I could understand Moonlighting not having the foresight because home video was just becoming a thing, and entire TV shows on VHS were not the norm, so why negotiate for rights beyond airings, repeats, and syndication?

But after 2000 when DVD took hold and everything was being released as seasons for public consumption, it's completely stupid that the rights to them music have been lost.  So now you watch House MD without the Massive Attack song for the theme, or the music from Supernatural is gone.  Don't blame the rights holders, blame the production companies who didn't get the correct rights in the first place.  They didn't need a crystal ball, especially with examples that already existed by 2000, like Heavy Metal, or WKRP."
Love in the Moonlight,I wish the BBC would temporarily add shows with music rights issues to iPlayer so pirates could snap up high-quality rips for archival purposes. That or do night-time marathons. I know they don't have to worry about music rights due to blanket agreements with the record companies.
Love in the Moonlight,"What a great opening song to this show, my mom used to let me stay up (from 9-10 p.m.) on school nights so we could watch this together."
Love in the Moonlight,"I remember when Misfits (british TV series), finally came to streaming, and they had stripped out all the tone-setting music with generic stuff, that while okay most of the time, really ruined a lot of pivotal scenes."
Love in the Moonlight,"Wow, it's so weird seeing him with so much hair in the thumbnail.

Even in the original Die Hard (1988), he was already balding in the top back area. Actually, he might be here as well, given the camera angle (:D)

*EDIT: Since it's 2022 and ""bald jokes"" are a touchy subject, let me clarify. I'm balding myself, and have since become fascinated by actors who also are. When I was a teenager, I never noticed Steven Seagal's receding hairline in Nico: Above The Law magically vanishing overnight for the next three decades of movies. Stuff like that sticks out to me nowadays, whereas it hadn't beforehand. Last Christmas, when watching Die Hard on blu-ray, his bald spot stuck out to me, because in a few Christmases time, I'm going to be the exact same age as Willis was when he shot the movie. Given the events of last month, I don't know where we are as a society when it comes to ""bald jokes"", but for me, this was just a humoured observation. Peace out.*"
Love in the Moonlight,"I remember when Daria finally hit DVD, all the 90s music that set the tone so well was replaced with generic filler.

Luckily, there was a fan project online to sync up the sharper DVD visuals with audio tracks from VHS rips taped off TV, so if you look you can find a good reconstruction with the music intact."
Love in the Moonlight,"Ugh, yes, it's frustrating that *Drew Carrey Show* isn't on streaming because of this too."
Love in the Moonlight,"Ah, music licensing has been a bitch for insanely many things. Just having few seconds of a popular (now or in past) songs, could've been a right away demonetization. 

Never mind, that people have also been claiming shit for no reason at all (youtube), so it has not even mattered if any of it is rightfully claimed. 

While I am all for the giving moneys/credit for the original creator, all this internet shit has taken it way too far in to just.... fucking everyone in the ass. Music industry is still in the fucking 70s when it comes to any of this."
Love in the Moonlight,*Northern Exposure* too. They used so much great music. There's way too many episodes that have music edits and/or substitutions. It really changes the entire vibe of the show.
Love in the Moonlight,Same thing happened with Wonder Years. It took a while but they figured it out at some point.
Love in the Moonlight,"As the saying goes, “Keep passing those tapes.”

I’m at the stage of not feeling sympathy when people pirate this, Drew Carey Show, and others.

I get that it can be complicating to make an agreement when properties get shifted around over the years and yada yada, but when you have a fleet of lawyers with sensitive antennas, it’s hard to feel sympathy.

Music licensing’s also why they cut out, not even 10 seconds, of the Beatles from the 1963 Doctor Who series. 

They weren’t playing their music, not the focus of the episode,  it was just a few seconds cameo with them performing, changed out to just static in later releases.

Once more, keep passing those tapes."
Love in the Moonlight,"You'd think the people who own the rights to the music would want to make a friendly deal. More exposure is always good and something is better than nothing. 

I don't really buy that it is Disney's fault either except in the sense that it is a headache for them as well. But if the rights owners were easy to deal with that would likely remove the ""resistance""."
Love in the Moonlight,"Ed, was screwed by music rights."
Love in the Moonlight,"Remember Conan's last show where he found the most expensive song to play on TV (Satisfaction ar $20,000 a spin) and played it over and over to fuck with the network? Music publishers are holding old shows to ransom. Seems paying billions for song portfolios wasn't the easy cash they thought it was."
Love in the Moonlight,I'm currently watching Miami Vice on The Roku Channel they figured something out I guess lol
Love in the Moonlight,I'm really glad that Disney was able to get it fixed for The Muppet Show.
Love in the Moonlight,A bigger one for the fans
Love in the Moonlight,I sure hope that current shows have their licensing agreements for music more future-proof than the past was.
Love in the Moonlight,"And movies too.

One of my favorite guilty pleasure movies, [Electric Dreams (1984)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087197/) has an amazing soundtrack which caused it to be stuck music rights limbo for years.  It's never had a proper DVD release in the US.

I see that it available for streaming on Amazon now.  I may have to rent it just to see if they butchered the music or not."
Love in the Moonlight,Same for “Pump Up the Volume” with Christian Slater.
Love in the Moonlight,The question then become why not change the music? Thats what they did for Supernatural on Netflix. It is a little annoying but with Moonlighting having music was new so couldn't be as integrated into the story as Supernatural.
Love in the Moonlight,"Mechanicals are when you record a cover of a song. For the original recording it's ""sync licensing"" and it's case by case. With mechanicals, you use the Harry Fox Agency and I don't know if it's even possible not to buy mechanicals. For sync, you have to negotiate with the property owner directly."
Love in the Moonlight,"21 Jump Street is another example. And Baywatch, if anyone still cares about that."
Love in the Moonlight,"Licensing is brutal for a lot of industries. Like music in old games, cars for racing games, etc"
Love in the Moonlight,"> the music labels are asking for x to license the songs. That's too much for the shows, so the music labels settle for... Zero?!?


Guess they're following Rule of Acquisition #10: ""Greed is eternal."""
Love in the Moonlight,"The labels don't want to undermine their current negotiations by selling off streaming rights to old stuff cheaply, but the underlying property (in this case, *Moonlighting*) is just not worth a hell of a lot to the would-be streamer, because almost nobody is dying to sign up for a network with a bunch of SD content. And if it's not bringing in new subscribers, or keeping the old ones from canceling, it's worth basically nothing to the streaming service."
Love in the Moonlight,I think it's an effort and demand problem.
Love in the Moonlight,">Is there anything music licensing doesn't ruin

Record companies bank statements."
Love in the Moonlight,Most of it was done by Jan Hammer and he's apparently a pretty reasonable guy. You get into trouble when the property changes hands and the people who own it don't consider it an obligation to negotiate in good faith.
Love in the Moonlight,I have all but the last season(including the standalone pilot DVD) and if I recall correctly it has the original music.
Love in the Moonlight,holy crap i just checked house and your right...wtf
Love in the Moonlight,"> So now you watch House MD without the Massive Attack song for the theme,

weirdest thing about house is the show never having this theme song in my country, apparently that song was exclusive to america and everywhere else got another song instead

and charmed without the how soon is now cover at the opening is also weird, it's how they air and stream the hd remastered version nowadays"
Love in the Moonlight,"Surely you know, that you're just being an asshole here? Yes he has a receding hairline here, but... goddamn u internet people can be dicks for no reason."
Love in the Moonlight,"The streaming version of 90210 replaced all their pop music with house band music made to sound like it came from the era. It’s kinda funny when you hear it.

Also there are huge swaths of later seasons missing from streaming sites because they haven’t updated them with the new soundtracks yet."

Love in the Moonlight,"For sure. Sometime when I watch an older show on a streaming service, I find couple episodes are missing. At first I was wondering why the episodes were missing, and then I found out that music licensing was the most likely reason."
Love in the Moonlight,Because the characters are singing a lot of the songs. Can't just dub in another song when it has to match Bruce Willis' lips.

Love in the Moonlight,"Can't they just tie it to expected (or actual) number of streams?  Moonlighting will have lower streams, so the streaming service would pay less to have a song there than say Stranger Things."
Love in the Moonlight,"The band and songwriters get royalties.  For some acts, that's now their main source of income.  The record companies still get most of it."

Love in the Moonlight,"It's really just a revamp of the contracts that needs to happen to drag them into the 21st century and to cover things like streaming. Not really a fan of essentially taking away ownership of material from artists. If they've written the songs that get licensed, they deserve their share whether or not it's been some arbitrary amount of time since they wrote them.

The renegotiation of the contracts is the issue unfortunately, since that'll require a bit more give and take from both sides than can necessarily be easily and quickly achieved. Artists will use the precedent of the previous contracts to ask for more money, especially when dealing with popular shows where the original contracts were done while the shows were less popular. The show owners will not want to pay more, and perhaps won't budge on paying less since that seems to be the way things are going in this new streaming focused world."
Love in the Moonlight,"yep. then watch disney change their strategy so that they only use 26 year od songs and stick their fingers at both legacy creators and current makers who will find themselves without any means to sell their art.

all because people want to watch a show and have nirvana play in the background.

it should be clear to people here that musicians and even music labels arent the bad guys here. its streaming companies who make millions and wont concede a single cent in royalties for something they are going to profit from"
Love in the Moonlight,I’ve only every watched this on Netflix and had no idea. I know scrubs when it was streaming had to change all its music and people didn’t go watched both said it ruined/ changes the whole tone and jokes of the show
Love in the Moonlight,"It's been released on DVD, and DVD was where music rights issues started to become a big deal.. Looked pretty good. But if it was only an existing videotape master, it wouldn't have made as much of a difference for SD DVDs.

Don't remember if Lionsgate had to cut or change music for the DVDs, though."
Love in the Moonlight,"Royalties are usually paid out that way. However, a music label isn't going to want to sell the streaming rights to a song for less per stream if it's in *Moonlighting* - but at the same time, *Moonlighting* isn't going to bring in a bunch of revenue for the streamer. Maybe if you were pulling up a serious classic like *WKRP*, you could get some people on board, but even then it's an old show. A nice nostalgia hit, but vanishingly few people are going to binge it who have never seen the show before."

Love in the Moonlight,"I appreciate your knowledge on this. Thanks. If you don't mind a follow up question... I'm not sure I'm fully following why a low revenue show still can't be valuable to Netflix. I mean, I certainly understand that many more people will watch stranger things and some people will order Netflix just for stranger things, but original content costs so much more to make.

At this point we're pretty close to ""everyone who wants Netflix has Netflix"" and if Netflix is going to lose customers it's going to be because people are getting more value out of HBO max etc. 

I'm probably an outlier because I have essentially all the streaming services. It's my one non-frugal thing I do in life. Over the past two years I've probably spent the majority of my Netflix hours watching old stuff (west wing, Frasier, etc) over their new stuff. Certainly old material doesn't move the needle for new subscriptions, but it must help with retention.

Netflix started as literally just old stuff and only got into the original content game once their underpriced deals expired. I'm just not fully understanding how something that exists already can't be profitable if everyone has reasonable expectations of licensing rights etc"
Love in the Moonlight,"> why a low revenue show still can't be valuable to Netflix. I mean, I certainly understand that many more people will watch stranger things and some people will order Netflix just for stranger things, but original content costs so much more to make.

It can be. It's just that original content is *theirs*, can be resold internationally, and drives the prestige of the brand. People think of HBO as becoming this great behemoth around the time of *The Wire*, but they had been putting on high-value TV like boxing matches in the late 70s and early 80s. The difference in 2002 was that HBO subscribers, who skew heavily to higher-income groups, had DVRs well in advance of the rest of the population. And that meant that they were ready for long-form serial television, where the story does not make sense if you miss an episode.

Old TV wasn't built that way. Even the highest-quality primetime soaps (think *Dallas* or *Knots Landing*) didn't expect viewers to catch every episode, just most. So if you binge them, it's going to be really repetitive. A show like the original *Law & Order* had some serial elements, but any single episode could mostly stand on its own.

And unless people will subscribe to get *that show*, it might not be worth bringing it in, especially if it's going to be expensive. Think about showing *Night Court*, which doesn't have that expense, vs *WKRP*, which does. Nobody's even showing *Night Court*, which, while rather dated, is still hilarious.

EDIT: one recent example: do you think that *Golden Girls* would be out there if Betty White hadn't recently died? Maybe. But probably not. It's a masterpiece of comedy, to be sure, and had the benefit of being family-friendly (even their most risque jokes are veiled and fairly mild). But *Home Improvement* is equally mild, pretty funny, and had fantastic ratings  - and is nowhere on streaming."
Love in the Moonlight,"Netflix has to purchase the rights from Disney to stream it in this case, as Disney owns the rights to the show. Disney, in order to sell the streaming rights needs to purchase the streaming rights to each individual song presented in each episode and add on that cost in order to sell the streaming rights to netflix to be able to purchase and put on their service. It is very little returns on money for Disney to do for something to sell, return on investment is minimal and for Netflix there is cheaper content they can produce or purchase the rights to. It's not a needle mover anyways and they won't lose subscribers if they don't have it."

Love in the Moonlight,James Mardsen is a great addition.
Evil Genius,"How are all these f*cked up people living in such close proximity to each other? It’s quite amazing actually. They’re all either mentally ill, drug addicts, prostitutes, soliciting prostitutes, rapists, drug dealers, have cancer, killed somebody, and literally all of them are apparently hoarders. I’m staying far far away from Lake Erie that’s for sure."
Evil Genius,"That little lane on the side of eye-glass world is where I would go to smoke a joint on breaks when I worked at the Marriot. It's about a block south from there. I took a smoke break on that very day, directly on the side of eyeglass world, about 50 ft from where Wells was sitting a few hours before it went down. I left work at 2.pm. expecting to return in the evening because of split shifts, but I was unable to because the FBI closed all lanes leading to upper peach. I couldn't even get there from the highway. What surprised me about this documentary was how little I knew about this, even as a local. I didn't even know Geraldo covered it. Considering the types of people involved in this crime relative to this area, it's kind of crazy they would call this ""evil genius"". It should've been titled ""drug addict maniac fuck ups"" or ""let's just kill a guy cus one of us knows how to make a collar bomb"" because there's no way any criminally sane group of people could think any real money would come from this. Hoopstick and Wells were probably the most stable out of the group. I don't know Hoopstick, but she did live about 3 houses away from me for a few years during childhood. It was an all-black neighborhood except for her ""family's"" ""house"". We're talking no supervision ""the dirty white people"" on the block poor. It's crazy to see her on Netflix after seeing her work on the corners here for almost a couple decades. I just saw her like a month ago out there. My dad worked for the gas company and told me years ago he serviced Marjorie Diehls home yeaaars before the crime. Said the same as the documentary, an ocean of garbage surrounding a few hundred bricks of government cheese. Said he got right the hell out of there...lol. "
Evil Genius,"So I just finished binging all 4 episodes, this was really well done. Being in my early 20s and an Aussie, I had never heard of this case and I dove right in without any prior knowledge. It's not exactly a whodunnit, but it really dissects the why, what and most importantly how really well. This case is fascinating, now to read wayyy too much about it all."
Evil Genius,Just watched this yesterday. Listening to Marjorie...she sounds exactly like the *president. Goes on about the media being out to get her. Rambles and always throws in how smart she is (brings up her degrees in the middle of sentences). Always blames someone else. Talks about being rich when she’s not.  It was weird how similar their speech patterns are. 
Evil Genius,"The reason this case was so complicated was not because there were geniuses involved. It's actually the opposite. These people were so fucking dumb they created a plan so bad it was shocking to believe how ill conceived it was. 

I also love how ""the smartest guy in the room"" wrote ""I wasn't part of the Wells murder"" on his fake suicide note lol what a fucking dope "
Evil Genius,"I like ROthstein's unreadable note,

1. whatever you think, no matter what, this has nothing, NOOOOOOTHHHHHHINNNNGGGGGG to do with Wells...lol"
Evil Genius,"How did they not anticipate the fact that Wells would probably get pulled over and arrested and/or explode before finishing the scavenger hunt? It's like they didn't even care about the money. Also, if Wells was in on it, why bother with the scavenger hunt? Why not just have him rob the bank and then drive somewhere remote to meet them directly after. The fact that he actually did the first part of the hunt at the McDonalds makes me think he was innocent. (the documentary never came back to the fact that that woman mentioned how he liked to participate in the local paper scavenger hunt which was weird...)  Also when Rothstein said he couldn't remember exactly how Diehl 'indicated' to him that she'd killed her boyfriend I knew he had to be lying. Of course he'd remember that. Also when the cops showed the footage of his place and the stuff lying everywhere, it was immediately evident he was a pack rat (hoarder)... which fit the profile they came up with. How did they not do a search of it?  I didn't think he seemed smart or convincing at all.
"
Evil Genius,"first time in a long time i straight up binged an entire show

this was fascinating

and i agree with /u/VeritasWay, how a group of fuck ups, drug addicts, a rapist and a few headcases could basically get away with this is beyond me

like the perfect storm of strange happened, so this happened. fascinating "
Evil Genius,"What I don’t get, and have a feeling I just missed, was that they said that Bill and Marj had this incredibly strong relationship and that’s why they didn’t grass on each other; so why did Bill phone the police about the guy in the freezer ? Surely if he didn’t do that they would never be linked with the case ?"
Evil Genius,"The series kept reiterating how mentally ill Marjorie was - and indeed she was. But hoarding is also related to mental illness so Barnes and Rothstein were as well. This was never really discussed. Also, did anyone notice how Majorie's long time friend mentioned that she loved animals, and yet two dead cats were found in her house when it was gutted? Then there were the dogs that had to be put down in Barnes place. That killed me. :( "
Evil Genius,"I seriously think this could get the Gone Girl treatment and get made into a movie. Holy shit I remember watching the robbery unfold on TV but didnt realize all the extra stuff.

The local police detectives really missed a lot. Furthermore, how did a group of drug addicts, criminals and pathological liars outsmart the FBI too? I know everyone pretty much involved died but damn they could've figured this out while everyone was still alive. 

My take, Marge and Bill were the masterminds. She thought of the concept and Bill set it in motion. She is a master manipulator so she did her best to be as far away as possible while still being able to pull strings. Everyone else just knew bits and pieces of the whole story. "
Evil Genius,"I think Brian Wells was in on it but didn't realize the bomb was real.  If he wasn't in on it at all, why wouldn't he walk into the bank and say ""I just had this bomb put on my neck by someone who wants me to rob this bank, call the police and bomb squad!""  They aren't holding his family hostage or threatening anyone else and they can't see him so his chances of being saved are greater by not participating than participating.  Also the fake story about who put the bomb on him.  Why cover for them at that point if he wasn't part of it?  Also, why would they give him a loaded gun?  If someone put a bomb on me and then handed me a loaded gun I think I would turn the gun on them and threaten to kill them if they didn't take it off?  Granted I can't think of a reason to give him a loaded gun even if he was a willing participant.  The whole thing is so weird.  "
Evil Genius,"I knew about this case, but all the new interviews, photos, and crime scene recordings were so fascinating. A very well made documentary. "
Evil Genius,"I didn't understand. What was the role, if any, of the 2nd pizza guy that died?"
Evil Genius,"That was some damn good storytelling.

A bit disappointing to have not gotten the proper full truth, but honestly that was a marvellous watch. Second episode took me on a ride especially with the suicide note.

Funny thing was I thought it was a bit sly they outed a dead guy for frequenting prostitutes, but very very well paid off."
Evil Genius,"[Here](http://casefilepodcast.com/case-81-brian-wells/) is a podcast that also delves into this case, which has a few facets of the case that weren't disscussed, and does fall into the narrative that brian wells was involved in the bombing. A few different things brought up:
Marjorie's hatred of men  
The possibility she faked bipolar disorder symptoms  
A suspect that was ultimately a dead end pursued by investigators  
The possible involvement of the other pizza guy that died  
  
Personally, I do think that Bill Rothstein was more then just manipulated by Marjorie, his statement in regards to being the smartest man in the room indicate to me that he was a narcissist and was his own brand of manipulative evil.  
Brian Wells's involvement is still unclear to me"
Evil Genius,"Holy shit. Just binged the entire thing and I have so many questions. This case is so bizarre,  it's so bizarre that I can't even imagine seeing it in a movie.

Loved the way this was edited, so much never before seen footage, so many interviews from key people, never before known information.

Best crime doc yet. "
Evil Genius,This is some Jigsaw shit right here. 
Evil Genius,"As a fan of The Jinx (which I won't spoil here but viewers will understand the connection): 

In episode 3, at 14:56 they show Bill's best friend the handwriting they pulled from imprints on the written note, which the friend said was 100% Bill's handwriting. Then at 20:22 Trey is showing us a note written by Marj from jail. I noticed they [had pretty similar and unique Rs](https://i.imgur.com/R9TuFUE.png) and I thought this was gonna lead to some big revelation. They're not identical but they're unusual in a similar way."

Evil Genius,Who else thinks Marjorie had a plan to kill everyone off?
Evil Genius,"Like many, I have some questions surrounding the case. Firstly, it was said by Marjorie (according to inmates), Wells' neck was measured for the collar's design, which implies Wells participated in the planning of the heist on some level. Could Marjorie have gotten Wells' neck measurements from a shirt belonging to Wells, unbeknown to Wells? Could Marjorie have gotten Wells' neck measurements from Hoopsick, who admits to aiding Marjorie? Could Wells have been entirely innocent as the doc suggests?

Secondly, the documentary stated the clock on the device had the ability of extending Wells' time by one more hour. Was the plan for Wells to drop the money to Rothstein (who was spotted waiting in the blue Chevy Astro nearby), who in return would extend Wells' time? The bank heist was so poorly executed and I cannot see an outcome where Wells would have survived. Any answers?"
Evil Genius,I ordered a pizza after watching this and gave the dude a long hug 🤗 
Evil Genius,Just found this article that gives some information that was left out of the series. http://www.pajiba.com/netflix_movies_and_tv/what-evil-genius-leaves-out-about-brian-wells-involvement-in-the-pizza-bombing.php
Evil Genius,"Just binged watched this series, thought it was awesome! I had never come across this case, and I honestly don't think Hollywood could write a much better story.

Couple thoughts on some of the key players:

Marjorie- master liar. She doesn't come across to me as someone that is amazingly intelligent, but she is capable. I think she just talks a lot and is narcissistic, which makes her come across as more intelligent than she really is. The people who talk the most are rarely the smartest. She would never tell the truth unless it would benefit her. You can see how she tries to establish credibility by ""fully admitting"" to killing her past boyfriends when talking to her lawyer. She kept making this point multiple tims as if to show how she is NOW being honest. This is sign of someone who is very manipulative (albeit it doesn't work in this case). As for her role, hard to say, but she definitely wasn't a minor piece.

Bill- I believe Bill, along with Marjorie, was obviously another major player. What I find interesting is why he would call the cops to come look at that dead body in his freezer? I understand he wants to prove how smart he is, and how he can dupe the cops, but he really brought all the attention to himself. If he doesn't do that, who knows what happens with this case. Another interesting thing is that the officer gave him a chance to confess on his deathbed, and he said he had no involvement. Why does he do this? Perhaps he didn't want the cops to have the satisfaction of ""catching him."""
Evil Genius,"As someone who knows absolutely nothing about this case, I find it very interesting. I don't think I'd put it on the same level as *Wild Wild Country*, *The Keepers*, or *Making a Murderer*, but the substance of the case itself is crazy if you come in blind, and the editing and production value are good"
Evil Genius,"I don't really understand why everyone was saying she was so beautiful ? She was okay looking when she was young but she didn't exactly look like cheerleader captain 

also ""Evil Genius"" is a weird title for this. Their ""plan"" was far from genius 

side note: That mug shot of the guy who ended up overdosing looked exactly like a mugshot of a guy who ended up overdosing "
Evil Genius,"Am I the only one that sees a disturbing resemblance between Marjorie and the current president of the United States? 

Holy shit the rambling, the belief that she's smarter than everyone else, the projection, when she would make up accusations about herself and then go on to say no way would she do those things, the constant lies, the utter refusal of reality.

It's fucking insane! "
Evil Genius,Sick from work. Know what I’m doing today! 
Evil Genius,"Great documentary. I never heard about the case. 

Do you guys believe Brian Wells was 100% innocent or rather did know nothing about the heist?

Personally i think he was on it. Met with the accomplices. At the Pizza delivery at the tower the situation got serious. The collar wasn't agreed upon but he played along at first with mixed feelings about the authenticity of the bomb. On the drive to the bank he was sure it's not a real bomb therefore his relaxed demeanor during the robbery. Just to realize minutes or even seconds before the bomb got off that it might be a real bomb."
Evil Genius,"I also recommend the docuseries ""Wild Wild Country"" - fascinating but also disturbing."
Evil Genius,"To those heroes who  have already binged the entire series, is it safe for work? Don't care about audio but is there any nudity or other visuals that may get me in trouble if someone sees it over my shoulder?"
Evil Genius,"can someone answer a question for me?  

In episode 3 Marjorie insists the reason the UPS driver saw her at the Shell station payphone where the Pizza Order Delivery was made from because she was meeting Bill there, as they were co-defendents on the Roden case.  How could that be true if the Roden murder took place after the pizza bombing case?

Do I have my timeline or facts mixed up here?"
Evil Genius,Maybe I missed it.  What was the point of the whole scavenger hunt?  Why strap a live bomb on someone you want to rob a bank for you and then make him go on some elaborate scavenger hunt?  
Evil Genius,"WELLS INNOCENT 
Just me who noticed they mentioned the fact that Wells was waiting to get paid for the pizza in the trial?? 
This and the scavenger hunt are the 2 clear pieces of evidence to me that he was innocent.

Why would they do either of these things if he was involved? 
Also, did they even care about the money? Or was this all just an exercise to see if they could outsmart the FBI? Because realistically this guy was never going to complete the scavenger hunt before the police found him, so how did they think they would get the money?!

so many questions"
Evil Genius,"Netflix and duplass brothers combination is fantastic , another great doc after wild wild country."
Evil Genius,They played the bomb explosion over and over again. It's my only gripe with the show. That was a real human being dying ffs 
Evil Genius,"What do you think the M.O was on the second pizza guy that offed himself days after the Wells robbery/death? Just a coincidence, due to all the drug abuse in the area? "
Evil Genius,"Did I get this right, Barnes admitted at the end that Brian was not in on the heist? And the reason why Diehl and the others insisted that Brian was in, was to avoid the death penalty?

And why did an eyewitness say that Brian's car pulled out of the driveway of Rothstein's house, if the hooker said he wasn't there?"
Evil Genius,Pizza seems to be on the dinner menu for tonight!  Can't wait to watch this one...
Evil Genius,"I haven't finished yet, I'm on episode 3. How is this attorney not going to lose his license? He's talking with a prospective client and video taping the whole thing."
Evil Genius,/r/evilgeniusnetflix for those interested
Evil Genius,"A few years back, there was a very lengthy article about this case in a major publication (might have been Rolling Stone or the NYTimes Sunday magazine). Does anyone remember this? I honestly don't recall much about the article's details, so I can't recall if the author didn't have all the information possessed by this documentarian, or if it came to a different conclusion based on the same information, but I do remember coming away from the article thinking that there was very persuasive evidence of Wells' involvement. He almost certainly didn't believe the bomb was real, but he was involved in some of the planning. "
Evil Genius,[I cant be the only one that thinks shes the wolf from the never ending story right?](http://villains.wikia.com/wiki/Gmork)
Evil Genius,My thoughts exactly
Evil Genius,"In the beginning of the show one of the troopers follows the route and said "" I saw a blue van in the distance but it was too far and got away"". In the the second part they film rostiens house with a blue van in front of it. I can't be the only one who saw this"
Evil Genius,It will blow your mind 
Evil Genius,"Finished ep 1, very mysterious. I am very intrigued and can't wait to finish the rest. The premise got my attention as much as \(if not more\) Making a Murderer"
Evil Genius,I’m thinking they gave Brian Wells different instructions and the detailed scavenger hunt was there just to throw off investigators if he got caught. Or was it not even about them getting money because the scavenger hunt was designed for him to get caught and then be publicly executed? What’s your take on their motive for the scavenger hunt circling the bank?
Evil Genius,"This was ""okay"", imo. It's worth a watch but only if you've exhausted through your list of true crime docs. This case was already very well known and while the documentary did shed light on details I wasn't aware of, it just wasn't incredibly interesting because the case is pretty much shut and closed with a definite ending and no real questions.

It's not bad but there are about 20 true crime documentaries that are far more interesting and countless unsolved mysteries that should have quality documentaries.

Evil Genius,"I hope season II reveals what made them all so crazy and why they died from cancer.  Is it just chaos - or is their an environmental connection to their condition?

Evil Genius,"Omg, I just finished bingeing and I was thinking this EXACT SAME THING. I wasn't sure if it was just my bias against Trump finding false patterns but I'm glad someone else said it... its absolutely uncanny how similar their personalities were. Always thinking they are the smartest in the room, giving the vaguest of answers and expecting them to suffice, rambling about random unrelated facts, and most importantly, knowing how to manipulate people with a combination of wit and charm... this is something that needs more attention. "
Evil Genius,[deleted]
Evil Genius,"A plan so ill conceived, it took years to uncover?"
Evil Genius,"> I also love how ""the smartest guy in the room"" wrote ""I wasn't part of the Wells murder"" on his fake suicide note lol what a fucking dope

This was the part where I put the most criticism on law enforcement. He was kind of right. That part on the note mixed with him saying ""oh well I don't want you to waste years on that"" in a condescending way right before he explains how he fixed all the stairs because they had blood on them and were out of date was the moment when all my senses were saying he did it. He fit the description of the suspect bomb maker exactly."
Evil Genius,"Yeah, and his answer on video was even more sketch. He said something along the lines of, ""I just did it so you guys won't waste your time on something unrelated. You'd spend months on that for no reason."" Okay bro, you really think the cops are that dumb?"
Evil Genius,The scavenger hunt was a distraction I think the clues were laid out along the get-a-away path. He was supposed to drive in that direction all along to the point the cops said they saw the blue van. At that point they would have taken the money and double cross him and told him to find the other clues to release the bomb or just left him there to die with the cops finding his dead body next to a clue that he never got to.
Evil Genius,"I’ve got a couple questions to. Why did Rothstein ever call the cops about the dead body in the freezer? Why not dispose of it and not get yourself into the mess. Everything seemed clear before that. Also, if Wells wasn’t in on it why didnt he drive directly to the police station and tell them what happened to get the bomb squad to come save him?"
Evil Genius,"I think the scavenger hunt was used for a couple of reasons.  I think Bill and Marjory thought they were criminal masterminds and geniuses so creating a puzzle or game appealed to them.  Also, it allowed time to see if Wells was being followed by the police.  If he was being followed and he drove straight back to their place or a meeting place with them then they would have been caught.  This way if he gets apprehended all anyone (including Wells) knows is that he was heading to the McDonalds or wherever the next place was and couldn't lead the police anywhere useful.  Also, I think it allowed them to have Wells killed without having to be anywhere near him although I think the plan was if everything went right they would get the money from him and then leave him with the bomb out in the middle of nowhere."
Evil Genius,"They never definitively explained that, but— based on the evidence in the doc— I believe that Bill was easily convinced by Marj to participate in the heist because:
- he wanted to validate his own sense of elitism 
- he wasted his potential, spent most of his life “waiting” for marj. 
- he likely was aware that his health was declining and knew this was create some sort of legacy (albeit a nefarious one)
- it would forever tie them to each other.

He likely called in the tip because:
- he realized he was manipulated once again by marj. 
- she likely promised him they’d be together if he helped her with this (also would satisfy their respective financial problems). When it appeared that this was not going to come to fruition and he realized marj likely only used him as a tool again, I imagine he felt an impulse to reassert control and show marj which one of them was really the “genius”. 

Both had those narcissistic qualities where they had to constantly trump it up and talk about how they were much smarter than the “average” person.

None could accept or be accountable for the fact that they ended up where they did because of their own choices. Marj blamed her mental illness, while bill blamed marj. 

Just my opinion."
Evil Genius,"William A. Rothstein probably knew at some point a missing person investigation could arise and he saw how this could end for him, an accomplice in a murder or worse the jealous ex-boyfriend that kill the current boyfriend. He also knew if he got ahead of it he could drive the narrative."
Evil Genius,I'm somewhat inclined to believe he didn't want to thaw out a body then put it threw a meat grinder. 
Evil Genius,"I think he enjoyed having them in his house and taking them around and showing and explaining what he did with the body. He basically admitted he knew someone had been murdered and who did it and he helped hide the body and he wasn’t charged with anything! I think he loved the power of all of that. It’s weird watching him in his house when he’s showing the cops around, as if it’s completely normal. I think he got off on playing as close to the law as he could get away with "
Evil Genius,#  
Evil Genius,"It's not uncommon to find dead animals in hoarders' homes... they probably think the cats are hiding or something, and never notice a carcass or smell because there is already so much shit everywhere.  It really is sickening."
Evil Genius,Like the Judge said many people have the same mental issues but they are not murders.
Evil Genius,"They were entitled white trash, the worse kind of white trash."
Evil Genius,"> get made into a movie.

it already was, sort of.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_Minutes_or_Less"
Evil Genius,"I agree, I think Marge talked about getting back at the bank and enlisted Bill 
 since he needed the cash he agreed and the two decided to concoct this plan."
Evil Genius,"Sid Haig has to play Rothstein, he can almost pass from Captain Spaulding.."
Evil Genius,"I have to disagree with you. He had to assume, as the letter stated, that they were watching him and that any deviation from the instructions would result in detonation of the bomb. 

I don't know how you could still believe he was in on it after Hoopsick gave her confession. She had nothing to gain in doing so other than a clean conscience."
Evil Genius,I remember growing up and watching the early 2003-2005 TV segments but finally hearing what all happened was absolutely interesting. It sounded bizarre before and it's even more bizarre now.
Evil Genius,I think it was just a red herring like the lollipop bit. The narrator wanted the viewer to believe something was going on. In the end they could of just never mentioned the other guy and the story would have stayed the same. But then we wouldn't be able to make up connections like the 2nd pizza was a drug addict who knew Kenneth Barnes and had over heard about the robbery from Barnes.
Evil Genius,"One of the co-conspirators, Bills roommate, actually named him as being at the meeting the day before the robbery, however this isn’t included in the documentary. Something I found interesting "
Evil Genius,"Prostitution isn't illegal in a lot of countries and is generally considered a morally grey area. It doesn't make him a bad person for doing it, just a lonely guy, so I wouldn't consider it 'outing' him."
Evil Genius,I think marj was borderline personality. I knew a girl like that 
Evil Genius,It's called 30 minutes or less starring Jess Eisenberg actually. 
Evil Genius,Very interesting! Those Rs are unusual enough that you’d think they would have at least explored a connection (or perhaps they did and found it to be inconclusive). 
Evil Genius,That's *eerie*
Evil Genius,I think it would have came down to who killed each other first her or Rothstein. 
Evil Genius,I think Marjorie was lying about measuring his neck... the collar had a ratcheting device and looked like it could have fit many different neck sizes.
Evil Genius,"I think Wells was supposed to die at the final drop off point that the cops went to. He would drive there, die because there was no final key, and then the van that the cops saw (Rothstein's van) would pick up the money and drive off. By the time anybody found his car (it seemed like it was out of the way), the van would be long gone, and the only witness would be dead."
Evil Genius,I don’t think Wells was meant to survive
Evil Genius,">A major detail left out of the documentary is the fact that, according to Floyd Stockton — the co-conspirator given immunity in exchange for his confession — there was a rehearsal the day before the robbery, in which Brian Wells was fitted with a fake bomb.

>The documentary also suggests that Robert Panetti — the other pizza delivery guy who died mysteriously — had no link to the crime. 

They covered this in the last episode. If you're going to believe Jessica, she said  Brian had work at 4pm and was with her until 2:30pm so he wasn't at the meeting. They also said Panetti was probably involved but never found out how."
Evil Genius,"A couple thoughts about Marge and her alleged intelligence...

First, I think the anecdotes count for a lot. Her best friend raved about her intelligence. Bill raved about her intelligence when he called the cops on her about the dead money \(""she is very, very intelligent""\). This is something a lot of people agreed on. 

Second, like /u/TooSwissToWrestle pointed out in the post adjacent to mine, it was said a number of times that she deliberately acted crazy to toy with the justice system. I think a lot of the footage we saw was theatrics and histrionics, and isn't necessarily an indictment on her being smart or not.

Finally, one last thing to consider: while I do think she ""hammed it up"" in front of the camera, she was getting pretty old. I believe she was in her 50s during the footage we saw. It's pretty common for mental well\-being to degrade as a person gets older. It's possible she was super intelligent when she was younger and in better health, and that her intelligence and general demeanor deteriorated as she got up there in age."
Evil Genius,"> What I find interesting is why he would call the cops to come look at that dead body in his freezer? 

Thank you, this is all I’ve been wondering about since I finished the series. I don’t understand his motivation for outing Marjorie for the death of her boyfriend if they had just pulled off this heist (or were about to do so, can’t remember the timing of the events). That was the one crucial mistake that took down the entire group of conspirators. "
Evil Genius,"Show went out of it's way to stress that Marjorie played up being senile to manipulate people. I think she's a chatter box but it's not out of the realm of possiblity to keep talking that much and even play it up so people think you're simple, underestimate you and even feel sympathy for you.

I mean she got away with the deaths of two husbands, she had to be doing something to have people lean towards her innocence.

"
Evil Genius,[deleted]
Evil Genius,Whats the keepers?
Evil Genius,She keeps saying that she is not an evil genius in the show. I think in the context of the story it fits well
Evil Genius,"Agreed about her beauty. By the end of the series it seemed like there was clearly something magnetic and charismatic about her persona and maybe those aspects were conflated into her beauty. I thought she was utterly obnoxious every time she spoke, her voice grated on me, and she never sounded all that articulate or intelligent to me. So she had a bachelors and a master's in Ed. Big deal. Perhaps that was a big deal for the area where most people didn't go on to higher ed. But the 'genius' of her and Rothstein was merely relevant to those around them. "
Evil Genius,I thought she was very pretty when she was young.

The Who Was? Show,I bet he aired that grievance!
The Who Was? Show,"""YOU DON'T NEED GLASSES, YOU'RE JUST WEAK. YOU'RE WEAK!"""
The Who Was? Show,"I got a lot of problems with you people, and now, you’re gonna hear about it!!!"
The Who Was? Show,"What always amazes me is how late in the series this episode was. It was only a few months before the show ended! Crazy they were still making iconic episodes that late in the game, just shows how brilliant Seinfeld was."
The Who Was? Show,"“They both shouted a lot, though Frank (Costanza) was a lot less toxic, I guess,” O’Keefe said.”

Holy hell, how is a father more toxic than Frank Costanza??? When you read the article it makes sense, but watching Seinfeld George’s parents seemed like Looney Tunes."
The Who Was? Show,"As I rained blows upon him, I realized there had to be another way!"
The Who Was? Show,"I've only ever participated in one Festivus ever and it's the last one I'll ever be in. 

A a group of friends threw one together as a joke and I went along cause why not. 

Friendships were actually damaged that day and I and one other person just sat in a corner watching the carnage before leaving awkwardly."
The Who Was? Show,I really enjoyed reading about this man's childhood trauma. Glad he shared it with the world.
The Who Was? Show,I can’t believe that Festivus is this big cultural phenomenon when in reality there’s only like 3 minutes of festivus related plot in the Seinfeld episode
The Who Was? Show,"Whoa, that kinda blows my mind! Just seems so fantastical, I thought it never could be real."
The Who Was? Show,[deleted]
The Who Was? Show,"Let me understand, you got the hen, the chicken and the rooster. The rooster goes with the chicken. So, who's having sex with the hen?"
The Who Was? Show,">O’Keefe’s father also coined the term, “A Festivus for the rest of us,” which ended up in the show. But it had nothing to do with class consciousness or the fight against Christmas commercialism — it was about the sudden death of O’Keefe’s grandmother in 1976.

I never imagined that this term have a sad meaning."
The Who Was? Show,"“You, Kruger.  My son says your company *stinks*!”"
The Who Was? Show,"When my in laws were planning on moving to a gated FloRida community I joked that they were going to be living the Del Boca Vista retirement life.  

When my father in law put that together with living a petty life they opted for a non community average home."
The Who Was? Show,I'm pretty sure all the stories in Seinfeld happened irl
The Who Was? Show,this episode is one of the funniest. anything related to george and his parents is always a golden episode
The Who Was? Show,Festivus is your heritage George. It's part of who you are...
The Who Was? Show,One if my favorite things in life are when people place Festivus Poles in holiday displays
The Who Was? Show,"“Cougar, my son tells me your company stinks!”

*”…Oh God.”*

“Quiet, you’ll get yours in a minute!”"
The Who Was? Show,"So, similar to fetivus my grandfather (also a new york jew) had made up the ""scumbag of the year awards) aka the STY awards, where you would state your case why this person or that person who did you wrong diserived the ultimate award, on occasion, my father would write songs about them, being the musician that he was. I still remeber some lines to ""crazy Steve's lament"" and ""All Frank's Suck"". The award ceremony would take place on New Years eye (or some point between Christmas and NYE) when we would all get together...when I first saw the festival episode I was a child still and I was like oh. They do their version of the STY awards....."
The Who Was? Show,"The local bar used to let us bring an aluminum pole in every 23rd haha

So obviously I watched the episode and something struck me, if frank says he hasn’t celebrated festivus in years, why did he send George the card?"
The Who Was? Show,this needs to get to the top of everything
The Who Was? Show,"Hello, woman."
The Who Was? Show,I would like to have been in the writers room when he told that story.
The Who Was? Show,"Spike Feresten (writer on Seinfeld. Wrote the soup nazi episode) just had Dan O’keefe on the latest episode of his podcast (Spike’s Car Radio). He revealed that his father had created other fake holidays, besides Festivus."
The Who Was? Show,But did he air his grievances?
The Who Was? Show,This is amazing. 25 years later and the show still continues to surprise and amuse us. Legendary!
The Who Was? Show,"After that Jets game last night, Festivus couldn’t have come at a better time"
The Who Was? Show,That was a fun read. Thanks for sharing it!
The Who Was? Show,"I assure you, Festivus is a tradition that is *all too real*. I could prove it, if you like."
The Who Was? Show,We will be watching tonight in homage to Mr Daniel O’Keefe.
The Who Was? Show,"“Oh I got denim vest checking me out.”



“No, please! Denim vest! He’s smoothing it!”"
The Who Was? Show,"Dammit! Even Festivus was spawned from a bed of lies!! 
Is there nothing honest and sacred in this world?!?"
The Who Was? Show,"I loved Seinfeld, I’ve watched it start to finish about 10 times, but I really can’t stand George and Jerry’s parents"
The Who Was? Show,"If he didn’t want it on the show and kept secret, he shouldn’t have told them all about it! But thank you for doing so!"
The Who Was? Show,Get this racist out of here
The Who Was? Show,Yea right
The Who Was? Show,Probably my favorite episode.
The Who Was? Show,"This is funnier to me because a U.S. Army Colonel who was also an optometrist examining my eyes told me the same thing. She scolded me for being lazy and not trying hard enough. “You’re not even squinting, you already gave up.”"
The Who Was? Show,It’s till a holiday.
The Who Was? Show,A festivus for the rest of us!
The Who Was? Show,"I remember reading an article about a defense attorney who was registering his client for incarceration… Forgive me of the details because I’m not an attorney and I don’t recall the specifics or how the court system works or whatever but… where the form asked for the defendants religion, the attorney, obviously a smart ass, wrote down “Festivus”. And the clerk registered it. And on that day, Festivus became an actual legally recognized religion.

Note: i’m lazy so if there are any other Redditor’s that want to do the research or have specific knowledge of this, please chime in and comment!"
The Who Was? Show,He sounded pretty gruff about it in the interview on Spike’s Car Radio podcast.
The Who Was? Show,Nah he just wrote a book about festivus and how to celebrate it.
The Who Was? Show,I got a lot of problems with you people and now you're gonna hear about it!
The Who Was? Show,And feats of strengths!
The Who Was? Show,"""Until you pin me, George, Festivus isn't over"""

The Who Was? Show,This is how to start a Sprint Retrospective at work.
The Who Was? Show,"Did a Halloween bar crawl with friends this year and my fiancé and I went as George’s parents and this is how I started most conversations at each bar we went to

The Who Was? Show,"Have you seen the pole, Krueger?"
The Who Was? Show,Best line on the show even better with the full context of him leading up to that line.
The Who Was? Show,Early Seinfeld episodes are a bit more grounded than later ones; the early episodes mainly rely on poking fun at real social situations while they go a bit zany in Season 8-9 after Larry David left the show. But both are great and hilarious
The Who Was? Show,My all time favorite Seinfeld line came from this episode. “Hey how did my horse do?” “He had to be shot”
The Who Was? Show,"I think the show sort of made a deliberate effort later on to create these sort of iconic, “viral” moments that it had become known for. The show always seemed to have a lot of catch phrases or outrageous moments that just stuck in popular culture, but I feel like in those last couple of seasons they just reeeally leaned into the quotable nature of the show.

The Elaine Dance, Yada Yada Yada, Man Hands, Festivus, etc. are all from those last couple of seasons and are some of the most repeated/iconic parts of the show. The last couple of seasons might feel slightly different, but like you said, it’s crazy how successful they were even at the end of the show’s run!"
The Who Was? Show,"I noticed this too when I was perusing the Netflix catalog.

Season 9 absolutely fucking *slapped*.  So many iconic episodes right at the end. They went out on a high note for sure."
The Who Was? Show,wasn't a big part of the show ending because Jerry and others wanted to end it while it was still great? i mean how often does that happen.
The Who Was? Show,"After David left they went balls to the wall and after finding their feet it's pretty much hit after hit. I personally think Seinfeld is the greatest comedy through it's entire runtime, but those last two seasons hit such a perfectly absurd vibe that I don't think any show has replicated"
The Who Was? Show,"The soup nazi, the bottle deposits, the rye, the chicken roster, the summer of George, the yada yada, the sponge, the bizarro jerry, the little kicks, the serenity now, the merv griffin show.

Some fans didn’t like the late seasons but  they were good in my opinion."
The Who Was? Show,"I can’t believe the writer didn’t want Festivus for the rest of us, though."
The Who Was? Show,"Also amazes me how the festivus scene is just a couple minutes long at the very end. And the episode isn’t called festivus it’s The Strike

Heyyyyyy no bagel no bagel no bagel no bagel"
The Who Was? Show,Yeah people rag on season 9 but it has some of my favorites
The Who Was? Show,Really good point!
The Who Was? Show,The last season still had so many gems! Obviously the finale was lackluster but overall it definitely ended before it declined
The Who Was? Show,It didn't really get popular until 3rd or 4th season. So prob most people who remember the peak didn't even watch a good chunk of the episodes that exist.
The Who Was? Show,"It was more because they decided to cancel it *before* they ran out of good material. They quit while they were ahead, instead of when everybody got sick of it."
The Who Was? Show,"Jerry, Mr. Steinbrenner is here, George is dead, call me back."
The Who Was? Show,"I know his brother Dan (also a TV writer) and the stories of their Dad are wild. 

Lots of episodes from shows they have written on like The League, Drew Carey, and I believe even Silicon Valley contain references to their family"
The Who Was? Show,He was apparently a pretty bad alcoholic so while the story is funny in the context of the show I think that man's childhood was sort of a living hell. I can't remember his name but I've heard him do an interview and was obviously going to be asked about this.
The Who Was? Show,"One of my favorite facts about seinfeld's development is that George's father was supposed to be a wimp like george also cowed by george's mother - his wife - and it really wasn't working so the actor improvised a bunch of lines firing back at her ""you're the one who breast-fed him till he was twelve!"" and similar, and it worked so well they changed the character."
The Who Was? Show,That must have been some doll.
The Who Was? Show,Jerry Stillers delivery of that line is amazing
The Who Was? Show,Damn. Another redditor in a similar thread said that had to add reconciliation or something. So they got to air grievances BUT for every grievance they had to add a thing they did to help or be awesome during the year. That sounds more reasonable to me.
The Who Was? Show,Can you elaborate? what exactly went down?
The Who Was? Show,My friend group has had a pretty fun time with it thankfully. Almost like the purge keeps us from exploding on each other.
The Who Was? Show,Sounds like the correct way to celebrate festivus to me
The Who Was? Show,Yeah the title of the episode is called the strike and the main a plot is about kramer
The Who Was? Show,"I think it’s because Jerry Stiller’s performance in that episode is so great in an over-the-top way that it really stuck out in people’s minds. Almost every line that he says in the episode is amazing.

“I find tinsel distracting.”

“I GOT A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH YOU PEOPLE!! AND NOW YOURE GONNA HEAR ABOUT IT!”

“A festivus…for the rest of us.”

“As I rained blows upon him, I realized there had to be another way!”"
The Who Was? Show,It hit a cultural nerve.
The Who Was? Show,"It's not that big, they just write articles about it every year."
The Who Was? Show,"In real life as well it was a floating holiday and not tied to a specific date making it ""all the more ominous"" according to the writer."
The Who Was? Show,It’s a festivus miracle!
The Who Was? Show,"Yamahama, it's fright night!"
The Who Was? Show,They’re all chickens. The rooster has sex with all of them.
The Who Was? Show,Trauma inspires tons of art
The Who Was? Show,You couldn't smooth a silk sheet if you had a hot date with a babe.....
The Who Was? Show,Haha I always say flah rih dah because of all the old folks and del boca vista
The Who Was? Show,[removed]
The Who Was? Show,that’s why I hate it.
The Who Was? Show,I got my dad a little desktop one for his office a few years ago.
The Who Was? Show,FYI. Frank Costanza was Italian.
The Who Was? Show,What….?
The Who Was? Show,"He didn't, his brother did. The producers pestered him about it and he didn't want it on the show, then they basically told him it's going to be in the show whether he wrote it or someone else did, so he gave in."
The Who Was? Show,"He didn't, his brother did.  Someone didn't read the article."
The Who Was? Show,Giving it a listen now. Apparently his dad had other made ip holidays too lol
The Who Was? Show,Really good episode this week.

Safe,"Gaiman:

>”Sandman Season 2 has been commissioned by Netflix and is real. Whatever behind the scenes wrangling and negotiating needed to happen to make this a reality has already occurred.”"
Safe,"> ""Sandman Season 2 has been commissioned by a Netflix and is real.


Plenty of shows were renewed, but few weeks/months later, they were unrenewed. This happened at Netflix, HBO, Paramount+, AMC+  etc

In the current era of belt-tightening, nothing is real until they drop the second season on the service."
Safe,"Gonna be interesting what they do with it. No spoilers but other than the first maybe, 20% of the novel, the rest is all stories through out history. If they do go all out on what big story pieces there are in the 2nd then I hope they stick with Barbie's stuff. Martin Tenbones is ma boi."
Safe,So happy they adapted this well. The battle with Lucifer and the death/Hob episode really stood out!
Safe,Sandman 2: Man Your Own Sand
Safe,"The Batgirl directors assured us it was safe too.

Sorry, just making trouble ;)"
Safe,"I won't believe it until it shows up on my Netflix homepage. Warner Bros Discovery has been unpredictable and honestly it isn't that abnormal for any company to go back on a deal. 

I get why he has to sound optimistic for fans though."
Safe,"i wouldnt treat it as a 100% confirmation tho, he probably is also in the blank in big corporation actions"
Safe,"Dang, I feel every major show at Netflix is either mired in some dispute, is in the process of being cancelled, or is facing some other problem...Netflix is turning out to be very unreliable from a production standpoint."
Safe,I hope season 2 is more like the first half of season 1 than that awful Dream Vortex arc. Honestly the Vortex plot felt like a CW show but with a higher budget (especially how bad the main actress was).
Safe,Should I continue watching this show if the first two episodes just didn't do it for me at all? Main character is super unlikable so far. Never read the comics.
Safe,Wooooo I had some of my best sleeps in ages while watching season 1. I can't wait.
Safe,More Desire plz.
Safe,"Did anyone feel like this fell off a cliff halfway through the season? I'm not hating and I'm glad it got a second season. However, I was much less interested in the second half of the season and I'm just curious if I'm alone in that thinking."
Safe,"Was very disjointed.  Guessing that's because S1 covered an anthology?

I quit maybe 4-5 eps in?"
Safe,"Didn't WB film all of Batgirl too, then cancel it when it was in the can?  I wouldn't call jack shit ""safe"" while WB is cleaning house."
Safe,Fuck yeaaaa one of my favorite shows!
Safe,Is this actually a good show? I remember seeing the trailer and thinking it looked goofy and boring.
Safe,"I didn’t care for it. No offense to anyone who enjoyed , just wasn’t my cup of tea.

Besides , everyone knows Netflix will wait until after season 3 to fk up popular shows :/"
Safe,Watched episode one of first season ....it was super un-captivating. Ugh.
Safe,Yay
Safe,"Glad to hear it...but I'll breathe easier once I see the words ""New Episodes"" On the show thumbnail."
Safe,I was so bored by this show after an episode and a half. Gotta give it another shot at some point.
Safe,"Never read the comics, had no idea about what sandman was, thought the first episode was utterly bizarre, only the vagueness intro to who he is, what he does, what powers he has, when he lives, how he influences the human world, who he works with... No background at all, he gets summoned and trapped for 100 years, goes back, his realm is destroyed. But I don't care about that at all because I'm not invested in it. It means nothing to me.

I didn't watch any further"
Safe,That fucking clown is going to kill WB.  At least we'll get a season 2 of sandman first!
Safe,Neil Gaiman is a gift.
Safe,Westworld. I’m so sad.
Safe,It fucking better be
Safe,Should have been cancelled
Safe,[deleted]
Safe,Too bad the show sucks and doesn't come close to living up to the source material. The audiobook is leagues better. Imagine that.
Safe,Woke.
Safe,Was there ever any real doubt?
Safe,"But will it be woke enough? That's the question.

Any more male characters we can turn into women?"
Safe,The amount of gay people/gay Shit that happens in this show is not realistic to the world (literally every episode some weird gay shit happens)
Safe,What was crazy to me is how much better Sandman looked than an HBO produced Mega hit like Game of Thrones new series
Safe,Meanwhile Stand Straitman got canceled
Safe,One less thing to worry about that I already wasn’t worried about.
Safe,And they renamed it to Sandperson.
Safe,👏
Safe,Gay man
Safe,Destruction the endless moment
Safe,"He can't possibly be sure. They wouldn't tell him if they were secretly considering cancelling it, and they have already cancelled projects that were already commissioned or even in production. Hell, they have cancelled projects that were finished."
Safe,"Netflix has a history of cancelling popular shows, I'll wait for this one and others to finish before I start them."
Safe,This is such a nothingburger of a story. All the rumors said was that Zaslav didn't like the payment structure.
Safe,It was already done and paid for.
Safe,"Hope they put everything they can into it. If they flub this arc there's no reason to continue the series (It would be cancelled anyway, but still)."
Safe,The sandman was so boring it’s def only gonna have 2 seasons
Safe,"First half of season one was good second half fell apart, kinda hard to determine how season 2 will go hopefully it’s good as the series has potential."
Safe,Is this going to be like Miracleman?
Safe,"Don’t mess with ma Sandman, there’s piles of other useless drivel that can be tossed before this gem."
Safe,"I stopped watching it as soon as i saw Lucifer. I mean cmon, My hopes of Lucifer was so high cos of Tom Ellis"
Safe,I really wish they’d give American Gods another shot.
Safe,I'm really waiting for next season. Good to know things are looking ok.
Safe,Could not get into this show. The director or sound guy made the dialogue hard to hear. I like the actors but it’s not for me.
Safe,No shit. Netflix is footing the bill for production. Sandman costed 15 mill per episode on season one.
Safe,I really enjoyed season 1.
Safe,This is definitely a Warner Bros and Netflix issue that will only involve new series sales. The issue will likely be long resolved before the new Sandman renewal is in consideration in a few years time.
Safe,Reading between the lines: they already cut the check.
Safe,[deleted]
Safe,I used to think a renewal meant nothing until cameras started rolling. But we've all been burdened and that doesn't mean it's safe either.
Safe,"I started the comic after watching season 1 and am just wrapping up the 2nd book.  I get why they hesitated on season 2, going to be a bit different."
Safe,Raised by wolves fans would like a word
Safe,"And even if.. I kinda see no way in hell that Sandman will ever get a full adaptation. Hell, I kinda doubt season 3 is in the cards unless season 2 will be some sort of surprise mega hit.

Which sucks."
Safe,"Even if it's released, it's not guaranteed to stay. David Zaslav has removed HBO ORIGINALS from the platform as tax right offs. Netflix removed their Marvel shows as well."
Safe,"
>the rest is all stories through out history.

The best parts of season 1 were the standalone episodes, so that's not necessarily a problem."
Safe,"I did some back of napkin math based on the first season and it looks like they can easily knock out two trade paperbacks each season, maybe a bit more for some of the one off stories getting tweaked or cut for IP reasons."
Safe,Martin Tenbones deserved better!!!!
Safe,Lucifer seemed like the weakest casting to me. Everyone else was perfect. But I did enjoy that battle scene.
Safe,"Adapted this well? What are you talking about?

They made Constantine a woman FFS. A lesbian woman. Because, you know, woke.

I am hoping they will make a Sandman tv series some day. It could really work well in that format."
Safe,Sandman 3: Keep My Sand Out Yo F***ing Mouth
Safe,"Sandman 2: looks pretty enough but the storyline, pacing, and acting are mid at best. I'm surprised it got renewed."
Safe,Well the movie itself is safe- WB still has it and it was absolutely filmed in some capacity. It just won't be released ever
Safe,"No this is accurate. Until season 2 airs, anything can happen. Honestly why would Gaiman even know?"
Safe,"I think that's just at a different stage. If they make season 2 and test audiences are showing that it's a total dumpster fire, they'd probably consider cancelling it, but the fears gaiman is trying to settle are around whether they will cancel it for legal reasons."
Safe,"That movie was dumpster fire and I don't know why people cling on to it. Like it was so fucking bad that Disco/WB looked at it and said ""yup we're writing this 200m disaster off as a loss""."
Safe,">I get why he has to sound optimistic for fans though.

And to the cast so they don't shop other offers."
Safe,They do this kind of shotgun thing of making a massive number of shows and hoping one sticks. Wednesday is the most recent example.
Safe,"lets be real, this is not a major show"
Safe,They squandered their position of market leader long ago.
Safe,"Season 2 will pull primarily from Volumes 4 and 5, with one-off episodes or episode portions adapting most of the remaining one-off issues up to this point in the comic.

Volume 4, Season of Mists, is mythic level storytelling that introduces us to gods and angels and the faerie court and centers on the actions of Lucifer. Volume 5, A Game of You, is closer to being a sequel to The Doll’s House (second half of season two) with a couple characters recurring, but it is less formulaic than that volume and weirder in general, so you may like it more than the previous such section (I certainly do as far as the comics are concerned)."
Safe,"Its straight out the comic and the show actress was just like the comic character. Personally i just dont think that comic arc is something most people will like. Its basically alice in wonderland but coming off the more sinister early arc and somberness of death it feels like a different show and doesnt slightly suprise me tgat people dislike it.

Even in the original comic its somewhat whiplashy to jump to that from the previous stuff."
Safe,The second novel is near all short stories through history of how Dream influenced/watch/helped/deus ex machina'd shit. In a lot of ways it's more of a middle child of building up the endless and their influence on the world. I think best case is maybe 8 single serving stories similar to the few episodes they release at the end of last season. That said those stories are some of my absolute favourites from the whole thing.
Safe,"Yeah, Rose Walker and her friends actresses were pretty terrible. It was literally Vanesu Samunyai's FIRST EVER acting gig (per imdb) and that made people speculate that she was brought in either because of her money or relations/connections."
Safe,Wholeheartedly disagree on that one. I think the entire season was phenomenal and an awesome adaptation of the comics.
Safe,"You know I wasn't a fan of the Vortex arc at first but have grown to love it on repeated viewings.

The actress was fine too she was suppose to be an almost dream like character."
Safe,Was it the kind of arc that ruins potential for future storytelling (like GoT s8 episode 4) or more like a sidestory that was kinda lame or boring which can be easily moved past?
Safe,"how the hell did anyone finish this show it was a snoozer all the way through. I didn't read the comics so I couldn't tell if the main character was supposed to be a little bitch or not until I got to near the end and I was like ""ok he's supposed to be a whiny little bitch. that's interesting."""
Safe,"The main character is supposed to be unlikable. Dream of the Endless is an asshole and honestly not that bright. The main arc of the original comic is him realizing that and *attempting* to change.  
  
Season 1 begins this process, much more quickly and surely than the comic did. If you were to watch to the end of season 1, you would see him begin to correct his wrongs."
Safe,no. many people said the beginning was better than the end.
Safe,"No. You start to get different stories but you also get to experience the Sandman a lot more as well. If you don't like him, then you won't like further episodes."
Safe,It’s started to feel campy and goofy  and couldn’t commit to a tone. It became like a rated-R doctor who for me.
Safe,"I hated everything involving John Dee. A shame since I really like Thewlis as an actor, but he felt terribly underwritten."
Safe,"the whole thing was kind of a drag. I felt the same way as you at first, then I really was trying to put my finger on it and came to the conclusion the whole thing was mostly terrible I just thought I didn't understand it at first but after finishing I was like wait, we just followed around this guy thats trying super hard to be a whiny little bitch wandering around asking people why they don't think he's super cool anymore. the episodes who had none of the main characters were ok though."
Safe,The portrayal of Despair as just a fat woman in a sweater was terrible.
Safe,"Only the last episode covers one of Sandman’s anthology arcs. I’m guessing it feels disjointed because 20-something page long issues of comics don’t translate into full length episodes of television well without creating a very atypical pacing. There’s also some remaining weirdness from most of the DC comics references being replaced by generic versions, as the first two arc of the comics, which season 1 of the show covers, are very connected to rest of DC."
Safe,There are certain legal agreements already in place they can't exactly mess with. For now.
Safe,"That was partially because focus tests and a new exec were a bit lukewarm over it. Maybe marketing wise and not really quality but we'll probably never know.

This had a successful S1."
Safe,"It was good.

Now that we’re getting a season two I’d say it’s worth a weekend binge."
Safe,"The first half was good, not everyone's cup of tea but it was good.  


Second half was pretty bad and felt like a chore watching imo.  


I think the show deserves a second season but it's not as excellent and mindblowing as others would say, at least for me"
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"the parent can blame netflix all they want but a tv show isnt the reason their kid committed suicide.

and i doubt the algorithm intentionally targeted unstable people, 13 reason why was one of the most popular shows once it came out, It was def one of the most controversial ones. 

most users probably saw it on the ""recommended"" ""trending"" etc whatever feed at some point."
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"I think most agree that a show about a teenage girl killing herself as part of a complicated revenge plan probably isn't gonna help any suicidal teenage girls. 

But to blame this suicide epidemic on Netflix algorithms and demand they pay you billions is insane. 

The world is dying. The elder generations have failed their children. Everything is fucked up and depressing. Everywhere they look is misery and confusion and anger and a complete absence of hope. 

Any young person with genes that predispose them to depression or anxiety basically get it 100% in our world. If its in there its coming out."
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,Was this why Netflix now have suicide warnings for some of their shows?
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"Just adding some worthless anecdotal bullshit, but I never wanted to harm myself or ever even thought I had depression. Then I watched girl, interrupted at a young age and wanted to kill myself. I still think “this would be a good song to drown in my tub to” sometimes when I’m taking a bubble bath and listening to music. Art is impactful for young minds."
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,“Gangster rap made me do it”
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"I found AFSP funds high quality research on the causes of suicide and pushes that into policy guidelines and training. https://afsp.org/reporting-on-suicide-prevention

The show was controversial because it didn't follow the guidelines very much, but it did open the dialog a bit more to help reduce the stigma.

Mental health is stigmatized in many cultures, which prevents those in crisis from seeking help. As a society we need to de-stigmatize the topic, make help easy to access, and recognize warning signs."
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,">Netflix cautioned in court filings that restrictions on content would lead to censorship of creative works, noting movies depicting teen suicide such as The Perks of Being a Wallflower, 

Was suicide actually shown in Perks? I thought >!it was insinuated that he was about to, but he never actually does it.!<


>Netflix has removed the original, nearly three-minute-long suicide scene in the season one finale.

Huh, I didn't know they did that. Seems to be admittance that they made a mistake?"
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"There's actually plenty of data that shows depicting suicide or mentioning real life suicides increases suicide.

Every expert that was consulted on this show explicitly told them not to show it.  But they did anyway."
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,This was a really tough scene to watch. I hate that they removed it.
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"Im suing Showtime! Haven't stopped killing people since I watched ""Dexter"""
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"Art is not responsible for real life acts. People need to understand that. And honestly, it's a lot of the people that claim to be really into TV and movies that do this type of thing. Can't handle when they see something that goes against their fragile concept of morality."
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"I had a friend who absolutely loved this show, posted it on social media, always talked about it with friends, and would rewatch it almost everyday. He didn’t come from the most stable house, and he seemed a bit on a spectrum, though functioned very normally. He was one of my best friends.


One day, I find out he has died: his father found him in his room dead. He was a relatively healthy person. There was no explanation, no obituary, and no funeral. I have no idea how my friend died and I was never going to see him again. I’m afraid he may have killed himself.


I won’t say this show made him kill himself, but it glorified suicide as a noble way of going out and I won’t sing it’s praises."
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"Definitely hard to watch but the entire season leading up to it and the second season (haven't watched the third) is watching how her suicide destroys the lives of everyone she actually did care about.

Her family and friends all have varying degrees of mental breakdowns and paranoia, several try to kill themselves, her parents store is vandalized, her parents divorce, and the cherry on top is her rapist gets off scott free and a clean record at another school specifically because she made the revenge diary the way she did."
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,Wait till they read the book…
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"The show also dealt with an (almost) school shooting. It was thwarted. It deals with rape. Are we going to claim people were raped or school shootings were caused because they happened on this show? Always looking for something to blame it on, rather than taking responsibility for being a piece of shit person."
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,I would argue that they did have adequate warnings. Check up on your kid more often
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"pretty sure if someone's gonna commit suicide, that a tv show won't be the breaking point"
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,Not paying attention for his child and blame it on others.
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"Iirc, there was an uptick in Teen suicide rates after this show aired."
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"Suicide scene or not, this show was terrible"
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"To think TV has no effect on real life is naive. People emulate all kinds of shit they see on TV. It depends on the person as to how much influence it has. It doesn't mean we should limit free speech but it does mean companies will exploit this for profit with no eye toward humanities well being. I had a teenager that was at risk for self harm when this came out and I wasn't thinking ""I'm not worried at all because people never do what they see on TV, durrrr"
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"I’m personally more offended they removed the scene. If Netflix thought it was ok to air before the executives watched it, why would they remove it now?"
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,Child was clearly not in the right state of mine even if the show “triggered” a reaction
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,The blame society
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"I understand why the lawsuit was dismissed, but I can still appreciate and agree with the stance of the parents here. 13RW is a dangerous show because it was geared towards an impressionable age group, and it romanticized suicide.   
People project themselves onto onscreen protagonists all the time. That's actually the reason why protagonists are usually the most boring characters in a story. All the side characters have all the interesting quirks and dialog, and the protagonist is often times a blank slate for the viewer to project themselves onto. It makes it easier for the viewer to feel a part of the story that way. So when a protagonist does something in a show or movie, there are people out there who try to mimic it.   


Is is likely for someone to commit suicide after watching 13RW? no. Is it possible? yes.   


Legally, it does come down to free speech, and no the law should not prevent such shows or movies to be made. But aside from the legal issue is a moral one. Sometimes movies that are meant to show the dark side of something in hopes of dissuading people from it, actually push them towards it. I believe it was mentioned that the Euphoria director saw Requiem for a Dream and decided to shoot heroine after watching it. I believe there are similar cases with the film ""the Basketball Diaries"" starring Leonardo Decaprio. As an artist, one must understand the power they have, and shedding light onto a dark topic might not do exactly what you intended to do, but rather the opposite."
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,Im pretty sure this case was over as soon as you start the episode and the warnings of suicide and graphic violence pop up on the screen.
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,I only need one these days
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"Because if you don’t talk about, it’s not a thing?"
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,I know multiple kids who got FUCKED UP because of this scene and still physically cringe when razors or self harm are brought up
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,People who have a moral panic over this show need to learn to take responsibility for themselves and get fucked.
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"I’m kinda worried we’re still in the “art is bad - censor art” stage.

I thought we fucked that shit off 10 years ago, but it’s making a come back."
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,Lmfao what? Trying to sue a tv show for your own kids suicide. This show did more to prevent it than probably any other movie/tv/book ever. Fucks sake.
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,i fucking swear up next they’re gonna sue a newspaper for just reporting a suicide
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"If anything, I felt the scene did a good job in not glorifying suicide. It was uncomfortable to watch, it wasn’t “pretty”.. it was done in a way (I felt) might show people that it’s an incredibly sad and graphic situation.

All of this being said, parents can’t blame a show for the death of their child. Its a heartbreaking situation but finding fault here is a waste of time and resources"
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,13 Reasons Why is definitely an irresponsible show and the writers and show runners should be ashamed of themselves.
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,Buncha incel males in this sub just rearing for some self hate. I can sense it with my virgin super powers. s/
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"SO wanted me to watch with her, First season was decent and intriguing, after that was terrible. Told the SO midway through second season I couldn't be forced to watch with her anymore. 

pushing for a greater nanny state to watch over your kids is not the answer."
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"As distasteful as I think the scene was, it did NOT cause anyone to commit suicide. Actually I have not watched the show, but I have seen the scene and as someone who was kind of suicidal at the time it made me think ""oh hell no I ain't doing that"". And in fact, saying this kind of shit and censoring anything with uncomfortable themes is how you make sure no kid who needs help is never going to get any. Blaming media for social issues has never, EVER helped. It's time we all move on from the satanic panic and start addressing social and political issues where it matters: in social and political contexts."
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"Suicide needs to be addressed and although the pain is very real and hurts like hell, people need to know the triggers and why someone may do it. 

Those who are considering it…..YOU ARE WORTH IT please do not, there is help. There is hope, we can get through this. 

Those who are survivors…..YOU ARE LOVED more than you know!!"
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,The only person to blame is the person who took their own life. No one is accountable for their own actions other than themselves
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"Maybe Netflix should just stop recommending shows and movies. I log on (or he’ll usually pay for the subscription) with one specific thing in mind then let it lapse until I think of something else.

The 13 reasons why suicide and rape scenes should have been edited. They aren’t even realistic. Hannah would have bled a lot, probably needed a blood bag but been otherwise fine. Alex would be dead, Tyler would be brain damaged and in a colostomy bag, Clay and anyone else involved in trying to stop Tyler would be dead, and fat kid who’s name I forget would have went missing waaayyyy sooner than season 3.

Clay should have been institutionalized as soon as he started having hallucinations"
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,The show was 99% teenage melodrama and then a incredibly graphic suicide scene.
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,is this why there are “suicide” warnings before content now? jfc
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,Theat show missed the entire point of the book and became about  promoting suicide to punish people. Its a horrible show.
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,Blaming a fictional TV show for their kids suicide is just a way to hide from the truth that the kid was probably dealing with a lot and their parents did not do anything until it was too later.
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,">most popular shows once it came out, It was def one of the most controversial ones.  
>  
>most users probably saw it on the ""recommended"" ""trending"" etc whatever feed at some point.

Exactly. On top of that, people were talking about it *everywhere*. I heard about it at work, and an entire floor was talking about it and most of those folks were 28-mid 50s. I overheard people talking about it at a restaurant having lunch. It was all over Bookface."
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"I don’t know, suicides tend to have a chain reaction. When someone commits suicide, people who know them’s likelihood of killing themselves increases When a celebrity commits suicide, there is often a notable increase in suicides. This can best be seen in Korea, with their frequent celebrity suicides. 

It’s not impossible to think that already fairly unstable teens who relate to the moody tortured teens in 13 Reasons Why might react in the same way to the fictional suicide as people do to real suicides.

That’s not to say we shouldn’t be able to depict suicide in media, but maybe we shouldn’t glorify it in media targeted at teens."
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"There was a lot of fucked up bullshit in that show that’s definitely bad as they made suicide look like a good way for revenge.

BUT this isn’t something that should be a lawsuit, this should be an example of why suicide is NOT the answer and why we need more talk about it."
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"It's just another version of the ""violent shows/games cause violence"" excuse"
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"Correct me if I’m wrong. Didn’t the beginning or end of every single episode have information on getting help if you are suicidal? When I was a tween this book was banned from our library and book fairs (but I happened to get my hand on a copy) and to be fair, it *does* glamorize suicide. Especially to a suicidal 13 year old, or at least I remember feeling that way. However, I’ve only seen maybe one episode of the show and I think all they can really do is help kids start that difficult conversation. I can absolutely confirm that this show is NOT the reason, but of course the parents need something to blame.

Edit- forgot a very important word"
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"Actually, media tries to downplay celebrity suicides as it literally causes an increase in suicide. There's been research into this. The show glorifies suicide which will increase suicide. However, in no way can you blame the show for a single persons death. It's similar to how we can't blame a single devastating weather event on climate change, just the overall increase. Netflix and the show is responsible for deaths. Legally speaking, it's complicated though. 

The book was far better anyway."
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"Was extremely depressed and had suicidal thoughts and remember watching that show, don’t think it made me any more so when I watched it."
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"If I had a dollar for every time Netflix told me I should commit suicide… well, that’s why I have an actual job."
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"Agreed, it’s like excusing murderers because they played doom when they were 16 years old. Never bothered to watch this particular show but I’m sure if I did I wouldn’t kill John Lennon or suddenly feel an urge to throw my head in a lawnmower. Concepts that are put into film most likely already exists in most people’s heads, motion pictures rarely introduce novel concepts such as ending it all or stroking kittens."
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"That’s true but it’s still a show glorifying teen suicide under the guise of being some prevention show.

She literally kills herself as part of a twisted revenge plot by leaving a treasure hunt behind for her classmates.

The number of young immature minds who are struggling, and then watched this show and thought about how they could be cool like Hannah, is definitely more than 0."
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"People get in trouble all the time for even talking about it, let alone suggesting it, if someone acts out on it.  I don't see why a TV show gets a pass.  They knew what they were making.

I don't see how that translates to suing Netflix, though.  Just take it off the air or put some kind of parental warning or consent on it."
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"Interesting comment from the subreddit that brought you ""This show is dangerous because it glorifies suicide"""
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"I always saw the problem with the show the feeling of impermanence about her death… she was still a main character after she killed herself.  I think in young minds who are biologically incapable of truly comprehending permanence, this toyed with the idea that you somehow get to live on after death, still enjoy your friends, and get revenge.  Still… it is a parent’s responsibility to be there for their kid’s mental health, not Netflix’s responsibility."
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"It may not help the girl directly, but it brings a lot of light to the issue to otherwise ignorant folks, and the more we as a society talk about it and realize this show is touching on a lot of real world problems, the more likely change will come."
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,">The world is dying. The elder generations have failed their children. Everything is fucked up and depressing. Everywhere they look is misery and confusion and anger and a complete absence of hope.

Jesus dude. The world isn’t as bad as you make it seem. In fact, it’s literally the greatest time to ever be human in history.

Maybe turn off the TV every once in a while. Find a new perspective. Life is nowhere near as bad as you make it seem."
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"This show didn't fucking help. It wasn't just teens, there was a 10-year-old who killed themselves over this trashy show. 10. Because the greenlit this show that experts told them was problematic. And the showrunners ignored it."
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"> demand they pay you billions

Where are you getting ""billions"" from?"
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,Pretty sure 13rw also had trigger warnings before episodes and specifically the ones that included the gore. It’s not like it was a jump scare and no one knew she was gonna commit
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"I was so annoyed that they added a trigger warning for every single episode of legend of Korra. ""Self Harm"" the guy just blew himself up in an explosion one episode. I really don't think that warrants the trigger warning for every single episode."
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"13 Reasons Why had full screen LONG warnings before almost every episode describing exactly why it was triggering and exactly who shouldn't be watching it. Those were included on day 1 for all viewers.   


They didn't add those because of 13 Reasons Why - they already had them for when they first released 13 Reasons Why. I remember the rape episode starting with a very ominous warning of ""This episode has graphic and violent displays of rape and sexual assault. Seriously, do not watch this if you are triggered by these things"". Same thing for the suicide episode and various other episodes."
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"To add my own, I was working as a crisis counselor when this series came out. It drove so much additional traffic to us that we literally had to make a resources entry for it to help people who hadn’t watched the show help people. I don’t know if it made people who were already on the brink more willing to talk about it or if it made people who were not previously suicidal think that was glamorous, but one way or another we saw a lot of at risk teens for months. It was genuinely a really harrowing time for me."
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"Sam Levinson, the creator of Euphoria, talks about this in this interview:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZv1Gc9DleY&t=38m13s

A mom in the audience asks if her daughter should watch Euphoria given the subject matter of the show. Sam, who was a drug addict when he was young, responds by pointing out how after he saw Requiem For A Dream, his first thought was that he should start shooting heroin.

Media definitely can have serious real world impact on people. Especially young people who may be dealing with mental health issues.

That of course doesn't mean film should be censored, but people should be careful what they're about to watch if they're not prepared for it."
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"exactly. suicidal ideation is something that should be met with concern and love, and not everyone has those resources. Maybe we should be more concerned about the people who took their own lives away because of the environment they could not stand, than the people still here making up excuses for why “they could take it”. you’re not stronger because you’re still here and they aren’t. you’re just able to come up with more excuses."
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"I think it is too. People forget how impressionable and distant from reality teenagers are. One suicide can cause another in a school, as happened in Wales once. Something like 20 died in a row. 

I don’t believe art is dangerous btw, I just think teenagers are prone to latching on to things. Maybe some subjects aren’t meant to be entertaining and need to be handled sensitively. 

I thought the suicide in that show was treated in a self righteous and inappropriate  way."
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,The artist is not responsible for your emotional reaction to their art.
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"Yeah. This idea that media doesn't impact people at all is very popular online (especially concerning violent video games) but simply not true. That said, it isn't the *only* thing that impacts people. It may be a relatively small variable in how a person decides to act eventually. 

*Bowling for Columbine* had an interesting conclusion about why there is more spree shootings in the US. It wasn't because of gun violence on fictional TV. Instead the idea was that it was tied to how US Foreign Policy involves more military conflict compared to a country like Canada (which isn't tos say some of that conflict might not be necessary). And that conflict is covered extensively in the media."
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"Wait a minute, who commited suicide in Perks? I thought he was just very depressed, and was thinking about it, and that's when he called his sister?"
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"There is an article on the ""removed"" line at the bottom.

tldr is they wanted more seasons and spoke with experts and was advised to edit the scene"
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,Could we not say the same thing about drug usage? This is kinda the reason shows have disclaimers.
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"> Every expert that was consulted on this show explicitly told them not to show it

I think that's the most important part to me. It's difficult to tell whether there really were suicides connected to the show, but even if there aren't, that was a risk they were willing to take?"

13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,Idk. You are saying that showing it vs heavily implying it makes a difference? Seems kinda silly to me to think that one scene made all the difference.
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,Good. Art should never compromise.
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"They’re zero chance that data could be directly correlational, and the only thing I could find was a temporary increase in teenage suicide in late 2019 with the debut of 13 Reasons. Even those researchers admitted “Researchers warn that their study could not prove causation.”

I’m would guess that Social Media has WAY more to do with teenage suicide than television. But I don’t claim I can prove that."
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,Please... people don't kill themselves because of a tv series
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"I kind of don’t care what the experts say, Art is art no?"
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"They aren't legally culpable for someone's suicide, but they absolutely failed a moral duty of care by broadcasting that shit."
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"As always, the actual suicide is treated as the main problem, not the mental state that made them want to die.

Nobody would hesitate to show depressed or otherwise mentally ill people in shows. It's the *suicide*."
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"Isn't it also true that merely reporting on a suicide in the news (especially a celebrity/known person) increases suicide?

It reminds me of that expression: there's no such thing as an antiwar film."
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,I thought it would be a deterrent.
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,Have one of your kids be negatively influenced by it and you may feel differently. That was a rough time for my family.
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,[deleted]
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,And I became a lumberjack.
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,They have to fit the code.
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,Seriously. What an idiotic lawsuit. How are people seriously like this now?
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"You must not have known any suicidal people in your life, or read any of the studies or articles about how there actually was a correlation (yeah I know that's not causation, but come on) between this show and a rise in suicides."
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"Idk dude, reading the Catcher and the Rye might make you want to suddenly assassinate people…"
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"People who suffer from mental illness are susceptible to these sorts of issue no matter what gets out put in the media. If it wasn’t for this show it wild have been something else.   As you said it’s no the arts fault, it’s our lack of mental health awareness and treatment.  It’s getting better but still has a long way to go."
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,It’s also in the book it’s based on so like 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,This main reason why I didn't believed celebrity bullshit when they said Joker will start Incel riots.
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,Guess you have never been moved by Art.
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"I haven't seen the show, how does suicide look noble in it?"
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"You would think this would be helpful with letting suicidal people know that suicide isn't practical or useful, but it can have the opposite effect. It can make it appear to them that their death will be significant and consequential in a way their lives aren't."
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,Good don’t watch the third or fourth it turns into a murder mystery it’s fucking Disgusting
13 Reasons Why: Beyond the Reasons,"It's always the phone fault, computer fault and social media fault."
The Rain,The kids are so dumb. Literally the first thing they do is the dumbest thing ever. It's almost unwatchable. 
The Rain,Kids are annoying. Just do what you're fucking told.
The Rain,"I like apocalypse stuff.

I just hate how the lack of communication seems to get the most people killed.

I get you are in a hurry, fine but when every single sentence communicates the least amount of information with no gain towards any positive outcome I feel less immersed in the world. Every show is seemingly guilty over this.

"
The Rain,"edit 5: i started watching the middle parts and i'll admit it's not that bad, the characters and their backstories are interesting, but they still do a lot of stupid stuff. especially simone and rasmus, my god these two have no sense of self-preservation at all. point is, it's still pretty cliche and just as predictable as you might think.

i'm danish and i was excited for this show. i mean, set in denmark, and it's in danish? cool.

but it's just unbearably cheesy.

in the beginning, they cause a collision on the highway (classic), and the dad yells at another driver ""YOU NEED TO MOVE YOUR CAR, IF YOU DON'T MOVE IT WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE"", which sounds nucking futs because he's apparently the only person on the highway who knows that the rain is dangerous. then they get out of the car, and run through the forest into a secret underground bunker (???) where the dad tells his daughter ""i'm the only who can solve this! it's me, who can prevent everyone from dying"" (even though he literally didn't warn his daughter's friends, who he saw earlier, to stay indoors/out of the rain???) and ""protect your little brother, he's the key to all this!"" wow, i haven't seen this trope being played out before!

then the kids open the door to the bunker, despite the fact that their mother told them not to, and inadvertently get their mother killed. you morons! you could have just sat in that bunker drinking hot chocolate, but you HAD to go open the door. smh

for anyone further ahead in the series, does it get better?

edit: grammar

edit 2: i'm calling it now, the boy is ""the key"" because he had the virus that is being spread in the rain and the dad (who is a scientist) successfully cured it in him.

edit 3: skipped ahead to the last episode...[spoiler](#s ""i was right, simone's little brother rasmus is the cure, and the evil science corporation needs to kill him to create the vaccine. the dad is also awful, he said he never came back for his kids because he knew his son would get killed for the sake of the vaccine, so instead, he spent 6 years experimenting on other children because their lives were objectively worth less TO HIM."") 

plot highlight: athletic guy tries to kick down a sliding door.

edit 4: the ending is somewhat ambiguous, probably a setup for a potential season 2 (but i feel like it won't get renewed)."
The Rain,Final verdict: Rasmus is a little bitch.
The Rain,"At first I thought the actors were just really bad at acting. 

Then I realized it was dubbed.

And then I realized that still, the actors are really bad at acting."
The Rain,Not even sure I want to watch past the 15 or so minutes I've seen so far. I can already tell these kids are dumb as hell and have no desire to see them succeed through sheer luck and bad writing.
The Rain,"I couldn't make it past the first episode. 
I have never disliked the characters in a show so immediately. As soon as that horrible kid Rasmus wouldn't buckle his fucking seatbelt, and his nagging sister wouldn't shut up, and it caused them to get in to a car crash I started to dislike them. But then after they opened the door when their Mother specifically told them not to, and got her killed with their stupidity, I really hated them. Then he freaks out at how sister over every little thing of her just trying to help, etc.  
I wish Rasmus had been who died tbh. "
The Rain,"Came here enraged at that little piece of shit for not sitting the fuck down. With one eye on Reddit and the other on this show, I was then gobsmacked to see those absolute moron idiots open the door when they have clearly been told to not to.

Some of the more positive comments here made me keep watching, although by the middle of the second episode I was falling asleep because it is impossible to get on board with the terrible writing and the fact that I could not care less about the main characters. In fact I really wanted them to be punished and die. 

So when they are attacked I'm filled with glee but then immediately irritated because it's clearly obvious that they will always end up on top. Immediate ""roll-eyes-look-back-at-phone"" material. It's really that important to make you not hate the characters so much. 

Causing a motorway pile up and then separately killing your mother within the space of two hours is just inexcusable. For anyone that's actually been in a motorway crash or lost their mother, or knows people that have been in those situations, you realise just how horrendous those things are, and it's mortifying to make light of them as if they are the kind of things that can just 'happen', like losing an earring, because some kids are being fucking stupid.

Then there's the cringeworthy dancing and lip syncing immediately after, and I'm wondering how the hell this shit was ever written. It doesn't help that the brat boy has an irritating, ugly, little face and grows up to have an irritating, ugly, punchable little face. 

There are so many reasons I hated this program, which felt like the walking dead's little punchable brother. Especially after just finishing Bates Motel, the comedown to this is just ghastly. So I promptly returned to menu and rated 1 star (you can still do stars on Apple TV app). Never before have I rated a program lower than two-star, but this completely deserved it."
The Rain,"It is boring, the kids are stupid and the show adds nothing new beyond what has already appeared in previous sci-fi and post-apocalyptic shows...

It is such a disappointment !"
The Rain,I hope Netflix hires better writers than The Titan. That was awful.
The Rain,Perhaps this series is supposed to be proof that God loves and protects idiots.
The Rain,I like the premise and the setting but the characters can be really dumb sometimes.
The Rain,"OK, the little brother should be tied up until he's 18.  He's a menace.  The older daughter is not much better, but you have to have someone mobile.  I hope in a real disaster the survivors aren't such hapless mooks as these."
The Rain,"Too much suspension of disbelief required.  
The onset of symptoms/death is much too fast. Bacteria/Viruses/Toxins cannot get absorbed inside the body by merely coming in contact with skin. There needs to be a break in the skin or the microbe has a ligand for receptor on epithelial of respiratory tract or GI tract to attach when breathed in or ingested. And when inside the body there are pathogenic mechanisms that need to happen for symptoms to show. However in the show simply touching rain/water is instant death.  

Father says that the virus resides in the Brain, but it is also in the blood since he transmitted it to the soldier that way and in the saliva since he infected the Apollon researcher when he bit her hand.  
Since it's in the blood, and Rasmus is asymptomatic carrier of the virus then they all should have died when he got stabbed in the stomach and they touched his bleeding stomach.  

THe virus cannot be inherently in rain. Rain merely acts as a vehicle transporting atmospheric microbes. So after it rains, the virus will be all over everything external given how often it rains. Meaning going outside should be a death sentence regardless if it's raining or not.   

Finally, right after the random kid's father tells Simone that people are animals looking for food, he strolls into the street with his kid brandishing food they just received.  

This show is a solid 4/10."
The Rain,"Amazon: ""We're canceling the creators program. we're not taking any more amateur scripts""

Netflix: ""We will literally take all those from you for free and make them.""

May 2018: The Rain premieres "
The Rain,"Wow, I guess I am the only one who loved it. Bring on a 2nd season.."
The Rain,"I knew I'd hate that little bastard immediately when he kept fucking with his seatbelt. Terrible writing and acting. 

I do have the desire to buy a fjalraven backpack tho. "
The Rain,"WTF halfway through first episode and I already loose my shit loooking at the stupidity of these idiot kids omfg. They cause a crash, get there mother killed, tell outsiders about there secret bunker and now she wants to go fucking outside when the dad clearly said he will come back! i dont blame the characters its the writters who are shit, damn."
The Rain,"I'm 10 minutes in and I want to murder both kids. So fucking stupid, beyond any trope of 'people doing stupid things at the worst possible time'. I don't think I can continue. It thought it might be ok with the woman from Dicte on it, but what do you know, she's already dead because of her stupid, idiotic kids.

Edit: I bailed a few minutes later. Life is too short to watch crappy tv. I don't use Netflix's new thumbs-up/down system, but they will notice when people stop watching."
The Rain,"Started watching couldn't get past episode 1 first 10 minutes just looked stupid and unrealistic, after the incident a few tears and all then a dancing scene thats where I paused it let me not even get started with the little boy."
The Rain,Play a drinking game. Have a drink every time sister calls for Rasmus. 
The Rain,whats up with all the new netflix series beeing completly trash with the writing + acting
The Rain,Wow! After reading the comments. I'm not even going to watch a second of this lol
The Rain,"I watched until the end because I like post-apocalyptic theme but the main girl is so annoyingly unlikable. It is really bothering me esp when the story is from her perspective. Her little brother is more annoying. In each episodes, both of them will do stupid things and the team need to help them.

The only realistic person who can survive the apocalyptic is actually their leader who unfortunately need to follow around the main girl. The people that they met and the places that they went along the journey are interesting actually ,together with their background stories. I also like the bunker which is pretty but is not practical. It's unfortunate that I dislike the characters in this series."
The Rain,I'm going to need snacks while reading these comments.
The Rain,"Watched on a computer, it was tolerable but I found myself using the mouse a lot to skip forward past the more irritating cliche's.   I suspended disbelief to accept the premise of dangerous rain, because that could be fun in a childish the floor is lava kinda way.  However, the plot holes just build up and up, then the final cliffhanger was a phone in.  [spoiler](#s ""Evil dudes wanting to profit off the proles is a fine and dandy trope, but the proles have to be able to pay, which they can't if it's the apocalypse.  It just doesn't fit."" )  I'd need persuading to watch another season of this."
The Rain,The characters and dialogue in this series are up there with the worst I have ever seen. Comparable to The 100. Are the people who write these shows lizard people or something? Because they obviously have no idea how real people behave.
The Rain,"Huh, I must be missing something, but this show's also right up my alley, and I'm genuinely enjoying it, cliches and all. It's not perfect, but it's not as awful as everyone here seems to make it out to be.

Then again, I'm only on episode 2. Then again, looking at the comments, it seems thats about where people have also decided to lay down verdict, so we'll see."
The Rain,The story is alright but the choice of cast is poor. Two stupid kids making really stupid and idiotic decisions designed to contrive drama. Basic rules of survival not followed here. Even Walking dead did a season or two before it started doing this.
The Rain,Thank you everyone for saving me some time. I try not to watch show trailers. 
The Rain,made it through the entire show. the writing is so lazy it makes me angry.
The Rain,"Not good, was hoping for another Dark level suprise hit 😔 "
The Rain,"Watched the whole series, and I think it wasted a lot of its potential. Solid 3/5 worth a binge if you can't find anything else. I cared far more for the original group than the siblings, who were admittedly unbearable at times. Also hate how they forced them into poorly fitted relationships. "
The Rain,Of course the mercenaries are russians :D 
The Rain,[deleted]
The Rain,So many terrible decisions! However I found myself sucked in (and a bit frustrated). It reminded me a bit of The Mist. Another show I enjoyed but didn't really like any of the characters.
The Rain,"I’m on episode three and this show is infuriatingly flawed. Makes no sense whatsoever. I really hope they clear things up soon, because I refuse to believe that anyone could write something this stupid. "
The Rain,"Damn I hate that manbaby . 

 I've seen the first two episodes and it's nothing new .  Walking Dead without zombies "
The Rain,The writing for this show is extremely bad 
The Rain,"Made it halfway through the first episode before tapping out. 

It's just bad. Everything about it. I wanted to like it too. "
The Rain,"It was a decent season 7/10, guys do you think season 2 will be an option for this serie?"
The Rain,[deleted]
The Rain,Going through SSRI and Valium withdrawals thought I would watch a show to get my mind off it.  I just about threw a chair through my front window and tipped tables over because of those stupid kids. I have to breath and do some yoga to get over that now. Thanks The rain you SOB!!!
The Rain,"I’m watching it in Danish bc the dubs were awful like they usually are. But anyway these kids are way too happy considering they just got their mom killed. Not thrilled with the writing so far, but I guess I’ll finish out episode 1. "
The Rain,"The idiots who designed the bunker did not add an external camera, or a peeky hole on the bunker door. Another example of stupid design that forced the characters into difficult situations. Script writers love to recourse this.

Edit: oh god, the more i watch \(Ep 1\), the more this is true. The oxygen filtration system, the growing system...all designed by incompetents. Finally i realised that this is a Young Adult series, no wonder they are playing it fast and loose. Not worth my time at all. Lost in Space is much better than this silly mess."
The Rain,"So, is it really bad or what?"
The Rain,[deleted]
The Rain,[deleted]
The Rain,"After 2 episodes I can't waste any more time with this. Some of the dumbest writing and worst acting I've seen. Terrible pacing, full of holes, and requires that you suspend your disbelief through really ridiculous contrivances."
The Rain,"After I found this series I was full of enthusiasm, because since it's Scandinavian I expect realistic post apo. But after just half of episode... How the heck they can be so stupid, why they just can't do what they are told, clearly their father know what to do so why just not wait wit their mother for few days. Also in critical situations communication is the key, why he didn't told them where is he going and how long he will be there, at least the girl is old enough to take it. Next thing I take SIM cards out of all phones and put them in drawer so the kids can't accidentally give out location of bunker or compromise dads operation... Or maybe western civilization is without war or serious crisis so long that almost noone know even the basic of survival. "
The Rain,"I couldn't complete the first episode. I shut it off 22 minutes in. These fucking kids, man... I can't root for these imbeciles to live. If they died gruesomely in the premiere it would be karma. 

This series was definitely way over-hyped."
The Rain,"5/10. Not great, not must-watch or ""event"". First 2 episodes are actually promising, but it starts to get messy in the middle part and doesn't recover until the last episode. Skip it."
The Rain,Since the rain is dangerous... what are the survivors drinking to survive? 
The Rain,"Watched the first 3 episodes and its a decent though generic post apocalypse/disaster show, there's the usual frustrating decisions that accompanies these type of shows but i suppose in the quest for advancing the plot its fine. "
The Rain,"The trailer made it seem good, but wow... the first fifteen minutes were so full of tropes and idiocy, I can't stomach any more."
The Rain,"Pure garbage show, one of the worst writing i have ever seen, do not watch this shit"
The Rain,Does someone have a clue where I can get these hoodies they're wearing in the first episode in the bunker ? They look pretty neat :D
The Rain,"This gets a discussion thread and Cobra Kai didn’t?

Edited to Add: Please join us in /r/cobrakai"
The Rain,"I don't know if people go into shows wanting to hate them or what, but it's nothing like the comments here say. I found it gripping right from the start, and for my taste the best thing to come to Netflix since Dark."
The Rain,"I've seen two episodes now, and it's not great. It's not terrible, but if you want to watch a dark European sci-fi light thriller, you're better off with Les Revenants, Dark or Hotel Beau Sejour."
The Rain,Not a fan.
The Rain,"Only 15 minutes in, this is hilariously bad but I’m enjoying it"
The Rain,Can someone please explain to me how the phone they find in episode 2 still has a charge?? Did I miss something?
The Rain,"So, I watched the pilot and am undecided as to continue watching.   The introduction was very rushed and flat at that. The middle part was okay, at best. Had some decent atmosphere, but also there is that cringey dance scene. And with the ending of the pilot, I fear it's just like a Danish The 100, which I absolutely despise.  
Could someone confirm (or deny) that this show remains corny and is mainly targeted at teens?"
The Rain,can someone explain to me how come nothing happened to them when they were dancing in the rain ? 
The Rain,Coming in late after a binge and enjoying it.  Didn't blow my mind but I love the distopian genre and this does a pretty good job.  It is disappointing to read the 'reviews' here because it appears no one actually watched any of the show because they couldn't get past the 15 min that show children don't act rationally in a panic?  
The Rain,[deleted]
The Rain,how does this show has 100% on RT.
The Rain,"So bad. I can't stand shallow characters making decisions that would make a baboon laugh.

Forced myself to watch the first 2 episodes. Just shut the whole thing down in the middle of ep 3...

Logic process: They find a video clip that reveals their father left for Sweden. So they decide to go to Sweden to find him. As if their father would be for 6 years alive and well in a high tech base, knowing his children's exact location, and all the means to go get them. But he didn't. Oh. My. God.

Very bad."
The Rain,"It’s funny to see everyone stop watching the serie at the first episode and than begin to hate it and let other people hate it and prevent people to watch it. Okay it’s not the best production I admit, but if you keep watching it is different than the first two episodes. If you don’t have others series to watch and waste money for Netflix you should definitely watch this serie."
The Rain,"It’s funny sometimes, even they don’t cover a hair to avoid virus but wear a heavy special uniform to avoid it same time... actors don’t care much about virus even they close the windows while still raining... the most strange scene is first episode. After their mom’s death, kids are laughing and dancing together cause they found a network device.... I feel this drama mood is much same as helix... it also supports a strangely bright bgm for killing scenes.. "
The Rain,"Watched the first episode with subs and the OG Danish (can't speak it but I heard the dub was a little icky). Overall, it was pretty cheesy. But the premise is intriguing, as is the setting."
The Rain,"So bad like 40/100 i watch 4 episode, and just skip it half of them"
The Rain,Anybody else confused how one of the girl gets chosen to sacrifice her body and then she’s just magically there the next episode or is that just me.
The Rain,"I like, is like watching r/Whatcouldgowrong/ or r/instant_regret/ , really fun seeing dumb ppl getting screwed."
The Rain,First episode was plain but entertaining. It had nice moments.  I enjoyed the technologically and aesthetically pleasing details. 
The Rain," I was expecting The 100, what you get is one the weaker Goosebumps novels. I know by now to keep my expectations low when it comes to weekly churn of Netflix shows but even by that standards this was pretty mediocre. "
The Rain,"[Those who've watched it all](#s ""So Rasmus gets the kiss on the forehead from the guy with the virus, which is what makes him contagious at the HQ that people start dying right? So why didn't the main characters die as well when they were near him? Is there some incubation period and he wasn't contagious in the car or are they all immune too? Which might explain the episode where they all go in the rain and nothing happens to them."")"
The Rain,If you like Lost in Space you might like this its stupid and makes no sense 
The Rain,"Los niños matan a la madre de la manera mas estupida posible, es increible lo tarados que son, una total descepcion esta serie!!!"
The Rain,I wonder if this is as campy and cheesy as Into The Badlands because Reddit LOVES that show. They also love The 100 which is cheesy on a whole nother level.
The Rain,"For me, it was too similar to The Last of Us..."
The Rain,Was the voices out if sync for everyone else? 
The Rain,[deleted]
The Rain,3/5 because of beautiful scenery.
The Rain,[deleted]
The Rain,"Annoying points in the first twenty minutes:

* The boy refused to buckle the seatbelt, resulting dad crushing and inevitably destroying everyone's chance to survive on the highway.
* The confused and annoying girl could not stop nagging his panic and distress parents while they are driving.
* The kids open the bloody door, and killing the mom.

Honestly, I can't watch it after that. It's pretty unbearable."
The Rain,[deleted]
The Rain,"What do you mean, ""almost""?"
The Rain,"May be it’s show’s intention to show kids dumb? In my opinion, they are young kids and prone to take bad decisions. "
The Rain,Thank u I thought this was a new show lol I’m on season 1 ep 5 . The kids are really stupid the teen daughter got her mother killed they warned you that somethings going on you saw it on your phone your mom told you not to go to the door because your dad just left so why would he be coming back he’s gone for like five minutes then other scenarios other cat characters are stupid you see your team well first you hear a gunshot then you see your team running towards you or you want to scream hey where is fill in the blank thank you dummy for giving away our location by screaming even the blonde daughter don’t kill anybody OK so they can kill us or we let them go then they could check his deal to kill us store resources because that’s smart
The Rain,It has been a long time since I watched a show where I'm rooting for the main characters to die.
The Rain,"I swear I was thinking the same thing - very short sentences exchanged with little to no substance. Often times the characters ask eachother questions that could very easily be answered, but they just choose not to"
The Rain,Every single sentence you say telling them that there is no time to explain could be a sentence explaining what is happening. 
The Rain,"Yeah, it's insanely cheesy and cliché-heavy. So far I'm enjoying it a bit because it's fun to see recognizable places in a post-apocalyptic setting, and because the show is at least no worse than the average Netflix production; but it's certainly no better, either. Very mediocre experience.

What makes me roll my eyes the most is the notion that contact with water is instantaneously lethal, yet people spend most of their time outdoors. You hear shit like ""it's gonna rain soon, we have to get inside!"" like they just know exactly when the rain will start and are able to get under cover in time. It's so wildly unrealistic.

So every time it rains, literally everybody who's outdoors just dies?  And somehow people are still walking around on a daily basis, not living permanently in bunkers and subway systems? It's too much for my suspension of disbelief. Maybe if this took place in southern California or something, but in Denmark where it rains so often, there's no way you could possibly live an outdoorsy lifestyle if a drop of water kills you.

The show feels a bit too much like The Walking Dead without zombies. They encounter [](#s ""overly pleasant, peaceful hippies who live remarkably well in a post-apocalyptic world, and readily invite strangers into their midst. And they turn out to be cannibals! Oh my word, isn't that just a unique and original idea!"")

I can live with the wooden dialogue and the trope-filled writing, but when the fundamental premise of the show is profoundly unrealistic, I think it's a bit inexcusable. If you spend any real amount of time outside, in Denmark, and any drop of undistilled water instantly kills you, you wouldn't last a month. There's just no chance."
The Rain,Lets also keep in mind thar the entire group is straight up fucking evil. As far as the know this virus is infecting the entire world amd rasmus is the cure. Yet they won't sacrifice rasmus to create a cure that will save the world. Somehow his life is more important than the rest of humanity?
The Rain,yea that fking kid is the antagonist deep inside
The Rain,they literally fucked up a whole highway because the kid didn't want  to put his seatbelt on
The Rain,It’s an ad for vasectomies. 
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,"See, every time I’m bailing they drag just enough good shit out to keep me in.

Oh, and Star Trek. There’s lots of Star Trek on there. 

"
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,Carol Burnett was known for rarely breaking character. Tim Conway & Harvey Korman were freewheeling pranksters who reveled in disrupting sketches to crack each other up. They took particular pleasure in messing with Burnett as they knew she hated it. Their antics (which are all over YT) made for some of the best bits of the show.
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,"Carol Burnett was a pioneer of TV sketch comedy. I highly encourage people to check out her Gone With The Wind parody, another classic, titled *Went With The Wind.*"
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,"Tim Conway is the best! They tried to trumpet but they just went, *Snarf*!"
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,"Man, as soon as Tim starts talking, you can see Carol just make such a hilarious face."
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,[fnork]
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,"So crazy that I grew up watching Mama's Family and it started on a show before I was even born.  Well, barely but, yeah.  Used to love Vicki Lawrence growing up."
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,*Fsnorky!*
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,I've probably seen this more than 2 dozen times in my life and it is ALWAYS funny. If he went on any longer you could weaponize this clip.
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,"What does she say at the end? ""Did you hear that little a--hole...""?"
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,This is hands down one of the funniest things I've ever seen. Together with The Dentist sketch with him and Harvey Korman.
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,I usually end up watching this at least once every few months and it still cracks me up.
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,thry used to show this on infomercials
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,What's a Tim Conway?
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,"Wow. Never saw this. Thank you.

Up there with This Is Your Story with Carl Reiner and Howie Morris and Sid Caesar."
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,I've told my wife for years that I want this played at my funeral. It never gets old. You could show it 100 years from now and it would still be hilarious.
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,I loved this show.
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,"This is awesome, thanks. Whenever I'm having a rough day, just watching people losing it laughing like this is the best therapy. 

I love how surprise always gets the biggest laughs!"
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,"I've always loved watching Tim Conway in anything he did. No matter what he could always make me laugh! My favorites were ""The Carol Burnett Show"", anything Dorf, ""The Private Eyes"", and his few episodes of ""Coach!"""
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,"Err...friend is hard of hearing and CC is no help, what did Vicki Lawrence quip at 4:20?"
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,This will never not be funny.
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,"[Vicki Lawrence on an infamous blooper on ""The Carol Burnett Show"" - EMMYTVLEGENDS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aA7bxTc0AJw)"
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,Comedy that still holds up today can be very rare. I was genuinely laughing my butt off at this by the end
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,Comedy GOLD!!
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,One of the great all time comedy scenes. I remember it being on one of those blooper reel compilation shows and my whole family crying laughing
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,"No matter how many times this pops up, I will watch and upvote it every time"
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,"I remember as a kid wondering why, during bloopers, the audiences would suddenly break into laughter. Now I know about the applause sign and producers and all of that and realise it's some desperate producer flashing the sign to try and settle the laughter so the scene can continue.

Carol's faces are pure joy"
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,Conway’s timing is incredible.
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,"In my opinion the dentist apprentice is the best skit those two did and among the funniest in TV history. Conway had made an arrangement with the sound effects guy to do the buzzing fly sound in the live take, without Korman knowing. The novocaine in the face bit was so funny even Conway couldn't hold it"

A Little Help with Carol Burnett,"As a person who grew up watching HBO's ""Storybook Musicals"", I loved hearing her voicing Peter Rabbit's mother and Mr Mcgregor's cat in their musicals animated adaptation of the beloved story by Beatrix Potter."
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,I just woke up the house laughing at that
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,"Still laughing at that, he was a comedy genius."
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,"Looking at the room layout and the sound “snarf,” could this be the beginnings of Too Many Cooks?"

[The Hitler puppet sketch](https://youtu.be/M5eAjYpcYeg) is a personal favorite. You can see how much Conway enjoys punishing everyone around him with laughter."
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,"LOL Man, I have three that I have to drag out of bed, is there a special kind of laugh I can do that will achieve this!?"
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,Many people don’t know the Reba McEntire version is basically a note-for-note remake of the original.  Great song.

A Little Help with Carol Burnett,"my second favorite skit. my favorite is the dentist chair with harvey.
"
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,one of the best skit comedies ever.  They dont make shows like that anymore.
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,"That was epic,  that show was hilarious especially when Tim Conway went off the reservation."
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,"When I watched The Aristocrats I was disappointed he wasn't in there, I thought for sure a legend like him would be in there somewhere.

Then at the end, he appeared. I was not disappointed by his performance at all."
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,I used to love Mama's family
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,Whats a Tim Conway?
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,TIL Tim Conway is from the future and first introduced the world to iPhone headphones. 
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,God that was such a great show.  My parents used to let me stay up past my bedtime to watch it.  
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,Conway is one of the more underrated comedians in history.  Good stuff.
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,"Wrong, Tim Conway sets it up, and Vicki Lawrence destroys it."
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,What did mama say at the end about assholes? Did she ask if they were conjoined as well?
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,So why does it look like he's wearing one ipod headphone?
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,I love this scene! The part where he imitates the elephant's sound (fjnorky) cracks me up every time.
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,Was he wearing the first Ipod earbuds?
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,I remember sitting down and watching the Carol Burnett show precisely because of Tim Conway always going off and throwing the whole skit off. I used to laugh until it was to sore to laugh.
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,"To be fair, when doesn't Tim Conway destroy it?"
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,Where aren't there any pixels in the video?
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,I am so so glad I watched it to the end
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,One of the greatest skits ever. 
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,...I don't get it. What is it that's making everyone freak out? I just sat awkwardly stonefaced through the whole thing.
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,I don't get it. I watched this three times and didn't find it funny at all. Am I missing something? Could someone explain this to me?
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,"Here's Tim Conway destroying on Opie and Anthony.  Hilarious.

A Little Help with Carol Burnett,"Man, I generally hate corpsing. It's unprofessional.

I'll always give a pass to the Carol Burnett show, though. I don't know why; it's like it's part of the deal."
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,That's funnier than anything on SNL lately. Awesome. 
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,Thanks for sharing that. I needed a laugh. 
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,How did I just notice he's the voice of Barnacle Boy on Spongebob?
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,One of my favorites of all time.
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,"I'd love to watch this without the laugh track/audience.

Seriously.

It'd be so much better..."
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,"It's too simply said, but that was incredibly funny.  I'm blown away by how amusing they managed to be here.  And the end was perfect."
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,"Can we stop sensationalizing titles like this? Its starting to sound like those Facebook articles ""10 Reasons You Should Go To Bed Before 10: Number 8 Almost Made Me Commit Suicide..."""

A Little Help with Carol Burnett,"That was the best thing I'd seen all day. Thanks for linking this. I nearly laughed out loud at work, which would have warranted a lot of curious stares..."
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,"That is my all time #1, favorite comedy sketch!"
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,Am I the only one who has no idea what the fuck is going and doesn't find this remotely funny?
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,What's a Tim Conway?
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,"///and by 'destroy', you mean, he didn't 'destroy' it?

Fucking hate kids.

Edit.

Sorry.  I've been pretty passed off lately."
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,[deleted]
A Little Help with Carol Burnett,"Ummm, yeah, I'm gonna be the asshole that says that this isn't really that funny.

I think people find it more funny because the actors are all about to lose it and that's why the audience finds it so funny. I think Laugh-In was all about that. People naturally start laughing when other people do.

I'm curious, what are the ages of the people who found this funny? I have a hunch that they're generally over 30. You don't see many reruns of the Carol Burnett Show or Mama's Family anymore do you? Nick at Nite?

I remember Sam Kinison hating on this. ""Mama's Family makes me ashamed to be white trash."""
The Durrells,I liked it too. Keeley Hawes is great. I also enjoyed her in Line of Duty in a very different role.
The Durrells,"I really enjoyed it and the 2nd season of Home Fires. 
"
The Durrells,"Recommended, 6 episode season has ended."
The Durrells,She’s fantastic in Line of Duty
The Durrells,So true! Kinda wish she would do more gritty roles like that because she doesn’t get much opportunity to show off her acting skills to the max. Line of Duty really showed what she’s capable of.
The Durrells,*The* most underrated show in the U.S. for my money. I love The Durrells man. Anxiously awaiting the final season. But also dreading there being no more to watch
The Durrells,"You can watch it all on dailymotion, someone has uploaded the entire series https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x75fhsj"
The Durrells,"Best I can find is a PBS affiliate blog saying ""the fall"" if the usual pattern holds.

Oh, and S4 is the end of the show, in case you hadn't read that news yet."
The Durrells,Great! Thanks.
The Durrells,"Thanks for the info.

>S4 is the end of the show

Yes, I was aware. Four seasons is about right. Besides, the actor playing Gerry will be sprouting up to be taller than his brothers, I'd wager."
The Durrells,"And Keeley Hawes' and Josh O'Connor's careers are blowing up at the moment, too"
The Durrells,Keeley Hawes is finally getting the regular work she deserves! She’s literally getting cast left right and centre! Saw yesterday she’s joined the Netflix Rebecca remake! She’s superb and the world needs to know 👍
The Durrells,In other news this show is great! And my foreign TV discovery abilities are still shit — why hadn't heard of this before now?!
The Durrells,"Because you don't watch *Masterpiece* on PBS?  Or, because you got it confused with the 2005 TV movie or 1987 adaptations of *My Family and Other Animals*? :D"
The Durrells,"I love this show so much. Now, to wait until the final season comes to the U.S. via PBS. One one hand I want to watch it right now. On the other I don't want it to be over, and once I've seen it there won't be any more of it!

Anyways, if anyone's curious the first two seasons are on Amazon in the U.S. It's a light, wonderful, hilarious show. Starring Keeley Hawes, Josh O'Connor and more. Edit: Yes, I'll gleefully and shameless be an amateur shill for this show as long as I can."
The Durrells,"I watch a lot of PBS, but the video.pbs.org interface is horrible. I wish it was more like netflix... even though I donate to PBS every month, I still find myself watching more PBS shows on Netflix than PBS itself."
The Durrells,"Does it have Globe Trekker? 

Sadly PBS doesn't seem to broadcast it anymore"
The Durrells,Does it have masterpiece?
The Durrells,[deleted]
The Durrells,All of the Ken Burns docs as well.
The Durrells,You forgot Downton Abbey.
The Durrells,Does it it have new content as it airs and does it have Nova and Frontline
The Durrells,"I have a similar subscription, for what's basically the Dutch version of PBS. There are so many great series on there. A boat load of Scandinavian detectives, British detectives, and *all* the good Dutch content."
The Durrells,"i watched all Beecham House yesterday, i really liked it until the last episode. It was really strong, but i really dislike that they use contemporary paper for these shows, really takes me out of it. I liked Vienna Blood (c.1900s Vienna) which is on passport. Plus the PBS digital studios have some interesting shows, like 'Say it Loud'. And PBS news hour has a lot more content on their youtube page throughout the day."
The Durrells,"Oh, I agree.  The fact that they don't hold the spot you stopped watching and just recently automatically started playing the next episode (rather than having you search for it) is pretty bad, but the content is worth it, I think.  They'll get there as more people sign up."
The Durrells,"Do you mean the website? I never use it... but man, they have one of the best streaming apps out there so your comment seems crazy to me."
The Durrells,"Yeah, lot of them.  Not all historically, but a good selection."
The Durrells,You recorded 30 years of content?  Wow.
The Durrells,Where?  It seems like only the most current one is available.
The Durrells,"Most of the Burns docs are (or were, I haven't checked lately) already on Netflix."
The Durrells,"Well, all of DA is on Prime too."
The Durrells,"The Masterpiece series will let you watch the entire thing usually once the first episode airs on regular TV.  I've already finished Beecham House.  With Ken Burns Vietnam, it gave you access to the first 5 once the first one aired and then the rest once episode 6 aired.  And yes, Nova and Frontline are usually on there but I don't watch them on TV so I don't know how soon they're posted."
The Durrells,I’ve never had that happen. The app is so great. I only use it on Apple TV tho. Maybe it sucks on other platforms...
The Durrells,Most of the recent stuff from a quick look is there.
The Durrells,[deleted]
The Durrells,"Sounds pretty good, thank you!"
The Durrells,Lol. Wow. So you have 30 years of pbs recorded on your dvr?! THATS AMAZING.
The Durrells,[deleted]
The Durrells,That’s a super good reason to suggest people not support PBS and subscribe. Thanks for your valuable input friend!
The Durrells,"Loved the Durrells! Try Howards End, Sandition & Vienna Blood all from PBS, all wonderful series!  Good continued luck on your post recovery. I'm going in for a Total Hip Replacement in a month or two😉"
The Durrells,"I loved the Durrells.

I would try the Detectorists.  It’s a perfect show."
The Durrells,"If you like bone-dry humor and quirky characters and can keep up with British accents, check out the super underrated show W1A on Netflix.  It stars Hugh Bonneville as the new Head of Values for the BBC on his first day, and it's narrated by David Tennant."
The Durrells,"The Durrells is fantastic. One of my favorite shows, and one of the funniest things on TV. The definition of a feel-good show.

P.S. I think there's a Durrells fan or two in the Brooklyn Nine-Nine writers room, as Holt is described as a fan as well."
The Durrells,"I've never been a BBC/PBS/Masterpiece person, or even a straight drama person for that matter. But Durrells in Corfu absolutely sucked me in. It's so chill while also being intensely.... something. I find it hilarious, despite the fact that it's really not supposed to be. I love everything about it, but at the same time I can't pinpoint why. 

It's like being sucked into a vibe or a screensaver or elevator music. There's nothing to it, but it's also blowing my mind. The comparison I made for my wife was if Frodo and Sam had a show about living in the Shire and ignoring the rest of Middle Earth - nothing big or relevant to the rest of the world happens, just charming people in beautiful country going about their lives."
The Durrells,Glad to hear others loved this show as much as I did. I was sad when it ended. One of my favorite shows in recent memory.
The Durrells,"If you liked the Little Women miniseries, definitely check out Call The Midwife. It's a great, heartwarming series by the same writer/creator, Heidi Thomas. It takes place in the 50's/60's and has a very sentimental, nostalgic feel to it. Also, based on your preferences, I think you'd really enjoy Last Tango in Halifax. It's one of my favorite British shows with a fantastic cast and a really incredible story about a family that's been thrown a bunch of curveballs all at once and how they all deal with it. I actually binged 3 seasons of the show in one weekend."
The Durrells,If you enjoyed Durrells in Corfu you should checkout Lark Rise to Candleford. It’s about the people in a small british town who run a post office. It’s very charming and has some great characters.
The Durrells,"Detectorists is the apex for me. I hope to find a show as good someday. Already had Durrell’s on my watchlist, look forward to trying it."
The Durrells,"Also Twenty Twelve, Hugh Bonneville plays the same character."
The Durrells,My best comparison is The Office meets a beautiful PBS drama lol
The Durrells,I've had Midwife recommended to me many times and I've tried to watch it mamy times but just couldnt get into it. Does it take a while to develop? (I've only made it into the 2nd episode)
The Durrells,"Yeah it took me a few episodes but it gets really good. The series as a whole has some very sweet but also very heartbreaking episodes. It's definitely a tear-jerker. Also, the cast changes rather frequently, which keeps it interesting."
The Durrells,I’m only on season 3 but when I watched the newest season of the Crown I was glad to see the actor who played Larry getting higher profile work.
The Durrells,"I thought it was an adorable show. It's also on PBS, with everything else Masterpiece (if you like the Durrell's in Corfu then you will love everything PBS has)."
The Durrells,"And awesome. The great irony is that the brother who wanted to be a writer didn’t, but the brother who didn’t care about school became a celebrated author. Lovely series."
The Durrells,I haven't seen the tv series but Lawrence durrell definitely became a writer. Is this not shown?
The Durrells,"The one that wanted to become a writer did [Larry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Durrell). 

The one that had a major fascination with animals become a renowned zoologist [Gerry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Durrell)"
The Durrells,"I think they mention him having published novels, he just wasn't very successful at the time. The series ends when they leave Corfu, in '39 I think. There's an 'After' episode presented by Keeley Hawes which shows what happens to the family later in their life, Lawrence being a successful writer and being considered for a Nobel prize."
The Durrells,"Ah. My bad. I saw that Larry was published, but Gerald wrote the books the series is based on. Ergo, I assumed that Gerald was the one who became a successful writer. Being a bitter failed artistic type helped me jump to that conclusion.

Is the “After” available on any streaming services? I’d like to see that."
The Durrells,"It's called 'What The Durrells Did Next', it should be on pbs and itv but those are region locked for me. But I just found it on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS6YcBMKHTY), it seems like the whole episode is there (until it's taken down)."
The Durrells,Thank you! I didn't know this existed!
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,"So this proves (again and again) that HBO has the recipe for good television drama.

Why can't any of the other networks figure this out?"
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,Nothing to add besides: I’m just really glad this show ended up in the right hands. Could have turned out very differently somewhere like Netflix or Paramount
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,I knew it was going to be big but jesus it could potetentially become HBO's biggest show if it keeps this up.

>The penultimate episode of “The Last of Us” Season 1 reached an impressive 8.1 million viewers on Sunday night.

>According to Warner Bros. Discovery, that makes Episode 8 the series’ most-viewed thus far. Previously, that title belonged to Episode 3 with 6.4 million viewers, though the company did not make data available regarding the audience size of Episodes 4-7.

>The 8.1 million viewers who tuned into Episode 8, titled “When We Are In Need,” contributed to a 74% increase from the viewership of the series premiere, which drew an audience of 4.7 million people and was HBO’s second-most watched debut in over a decade."
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,"HBO treating The Last of Us as prestige television. Great writers and creatives on board to adapt the game properly

Monogatari Series 2nd Season,"I've never played the game but I'm enjoying the show and it's been moving, but ""I got you baby girl"" is what finally made me burst into tears."
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,"I am watching this show with MY GRANDMOTHER. It’s so crazy to me that in this day and age we can bond over something of a shared interest! Me, knowing exactly what happens and seeing her watching in suspense is always a great feeling for me. She adored Sam and Henry and was like “I hope they make it through” when they approached the sniper on the street. I was just sitting there silently and she’s like, “you know what happens don’t you?” She was devastated but the >!bloater ripping the head off!< had her so intrigued, also realizing >!David and his group were a bunch of cannibals!< had her so hooked it’s amazing. Thank you HBO for creating something we could bond with in a way that I never thought!"
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,Bella Ramsey crushed it this episode. What a powerhouse.
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,That episode was INCREDIBLE!!!
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,I’m so glad Amazon or Netflix didn’t get ahold of this show. So refreshing seeing people actually give a fuck about the original material.
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,"Ever since I played the game for the first time way back in 2013 I knew it was one of the best stories I’ve ever been told and it just makes me so happy that so many people are experiencing this amazing story for the first time, I certainly didn’t expect that it’d come close to Game of Thrones/House of the Dragon which is arguably the biggest TV show of all time."
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,"Damn amazing number, shame it has to compete with the Oscars for the final episode."
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,"It was nearly a 1:1 of this section of the game, and masterfully acted. A+"
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,[removed]
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,"It's pretty good, I'll admit I had my doubts but the 74% is for sure word of mouth. Everyone around me told me it was 🔥 and now I'm suggesting it to others. It makes sense."
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,"I haven’t watched a single episode, I haven’t seen a single spoiler, and on March 12th I’m binging every fucking episode and I can’t wait!!!!"
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,Wonder how long it’s gonna be until other networks/streamers announce their own zombie/zombie-adjacent shows to ride the hype.
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,"This was a great episode.  I ended up rewatching the [video game playthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AaaGoWfOhY&ab_channel=CouchSoup) with commentary from Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson.  They did a great job capturing the story.  

Fun fact!  Troy Baker makes a cameo as James in the tv show!"
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,I remember the time when 8.1 million views meant cancellation of the show
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,ELI5: are people not watching the rest of the season and just watching episode 8?
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,Happy for Sony and Naughty Dog.
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,Been such a great show so far. The best video game/movie adaptation.
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,"As someone who was wildly impressed back in 2013 with the game and the story. I’m just as excited to see the show doing so well, people that worked on the show seem to have enjoyed their time together, and it has kept the heart of the story. Well deserved praise for The Last of Us."
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,Video game dialogues are top but I like how ‘sort of close’ they are to it compared to the game.
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,Netflix totally gonna pivot some shows to one episode a week. Their shows hit and the conversation is gone in a week.
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,"Amazing production for both fans and those new to the series. Not only did they stay true to the story’s themes but the deviations they’ve introduced seem to augment them instead of reduce them.

I can’t help but imagine if Henry Cavrill and Sapkowski were able to work with HBO instead of Netflix…"
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,And this isn’t even counting all the people pirating it!
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,"I was in the real town they filmed that in a few weeks ago, was cool to see it."
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,It’s sooooo good! Like sautéed portobello good!
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,It’s a good show
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,"That was an intense episode.

Having Joel up and running and killing 3 men seems a bit of a stretch when he was bed ridden minutes before."
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,[removed]
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,Good stuff
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,Best episode yet
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,"Forgetting the game exists, after watching the walking dead for however many seasons I got through I absolutely got worried they were going to stretch this ""villain"" out and then remembered it's the last of us lol. It was nice not having a drawn out enemy that just gets worn out too fast."
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,"I just want to throw out there that between episodes of TLOU, I started watching Station Eleven, another post-apocalyptic drama and I’ve never seen anyone mention it but if you haven’t seen it, it’s excellent. Very different from TLOU; slower, less action but engrossing. The base story is about an acting troupe that makes a living circling lake Superior going from one small community to the next performing Shakespeare. 

Maybe I just missed it when it first came out and I’m late to the viewing party or maybe it just got overlooked. Either way, if you are looking for something to watch when the credits roll on Joel and Ellie, it’s out there."
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,"Any recommendations for single player PS games that focuses on story and isn't open world?

I don't really have time anymore to sink it big open worlds, I love TLOU part 1 & 2 because the story is so good and so tight. Would love to play something similar."
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,"My only complaint with the show is I think they're going too fast. Instead of 9 episodes, it should have been at least 15. A lot of the moments in the game that in my opinion are crucial to character development and the development of the relationship between Joel and Ellie have been skimmed over, or cut entirely, and honestly I don't think the point their relationship is at in the show makes sense within the context of what's actually happened in the show. I think it would have benefited from a slightly slower pace that told more of the story. But that's just like my opinion man."
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,Ellie was a BOSS in this episode!
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,"Bella Ramsey did an awesome job this episode. Lots of high emotion and fight choreo scenes.   
  
And then I watched Pascal take care of a different, greener adopted child right after. Dude’s having a dad year."
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,The finale few minutes were pretty amazing in that episode 👌🏻
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,Some people are going to be real upset when it doesn’t drag out for 11 seasons like TWD.
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,This episode was the most intense 50 minutes of tv. Absolutely marvellous.
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,"As much as I wanna see the new ep so bad, I really thing weekly premiers are the way to go"
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,[removed]
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,RIP to all the haters that said Last of Us was B-tier story at best if it was filmed.
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,I am trying so hard to like this. apparently I'm the only one who thinks it's average.
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,"Every week, a friend texts me that The Last Of Us must have been one interesting game… almost as if he’s insinuating that what’s in each episode wasn’t part of a pretty rich series of games. And every week, I reply “yup, it’s a fantastic story that they’re adapting brilliantly!”"
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,"So lucky to have had such a wonderful adaptation of such a treasured game and story to so many people. I have my own nitpicks and I agree that they are having to speed through some sections but I genuinely don’t think people realize how good we have had it. Brilliant acting all around, showrunner who loves the source material, original creator heavily involved, original composer doing the score, beautifully shot — a dream come true compared to most adaptations (let alone game adaptations)"
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,Yeah I mean it's one of the best shows I've ever seen. Deserves all the praise.
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,"I love it. Theres a lot of content out there, a lot of good content even, but this show is great."
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,I love this show!
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,I'm ready to be hurt again...
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,what delicious numbers
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,10million by the end! Let’s do it!!
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,"I can't get the original game out of my head, but when they use a similar scene, it's incredible."
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,She went into beast mode and I loved it!
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,It was a great Episode!
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,Crazy good episode
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,This is by far one of the best shows I’ve ever seen. I love what they’ve done with it and how they make things a little different from the game to keep you guessing. Everything about this show is amazing. I’m so glad they knocked it out of the park.
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,"Bellas performance in episode 8 was incredible. 

“Tell them Ellie is the name of the child that broke your fucking finger!”"
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,Last night episode was so fucking good
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,Its really not that good..but i guess enjoy?
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,Episode 9 is gonna have more than 10M and gonna surpass House of the Dragon season finale numbers.
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,Why tho? That dialogue is ass
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,"Anyone else think it was way way over rated? I quit pretty quick. Episode one was good and sad. After that I thought it was lame and felt really cheap for HBO. 

Just my take"
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,Shit is so good
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,"my biggest issues with it are the 

1) goofy ahhh kathleen episode and the ending action scene

2) the time skip being in the new spot was altogether worse for the pacing and character development

3) the impalement scene was weaker in the TV show"
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,"They had to make up for episode 7.  What a, predictable, snooze fest that was. Ep. 8 kicked ass tho"
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,The worst part of this show is the astroturfing.
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,This Pedro Pascal guy is having a great start in acting. Maybe HBO or even Disney might give him more roles in the future.
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,"Sorry this show is overrated. It’s fine, but people acting like it’s the next Sopranos or something."
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,"It's a good show.

Let's see how they handle... Well... You know.

Honestly if they deviate for a bit it probably wouldn't make people hate them... But they gotta do it right... 

Either way, they gotta do it right.

Edit: Jesus Christ, what's wrong with you people. We're discussing a tv show why are you people so damn vitriolic. I didn't even state how I felt about the show doing one thing or another, just that I hope whatever they do that they do it well."
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,"I gotta say, I never enjoyed the gameplay of the original game, but I am loving being able to enjoy the story without dealing with the gameplay!"
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,"Lazy question.

But as someone that hasn't played the games.

Wil the show follow the entire game series and then just stop, or is it loosely based and will it divert from the games to create a season 5-6-7-8 etc?

If it's even known"
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,I can’t believe my eyes how insanely accurate the sets are. It’s incredible
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,Netflix so jelly right now.
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,What a fantastic fucking episode.
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,"Whatever the HBO recipe is, never change it. My all-time great dramas is like mostly HBO at this point."
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,"See, this is what happens when a production company makes an actually good show"
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,Love the show!!
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,"I see a lot of comments saying “see this is what happens when…” and crediting some cocktail of budget, faithfulness to the source material, etc, but really i think it’s just well-written and well-acted. The writers wrote a compelling show, HBO probably used many of the same technicians and film crew as they have in other successful shows, so that was done well also."
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,This was the best episode of the show 🥺❤️
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,"Such a GREAT episode 👏 


Well done , and I NEED more .
This is coming from a person that’s NEVER played the game before."
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,That end scene had me ugly cry
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,Well ! It’s a really good show for one thing ! And it’s really well made ! And the characters are amazing !
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,I just watched all of the episodes this week. The numbers are obviously because of me.
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,I’ve loved this series I do wish there were more zombies though
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,I've absolutely loved the show but feel they're making a mistake by moving things along so quickly in order to follow the events of the game.
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,"Don't get me wrong, I am loving the series, but am I the only one wishing there was more conflict with the cordyceps? It is like they skipped the whole first few years of the outbreak and went full bore into the Walking Dead equation where the main conflicts are coming from humans trying to survive against other humans with differing views on how to advance society as it fights to regain its hold over the World."
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,"Is this episode better than 7, my God that shit was boring. Just had to skip it."
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,"If they lost the flashback scenes with bill and Ellie.(make them bonus episodes inbetween seasons, it’s been done) and replaced them with scenes from the game they obviously skipped over, this would be 20/10 game adaptation.

Ready for the rate downs, fight me."
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,"One episode a week is the correct recipe. Giving each episode the respect it deserves. Just like back in the days shows…
Releasing a show like this all at once is a crime. We all watch one, talk about it and the word of mouth just makes it even more special. #hatebinge"
Monogatari Series 2nd Season,Well I hope everyone’s enjoying it at least.  I didn’t get anything out of this one.  Just seemed like more of the same zombie stuff to me.

Millennium,I thought the plot was okay but that final scene with Frank reuniting with his daughter chokes me up everytime.
Millennium,All i remember is scully and mulder kiss
Millennium,"It works as a standard MOTW episode. Zombies were never a presence in *Millennium*'s lore, though, so the Group's goal of suicide/resurrection was odd to watch. But hey, I enjoyed seeing Lance Henriksen play Frank Black again, even for a few minutes."
Millennium,Good lord that photoshop is TERRIBLE.
Millennium,"Shame there hasn’t been a good xfiles episode for like 4-5 seasons now. 

Should rename the past few seasons ‘old couple being grumpy with technology and the government’. 

And don’t get me started on the line gunman and their spin off, they were never meant to occupy a screen for more than a few minutes of comic relief at a time."
Millennium,"> In the mid-1990s, The X-Files creator Chris Carter was reaching new heights in his career. The X-Files was at the peak of its popularity, and the 1998 feature film was just around the corner. The only way for Carter to go was up, and so he developed a new series for Fox about a former FBI profiler named Frank Black (played to perfection by Lance Henriksen) who had an unnatural ability to see into the hearts and minds of criminals. The series, called Millennium, ran for three seasons, each unique from the last. For many, the second season was Millennium at its peak, and it's here that the show's iconic Halloween episode ""The Curse of Frank Black,"" which many consider the series' best, became a reality.

> In a season full of retrospective and deeply personal episodes that dive into Frank Black's psyche, ""The Curse of Frank Black"" is the absolute best. It not only chronicles Frank's continued struggle with personal obsession and responsibility, but it also serves as a very character-driven Halloween story that takes the holiday to new heights. Halloween specials tend to go in one of two directions, either they're cutesie ""trick-or-treat""-themed stories that are all about the Americanized version of the holiday (sometimes with a paranormal twist), or they're bloody horror shows that lean deeper into supernatural spectacles meant to frighten both the lead players and the audience. Unlike most Halloween episodes of television, ""The Curse of Frank Black"" touches on both of these tropes while not exactly fitting into either, making it a must-see Halloween classic.


A brilliant show that is still not available for streaming anywhere."
Millennium,"The entire show is a must-see classic. It's influenced a whole generation of prestige TV shows such as *Hannibal*. Incredible that such a dark, intense, artistically daring show could air on prime-time broadcast TV in the '90s!"
Millennium,That is a pretty great special and one of their best episodes.
Millennium,"Thank you for this recommendation.  I haven't thought about Millennium in a very long time.  A friend of mine tried to get me into it, but I never did.  I think I am going to give this show another chance, and I'll definitely check out the s2 Halloween special."
Millennium,"Biggie Smalls is the black Frank White, and Lance Hendrikson is the white Frank Black"
Millennium,"excellent recommendation!

loved this, was too young to really get it when it aired, but this is a great episode!

thanks!"
Millennium,"I don't remember too many particular episodes but one that made an impression on me and my friends who watched it at the time was the episode where the Devil appeared at the top of the stairs.

That was in a par with the Prince of Darkness finale and collectively, it transpired the next day, had us s***ting ourselves sideways."
Millennium,So this isn’t about the frontman from the Pixies?
Millennium,"I was just going to ask where it was streaming. Hopefully the renewed attention will help it get a pickup somewhere. 

You really do have to wonder why so many great shows just sit on a shelf somewhere, unable to be watched."
Millennium,For this reason I tell my wife why I'm not selling or donating my dvd collection when we clean our storage for yard sales.
Millennium,shit was dark and scary for 12 year old me
Millennium,"Funny you should say that, but I’m sure I read somewhere years ago that Chris Carter named Frank after the Pixies singer. 
At the time he went by Black Francis and Chris Carter swapped the names around to call the character Frank Black. 
It was only later that the Pixies singer started going by Frank Black. 
I could have all of that completely wrong though!"
Millennium,"Yeah, there are many old shows that I can't find on any streaming services. 

Night Gallery, Nowhere Man, Space: Above and Beyond, Earth 2, EZ Streets, Harsh Realm & many more."
Millennium,"Space above and beyond was my favorite show at the time.

It sucks that it got cut off at the knees.  Same with Earth 2. It had great possibilities, but instead turned into a waste of viewing time"

Millennium,"Tales From The Crypt

“Hello Boils and Ghouls!!”"
Millennium,Moonlighting
Millennium,"*Two Guys and a Girl* (originally known as *Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place*). It aired on ABC for four seasons back in the late 90s/early 2000s and was the show that introduced me to Ryan Reynolds and Nathan Fillion.

Ryan played Michael “Berg” Bergen, a Boston med student who shared an apartment with his best friend, Pete Dunville, an aspiring architect, and they lived one floor below their other friend Sharon Carter, who handled PR for an unscrupulous chemical company. Sharon would often hang out with Pete and Berg while they worked at Beacon Street Pizza. Nathan Fillion joined the show in season 2 as jukebox repairman Johnny Donnelly, who would go on to marry Sharon. In the third season, they dropped the pizza place as Berg graduated med school and Pete and Johnny would both become firefighters.

The show is not available to stream anywhere but, fortunately, I was able to find it on DVD not long ago."
Millennium,"Northern Exposure.   

I think largely due to music rights issues?  Not sure."
Millennium,Sci-Fi channel Dune miniseries.
Millennium," Boston Public. Can’t stream it, can’t buy it, not even available on DVD. Basically gone forever. It’s not a top tier show by any means, but it’s strange you literally cannot watch it today.

For a long time, this weird inaccessibility was true of a lot of David E Kelly shows, including The Practice, which in my opinion is the best and most accurate legal drama show of all time."
Millennium,"The Drew Carey Show deserves a second life. Not streaming anywhere though, and only the first season seems to be available to purchase"
Millennium,The Oblongs. I Can’t find this twisted gem anywhere
Millennium,"Fernwood Tonight

WKRP

SCTV"
Millennium,"Homicide: Life of the Street - it’s the precursor for Law & Order and The Wire, plus amazing performances by Andre Braugher and Yaphet Kotto among others."
Millennium,Megas XLR - fuck that show was amazing. I still have the theme song memorized.
Millennium,"Due South (1994-99) about a Canadian Mounty in Chicago helping to solve crime, along with his deaf wolf Diefenbaker."
Millennium,Stella and Strangers With Candy
Millennium,"Really wish I could watch whole Late Night with Conan O'Brien episodes. Hell, all late night TV episodes (other hosts) would be a treasure trove of interviews and laughs."
Millennium,The Whitest Kids You Know. You can’t even buy their DVDs. I can only watch clips on YouTube which is depressing since it’s one of my favorite shows.
Millennium,Xena
Millennium,Murphy Brown
Millennium,"One I would love to revisit that it is unlikely to ever be streaming because of music licensing apparently is the sitcom The Drew Carey Show. Great Cast, Good Writing, Went on long enough to have plenty of episodes but not too long. One of the best theme songs ever."
Millennium,Pete and Pete.
Millennium,"Real Sex. 

Young people these days can just google whatever fetish they like and have at it. Well back in my day when you wanted to wack off to HBO you had to learn something too! 

In all seriousness it was a great documentary series that covered a lot of taboos about sex. Given the severe lack of quality sex education in the US I'm surprised even season 1 is on prime."
Millennium,"Third Watch. Started in 1999, I think? Followed NYC paramedics, firefighters and cops on the night shift, and was just really, really good. It's not even on DVD."
Millennium,"The Brink. 

Black comedy about modern day nuclear tensions and international diplomacy starring Tim Robbins, Jack Black, Pablo Schreiber, Carla Gugino, and that’s just to name a few of the absolutely stacked cast. 

It had one season on HBO around 2015 and was renewed for S2 but canceled before production, no one knows why. Sadly, impossible to find now, in the US and on the high seas."
Millennium,"Growing up my family loved *Ed*. Had a stellar cast of Tom Cavanaugh, Julie Bowen, Michael Ian Black and a young Justin Long among others. Music rights mean it likely will never be on a streamer, but it was a great, heartwarming show."
Millennium,"Good call on ali g....

Also, Dr Katz and metalocalypse"
Millennium,"*Millennium*. If it were available via streaming, I think it would develop a huge cult following as it's very much in tune with the current zeitgeist. 

It was decades ahead of its time when it aired, with its avant-garde production style and concern with the themes of collapse, apocalypse, and eschatology, but those would make it ideal watching for today."
Millennium,"Muppet Babies (the original series). I know cuz of all the movie/TV clips, though I once read an article that interviewed one of the producers who was under the impression the clips were licensed “in perpetuity” but who knows, plus I could see the advent of digital media skewing previous contracts a lot."
Millennium,Millennium
Millennium,"*Once and Again* - an incredible blended family drama starring Billy Campbell, Sela Ward, and Evan Rachel Wood."
Millennium,The early seasons of the original Law & Order. I think Peacock has after season 13 but those 90s episodes are no where that I know of.
Millennium,Las Vegas (2003 - 2008).....can't find it.
Millennium,"For me,it’s a quaint NBC drama called Providence.  I loved that show and wish I could find it streaming somewhere!"
Millennium,Reboot
Millennium,"I'm going old school- The New Mickey Mouse Club aka MMC, Kids Incorporated  - at least MMC should be on Disney+!

And American Dreams and China Beach 

I think most of these are a music copyright issue thing"
Millennium,Mama's Family
Millennium,Also on HBO: Taxicab Confessions
Millennium,I tried to find It’s Garry Shandling’s Show a while back and couldn’t find it. Maybe it’s available now?
Millennium,"For anyone that's missing a show or movie, comment on here and I'll see if I have it on DVD. I literally have thousands of dvds in my garage that my brother stored but refuses to get. I was going to throw them out but I rather mail them to someone who will use it."
Millennium,Pokémon is extremely difficult to find. Yes you can watch certain seasons on Netflix but there is no legal was to watch every season from start to finish unless you want to spend ~70 USD per season.
Millennium,MAD TV
Millennium,Wonderfalls. DVD set is up to 50 bucks now.
Millennium,Orphan Black isn’t streaming anywhere in the US. Which is stupid because of the recent increase in awareness (because of She-Hulk) of how awesome Tatiana Maslany is. I assumed it would be on AMC+ like all of the other BBC America shows but nope.
Millennium,Dream On
Millennium,Northern Exposure
Millennium,"Early Edition isn’t streaming, but finally got a full DVD release.

So now I just wait for Judging Amy and Boston Public.  Streaming, DVD, Bluray, I don’t care."
Millennium,'That's My Bush' - practically forgotten Sitcom from Trey Parker and Matt Stone about George Bush in the WhiteHouse that came out in 2000 I think? Maybe 2001? People thought it was going to skewer George Bush but instead it skewered Sitcoms with the incredible precision those guys have. Its really great
Millennium,"God like 15 years ago there was a reality show for finding the next Danny and Sandy in the broadway revival of Grease and it’s been wiped off the face of the earth. There are clips of the challenges on YouTube, and the things they made these actors do look absolutely unhinged. It’s my life’s mission to find it in its entirety"
Millennium,Pirates of dark water. Cut down in its prime
Millennium,The John Larroquette Show
Millennium,Spin city. Really funny show that I can’t find anywhere
Millennium,The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd.
Millennium,"Evening Shade. Early 90s sitcom went 99 episodes with a great cast. Burt Reynolds, Marilu Henner, Ossie Davis, Hal Holbrook. You put it in justwatch.com and it doesn't even come up. It's crazy."
Millennium,Get a Life with Chris Elliot.
Millennium,"Yes, Dear"
Millennium,"Detroiters!!!

It was a Comedy Central show starring Tim Robinson (I Think You Should Leave, SNL) and Sam Richardson (ITYSL, Veep) running an ad agency in Detroit. 

Basically ITYSL humor in sitcom form.

Edit: I did not know it was on Paramount+"
Millennium,Anne Heche’s death had me looking for Men in Trees but you can’t find it anywhere. I loved that show.
Millennium,Insomniac with Dave Attell
Millennium,Early seasons of Law and Order
Millennium,Outside the US so i really hope some streamer picks up Columbo for streaming. Infinitely watchable and still holds up excellently.

Another,I think people forget how much laugh track is in that 70s show. I've seen a lot of comments around that That 90s show uses it excessively. I rewatched that 70s show not too long ago and found it comparable in terms of how much laugh track there is in both shows.
Another,"My wife and i are both enjoying that 90s show. 

Its not life changing but its a good just chill and watch tv show.

I guess the producers learned to use generic music to not have the same music problems that 70s show and Wkrp had. Its fun going oh this kinda sounds like Primus."
Another,"My only real gripe with That 90s show is the lighting. Everything seems way too bright and the shadows are distracting. I don’t remember that being a problem in the original. 

Other than that it’s nice to see the gang back, hopefully the younger actors get into more of a groove if they get another season."
Another,"The 90's show was just dumb fun. It was just enough 'memberberries' mixed with something fresh. It isn't changing cinema history, but its enjoyable if you liked the 70's show."
Another,"I just finished that 90’s show today. I liked it! If you’re a fan of that 70’s show it’s definitely worth watching. Kitty and Red are great, good cameos, just have to get past the so-so script"
Another,"Look, all I'm saying is if Leia turned 15 in the summer of 1995, then she was conceived while Eric was still in Africa."
Another,"Context from the article.

> That ’90s Show made its entrance onto the Netflix Top 10 for the week of January 16 to January 22, **after only three days on the service.**"
Another,Ginny & Georgia is definitely getting another season.
Another,"As expected this is the first week since November 14th-20th that no show has hit the 100,000,000 hours mark. It signals the lowest week in engagement for Netflix in over two months! 

Ginny & Georgia’s third week topped in raw viewership hours (87,400,000) but only hit second top in the more comparable equivalent complete viewings metric where it did 9 million. Which was a -46% drop between weeks 2 and 3. Analysts cite an over 50% week 2 to 3 drop as a potential harbinger of cancellation. At this point Ginny & Georgia looks pretty good for a third season. 

One interesting thing to note about Ginny & Georgia was the fact that Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos highlighted it this week in an interview by stating it did “very well” domestically in the US but was not great internationally. 

That 90s Show was the surprise hit of the week. Its 41,080,000 hours worked out at 10.6 million to top the equivalent complete viewings chart for the week! It is the first new 30 minutes comedy in ages to top 10 million in a single week. It also ensured Netflix had the one show over 10 million with G&G and Wednesday dipping below it and Vikings Valhalla s2 not getting a second week boost. Last week I predicted zero Netflix shows going above 10 million and That 90s Show has proved me wrong. Fair play to That 90s Show. The overall numbers are not great by any stretch of the imagination but I’d argue they are pretty good by Netflix 30 minute comedy standards. 

Not a good second week for Vikings Valhalla s2. It did 8.7 million (+1%). It is trending for around 24-25 million over 4 weeks which is cancellation numbers. Lucky for Vikings Valhalla fans it was ordered for 3 seasons upfront. This just means the third season will definitely be the final season. 

Wednesday only dropped -21% to garner a fantastic 9th week haul of 6.8 million. It is the gift that keeps on giving for Netflix just like Squid Game! 

Kaleidoscope (between 28.4-30.4 million), The Glory (25.9 million), and Alpha Males (between 8-10.1 million) finished their 4 week runs on Netflix. Very solid for The Glory. Disappointing but not a total flop for Kaleidoscope and OK for Alpha Males. Treason also finished its 4 week run be we cannot give an accurate estimate as it missed the chart in 2/4 weeks. It did deliver 21.5 million in the two weeks it did chart though so it probably performed similarly to Kaleidoscope. 

It was another quiet week for the other new shows. Woman At War (3.6 million), Fauda s4 (1.4 million), and Shahmaran (2.5 million) all charted with low numbers while shows with lower runtimes Represent (less than 3.5 million) and Shantytown (less than 3 million) missed the charts. Bling Empire New York (less than 2.2 million) just flopped and missed the charts. 

The big show next week is Lockwood and Co but I have to admit I’m not expecting it to do above 8 million. With That 90s Show also due to fade in the second week as shows with short runtimes tend to do I’m again calling a week where Netflix will not have a show hit double figures in equivalent complete viewings!"
Another,"I found that 90’s show okay… few things were off, but I would watch another season easily. I don’t think it’s 70’s show quality yet as even the 70’s show wasn’t that in the first season."
Another,"I didn’t watch That 70s Show but I really liked That 90s Show. I’m not usually a fan of these multi cam sit coms but as someone who grew up in the 90s it’s extremely nostalgic. Not just the references (which were smart in the appropriate for the time but modern audiences will still get them kind of way) but in the way it’s shot, edited, the way the sets look etc. 

I laughed a lot too- I think Sherri was my favourite. The kids took a couple of episodes to click but I wanted to see more of them by the end. If you’re “of a certain age” like me and are in the mood for something fun and lighthearted I’d recommend it even if you haven’t seen the original (from the audience reactions it’s obvious who is a returning character - felt a bit bad for Leia who came in to complete silence haha)

Edit- Looks like James Iha from Smashing Pumpkins wrote the music too!"
Another,"Pretty enjoyable binge, liked it way more than I anticipated. I was a fan of the original. I thought it was weird how they did the cameos from that cast, except for Chong, he was epic as always."
Another,These kids look too young to smoke weed
Another,Ozzie single-handedly drags the show down hard
Another,"I’m two episodes in, it’s pretty good for what it is but I cannot stand the Asian kid for the life of me."
Another,I think it’s fun.
Another,I really enjoyed that 90s show. I’m hoping for a second season.
Another,I've been really enjoying That 90s Show. It's not perfect but neither was 70s
Another,It’s far from perfect but I’m definitely loving that 90s show(as a die hard that 70s show fan)
Another,"I wasn’t expecting to even like it and I LOVED it, totally what I wanted!"
Another,"I was surprised by how decent ""That 90's Show"" turned out to be. 

I thought everything involving the original cast was gold! I didn't like the new kids at first, but they grew on me by the end."
Another,[removed]
Another,"I watched the pilot, went to that 70s show for a few episodes which helped me get in the right mood, came back to watch the rest of that 90s show and enjoyed it"
Another,All I know is that I laughed at the show and absolutely loved it!
Another,"The kids just don't have ""it"" like the first group. The original cast just seemed so natural like they weren't even acting. The new group's acting got a little bit better towards the end, but most of the time they just weren't very good. I am also still confused why they had to have two ""dumb"" guys that are really similar. Whyyyy? Really wish they had just created some new personalities instead of just reworking the old ones."
Another,"Only 5th, time to brace for that cancellation."
Another,Only 41m hours watched? Well looks like Netflix is gonna cancel it next!
Another,"Good, maybe that means they'll get a bigger budget for set design and costuming for future seasons."
Another,"It really stinks that Danny masterson is a piece of shit because I could totally see Hyde owning and running the Hub and being integrated in the show there

And if Lisa Robin Kelly stayed away from drugs, and dying, i feel like she would be the Sherri character"
Another,"I hope they can find a way to bring the older characters back more honestly. Their small moments were the best parts. The kids were fine but I think they're too young collectively. They're all 15-18 whereas the original crew was like 15-22 lol. 

Maybe they'll be better when they've gotten more experienced but as it is they feel a little awkward. Half of them were on Nickelodeon kids shows and you can tell by the way their timing is."
Another,"This show is worth the watch if you were a fan of That 70's Show... Red and Kitty are 100% the draw here.  The new cast of kids was lackluster.  Representation was the goal, not the acting.  I could have used 4-6 more episodes to try to find the bond with the new cast.  The guest appearances were all pretty good.  Also, it has been said before, but the laugh track may have been slightly overused."
Another,I went in thinking is was going to be another awful sequel/reboot series. But I really enjoyed it a lot. I really would want to watch another season of this. Plus Red And Kitty were fantastic!
Another,I thought “That 90s Show” was going to end up another annoying teen drama that makes them learn all the lessons and become better people but it truly does mimic the feeling of it’s predecessor and was truly funny.  I was going to skip but my husband put it on and I thought it was great.
Another,">debuts at No. 5 on Netflix

Well, it had a good run. Hopefully they get a season 2 to wrap up the storylines nicely."
Another,Is The 90s Show any good?  I watched like the first few minutes but the constant shrieking of the studio audience every time a member of the old show walked onto screen really grated me.
Another,Gina and georgia is overrated imo
Another,That 70s show Cameos were better than the actual show
Another,"I couldn't stand Ozzie, the over-the-top melodramatic, deadpan, gay character. I just don't think he had a reason to exist in the show, he didn't do much and his character could be incorporated into one of the _other_ characters to give them more depth.

I just think it would have a better impact on/in the show (as well as the LGBT+ community) if the lead actress (Leia) was gay or bi. Plus I thought there was instant ""clickability"" with Gwen as opposed to Jay.

But at face value it was a good enough time. More of a time-killer show but this was only the first season."
Another,Found it cringy and horribly acted.
Another,That 90s Show isn't Velma levels of bad but it's not particularly memorable in any way other than the cameos from the original cast. The love triangle thing they try to pull at the very last minute was VERY weak. The new cast doesn't have the same level of chemistry. They all just come across very cringy.
Another,I tried that 90s show but I can't get past the first episode. It's so awful.
Another,"That 90s show wasn't good. I wasn't a fan of the original either. The kids acting did not win me over. 

Also, I'm just weird and like to pick things apart. My example is the lazy prop design. When they get the tap for the Keg they are in a store with Doritos that have today's design... Not the 90s design othat Doritos was using back then. At the video store they had the new Sour Patch kids logo with the candy kids when it should of been the older design of the blonde kid. Also Jurassic Park: The Lost World was sitting on the shelf. That movie came out in 97... this was set in the summer of 95. I mean there were a lot more prop errors, but those were a few I remember. If you are going to make a ""period"" piece, you should at least go all out on the props and make them resemble the time period that the show is set in."
Another,Loved That 70s Show. Could hardly watch That 90s Show. Felt like I was watching Full House with some weed jokes.
Another,Couldn’t even make it through 10 minutes. The writing is awful
Another,"This show sucked until I got high, then it was okay. 

It’s missing something, maybe it’s legs, maybe the fact that the 90s is somewhat hard to spot in todays 90s revival that’s been in vogue for a bit."
Another,How many episodes are people watching? That's what I want to know. Slogging through all of them seems painful.
Another,Oy That 90's Show was horrible. Kitty and Red are okay but the original vibe is gone. The original actors who ran in seemed super forced. It won't last as a show.
Another,I could not get through the first episode of Ginny and Georgia. Does it get better? I wonder if I should give it another try
Another,"None of this matters, as Netflix cancels super popular shows constantly."
Another,The gay Asian kid steals the show
Another,Couldn’t finish the first episode
Another,Netflix Top 10 is a useless list.
Another,"Honest question, why is Hollywood always promoting gay Asian boys? It's disproportional to IRL stats."
Another,Uh... So Ginny & Georgia is one of Netflix's 5 biggest shows?
Another,Another show with the gey agenda shoehorned in
Another,how do people watch shit like ginny and georgia
Another,Unwatchable. Utter garbage.
Another,Are Netflix releasing streaming numbers now or is it just to showcase how successful their originals are?. I remember some creators complaining they wouldn't let them know how their shows were doing.
Another,Is Ginny & Georgina that good of a show?
Another,proving people will watch anything if marketed right
Another,That show is giving me strong “Girl Meets World” vibes.
Another,I liked it for what it was. But… can we just talk about Ozzie wearing the (2004 version) Phantom of the Opera shirt?
Another,That 90s is horrible. Show sucks.
Another,"First time I've heard about Ginny & Georgia, but from seeing what it is, ""Ginny Miller, an angsty fifteen-year-old"" yeah I don't think it would be recommended for me either, nor would I care if it was. 

I'd imagine most of the top shows I would not know tbh. There's so many of them crappy (i mean actually crappy, not just by my estimation) romantic bullshit shows/movies that do insane numbers. But then again, I like some shitty action bullshit too. So to each their own."
Another,"That 90s Show is going pretty bad. The kids characters are completely vanilla and the actors can’t act for shit.
They also forgot the jokes.

The fact Ginny is beating it and remains at no1 after a month illustrates just who is watching Netflix most of the time these days - middle aged housewives"
Another,If there was an award for the most unfunny group of teenagers they would be taking the prize. Not even Kitty and Red could save this disaster
Another,"I haven’t seen it but I’ve heard there’s no reference to Hyde, who was an integral part of “That 70’s Show” due to baseless accusations being lobbed at him."
Another,ginny and georgia debuts at number 1 again and still people do not think netflix is a woman tv station lol
Another,"Welp,  must be time netflix cancelled it, if it's doing so well......."
Another,I left it on and watched like 20% while it played the entire season
Another,I got halfway through the 2nd episode before I realized how awful the show was
Another,It sucks and it's nothing like the 90s were.
Another,"I remember liking That 70s show, but I couldn’t even make it half way through the first episode of That 90s show…"
Another,"Not that bad of a show. I never wanted to turn it off at any point, but it didn't scream anything special. I would expect for it to do well they'd want to do 6 month cycles sort of idea just to have enough 30-minute episodes to go with the ages of the actors.

Seasons for these are usually much longer, and it feels super short otherwise. If it was an hour long episode series, then I would see the justification of just 10."
Another,"I watched it, mostly out of nostalgia and wasn't impressed"
Another,I just feel like they really missed the mark and kinda Disney-fied it? Shit was grunge and depressing and we liked it that way and talked about dying a lot and womens empowerment especially through powerful women singers and too much black eyeliner that always looked like you slept in it and there was definitely weed and drinking.
Another,So it will be canceled in 3 seasons instead of 2
Another,"That 90's show is not good, sorry. I also did not like that 80's show either. Stop messing with the original. Next they will do a That 2000's Show and it will also not be good either."
Another,"Red and Kitty are a delight, but the rest is atrocious."
Another,"That 90s show was way better than I expected. I was not expecting much, but it got me to watch the entire season. I did enjoy it, and I am sure the characters will grow on me if it continues. My only gripe was age of the teenagers and not expanding personalities a little more. Jay and Nate are too similar. The girls are fine sometimes a little much, Ozzie needs time to expand a bit. He’s just kind of the deadpan silence breaker right now. Would like to see him expand a bit. Show wasn’t amazing but I can see myself sticking around for more."
Another,"That '90s Show was really good; I just wish it was 22 episodes long rather than 10. It feels over before it's even began.

Hopefully it ends Netflix's sitcom dry spell; if you can call it a dry spell as remained unbroken since their inception. Even Kimmy Schmidt wasn't originally meant for Netflix."
Another,It's almost as if both shows were taped in front of a live audience...
Another,It's a multi-camera sitcom. How do people expect anything else?
Another,"I think a lotta people fail to realize that sitcoms are corny by nature. The first season of any sitcom can be rough. When compared to the other recent Netflix sitcoms, that 90s show has been great. I couldn’t make 5 min in to that god awful blockbuster one"
Another,"I loved That 70s Show and the 90s version is almost a pitch-perfect continuation. 

I'm really enjoying it, but I think that comes from my love of the original. My wife who never watched it doesn't get it."
Another,"I feel like people look back on That 70s Show with rose-tinted glasses. That 70s Show didn't start out amazing either. 

So far I feel like the writing/jokes of that 90s show is on par with it's predecessor. It feels really similar to me. I think the style of humor just feels dated these days, but I enjoyed it for what it is. Not as good as That 70s Show, but good enough to be the successor (and to give the benefit of the doubt that it could improve) imo."
Another,"Yeah, I get the sense from some of the critical comments, that a lot of people just haven’t watched a multi-camera sitcom in like a decade."
Another,"Not a track, both shows were filmed in front of a live audience"
Another,I think the issue is the cast in the 70s show actually seemed to be laughing at stuff. In this the cast is over the top to try and make jokes but it keeps falling flat.
Another,"No one forgot, but That 70's Show came out 25 years ago. Laugh tracks were everywhere back then, so you just accepted it as a fact of life. However, in 2023, there's really no excuse to use a laugh track."
Another,I watched a whole 30 seconds of That '90s Show before I remembered I hated everything with a laugh track.
Another,"While I agree, I just feel like it was less forced in that 70s show. I couldn’t get through one episode of 90s. You sorta cringed and every showing of the original cast was like coming up for air"
Another,"Hijacking the top comment to ask: How did they handle Hyde? Was he even mentioned? It'll be forever before I get around to this, someone please just spoil it for me."
Another,"I think it’s a decent first season. They’ve got a LOT of room for improvement, but it’s not the total dumpster fire that some comments want it to be"
Another,"Yeah, just finished it. It was a show. I giggled from time to time. Which as it turns out was everything i needed from it."
Another,I was surprised to hear a Pantera song during a gym scene.
Another,">Its not life changing but its a good just chill and watch tv show.

Perfect synopsis. Watched all 10 episodes on a binge and it didn't change my life or anything, but it was a nice, lil show to watch while I had nothing to do. Nothing wrong with that in my book."
Another,">Its not life changing but its a good just chill and watch tv show.

Agreed. And in this era of so much ""prestige"" television... I'm pretty happy that it's just a fun nice show. Sometimes that's all I really want."
Another,"I mean there’s a lot of popular songs in the show, like no rain, groove is in the heart, I wish"
Another,I’m watching it in picture to picture on my phone and it’s pretty enjoyable in the background. Love seeing all the old characters pop up too.
Simon,"Black Mirror's Charlie Brooker worked in the first CEX tech/games trade in place. They started getting him to write cartoons for their adverts, which were published in PC Gamer, who asked him to do a few reviews too. Then he started his own tv review website, ended up writing reviews for other outlets, and several bunnyhops later, voila, Black Mirror. 

I think it's safe to say his background in games, tech, and the media circuit have all played a huge part in the show."
Simon,David Chase growing up in New Jersey probably influenced The Sopranos. NJ doesn’t have quite the same level of impact in the show vs. the settings for True Detective and The Wire. But it’s still an interesting backdrop.
Simon,Joseph Weisberg was the creator of The Americans and he previously worked in the CIA.
Simon,*Detroiters*
Simon,Stephen Hillenberg was a marine biologist before creating SpongeBob
Simon,After watching several sitcoms that take place “in Philadelphia” hearing Melissa ordering a “Wooder ice” on Abbot Elementary is nice to hear.
Simon,"""No country for old men"" and west Texas.

It was a pleasant coincidence that Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones were both already intimately familiar with the region and slang."
Simon,"Doc Hammer and Jackson Publick both lived in NYC for most of the Venture Bros production, throughout the years, the later seasons of which were based there.

Definitely has a ton of NYC specific jokes that most people who don't live there would need to look up to figure out.

Like, Col Gentleman having a house on Christopher St, or having St. Cloud repeatedly yep 'PENIS' while they were traveling down that same street, or the various subway/tunnel references - 

* ""I'm not even at Grove St yet!""

And

* ""Don't take the Lincoln Tunnel! It's rush hour! Take the Triborough!""

* ""Idiot, that goes to Queens! I'm the chauffeur, let me.. 
Chauf!"""
Simon,"Brad Ingelsby, writer and creator of Mare of Easttown. I have never been there but it feels authentically like Pennsylvania."
Simon,"**Treme**, Eric Overmyer lived part-time in New Orleans. And, this series is about New Orleans residents building life after Hurricane Katrina devastation.

From wiki

>New Orleanians waited cautiously for the series premiere of Treme, but quickly embraced the show as an accurate and honest representation of the city."
Simon,"Seth Macfarlane is from Connecticut and went to school in Rhode Island. He gets not just the southern New England accent but the cadence and way of talking. It's one of the few pop culture portayals of someone who says ""wicked"" but it feels authentic. But as somebody on the fringe of New England (being from Massachusetts I'll tell you CT isn't New England) he has a good outsider few of how ridiculous the region is as well."
Simon,David Lynch and Twin Peaks
Simon,donald glover (childish gambino) - atlanta
Simon,"I've never been to Chicago but liked the way the city was portrayed in The Bear. Lo and behold, showrunner Christopher Storer is from there"
Simon,The creators of South Side are actually from the south side of Chicago. So many Chicago-based shows are written by people who aren’t from Chicago and it really shows if you live there.
Simon,"Jim Gavin, Long Beach, and Lodge 49."
Simon,"Dana Terrace (creator of The Owl House) is also from Connecticut, and I can imagine growing up near a place called ""Sleeping Giant"" might have influenced the show."
Simon,I love that it took so long for The Boys to make it to the screen that the likeness for Hughie ended up playing his dad.
Simon,Kripke slowly rotating through the Supernatural cast. Who should be next? What should Misha play?
Simon,Absolutely love that Rosemarie is playing Hughie's mom! And Rob's been rumored for a while so nice to have confirmation.
Simon,Elliot Knight playing Tech Knight?  Hmmmm
Simon,"Oh, they casted god in the new season, sweet"
Simon,So who is Nick Frost playing?
Simon,"At this point we need a episode dedicated entirely to Supernatural.  Get Jared and Misha involved and release Soldier Boy for a bit.

Don't disappoint me Kripke!"
Simon,"As long as there's a plot that changes the status quo, I'm for it.  Last season, after everything, nothing happened."
Simon,Rosemarie Is Hughie's Mom?
Simon,I’m going to guess Elliot Knight will be playing the new version of Black Noir going forward.
Simon,Love this show.
Simon,I feel like Rosemarie DeWitt was in a ton of films for awhile then just disappeared. She's an excellent actress so this is cool.
Simon,Gaz and Farah reunites
Simon,Maybe they will let Pegg be more than just a prop.
Simon,I’m excited but I feel like Hughie’s Dad might be dying this season
Simon,"I’m gonna lose my mind if Hughes dad is going to be wearing the same frigging ugly wool pull-over sweater. Besides the funeral scene of season 1, it seems he has been in the same clothes."
Simon,I think this has high potential to be the best season of the boys
Simon,"Can someone explain about s3 when the girl try to suicide by jumping from top of building then homelander show up.

Is this set up for homelander so he could look like saving him or the girl really want to suicide...?"
Simon,"I still need to finish the rest of last season. I lost interest after the stupid superhero orgy episode and found other things to watch. Huey being a dick to plastic surgery girl and Butcher being a dick to what was basically his stepson got old and I stopped giving a shit what happened to anyone, frankly."
Simon,"I don’t get why they cast Simon Pegg, he doesn’t look like the actor who plays his son and he doesn’t appear enough to have a character ‘because he is a star.’"
Simon,Yay for Rob!
Simon,I couldn’t care about anyone other than homelander. ‘The boys’ the crew is stank. Also the tired ‘current trends’ writing is hokey and not engaging.
Simon,Season 3 was good but hopefully they chill a bit on the social justice preachy stuff
Simon,Semen Pigg
Simon,no offense but this show is trash
Simon,Yay to Chuck Shurley aka Carver Edlund aka GOD
Simon,"The likeness? Genuinly asking, am I just a dum-dum or something cuz I have no idea what your trying to say but I wish I did"
Simon,"Fun fact, the actor who plays Hughie also plays Boilmer on Lower Decks. He’s set to make an appearance in Strange New Worlds Season 2."
Simon,I’m surprised Felicia Day hasn’t shown up as like a TV host or something yet.
Simon,Misha and Jared have to show up at some point
Simon,"Misha, Jared, and both Marks (Lucifer and Crowley)"
Simon,Didn’t Misha Collins become a MAGA psycho?
Simon,"Elliot Knight has also been publicly hanging with the cast a lot recently, so also not a surprise there"
Simon,Jeffrey Dean Morgan is most likely playing Tek-Knight.
Simon,If he doesn’t play GOD…. we riot
Simon,He’s playing left…out. /s
Simon,"No. I liked Supernatural, but let's not do that fanfiction shit that they did for... 7? 8? seasons after the show actually ended at season 5 on The Boys too."
Simon,Exactly my take. All the build up season long and things are back to how it was at the beginning of season 3 basically.
Simon,"Nah, Nate Mitchell is returning and will be playing the new Black Noir."
Simon,So Hughies parents don’t show up until much later in the comics. Hughie goes home for a whole arc so I’d say moving forward they’ll have a juicier role for Pegg.
Simon,From what I remember it was real and Homelander was basically told go save that girl it's good for PR. Only it didn't turn out so well lol.
Simon,"Honestly if you thought the Herogasm episode was “stupid,” I’m going to just suggest this show is not really for you"
Simon,He was the basis for comics Hughie so it’s likely just a legacy type casting
Simon,You’re exactly the type that they are poking at and making fun of with this show. The lack of self awareness is always hilarious.
Simon,Are you even watching the same show? It’s entirely predicated on addressing contemporary social and political issues through overt metaphors.
Simon,Hughie in the comics looks exactly like Simon Pegg
Simon,canonically hughie is a bottom but simon pegg doesn’t look enough like a bottom anymore so they cast jack quaid. hope this answers your question!
Simon,"Yeah, I think that's an awesome idea but I wish they'd kept it under wraps, I feel like that's a huge spoiler."
Simon,"What happened to Felicia? I feel like she had an extra/cameo in everything like 5-10 years ago, then I never really saw her in anything else (I could also be dumb and just not paying attention)."
Simon,Has Felicia been in a show with the dramatic acting caliber of The Boys? I recall her more from hammy stuff like MST3K and Dr Horrible.
Simon,"Mark Sheppard is always so fun in everything he’s in, he reminds me of like a serious version of Laszlo (Matt Berry) from WWDITS in a lot of who he plays."
Simon,I'd love to see both Marks as well. Pellegrino a little more but both are fantastic.
Simon,My SO met Sheppard at Comic Con in Atl  a few months ago. He and I are both ass men.
Simon,No. Where did you get that idea? He is the very opposite. He has been extremely vocal that he is anti-all things Trump related.
Simon,"Can’t wait to watch him save earth by fucking an asteroid so hard it explodes.

The show is fun, but the original comic is… not good."
Simon,Figured it wouldve been too perfect
Simon,"...what?

That's not at all what they said."
Simon,Such a tiresome and predictable stance on Supernatural.
Simon,"To be fair, they cannot kill any main character until *that* moment happens — being >!Butcher!< >!killing!< >!MM!< ***/*** >!Ryan!< — given the first, second and third season finales all had scenes hinting towards the latter, I do believe that is the scenario we may very well see this season."
Simon,"To add. Same actor, Different in-universe human/character. Same suit."
Simon,"Okay, so when homelander show up, why the girl undoing her suicide until homelander need to tell her to jump. So the girl really want to suicide or she just treating to jump"
Simon,"Probably one of those annoying fans who ragged on that episode for not being as graphic as they wanted. A lot of The Boys audience have very surface level takes, like they'll hate on Starlight in season 3 because she was finally allowed to be confrontational and not just perfect but insecure hero girl"
Simon,"Yeah, its a cute easter egg for the comics fans!"
Simon,"I also think it's great (if maybe unintentional) visual storytelling that he doesn't look much like Hughie. The guy’s such a flaccid wimp that even his genes aren't dominant, making Hughie-Boy’s love-hate relationship with his dad and desire for an important exciting life even more tangible"
Simon,Which type is that?
Simon,"Exactly, that's the problem. More Supe Hunting, less preachy stuff the better"
Simon,Ahhh okay so I am just a dum-dum
Simon,He was modeled after Pegg iirc
Simon,"I mean it’s all right there in his name; Simon Pegg could *maybe* be a power bottom, but that’s it"
Simon,simon pegged 😏
Simon,"I mean… Both the cast of Lower Decks and SNW were hosting a joint panel, and I forget who it was, I swear it had to be Mariner’s VA/Actress who confirmed it without anyone asking right I think it was the actor who played Pike was asked about any other Future or Alternate Timeline episodes."
Simon,"She dipped out for a while to have a kid, she's started doing stuff again in the last year or so."
Simon,"I think I’ve seen her host some interviews and stuff for Netflix on YouTube, plus she has a Twitch stream.

I rewatched Dr. Horrible the other day and man it holds up well."
Simon,"She did just recently ""host"" the little god of war recap story they put up on YouTube leading up to ragnarok's release."
Simon,Just checked Wikipedia. Seems she had a baby in 2017 and now does mostly voice acting.
Simon,"She had a baby, and also she had a gig as a host of Mystery Science theater for awhile as well."
Simon,"she is the founder of ""Geek & Sundry"" which has spawned all sorts of stuff in nerd fandom"
Simon,She had a baby
Simon,"I think she does projects for Netflix Geeked, like the stranger things recaps/interviews."
Simon,Had a baby and is probably focusing on that
Simon,"She was a fairly significant character in Eric Kripke’s previous show, Supernatural."
Simon,Noble man.
Simon,I think another actor went full MAGA. I think it was the dude who played Lucifer.
Black Crows,"I can't tell either. It is really funny at times. In a way, it reminds me of the movie ""Saved"". You can't tell whether the creatirs love or hate the people they're writing about.
"
Black Crows,here's an L for you   ;)
Black Crows,Why is it controversial?
Black Crows,"From [an article](http://gulfnews.com/news/mena/syria/ramadan-show-about-female-extremists-ruffles-feathers-1.2034527) I read, the Arab world doesn't like how it's ""dividing Islam"" and targetting Sunnis. The [Western media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwJm5zIBvl4) doesn't seem to have a problem with it though."
Black Crows,"I haven't had a look, the subject matter seems disturbing and scary.

Why would they feel it's dividing Islam? Is it targeting Sunnis?"
Black Crows,[deleted]
Black Crows,"I've only seen the first episode (the one posted), and I don't really see anything explicitly calling any particular group, other than ISIS, out. But ISIS is Sunni organization, and I'd imagine Sunnis aren't too chuffed about a TV series drawing negative attention towards something they're trying to disavow themselves with."
Black Crows,"What is an apostate?

Are Jihads specifically to do with Sunnis, or Middle-Eastern terrorists?

What do you mean typical shitty Arab TV drama?

"
Black Crows,"I of course haven't seen it, but am just curious what the problem with it would be.

Of course, given the atrocities that ISIS have taken responsibility for, it makes sense they would be called out and it's a necessary thing, really.

People need to stand up, despite fear and not let them oppress or suppress them."
Black Crows,"i'm on episode 3 and i'm really enjoying this show a lot! 
going by the few other threads i've seen about this show on reddit, it seems like i'm in the minority on this though. LOL.  it seems like most people dislike the show."
Black Crows,"I watched the whole season. I thought it was alright. Definitely not a perfect show but not as awful as you're making it out to be either. 

I liked the cases of the week for the most part because they gave the villains interesting motivations. I also thought the main cast was fine, maybe them meeting Leo was contrived but it never bothered me much as its part of the basis for the show.

What I really didn't like was the portrayal of Holmes and Watson. Just didn't work for me. In general, I thought the show could have done a much better job with their adult characters."
Black Crows,"I laugh every time the lead does her ""angry walk"". She always looks like she is about to kick someone's ass."
Black Crows,"I couldn't agree more. It has potential, but they need to replace the writers with people who don't just rerun every cliche in the business.

I like some of the actors and they do a pretty good job.

What annoys me most, though, is that they chose to take names from the Sherlock Holmes books who have nothing to do with the characters from those books. Why bother? Just invent some new names - don't claim this is inspired by Holmes."
Black Crows,">	“It’s dark cause London in pre-1900s were dark times”. Stop smelling your own farts and let the viewers see what’s happening!

I haven’t seen the show but statements like that one make any subsequent criticism hard to take too seriously."
Black Crows,The only thing I don't really agree with is that it's too dark. I don't like the aesthetic because it's very 'British TV set' and feels so safe and boring but I think if it was any brighter it would look even worse.
Black Crows,I like the show because of the diverse cast. First time seeing a badass Asian girl leading a group of teenagers! I'm willing to overlook everything else because of this?
Black Crows,"Then my dude please enjoy it, don’t let my critic stop you. I watched other shows and movies where others said similar things and it didn’t stop me from enjoying the ride (I.e. Tron Legacy)

I went into this show blindly and it was a “oh look what’s on the front page of Netflix. Looks cool and hit play.” thing.

This is the first I’m hearing that others have similar thoughts that I do. Does it get better?"
Black Crows,I can agree with this.
Black Crows,And she does kick people's ass lol
Black Crows,"I didn’t notice that. Wow so it’s a case of the writers and producers afraid no one will remember the characters unless they are named after some popular ones in the same type of settings.

Good observation there."
Black Crows,Then I’d suggest you watch 20 mins of it to see it yourself. Yes it was a silly comment but don’t throw out my entire critic cause I wanted to make someone laugh.
Black Crows,I’ll give it watch but it’s pretty boring these days to see people to demand all artist choices take a backseat to lighting and saturating everything like a stock photo.
Black Crows,"Boring to ask to see the surroundings and people once in a while? Im not asking to shine a light in their faces. 

Watch the Witcher. Way darker times, lots of blood shed, sexual encounters, monsters, misery, poverty & magic. Light when it’s needed to be and also dark but I can tell what’s happening. Torches and candles actually light rooms properly, reveal just enough to keep that low light scary feel and STILL retain the atmosphere “irregulars” is trying to capture."
Black Crows,">demand all artist choices take a backseat to lighting

You're deliberately overstating what OP said to be combative as far as I can tell"
Black Crows,"Maybe this is a TV specific thing? I haven't had any problems with the lighting, even in the scenes you're describing, everything was pretty easy to see. But I can absolutely see where it would be really frustrating if you can't see any of the darker scenes;  there are plenty of them."
Black Crows,Thank you my dude.
Black Crows,No problem. Some people just want to be argue. Don't take it personally.
Black Crows,Thanks for this! Very impressive work.
Black Crows,"Amazing work and fascinating read!

Question, is that last list Oscar winners making their series regular television debut or did you include those who are returning as well? Because your description reads like the former but includes actors that are returning to tv."
Black Crows,Am I missing Sam Rockwell in F is for Family? I love him as the voice of Vic!
Black Crows,"Thank you! The last list does include actors who have starred in a TV show before but the main idea is that these actors haven’t starred in a TV show after winning an Oscar. Furthermore, all these actors don’t have any experience in the current state of television (aka Peak TV since the last five years).
So for example, Brie Larson starred in United States of Tara on Showtime but that was way before her Oscar win and also before television became as big as it is now."
Black Crows,"You're absolutely right, I didn't know Sam Rockwell has a main role in that show. I will add him to the list!"
Black Crows,"You're absolutely right, I didn't know Sam Rockwell has a main role in that show. I will add him to the list! Do you know any other actors with a TV role?"
Black Crows,"Larson was one of the ones I was thinking, but Holly Hunter also started in a tv show (Saving Grace on TNT) after her Oscar (though not during peak TV).

Edit: I forgot, she was also in Here & Now on HBO last year."
Black Crows,"You're right, I did not see that while writing this post."
Black Crows,"No worries!! Still an awesome bit of research.

Are there any actors you’re surprised haven’t made the jump yet? 

Personally, I can’t believe somebody hasn’t nailed down Sandra Bullock yet."
Black Crows,"Sandra Bullock is [producing a series](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/sandra-bullock-developing-1980s-college-dramedy-amazon-1217198) for Amazon with John Legend based on her college days but to see her in a show would be incredible. 

I would love to see Ryan Gosling in a comedy series, he was amazing in The Nice Guys. He has no Oscar but nonetheless, he would be incredible in a series. I am surprised that Tom Hanks and Robert de Niro have not starred in a TV show.."
Black Crows,"What the heaven are you talking about?  Lol.  

It's not for everyone that's for sure.  "
Black Crows,It’s for teenagers. The target demographic of CW Shows. Literally references Riverdale. Maybe it’s just not for you?
Black Crows,can't walk into McDonalds expecting a rump steak 
Black Crows,"I think the original craze for it came because it's Sabrina! And it's a darker version of Sabrina than we saw in the 90's so it was new, exciting and kind of taboo (maybe not quite taboo, but you get where I'm going).

I think it's also aimed at teenagers, so you can't expect a great deal from it. I'm pretty sure that since the start of Sabrina back in the 70's she's just been a cool witch that young teens can look up to, and I think it worked with the new version. If you're going to be victim to it anyway, try and change your mind back to 12 year old you and see how you go :P

I haven't watched the second season yet though.."
Black Crows,I am mostly bothered by that the guys all look orange in these new set of episodes. It is either bad lighting or terrible makeup. Either way it is really distracting
Black Crows,"I agree. It got a shit ton of praise. I don’t think it lives up to the praise, and I think that even considering it “good” is debatable "
Black Crows,"Its, meh, its not bad because the actual plot line that it often forgets, I think, is quite good. The problem being it forgets it in place of high school drama shit. I have to say I LOVE the aunties. I think they're hilarious. I really just wish it could stop being a drama and become a black comedy."
Black Crows,Nice review.   👌🏼
Black Crows,"I gave up on it. I really enjoyed the first season, but I couldn’t even get through three episodes of season 2. The tone has totally shifted, and it feels like the writers were just throwing things to the wall to see if they would stick."
Black Crows,"I like the show okay, but I did have an issue with some shit this season. In the first episode of season 2 Sabrina just blatantly cheats twice and never really recieves any retribution for it and in fact it's played in this really ""it's okay"" kind of way. She casts a spell on Suzy to make her good at basketball, which just seems unfair. Then she cheats at her Top Boy test and gets called out for it but never punished. I dunno it's a weird message to send Teenage girls that it's okay to cheat as long as you are taking down the patriarchy. That's how you get things like Theranos ya know. Just because it's a woman doing it, it's still a crime and a terrible thing to openly encourage (which for some reason a lot of people lately see her as some hero). Jesus I sound old saying our morals are going down the toilet, but jesus they really are. "
Black Crows,Just because someone's not the targeted audience doesn't mean their opinion on a show is invalid. 
Black Crows,ikr
Black Crows,"The last half of part two is really good imo.  And made me appreciate the shit I went through watching all the episodes before it.

Episode six was an amazing episode with the introduction of the witch hunters.  Got away from the boring high school subject."
Black Crows,"That’s how I felt about riverdale ugh. I thought the first season was brilliant and then they brought out 159 plot lines, none of which hooked me "
Black Crows,"I also kind of had some moral objections to some of season 2. It has the story line with Suzy wanting to be on the boy's basketball team and the fact is she naturally sucked at basketball but then Sabrina uses a spell to make her good. So is it okay to just flat out cheat as long as it's taking down the patriarchy? Then Sabrina cheats in her three trials thing for the Top Boy competition. To me it's kind of a shit message. Like it's okay to cheat if it fits your agenda. To me that's kind of bullshit. Granted the show is filled with a lot of these kinds of moral quandries but usually they at least would have Sabrina see that magic just can't fix everything, or have her at least contemplate that what she was doing was wrong, but this just presents it flat out that it's okay to cheat like that. And considering the target demographic for this show is teenage girls I do think that it's a bad message to send. "
Black Crows,Just curious have you finished part two yet? Cause it kind of explains why she got away with it...
Black Crows,"Just because someone suggests a show isn't for them, it doesn't mean they're suggesting the original opinion is invalid. "
Black Crows,"I agree. I also did not appreciate that it was not until after sabrina made suzy cheat that he revealed that he was in fact male. I love trans representation, but he only did it after he played a good game of basketball. It rubbed me the wrong way. Also, I stopped watching because Sabrina has to literally complain about every single thing even if it’s logical and a no brain choice, she has to have the “better” plan. So glad I gave up on it."
Black Crows,"That sounds a lot more like a technical hiccup rather than censorship. I know my tv can do basically the exact same thing when the signal is weak. Also, i'm sure there's been much more 'offensive' content than a Kim Davis joke on HBO."
Black Crows,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XorMeVgEqQ
Black Crows,Same thing happened to us and also a friend in another state. Can't find any other mentions of this online - yet. Was curious. 
Black Crows,"i don't think you hire bill maher if you don't want him to say ""politically incorrect"" things :)"
Black Crows,[deleted]
Black Crows,"If OP *legally* has HBO, why didn't they first go to either HBO Go or their cable company's On Demand service to check if the problem wasn't on their end before running on here to cry ""Censorship!!!."" That's the most logical answer in this day & age. 

Yesterday my playback of an old *Survivor* episode abruptly became a jumble of digital noise. By OP's logic, someone is trying to hide if Rodger or Elizabeth got voted off (it's the summer and I've run out of shit to watch while I read the paper, okay?)

Oh, wait - OP is actually trying to drive up the 3+ numbers for the show. Nicely played, sir, nicely played..."
Black Crows,That's what I thought.  That's why i was just asking if it happened to anyone else.
Black Crows,Thank you.  Now i know all i missed was him calling Jesus Gay. No biggie (for me).  Online version is interruption free.
Black Crows,"Jump to 4:40 to see the missing bit.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XorMeVgEqQ&feature=youtu.be&t=283"
Black Crows,Same thing happened to me in NorCal.
Black Crows,He watches Bill Maher.
Black Crows,"I guess you've never had the experience of certain parts of shows going black or to dead air so they wouldn't offend certain people. 

That's why i'm asking if it happened to anyone else, I could have just had a weak signal at the time, and it cut out, and its just coincidence that it lasted as long as the joke. But, If it was censored, I really want to know what was said, cause it sounded funny."
Black Crows,I don't know either way - just curious. Seems that it wasn't a local feed problem. No harm in asking. 
Black Crows,"More like I was too lazy to get on the phone with Rogers customer support at 7 am on a Saturday to find out why 30 seconds of show was missing from my PVR.  And I figured there are millions of other fans out there i could talk to about this who have seen the show and could tell me what i might have missed or if it happened to them. So instead of wasting hours of my time with bullshit, I've spent 2 minutes asking a question, and 5 min checking answers.

Yes i used ""Censored"", because i wanted an answer.  On reddit Hyperbole gets results.  If i had said ""PVR blanked 30 seconds of show, what did i miss?"" I wouldn't have been given a youtube link to the full monologue, and i would have believed it was an issue with my PVR until the other redditers said they had the same issue.    

Lastly, having worked for Rogers in the customer service front line, they only find out about black outs and signal issues from cx'es calling in.  Then it can take up to 48hours to investigate the problem, specially if its just restricted to part of a single show and not the entire channel."
Black Crows,"Yes, I saw the same thing happen. I assume there was an issue with the live feed.  HBO doesn't censor things. "
Black Crows,"Then it definitely was an issue with the live feed, as the online version would be the tape. "
Black Crows,"But it took you as long to post that question as it would have taken me to simply reload the episode, fast forward to the trouble spot and find out. "
Black Crows,Ya..well....shut up. ;P
Black Crows,"Well, I don't agree with ALL the nominations, I think this is a pretty good list! I think Pedro Pascal had better win best reoccurring character! And again, I would have included GoT in Best Television Show (I mean, come on! Season 4 was the best season yet!) I do agree that True Detective and The Returned are awesome nominations. Can't wait for the final results.  "
Superstition,"I was in the USAF stationed in Italy back in the early 80's. A family member sent me a VHS tape of just Beverly Hillbillies episodes. After watching it I wrote my name on it and gave it to a coworker. That tape went from person to person for quite a while. For a couple of years people would come up to me, thank me and tell me they had passed it on. Good times, thanks for sending me down memory lane!"
Superstition,I remember one episode where the grandmother thought the president was Jefferson Davis.
Superstition,"There are two very good eps I particularly enjoy:  

[Manhattan Hillbillies](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0522541/) - A trip to New York, encountering two Irish beat cops in Central Park, played by Sean McClory and Sammy Davis Jr.

[Robin Hood and the Sherrif](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0522555/) - ""You say your granny smokes *crawdads*?"""
Superstition,Well said.  My family all comes from West Virginia so it was a favorite in my household growing up.
Superstition,Still fucking hilarious to this day!
Superstition,"The show was especially great in its early b&w days and got huge ratings. The first two seasons averaged 57 million viewers each episode. I believe it is the only comedy series to be #1 in the season ratings in its first year. (Laverne & Shirley debuted at #1 but ranked third in its first season.)

The most-watched half-hour episode of a TV show aired in 1964. ""The Giant Jackrabbit"" was watched by 65% of the people in the US with TV sets. It was no doubt helped by the fact that President Johnson's State of the Union address, his first since Kennedy's assassination, was the lead-in, but still. 

Until the Super Bowls regularly started drawing huge numbers, several episodes of Beverly Hillbillies were on the 20 most-watched broadcasts of all time list."
Superstition,"Of all the ""rural"" shows, this one was by far the best.  Managing to put the Clampetts in a lot a different situations and not just repeating themselves"
Superstition,Am I misremembering or did almost every episode involve the bank guy/financial advisor/investment guy and his secretary trying to scam the family or something?
Superstition,I thought the movie was solid and excellently casted
Superstition,"I had a problem watching this show when I was younger, because I took their hillbilly behavior at face value, and would simply be mad at them for not realizing that they look silly. Like why even go to California or Beverly Hills if not to seek a change in how you live?

And it always felt like they were demanding things. That the bankers were the ones who were being treated badly.

So I finally came across a few episodes on MEtv about a month ago, and I didn't take it so seriously. And that's when I noticed that there's quite of a bit of spicy innuendo for a tv show from the 60's. And I noticed that the Bank guy is a bit of a greedy jerk at times, who will subject his assistant to do demeaning things to keep the Clampetts happy. And there's quite a bit of slapstick that was pretty good for the time.

The movie made it more clear that Jed would have been perfectly fine never leaving the Ozarks, but he did it because he wanted to give his daughter a better life."
Superstition,"It was mocking white southerners, but no one cared. 

Rednecks love redneck jokes. 

CBS cancelled it because it wanted to become a classy network. Its ratings were always high."
Superstition,I still refer to the pool as the seamint pond.
Superstition,"Wasn't that long ago that they had the pilot and first shows on one of the far back cable channels.

Told my wife that new shows do not make you laugh as well as those did and they didn't rely on dirty innuendo, well maybe when Jed was talking about Elly Mae busting out of her blouses.

Also still enjoy the Honeymooners even though every one is a repeat."
Superstition,Def watched this growing on tv land or something. also I love the movie adaptation from the 90s it's super silly
Superstition,How lovely!
Superstition,Ouch.
Superstition,I'm surprised you had TV in West Virginia based on the documentary this thread is about.
Superstition,They must have liked The Real McCoys also. They were from West Virginia.
Superstition,"INteresting, did not know that"
Superstition,"Not scamming in the sense of stealing, just in keeping them comfortable in Beverly Hills so they'd keep their money in his bank. His secretary - Miss Jane - would sometimes reluctantly go along with his schemes, sometimes act as his conscience."
Superstition,That's the only version of the Beverly Hillbillies I've ever watched. I used to like it a lot when I was a kid but I don't dare rewatching it today.
Superstition,cement pond
Superstition,I've seen all 39 of those original Honeymooners episodes at least a dozen times apiece! Greatest show ever.
Superstition,"OTA are the way to go. Decades has The Honeymooners. There's also MeTV(M.A.S.H), Cozi(Colombo, Emergency), Antenna(SOAP) Comet (Dark Shadows OG)"
Superstition,"Cloris Leachman's Granny undergoing electroshock therapy absolutely killed me as a kid. And i still say ""happiness"" the way Lea Thompson does."
Superstition,Shoes we don't have shoes.  We gots TV.
Superstition,"MeTV just started running the Hillbillies at night, so they're in the early episodes. And it's on right before Green Acres."
Superstition,"Haha yes. also randomly today I was saying ""biig fancy car"" like jethro"
Superstition,MeTV is also showing Wild Wild West after Saturday morning cartoons now.  An hour of Popeye and Pink Panther followed by Tom and Jerry then Loony Tunes.
Superstition,"It's a crime that this show had been so forgotten. I would buy a blu-ray collection in a heartbeat. 

Keith David's voice is smooth as silk.

(edit: spelling)"
Superstition,This and Batman: The Animated series was my life.
Superstition,"**Gargoyles** first hit the airwaves on Oct 24th, 1994, and still stands today as one of Disney's greatest animated series. Unlike anything they have ever done before."
Superstition,"Wow, 21 years ago. That seems unbelievable! I still get excited hearing the intro!

Fun fact: Elisa, Matt, Xanatos, and other humans would be 21 years older, but the gargoyles would only be 10.5 years older."
Superstition,"Oh man! i remember this show, some great memories coming back.  I can remember ""playing"" this with my pals.  We would cover ourselves in pieces of styrofoam and bust out as we became gargoyles.  Simpler times then."
Superstition,"Gargoyles had a killer lineup of voices. 

I watched this in college, and it was a game to see which Star Trek actor would appear next:

This had Jonathan Frakkes, Martina Sirtis, Michael Dorn, Nichelle Nichols, Brent Spiner, Kate Mulgrew, LeVar Burton, Avery Brooks, and Colm Meaney."
Superstition,"Incredible cast and writing. Amazing timeless stories. Best television show of my childhood, and one I still revisit at least once a year. "
Superstition,"DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN DUUUUN DUN DUN DUN! 

I still have the Gargoyles video game for sega genesis that I play occasionally. I wish I still had my coloring books and action figures =*(.

At least Greg still gets to write cool stuff? I just wish Gargoyles would get the writing and art it deserves... ugh I have some of those comics from the 2000s and they were a mess. "
Superstition,"Do you guys not know that it's all on youtube now?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSfVzu7L-_w&list=PLiOK3y1JyTyROSmYcq4N5la2z0chRnK53"
Superstition,"Jesus this nostalgia hit like a ton of bricks.

Did anyone else have the DVD that came with a little boardgame? I used to eat that shit up."
Superstition,Everything i know about Shakespeare i learned from this show.
Superstition,"I revel in how many shows I've forgotten, and then have been reminded of by the Internet. It's like finding a long lost part of yourself, remembering what was important to you when you were young."
Superstition,"**""I have been denied everything---even my revenge!""**

Watched first two episodes to make sure I had it right. Gives me chills every time.

Wish I could watch Pirates of Dark Water now."
Superstition,"This show will always hold a special place in my heart as it is one of the few memories I have left of a dearly departed friend :\

I moved to a new town when I was 5 and had trouble making friends due to the fact I was extremely tall for my age and others were scared of me. Pretty much the only friend I made in kindergarten for a while was a kid named Willy who I remember as being pretty small kid, the biggest and smallest kids in the class were friends.

 I distinctly remember that we played two games, one was pretending we were power rangers and the other was Gargoyles where I was pretty much always Goliath and he was either Brooklyn or Lexington and we would fight invisible baddies. After the kids saw Willy and I playing together I think they started to come around and realize I wasn't so scary. He was my first friend in that town and he was a good one. That summer he died in a car crash when his mother fell asleep at the wheel.  He was a good kid and Gargoyles is what helped bring us together for a short time.

This post brought back some memories and I wanted to share them with someone. Thanks."
Superstition,Did Gargoyles have an overarching plot? I guess I was too young to notice it.
Superstition,"""pay a man enough, and he'll walk barefoot through hell.""
"
Superstition,10 year old me did not appreciate that show for what it really was. 
Superstition,"Everyday after school. Loved that show. Have the first season and a half on DVD. Great stories, lots of fun mythology and technology interwoven. Good times. Gargoyles, Duck Tales and Tale Spin made my afternoons! Wasn't a Rescue Rangers fan though."
Superstition,I had the Goliath costume like this one back in '98 http://i.imgur.com/OVZMXkb.jpg 
Superstition,"With all the terrible movies coming out recently, I'm surprised no one has thought to make this into live action. "
Superstition,"Okay, Reddit... Now you're just fucking with me. I literally haven't thought of this show in over a decade and a half, but this morning my son was talking about gargoyles with his mother and I just went on a nostalgic rant about the greatness of this series. And now here it is on my front page on the same day. 

It's times like these I'm convinced this is all a dream."
Superstition,Was anyone else really disappointed an episode didn't start after watching the intro? 
Superstition,All the episodes are available for free via the youtube disney channel.
Superstition,"As a 33 year old grown-ass man, Gargoyles is still one of my favorite things ever.

It's cheesy as hell but I still love the end of Lighthouse in a Sea of Time. ""The scrolls ARE magic, but you can't destroy them! They're Merlin's life in his own words! When you read them... they take you there. They ARE magic, Goliath. PRECIOUS magic!"""
Superstition,This show was amazing when i was younger. Still is.
Superstition,"All watching this did, was made me realize how old I'm getting :'("
Superstition,"In my kids playgroup this morning there was an Angela, a Hudson and a Brooklyn. I said it was like a gargoyle convention and i got a bunch of odd looks from the parents (the kids are all less than 2)"
Superstition,It kind of saddens and intrigues me that this post probably has more upvotes than the entire content of /r/Gargoyles itself.
Superstition,One of my customers in the Wendys drive thru... http://imgur.com/obpQ5wk

Superstition,"This was a great show, thoroughly remember enjoying the fuck out of it when I was 5 or 6.  Had some pretty cool merchandise to go with it as well, I'm surprised it didn't last longer."
Superstition,"/r/gargoyles. It's kind of a dead sub, but always pleasant when I see the errant post on my front page."
Superstition,[deleted]
Superstition,By far my favorite tv show growing up.  All because Will Ryker was the villain.....
Superstition,I would support a gritty live action reboot of this.
Superstition,"I loved this show, in fact my kids play with the same gargoyle toys I played with growing up. "
Superstition,I still have some of the toys in my parent's basement!
Superstition,"I really loved this show as a kid, but I think I was one of very few of my classmates at the time who watched it. I remember I dressed up as Goliath for Halloween and very few people knew what I was. Shame.

 I need to watch it again. "
Superstition,Oh man I forgot about this show! My brother and I always watched it. And I never realized Keith David voiced Goliath until seeing this! Awesome nostalgia thanks for the vid.
Superstition,This show was so awesome! Right up there with Skeleton Warriors
Superstition,"Got just as excited listening to that intro as I did when I was a kid. Used to watch this show religiously!

When/where can we buy a collection of the show?!"
Superstition,"I never realized how good I had it as a kid, the 90s to mid 2000s were the golden era for Saturday morning cartoons. Skeleton Warriors, Mummies Alive, Biker Mice from Mars, SWAT Kats, Street Sharks, and Mighty Max, were among my favorites. So I pretty much loved them all. I don't even care that most of them existed to sell me toys.

What do they show now to my fellow kids on Saturday mornings? "
Superstition,"The episode where Oberon fights Xanatos is one of my favorite episodes of anything ever. Science VS magic in an all out, even brawl."
Superstition,"For those who don't know, the creators of Gargoyles got to continue the story recently in comic book form. All fans should check it out!"
Superstition,"Honestly, I loved the game on the Sega Mega Drive, it was awesome "
Superstition,"The first time I heard Commander Riker outside of Star Trek, weirded me out as a youngish kid. "
Superstition,I totally forgot about that show it actually was really bad ass. After school snack and Gargoyles!!!  I can't remember but I think there were a few cool shows that ran back to back when Gargoyles was shown.... I want to say one was Darkwing Duck?
Superstition,"It's a shame we don't have more shows like this on the air these days. Quality animation, a great story, amazing music, drama and mature plots.

We had Young Justice, but CN just wanted to sell toys and ""girls don't buy toys"".

We had Korra, but Nick was a fucking idiot and didn't even air the last half of the third season and just pushed season 4 online.

We do have Steven Universe, but it's only 10 min per episode. And we do have Gravity Falls, but that's a comedy.

They really ought to remake Gargoyles for a new generation. Call up the Star Trek folks again!"
Superstition,"Elisa Maza was my first cartoon crush, it was all about dat blue hair."
Superstition,"I know it would make much sense for you guys, but if you have a minute to spare you should listen to the Italian opening of this show. I still remember the narrator as one of the most epic voice of my entire childhood http://youtu.be/RfOBUA0f4qo"
Superstition,"I remember being at camp for the summer sometime in like 94, and this one chick was fucking balling her eyes out because she was going to miss the show while she was there. I was like... shit, I dig it too... but Camp Timbers is sick AF."
Superstition,"Heyo props to gargoyles for being so cool we forgot what a fucking nerdy word ""gargoyles"" is"
Superstition,omg...i have only seen a few of em back then..now i want to see em ALL
Superstition,Used to love that show so much.
Superstition,"The spell is broken. We live again!

Wait, no...back to sleep."
Superstition,I had completely forgotten about this show until now. I used to love it when I was a kid! 
Superstition,"i still have my Goliath action figure! :) i loved this show very much it fascinated me with the story twists it had good writing for a ""children s show"". "
Superstition,Jesus this brings back memories. I vividly remember watching episodes entranced. 
Superstition,"What a great show, it was interesting how so many Startrek TNG actors did voices for it. . 
"
Superstition,"About 7 years ago after Christmas I was saddled with a Best Buy gift card. I had just gotten whatever game or gadget I wanted, plus I hate the place, so I was wandering around aimlessly. Ended up a grown man with box sets of a children's cartoon. No ragrets.

But really, watching them had a lot of entertainment value beyond simple nostalgia. Not only is it still damn good, that was quite rare in 1994. Kid's TV wasn't meant to be a family experience back then, and most cartoons were too saccharine or too slapstick and would bore an adult shitless. This was the exception. "
Superstition,I had all of the action figures for this show...my parents threw them out by mistake. One of the best cartoons ever
Superstition,The nostalgia feels!! Did anyone else record Gargoyles on their VCR? Excuse me while I drive to my parent's house and search for the VHS tapes. Hopefully their VCR still works! lol. So many great 90s cartoons. Today's shows pale in comparison. 
Superstition,"just ordered the first season. I'm 24, and this was my favorite show ever when I was in pre-school. This is going to be great"
Superstition,Whoa. I think my balls just got saggier at the thought of how old I am.
Superstition,"I loved this show, and ""exosquad"" when I was growing up.  Both are forgotten. "
Superstition,"When I was a little kid sometimes I'd wake up at like 3-4 am and couldn't go back to sleep.  I'd sneak downstairs to the basement and watch TV.  For some reason there were always Gargoyles episodes playing, and it was fucking great."
Superstition,"Every time I hear Keith David's voice, I remember his lines in Requiem for a Dream. "
Superstition,"My afternoon school lineup; Tale Spin, Darkwing Duck and Gargoyles."
Superstition,"Michael Dorn, marina sirtis, and jonathan frakes. frakes was the bad guy. great cartoon."
Superstition,I feel old....
Superstition,Holy shit 21 years man this was my favorite show when I was younger. My parents got me some of the action figures from the show from Christmas and I remember I lost my damn mind. It's so nice to see other people have the same memories of this show. 
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"No wonder 90's show got renewed, 1.5bill minutes is excellent and looking at the sets and the cast it must be (relatively) cheap to produce as well"

>Netflix dominated the top of the Nielsen charts for the week, with Ginny & Georgia drawing 1.8B minutes viewed and taking the No. 1 spot. That was one of three programs to generate over 1B viewing minutes. The others were That ’90s Show with 1.6B and The Walking Dead with 1.1B."
Gegege no Kitaro 6,Pretty impressive numbers considering it's only counting two episodes.
Gegege no Kitaro 6,Any TV nerd that can tell us whether this is a good indicator or not?
Gegege no Kitaro 6,Never seen the hype for something die as quickly as with this show.
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"The actors is what is expensive. Almost all the returning actors from that show have had very successful careers and will demand top dollar for coming back. Even in a small role. 

But yeah the sets do look like they were lower budget so they made up for it there."
Gegege no Kitaro 6,I just wish it had more 90’s stuff. Seems very very light on the 90’s things.
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"Here's that list, rearranged by the ratio of viewing minutes (in millions) to total runtime:


Name | Ratio
--|--
That '90s Show |	6.82  
The Last of Us |	6.75  
Wednesday |	1.72  
Ginny & Georgia |	1.62  
Vikings: Valhalla |	1.23  
Cocomelon |	0.89  
Bluey |	0.70  
The Walking Dead |	0.13  
NCIS |	0.04 
Criminal Minds |	0.03

In other words, the ratio is how many (millions of) complete watches of the show occurred during that time, assuming all viewing minutes were part of complete watches."
Gegege no Kitaro 6,This lost probably triggers Reddit lol
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"> Ginny & Georgia

Who the fuck is actually watching this??"
Gegege no Kitaro 6,We know how much this subreddit loves Bluey!
Gegege no Kitaro 6,This is its first full week. Numbers are from the week of January 16–22.
Gegege no Kitaro 6,Why only No. 6 is what I want to know!
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"Nielsen numbers are delayed a bit while they collect and release them, so they always come out “late” and reference a time period that happened a few weeks ago."
Gegege no Kitaro 6,They just sing.
Gegege no Kitaro 6,What’s creepy about it ?
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"You aren't your kids, you're all different people. Just because you find something creepy doesn't mean they will."
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"Other then Cocomelon's weird hairdo, I don't see a problem. My 2 year old loves it"
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"I mean if they think that, no numbers will reason them. The Netflix is dying discourse has been going on for a very long time in spite of tons of numbers proving it's not the case."
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"It's not dying it just keeps getting worse

Edit: obviously it doesn't mean it is doing bad numbers."
Gegege no Kitaro 6,It's more like entire week viewership of episode 1 and just few hours of episode 2. since episode 2 debuted just before nielsen's window closes for the week
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"House of the Dragon and Rings of Power kept battling it out for the number 2 & 3 Nielsen streaming spots throughout most of their run, with Netflix’s hotness-of-the-week usually above them.  

I’m actually surprised it’s this low.  But I’m sure there’s some “too dark for me” reactions from some potential viewers (like my wife, who won’t watch with me because everything she’s heard about it is that it’s good but depressing.  Which I can’t really dispute :)"
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"It’s a home run hit for HBO, it’s trending to almost match HoTD in terms of viewership."
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"It's a very good number and we already know that other episodes had a strong first day viewership.

The show is a massive hit."
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"It's a healthy sign. This helps for network execs measure the success of a show, regardless of critical reception. Seeing that the count for Last of Us was only for 2 episodes and it has higher minutes viewed than Netflix's Wednesday with 8 episodes, it's an indicator that its good enough to compete. Will it be great? Who knows, to be uber successful, I would imagine the expectation at HBO is that it reaches the top 3."
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"Lol.  All the normies at work are talking about it.  Reddit is completely abuzz with it.  Discussion articles all over my feeds.

You just sound salty.  Did Joel hurt you?"
Gegege no Kitaro 6,Rings of Power says hello.
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"what? if you post something that is not praise in this sub about the show you got downvoted to hell.

and everytime a new episode comes out you have 10 posts arguing ""Why X episode is the best thing ever done since pizza was invented"""
Gegege no Kitaro 6,By almost all you mean just a couple of them right?
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"They were in a tricky spot since they were capitalizing on the nostalgia of that 70s show, so the entire set is basically still 70s themed"
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"I've never even heard of the top show lmao. I'll just hug my ""popular != good"" comfort blanket and pretend TWD can't hurt me."
Gegege no Kitaro 6,A lot of people.
Gegege no Kitaro 6,1.62 million people apparently
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"Because that measurement is only for HBO Max views so excludes HBO's linear viewers, and because HBO Max has far less subscribers than Netflix (which had the top 5 that week)."
Gegege no Kitaro 6,Its measured in minutes. Netflix makes all episodes available since day 1.
Gegege no Kitaro 6,Because it's in term of minutes streamed. So besides thos who watched it on cable you only have two episodes compared with people potentially binging whole seasons of Netflix shows 1-5
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"as the article says, this includes first week viewership of episode 1 and just few hours of episode 2 compared to 10+ and incase 100+ of other shows(except wednesday). I expect it will climb into top 5/3 next week."
Gegege no Kitaro 6,netflix has like 10 times the amount of subscribers
Gegege no Kitaro 6,If amazon and some other random sources is to be believed then apparently Rings of Power had a massive viewership.
Gegege no Kitaro 6,Literally all of the main crew are in it except for the guy that raped someone. That’s more then a couple
Gegege no Kitaro 6,Which is actually *very* accurate to the '90s.
Gegege no Kitaro 6,I demand a recount.
Gegege no Kitaro 6,HBO Max do represent the majority of viewings of HBO shows now though. I remember the first week we got the numbers and it was like 80% or more via HBO Max.
Gegege no Kitaro 6,10 times is a reach.
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"“Random sources” being the same Nielsen ratings that this article is about, yes."
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"Barely sniffed top 15 streaming shows last year which isn't great for a massive IP that also happens to be the most expensive show ever made

*yall can down vote but it's facts, look it up"
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"You’ve got to be kidding. The only “returning” characters from the original show are kitty and red. Pretty much everyone else is considered cameo, yes even Eric and Donna. It can’t be that expensive"
Gegege no Kitaro 6,Let me try and rephrase my joke a bit. By very successful you mean not very successful right?
Gegege no Kitaro 6,lol that's actually very true. My parents basement in the 90s was full of their 70s shit.
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"Sure, but they're still behind Netflix in terms of subscribers."
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"Quick Google looks like 3 times as many, agreed.  Huge difference but not hyperbole huge."
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"Yeah, could be.

Didnt bother check into it, but if people checked places outside of reddit then it does appear that rings of power was actually very popular.

here it turned into a contest vs house of dragons so one of them had to lose, weirdly."
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"It bounced between top 2 and 3 shows on all of streaming alongside House of the Dragon for pretty much its entire run, according to third-party Nielsen charts."
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"Donna and Fez are both in multiple episodes. More than a cameo, they're basically recurring characters. Eric is featured throughout the whole first episode. Jackie and Kelso had one scene, that's a cameo."
Gegege no Kitaro 6,Not sure why you’re getting upvoted as it’s fair to qualify their appearances as “small roles.” The point made above was that even cameos (which I’d argue some were more than cameos but that’s semantics) with those actors are all that cheap.
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"Not sure what joke your trying to make besides just being incorrect. Mila kunis and Ashton are both very successful. Ashton has been in a ton of movies and has another very successful comedy series with multiple seasons. Mila has been in family guy for 20 years and also multiple movies. Topher less successful but also been in many movies/series for smaller roles. 

The haven’t done much but those 3 could demand a high cost for even small roles/cameo. The only point I’m trying to make here"
Gegege no Kitaro 6,Yeah when it was airing. I'm talking overall year.
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"That’s the joke only a couple of them are successful not “almost all”. 

Saying almost all of them are “very successful” after That 70s Show is absurdly funny when it’s just a couple of them."
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"Being in the top 15 of all streaming content to debut in the overall year is a HUGE win for Amazon and exactly what they wanted for the show.  It’s one of only 2 shows on that list that aren’t Netflix shows, which is significant considering the pure numbers advantage Netflix has as the biggest streaming service."
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"Topher, Mila, Ashton, Laura prepon, Wilmer and even Danny masterton have had Good careers with all of them starring in very successful tv series after 70s shows. That is literally the definition of successful. The only two that didn’t do much were kitty and red. So yeah my “almost all” is 100% accurate and your knitpicking for no reason."
Gegege no Kitaro 6,Yeah it’s just a joke dude because 2 of them went on to be very successful and the others not so much. A fun little chuckle for people that wooshed right over your head and now you’ve taken it WAY too seriously.
Gegege no Kitaro 6,Where’s the joke lol it’s not a joke at all. You’re just saying false statements and then defending it with “it’s a joke”.
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"“Hey, you know that the USA is in Asia?”

“What? No it isn’t.”

“Woah, calm down, it’s just a joke.”"
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"PoI is a very tough one to categorize. It's a hybrid between procedural and serial. The beginning starts out with more of a procedural feel but that aspect is dropped as it goes. Some very important main characters don't get introduced until later in the show (Root/Shaw) so in a way the early seasons aren't indicative of the final product. By the end, the show has almost transformed itself from an investigation show to a hard sci-fi that deals with concepts about sentient technology.

I almost get the feeling that the creators were looking for a way to draw casual audiences in so they could hook them and then pepper them with the more philosophical ideas.

In a way, I might characterize the show as being similar to eating ribs. It's arguably too much work and mess for not enough good meat. But there's no denying that there is some real, good, unique type of meat there. I think these ideas are important things that people should be aware of and discussing as our society becomes more reliant on technology."
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"The first season is mostly a procedural - a well-done procedural, but not something revolutionary - but the big plot starts slowly building in the background and eventually transforms the show into something else entirely. I'd say it's definitely worth watching, but you might want to watch the first season - most of it, anyway - more casually."
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"The first three seasons are basically a realistic take on Batman meets government conspiracy. The episodes feature an A plot, a B plot, and a C plot. The A plots are usually baddie-of-the-week, but the B and C plots are extremely serialized and contribute to the overall story. (I think only two episodes in the entire show are purely baddie-of-the-week.)

Seasons 4 and 5 are more techno-thriller pre-apocalypse.

Both of these storylines are done very well, but it's likely that one will speak to you more than the other. I was personally a bigger fan of the realistic-Batman storyline than the techno-thriller, but I thought the show stuck the ending despite me liking the latter seasons less than the beginning seasons. However, most people on here tend to like the later seasons more it seems. It's worth watching."
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"Yes, it's a fantastic TV show. It starts as a case of the week show but evolves into a more serial form of storytelling, well worth watching in my opinion"
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"Yes it was very good, dare I say great show. It's worth the time."
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"Yes

One of my favourite shows ever with some of my favourite characters ever"
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"If I'm not wrong, a lot of people on reddit consider If Then Else (Season 4 Episode 11) to be one of the finest episodes of television. It has its really good moments. And it introduced me to Johnny Cash's version of Hurt, so I'm definitely biased. Overall definitely worth a watch IMO"
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"Yes, very.

First season and a half are episodic, then it gets more focused on the big picture, it goes from good to great with one of the very few good series endings.

Also, try Fringe, my evaluation of it is about the same as PoI."
Gegege no Kitaro 6,I'd say it's worth it (it's actually 5 seasons and the fifth is only half-length) but beware the people telling you it ceases to be procedural.  It remains 90% procedural 10% mythology arc for the entire series.
Gegege no Kitaro 6,Its my favorite show of all time so I'm biased when I say that you should watch it. It will take its time but the investment you put in watching the first two procedural seasons rewards you in the latter 50 episodes.
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"It's 4 seasons and a shortened 5th one. And yes, absolutely worth the time. Excellent continuity and writing. Doesn't take the audience for dumdums."
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"It never really stops being a procedural at its core, despite what others will tell you, so keep that in mind."
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"I would have dropped it after 3 episodes as well but it was absolutely worth sticking with. If you really can't handle the first season you can check a guide for which episodes introduce important characters etc and just watch those in the first season - it's what I did the first time around and I don't think it significantly lessened what came later.

The overarching story is one of the best I've seen on TV with a few individual episodes also being up there for best episodes of TV. 

Also worth noting it sticks the landing."
Gegege no Kitaro 6,In the top 5 of my all time favorite shows.
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"Yes, 100x yes. I rewatch POI every 1-1.5 years, it's really, really good. People will say the first season is just a procedural but they lay the foundation for telling a bigger story almost from the start. The show starts by developing its main characters and then expands its world and plots naturally from there. 

And also...the procedural aspect of it is really fun IMO."
Gegege no Kitaro 6,Absolutely worth it! One of the best.
Gegege no Kitaro 6,Yes
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"I’m watching it again now.  I love this show.  Good bit of humor, likable characters and villains, interesting overall concept."
Gegege no Kitaro 6,I watched the first season and didn't think it was anything special.
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"Reese is Batman with a gun, my only gripe is the last season having less episodes than other seasons, the show tied up all loose ends but still would've preferred a full final season."
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"The show gets to be great later on but it's a slow burn and you have to deal with a lot of old school procedural things/network bs before the real plot reveals itself. People recommend it because it becomes a different beast in the later seasons and at the time it was pretty unexpected.
 
I'd still recommend it but if you don't want to or can't watch the whole thing, against the advice of the super fans, I'd say you should just follow Root, especially in the first season. She usually moves the plot along. Check imdb to see which eps she is in and watch those, if you still can't get into it, then maybe the show isn't for you and that's ok.

After all this time, I still miss The machine, she was great :("
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"We binged it during covid.


Michael Emerson and Amy Acker were great.

Jim Caviezel's acting was interesting early on, but his acting got noticeably more wooden/awful as the series went on.  Researched him to see if he had a medical condition that rendered him unable to act and learned he is a save-the-children adrenochrome qanon nut job.  Back during PoI he saying in interviews that he couldn't kiss actresses if it was in the script because he was married, and he insisted on doing his own stunts and was bad at them, and injured others on the set.  He felt like a drag on the series to me.

If you loved LOST then you may love PoI for Emerson.  Like someone else suggested - check-out Fringe if you haven't yet.  You may also like The Leftovers."
Gegege no Kitaro 6,Please watch it!
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"I like the more episodes in a season. The more time with characters I like, the better."
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"If you like the show, the extra episodes aren't an investment, they're a gift."
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"It's pretty reliant on a ""case of the week"" formula throughout, but if you enjoy spending time with some great characters, you will enjoy PoI. Harold, Root, and Fusco in particular are fantastic characters, and the decision to shoot on location in NYC means that the city itself always feels like a character as well, which is a lot of fun if you're into shows with a strong sense of place like I am."
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"Effing YES!!
Person of Interest is a phenomenal show with only a couple meh episodes. The characters, the world building and the stories are all fantastic. 
As for the “big investment,” dude life isn’t a race. You can binge it all or an episode at a time every couple of days until you finish."
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"I wasn't keen on the way they finished it, I think they struggled to tie up all the threads they had going but I still enjoyed it, and it was pretty easy watching."
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"It's a show that manages to reinvent itself often and organically through its own plot. The stakes change, the goals change, and you always feel like it's a deserved evolution."
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"It's five seasons (with the last one being quite short) and I really enjoyed it. I'm currently doing a rewatch and just started season 2.

Yes, there is a lot of filler/procedural episodes, but I quite enjoyed a lot of them. Even during them, you'll often find bits of the main plot interspersed throughout (hint - look out for mentions of ""Elias"").

It is good. Yes, it does have a lot of ""baddie of the week"" but that was most shows at the time with long seasons."
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"Yes it’s worth it. 
The characters alone are worth it. 
It’s so good."
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"I would love to see you again but I can’t find it anywhere for free, If you’re getting it free tell me where please ,thanks"
Gegege no Kitaro 6,I enjoyed it so definitely
Gegege no Kitaro 6,"Based on what you like currently, no, you will not like it. However, it is a great show.

And it's five seasons, not six, with the fifth season shortened / compressed. Again, if you don't like the longer episodic format, it's not for you."

Signal,"This remains the white whale of awesome TV conspiracies and such

I wish we knew more, but its probably yielded all the info it ever will already, which got us no where. So interesting.

I still believe the most likely case was that it was from the local hacking/phreaking community who worked with someone on the inside or someone who had detailed technical knowledge and means (probably from working TV ops) to somehow disrupt the signal and replace with theirs (in some way, be it a transmitter or something less technically  complicated)"
Signal,"This is honestly the best kind of unsolved mystery, something legitimately weird and silly and a little bit creepy in which nobody got hurt and anybody who knows anything - and, surely, there must be *somebody* out there who does - also knows well enough to keep their trap shut. (The statute of limitations for any legal repercussions elapsed back in 1992, so there's really no reason for anyone with any knowledge not to come forward save for the fact that it's just more interesting if they don't.)

It's also a real and valuable glimpse into a now-long-gone era when television, as a medium, actually felt as though it could potentially be *dangerous*, that it could be (and, here, was) harnessed for culturally subversive means. Cable TV piracy was a real thing (as was the truly bizarre Wild West of public access television, where any nutbar with a soapbox could and would put themselves out there for the world to see), and - as David Cronenberg has remarked, when discussing the inspirations for Videodrome - there seemed a real possibility that an unwary viewer might stumble across something forbidden, something they weren't really meant to see.

Always thought it was so weird that people went through all the trouble and possible jail time to do this (the FCC takes this kind of thing VERY seriously), then have basically nothing interesting to broadcast.

I realize this is like someone projecting “made you look!” On the moon; amazing achievement undercut by a puerile joke."
Signal,I had just gotten into Reddit around that time. People missed the vibe from before reddit was popular at all back then.
Signal,Agreed. It was just the can we actually do it aspect.  Very much in line with a lot of hacking phreaking communities of the era
Signal,It was ;)
Signal,Bribe tech ops to slip a tape in the machine would be easiest.
Signal,They googled it from the future.
Signal,Tom Baker was the best Doctor.
Signal,True. Then it become DIGG+4chan+tumblr outcasts
Signal,I can't believe I've been on reddit for 12 years (deleted my first account). But tbh it had the same vibe back then. Unless you mean way before that. There were a lot more cringe meme subs that were popular though.
Signal,20 minutes into the future
Signal,"Next Sunday, A.D."
Signal,"Call it a hunch but I think Disney is going to have a theater problem thanks to Disney+. COVID hasn't helped things but if everyone knows that a Disney movie that isn't an absolute must see in theaters film, they're going to wait the 45 days and just catch it on Disney+."
Signal,"*The company says its flagship Disney+ beat Wall Street expectations by adding 12.1 million subscribers to 164.2 million, and overall streaming subscribers passed 235 million, with Hulu adding 1 million subs in its last quarter, and ESPN+ adding 1.5 million.*

Impressive gains in an era where everyone else is struggling. Hulu just added double what HBO Max did domestic in the quarter! ESPN+ did even better. 

Chapek says DTC losses have already peaked in this quarter. Forecasts losses decrease through 2023 before profitability achieved sometime in 2024. 

Nice to see Hulu’s strong investment in content rewarded in the quarter."
Signal,And  the stock is down 7 percent on its earnings.
Signal,convenient this comes out right before they tell subscribers that the prices are going up.  im canceling this month.  37.5 % increase from 8 bucks to 11 starting next month.  see ya
Signal,$1.5 billion lost on streaming in the last quarter but sure everything is fine.
Signal,[removed]
Signal,"Well, they're just about to raise prices, and the 3 year D23 prepaid subscriptions end this month, so they might get more profitable, and they'll probably see slower growth in domestic subs next quarter."
Signal,Losses have peaked? Shouldn't it be thalweged?
Signal,"I'm not surprised, with all the companies that Disney is slowly but surely gobbling up D+ is becoming the Netflix that used to exist."
Signal,why? there's nothing to watch on disney+ (unless you are a child or mentally stunted adult) or hulu. there is genuinely nothing but trash on hulu lmao
Signal,Great news! I can't wait for the next 45 years of festering shit-stink content based on endlessly repeated and creatively bankrupt franchises. Will bobba fett get over his daughter kissing a boy at the prom? will ant man finally defeat his arch nemesis the faceless goon? boy howdy i hope i dont swallow a bullet before i find out
Signal,"Yeah, Disney is in a weird place. They basically needed the streaming but it's really hurting their smaller movies."
Signal,"Here is the thing...

Lets say each sub here pays 5 dollars per sub that is 14 billion in revenue a year. That is more than even disney's best year financially. They are making their money back without the theater just fine"
Signal,"Or . . . they don't need theaters anyway.

Encanto theatrical, critically adored but box office lacked luster.

Encanto after Disney+ , crank up the merchandising and derivative synergy because this thing is hot.

Yeah, there have been decent money makers outside the worst of the pandemic in that space that challenge the notion (Minions: The Rise of Gru), but it is quite possible that parents are not going to be taking kids to see these movies in theaters as much anymore.

Was Lightyear dismal because of Disney+ or because it was a mediocre movie?

There are probably actual profit questions too after theater distribution (they can compare pure release numbers like Turning Red against theatrical long run profits), but to me it seems like people on reddit are assuming all these movies would be like Minions: The Rise of Gru if they had a 90 day window. (Minions; TRoG was 85 days) I am going to have to see that to believe it.

And it is still going to need to be a better deal than what merchandising and other derivatives are getting them throughout the rest of the company."
Signal,[removed]
Signal,"I signed up for ESPN+ in August because AmEx is offering $7 back on Disney bundles.  I already had Disney+ and Hulu, making it a bundle with ESPN+ lowered the cost by like $1.50.  Add in the $7 cash back and I'm saving $8.50/ month by having ESPN+.  The only time I've ever opened the app was that one NFL game that was exclusive to ESPN+."
Signal,"Don't fall for subs as the key metric.  A dozen subs that make money is better business than a billion money losing subs.  

Disney's subs are money losing.  They don't even charge enough to cover administration costs, never mind the content cost.  

HBO may have modest subscriber numbers, but they know how to control costs and they charge a premium price.  From a business perspective, that's where you'd rather be.  

And it's unpopular to raise here, but Netflix is another service that is actually not profitable, despite their own deceptive claims, which have been circularly regurgitated in medium.  (Their ""profit"" claim is a heavily adjusted number that excludes major costs like their debt and content obligations.)

Similarly, don't fall for executives touting BS stats like ""views"" or ""viewing time"" or ""watch time"".  Unless you're selling advertising, views and viewing time are a drain on your cost side, and they don't add a single penny of revenue.  Plus Netflix is sneaky about how they define ""views"".   

If you sell ads, then yes, view time and number of views and number of viewers matter.  But if you have an ad-free subscription model, they don't drive the financials."
Signal,"They gained subscribers but lost $1.5B *in a quarter* in the process. Money is more valuable today than it has been anytime in the last 15 years, so just growth is no longer enough. You have to have $$$ on your balance sheet at the end of the day or your stock is going to get screwed. Look at all the tech giants down 75% from last year."
Signal,"I think it might be 10% when the market opens. Simply put the gains in streamers matter less to investors than the costs to bring in these gains.

The free money era is gone."
Signal,"Their stock went down 6% after hours and it’s down to $94 a share, from their peak last year at $197."
Signal,This sub definitely hates Disney beyond any reason so yeah there's definitely going to be tons of triggered comments soon enough.
Signal,If you actually look were the growth is coming from it’s  these cheap poor countries where Disney plus is 2$…esp India. It cost 11$ a yr in India. These numbers don’t mean squat if it’s constant losing money per year as shown in the article.
Signal,I think it's the 45 day window that's killing them. I don't have high hopes for strange world and I wouldn't be surprised to see black panther not met predictions.
Signal,I have heard the money is in the parks anyways.
Signal,"Their clueless execs botched it.

Entering the streaming world was due.  But they should have tried to emulate HBO.  That would have been a streaming option in parallel with keeping their existing (and incredibly profitable) platforms going.  

That streaming service should have been premium priced (like HBO, and like everything else Disney sells)

And the streaming should not have given away the entire farm, and the town, and the railroads.  It could have had featured content, and then a rotation of the biggest favorites.

They should have kept the lucrative BVD and foreign licensing going, while allowing the digital business to continue to prosper, even if it meant the subscription numbers would come along more slowly.

Instead, the exterminated their most profitable divisions and replaced the, with one that just burns money in a furnace."
Signal,Redo your math. 235 million  x $5 is $1.1 billion
Signal,Don't they include Hotstar subs in this? I pay the equivalent of 10 dollars for my yearly sub.
Signal,Makes me wonder what their plan is for it when they fully take over Comcast's ownership. Would make sense to consolidate into one service but giving up 45 million other subs who may or may not switch over or pay more for a consolidated D+?
Signal,"You are wrong. Netflix are actually profitable right now. On track for $6 billion in paper profits but, crucially, $1 billion in FCF for 2022. Debt is only $14.5 billion. Pretty manageable as long as they do not suffer severe subscriber losses in the next 2-4 years. 

HBO Max is haemorrhaging cash all over the place as is WBD in general. Absolutely drowning in over $50 billion of debt with cable revenues (their main revenue source) plummeting 8% year on year. Zaslav is curbing the losses at HBO Max which will be good for short term cash flow and profitability but is probably likely to negatively impact streaming growth in the medium term. Which is an issue as they are now facing being a mid-pack streamer alongside NBCU and Paramount. Crazy considering they have the tools to best Disney and Netflix. They just do not seem to have the cash needed to grow the service over the next 3 years to get it to scale. 

Disney laid out the plan quite clearly to investors at this quarterly report. DTC losses have peaked in this quarter. They will narrow in 2023 and profitability is expected sometime in 2024. DTC is not some endless money pit for Disney. There is a clear path to profitability.

Netflix are the most transparent in the industry when it comes to defining “views”. Every week they release viewership hours charts at [this](https://top10.netflix.com/tv) website. An imperfect metric for sure but far more hard data than we get from any other service in the industry!"
Signal,"> Money is more valuable today than it has been anytime in the last 15 years

I want to expand on this that the market feels incredibly risk adverse right now.

The only companies that haven't had major draw downs in their stock price have done (relatively) good work at showing resiliency in the macro."
Signal,"Not really surprising.

Disney's entire media business made an operating income of just $83 million down from $947 million in the same quarter 2021.

Disney shareholders have to be thanking the gods for Walt's decision to go into theme parks."
The New Legends of Monkey,"The first episode I was kinda shaky on, but I’m up to episode four and it’s keeping my interest. It’s a bit silly, and kinda has a Xena Warrior Princess tone to me sometimes in the campiness. I like it so far, as long as you don’t expect seriousness."
The New Legends of Monkey,"I enjoyed it, definitely guilty pleasure stuff, if you're looking for something to scratch a Hercules 'n Xena itch this is KINDA close enough."
The New Legends of Monkey,"I watched the trailer the other night, and it's definitely on my radar. I just have a massive backlog of games and shows without the time to get through them all. "
The New Legends of Monkey,Is it available on Netflix US? 
The New Legends of Monkey,"I enjoyed it quite a bit. I’m sure it will get panned, but it’s fun to watch. "
The New Legends of Monkey,"I don't know, I hate this show. Not every hero show needs to be a comedy, and if they really want to make a hero show that has comedy in it, then should probably just ditch the Journey to the West theme and went with something original. But doing such an artistic take (and I am been generous here) require careful thoughts about how not to ruin the central theme of the story, kind of like how Elementary is a modern take on Holmes, but this take is just terrible. As someone who read the book, this is the worst artistic interpretation of any novel I have ever witnessed. If someone wants to do a rescuing the world theme, there are plenty of other stories to copy and ruin, Journey to the West is ultimately one of self recognition and self help, it is not a story looking for savior of the world, but of internal acceptance and conquering the inner demons. It is about resistance against temptation, and baser needs. If the artistic take is going to just ruin the original intent of the author, why the fuck do it, just do your own god damn show. "
The New Legends of Monkey,Yes!
The New Legends of Monkey,I thought it was cheesy and fun as well. The Shannara Chronicles (TV) is a show that I rarely admit to watching but it was the same cheesy sort of fun (it was cancelled after 2 seasons).
The New Legends of Monkey,"I like a show that doesn't take itself too seriously. That was the vibe that I got to Shannara. This show clearly does not take itself that seriously, it shows that they have fun with it. That makes this more enjoyable for me."
The New Legends of Monkey,true. I got a serious vibe from Shannara 
The New Legends of Monkey,Monkey is China’s version of Superman except he’s a prick haha.  Comedic relief was definitely a part of the novels too mostly from the monkey and pigs interactions
The New Legends of Monkey,"Was a big fan of both Xena and Hercules, AND kind of running out of things to watch so... thanks!"
The New Legends of Monkey,"Xena is one of my favorite shows, gonna watch this tonight!"
The New Legends of Monkey,"After seeing this post... I found and watched it.  I'd have to say I think it's a cut *above* Hercules and Xena.  Maybe not in some of the landscape artwork, or the feel of the practical sets, but definitely in the writing.

The humor is just perfect.  Every time I think maybe the show might not be quite what I'm looking for, they hit me with a joke that gets a genuine laugh out of me.

I've just finished S01E03, and if the quality holds I expect to finish when I run out of episodes and not before."
The New Legends of Monkey,"Ha, I watched it and I said to my wife that it was like the Hercules people had been transported twenty years forward in time."
The New Legends of Monkey,You can also watch The Witcher. It's Hercules and Xena with a bigger budget and better (much better) actors.
The New Legends of Monkey,"I've been hesitant about it since like 90% of the charm of Monkey was that it was a dodgy dub of a very weird Jaapnese show. Setting out to deliberately recreate that doesn't feel like something that would end well.

Anyway, if it doesn't use Monkey Magic as it's theme then what's the point?

https://youtu.be/J-SUoHmpRdM"
The New Legends of Monkey,True
The New Legends of Monkey,"I loved the original TV series, Monkey was such an arrogant prick."
The New Legends of Monkey,"Thanks for the recommendation. Love Xena and Hercules, and the film version of Journey to the West is one if my favorites, so this show should be right up my alley."
The New Legends of Monkey,"Actually, I get real ""Lexx"" vibes from the show."
The New Legends of Monkey,"Yeah I'm watching S2:E2 right now and it seems like his arrogance is going to be the main cause of most problems lol.

Kind of reminds me of king Arthur from BBCs show Merlin"
The New Legends of Monkey,Haha you'll love it. Watch at least through episode 3 or 4. By then you'll have a good idea if it is for you or not but I think it will be haha
The New Legends of Monkey,"Awesome, let me know what you think!"
The New Legends of Monkey,"Before i bring my pitchfork, are you implying the witchers actors are better than Xena OR Legends of the monkey."
The New Legends of Monkey,"It's unfortunate someone downvoted you, because you're 100% right, and it's not a bad thing at all.

I loved the Witcher and watched it through this lense. I've recommended it to other people in this way and they've all loved it and agreed as well. 

The only few people I know that don't like the Witcher are the ones that can't get over the fact that it's not (and not trying to be) game of thrones"
The New Legends of Monkey,The power of the Monkey is... irrepressible!
The New Legends of Monkey,Ah it often is in the novel.  Idk if it’s the case in the show but it’s annoying how often someone so overpowered has to ask for help lol.
The New Legends of Monkey,"Follow up
Started it. That is a really good comparison. Thanks again for the heads-up."
The New Legends of Monkey,Will do!
The New Legends of Monkey,Yes.
The New Legends of Monkey,The Witcher doesn't have to be Game of Thrones. It needs good writing and consistent production values. There are plenty of reasons to criticize the show that you shouldn't be dismissing. If they don't improve with Season 2 we're not getting a complete saga.
The New Legends of Monkey,"No problem, I finished season 2 last night. I actually preferred S2 to S1"
The New Legends of Monkey,"I'm not dismissing it's flaws, I never said the show is flawless.

I said personally the people I know that don't like the show were dismissive because they couldn't get over comparing it to GoT unfavorably"
The New Legends of Monkey,I really liked Upload.
The New Legends of Monkey,"I enjoyed Upload, Dash and Lily, and Emily in Paris, but the show on your list that I was most surprised to enjoy was The Unicorn.

I generally don’t watch or enjoy sitcoms (other than, I guess, the biggies like Friends/30 Rock/etc.).  It’s definitely not in that league, but it was cute and original enough to watch in 48 hours.

ETA:  Teenage Bounty Hunters is the funniest show I’ve seen in a few years!"
The New Legends of Monkey,"This is a bit pedantic but the title should really be ""shows I watched on streaming"" not ""streaming shows I watched"". Like half of these aren't streaming shows."
The New Legends of Monkey,"I'm halfway through s1 of Upload and would definitely consider it dark, and maybe edgy."
The New Legends of Monkey,"Sure, and since people watch Netflix shows on their computer not television they shouldn't be on r/television but r/computer."
The New Legends of Monkey,"Further pedantry; New Legends Of Monkey, as well as Xena and Hercules, were made in New Zealand."
The New Legends of Monkey,"You're making their point for them. Watching something on a computer doesn't make it a computer show, and likewise, watching something on a streaming service doesn't make it a streaming show."
The New Legends of Monkey,A computer monitor is literally a television because it lets you see things at a distance
The New Legends of Monkey,That I will correct.
The New Legends of Monkey,"I loved how they didn't take themselves too seriously in the final season as well.

Singing ""U + Ur hand"" to a group a Nazis and ""I had the time of my life"" for the final showdown."
The New Legends of Monkey,"Emily Hampshire is really good in this, she plays Brad Pitt's character from the movies."
The New Legends of Monkey,"Deacon is in this season of Picard. 

I am just now finding out that Picard has a lot of 12 Monkeys references because they share some of the same writers or something?"
The New Legends of Monkey,"Love this show, causality and fixed time loops scratch that itch in my brain so good."
The New Legends of Monkey,A show with a perfect ending. It's rare you get a show that wraps everything up so nicely.
The New Legends of Monkey,"Some of my favorite shows of all time are Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, Mr. Robot, The Leftovers, Dark, and Bojack Horseman.

I put 12 Monkeys in the same category. It is that good.

It is overlooked and dismissed for some unfair reasons: (1) It is based on the movie. But the show goes WAY BEYOND the source material and becomes it's own story. The show is levels better than the movie. (2) It was on SyFy which has a somewhat deserved reputation of airing crap. 12 Monkeys should have been on AMC (when AMC meant something)."
The New Legends of Monkey,Really liked the ending.Fun ride for sure.
The New Legends of Monkey,For those who haven't watched - it's a really fun and satisfying show. The cast is great and every single mystery set up during the show is answered by the end of the excellent series finale.
The New Legends of Monkey,[deleted]
The New Legends of Monkey,"Show runner and writer Terry Matalas is currently killing it on season 3 of Picard, which is poetic seeing how dude made his bones on DS9 and has now come full circle."
The New Legends of Monkey,Probably my favorite show of all time. Definitely the best time travel show of all time. Watch it.
The New Legends of Monkey,"My film professor in college absolutely hated this series and I never understood why. It's a bit campy and doesn't take itself too seriously but for what it is, it's a great show."
The New Legends of Monkey,It's not prestigious TV or anything but it's damn good scifi and just fun! Definitely got one of the best endings of a show.
The New Legends of Monkey,"One of my all-time favorite shows! We were just talking about it the other day. I'm so glad we got to see it all the way to the end and that it didn't get cancelled halfway through like so many others. 

99 Luftballoons was just a bonus none of us knew we needed."
The New Legends of Monkey,Travelers is a good time travel show
The New Legends of Monkey,"I thought it was pretty entertaining and certainly doesn't get the respect it deserves compared to other recent sci-fi programming. The woman basically playing the Brad Pitt character had a great run - she went from being a bit annoying to the show stealer.

Still had some issues though. The baddies were like comic book baddies, it might have been more interesting if they were more nuanced. Sometimes character motivations felt forced to make the time loops still work. And the usual stuff where it falls apart if you think about it too hard (They will reject an obvious solution because it might ""affect the timeline"", then the next episode they do something way more drastic in the past and it's seemingly not a problem.)"
The New Legends of Monkey,This show was great. Might be time for a rewatch
The New Legends of Monkey,"Well based on the comments here, I'll have to give it a go!"
The New Legends of Monkey,"I'm struggling a bit with Season 1. I know the show is supposed to get better, but the editing/writing/music feel very 2015 SyFy (which is hardly surprising I guess). 

Does it shake some of this off in the later seasons?"
The New Legends of Monkey,One of the few shows I'll watch at least yearly all the way through. Amazing television.
The New Legends of Monkey,Love this show so much.
The New Legends of Monkey,This show is one of my favourite shows of all time. It’s entertaining and time travel actually makes sense. Very well written and underrated for sure.
The New Legends of Monkey,"This show was a ""secret tip"" over 5 years ago... But there are still people who had never heard of it. 

This show is one of my all-time favorite shows."
The New Legends of Monkey,This is probably the best time travel show I have ever seen and probably the best sci-fi show show after Fringe for me.
The New Legends of Monkey,"I've definitely watched this show. But honestly I cant remember really anything from it. 
A showdown in a warehouse? 

Was it really that good? How comes I don't remember what happens in it. Hmm."
The New Legends of Monkey,"It's a shame that many, many people quit this show during the first season altough the story hasn't begun yet. It takes time to unfold. This is one of the best written shows and it has the BEST FINALE ever. Better than Six Feet Under. Better than Breaking Bad. It has no plotholes (which is insane because it's time travel) and you can even watch it backwards and it still makes sense.

Don't even get me started on one of the best characters ever developed: Jennifer. What a delight. THIS is how you write strong women, dear Hollywood!

What a masterpiece!
10/10"
The New Legends of Monkey,I stopped somewhere S02. Dont know why
The New Legends of Monkey,"Fantastic show, where does it stream?"
The New Legends of Monkey,"Absolutely loved this show. Been trying to chase a similar show to scratch the itch for time travel and/or epic scifi ever since, and just can't find one. Closest thing was probably Continuum. But Battlestar and 12 Monkeys are probably my two favorite epic sagas."
The New Legends of Monkey,"I stopped watching, because while it had good scifi and concepts, it felt like the same antagonist/situation season after season."
The New Legends of Monkey,"great show
always recommend it"
The New Legends of Monkey,"I loved Nikita, and since this show had a bunch of that cast and I always enjoyed the movie I checked it out. I remember enjoying the first season but just kinda stopped watching after a while, I need to get back into it one day, always heard good things."
The New Legends of Monkey,Same show runner for the new season of Picard which is night and day different quality from the first awful 2 seasons of Picard.
The New Legends of Monkey,"I never knew there was a show, will check it out."
The New Legends of Monkey,I've seen the movie.  Didn't know there was a show.
The New Legends of Monkey,"This show, Black Sails, and The Leftovers have been among the most satisfying series for me in recent years. They are exceptional, and worth investing the time into.

12 Monkeys is a carefully planned and well executed time travel story that will have you on your toes for the duration of your first viewing, and if you rewatch you will get the pay off of seeing how lovingly the puzzle got masterfully shifted into place. 

Genuinely one of my all-time favourite TV shows."
The New Legends of Monkey,"The movie was brilliant, if depressing. I never even heard of this show till now."
The New Legends of Monkey,I still watch full series every few years. A good example of how a reimagining / reboot can work.
The New Legends of Monkey,You really can see the actors and writers having fun.
The New Legends of Monkey,"wasn't a huge fan of the movie, hows the show in comparison?

edit: alright i'm convinced. going to potentially binge it this weekend!"
The New Legends of Monkey,"Loved this show. So we’ll done. As much as I would have liked more seasons, it ended well and feels complete."
The New Legends of Monkey,I loved this show. Definitely worth a watch.
The New Legends of Monkey,Aaron Stanford should be a bigger star than he is
The New Legends of Monkey,"I haven't seen it in a while but I remember thinking it went on for too long. They had a great reveal of who the villain was but then it felt like thet got renewed for more episodes and had to add a 'actually, this was the real villain all along'."
The New Legends of Monkey,"If you get past the fact that the show is a reboot/reimagining of the original movie premise, then it is a really fun watch. They really fleshed out the characters and just took it in a whole new direction. The movie is definitely in my top 10 list. I love Terry Gilliam movies and the heartbreakingly beautiful closed loop time travel paradox ending will always be a cinema high to me."
The New Legends of Monkey,"i liked it, i watched it until the thing with the baby and it was too much."
The New Legends of Monkey,"My favorite TV show of all time. Great story, time travel is very thrilling and keeps you invested, but even the best of stories is nothing without great characters and this series has amazing characters. By the end of it I was very invested emotionally in the characters. Also, the best finale I've ever watched, which is very hard to get right."
The New Legends of Monkey,In this thumbnail that guy could’ve already shot her. Shows use guns so stupidly and it doesn’t add to the excitement at all. Basically TV writers have no respect for or connection to other people and are all Michael Scott.
The New Legends of Monkey,Couldn’t the guy in the picture quickly scoot slightly to his left and take the shot with her head turned?
The New Legends of Monkey,Someone must have never seen futurama
The New Legends of Monkey,"Man that show was an insult to the source material. 

Y'all like that show but hated Cowboy Bebop is sure a indictment to objectivity."
The New Legends of Monkey,"I wish the true ending was the bleaker one, but still enjoyed the show."
The New Legends of Monkey,I think Dark has something to say about this
The New Legends of Monkey,"I'm on like the third season. It was pretty stupid. Time travel has no rules.

Alisen Down is great. She's been great for over 20 years though."
The New Legends of Monkey,I gave up on this in the first episode where the watch got a scratch carved into it.
The New Legends of Monkey,Good summer binge show
The New Legends of Monkey,"The first season was great. 

They really put a lot of great seeds into the fact that climate change was going to destroy the world, so by saving everyone you'd be dooming the planet, etc. 

Then I guess there was a showrunner change or SOMETHING because season 2 went completely off the rails. I stopped watching but I don't think it got more on-track ever."
Bobby Kennedy for President,"Comes out April 27th, for anyone who'd rather not watch the whole trailer just for that information."
Bobby Kennedy for President,[deleted]
Bobby Kennedy for President,"If someone reading this happens not to have heard of it, I highly recommend CNN's docuseries American Dynasties: The Kennedys.  Really goes in depth about the family, from Joe on.  This past week's covered RFK after his brother's death and his tragic run for the presidency.  Between that show, this new series and the new movie about Ted Kennedy, the Kennedys seem to be everywhere.  "
Bobby Kennedy for President,"I think very highly of Robert Kennedy.   He was a great speaker.  That said, I do think we view him and his brother through rose colored glasses.   We remember the good about them, and not some of the down sides.  

Had he lived, the country probably avoids Watergate entirely (or a similar scandal).  That said, I don't know if he would have really pulled out of Vietnam.  I don't doubt that he might have wanted to do that,  but how do you do it.... does he just remove all US presence there or does a Kennedy Administration find other others to support South Vietnam in place of the United States.    

A lot of the reason the US went to the Saudis to support the war against the Soviets in Afghanistan was that the Pentagon didn't want to be directly involved because of the Vietnam experience. 

Also, let's remember Nixon's greatest political triumph.... the opening to China.  That probably doesn't happen under Robert Kennedy.   

What is the US government under RFK gets a then non-democratic South Korea and Taiwan governments to support South Vietnam while the US remains there with a very action CIA, DIA, NSA presence.     There is potential there for that to really explode into something big.    If only because the People's Republic was never going to directly attack the US in Vietnam.... but Taiwan..... that's a different scenario.   It at least seems possible. 

I too find the good memories of the Kennedy's to be very appealing.  Even Teddy's speech in 1980 at the Democratic Convention is one of the great American speeches.   But rose colored thinking..... I don't know if, and i very much doubt, we would have gotten the perfect world we dream about.    "
Bobby Kennedy for President,Anyone know what the song is? It’s beautiful and I’m desperate to find it. 
Bobby Kennedy for President,"It would have. However it's easy to assume that he would have won had he not been assassinated, when in reality he may not have even beaten Humphries to the primary nomination, and had he succeeded he was very much facing an uphill battle against Nixon after the Johnson years. Don't forget how formidable Nixon was as a political opponent."
Bobby Kennedy for President,"Jerome Holloway - ""Troubling Times""
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEqSi-bmaSA
I totally thought it was Nina Simone but it wasn't.  "
Bobby Kennedy for President,"Humphrey almost certainly would have got the nomination. He lead him in the delegate count by a wide margin at the time of Bobby's death, his primary battle with McCarthy also showed that his campaign had a lot of weaknesses. 

In reality he likely loses the 1968 primary campaign but it would have lead to a 72 or 76 run. 

"
Bobby Kennedy for President,"THANK YOU!! I kept trying to google the bits of lyrics I could hear like I normally do with songs, but nothing was coming up. Lifesaver!"
Bobby Kennedy for President,"I was ready to vote in my first presidential election back then, and I was so desolate when they killed Robert Kennedy that I can't bring myself to watch this."
Bobby Kennedy for President,"amazing intro, great series"
Bobby Kennedy for President,"Cool, but [Elastic](https://www.wired.com/2015/06/made-true-detectives-opening-credits-eerie/) needs to find something else... kind of a one-trick pony. "
Bobby Kennedy for President,"Half way through.  One of the best series, about one of the truly great Americans, I've ever seen in this long life myriad hours seen.
edit; now finished.  Just a thorough, well crafted series of one of, if not the most important modern moments of our country.  The life of this man who could have been maybe our greatest president was cut down in what could still prove to be a deadly conspiracy that stole the lives four powerful, liberal leaders."
Bobby Kennedy for President,"It is 4 episode long and the first three episode are very good. The documentary does a great job of weaving in a lot of rare historical footage and lays out some pretty cool stuff about RFK, also it illustrated his assassination in ways that I had not seen before. It really fills in a lot of blanks from the assassination of JFK to RFK's assassination.

The final episode was fucking atrocious and just groped around with a half-assed conspiracy theory and really just sucked. It is really unfortunate that it ended on that note.

The first three are worth a watch. "
Bobby Kennedy for President,"Hardly a half-assed conspiracy theory. But definitely not concrete, I’ll give you that. Sure as fuck convinced me that there was a girl in a polka-dot dress who was there though "
Bobby Kennedy for President,I've been wanting to watch Chappaquiddick. Bobby Kennedy for President is a great docuseries. 
Bobby Kennedy for President,"Eddie Thawne, Eobard Thawne (original face) and Nora West-Allen"
Bobby Kennedy for President,"Jessica Parker Kennedy is 38, & still getting young adult roles. Wonder if she'll age into mom roles before she's 70."
Bobby Kennedy for President,Ngl I thought The Flash wrapoed.
Bobby Kennedy for President,Love me some Jessica Parker Kennedy ngl
Bobby Kennedy for President,"Eddie Thawne, now *there's* a throwback."
Bobby Kennedy for President,"So now the show has confirmed that Oliver, Diggle, Wally, Bloodwork, Henry, Nora (old), Nora (young), Eddie, Eobard, and the Pied Piper are returning (with a few more minor characters as well). Plus they're having the actress from Batwoman play Red Death and got Murphy from The 100 to play Captain Boomerang (good casting IMO).

Show hasn't been good for a long time but I'm kind of looking forward to this. Seems like they're going to pack a lot into the last 13 episodes to wrap up the series, the Arrowverse, and maybe even the CW as it used to be."
Bobby Kennedy for President,"Eddie Thawne finally return, no fricking way."
Bobby Kennedy for President,"That things still going? I stopped watching at about season 4 because it got BAD. Did it ever get good again? Might just skip to a good season

I loved the cast. The writing wasn’t there though."
Bobby Kennedy for President,"It's still going??? Jesus, I gave up on the Arrowverse about 4 years ago."
Bobby Kennedy for President,we don't care. post riverdale trailer please thank you
Bobby Kennedy for President,I thought this show was over?
Bobby Kennedy for President,Everyone associated with it should be embarrassed.
Bobby Kennedy for President,Jessica Parker is beautiful!
Bobby Kennedy for President,"I like how you said original face, because Harrison Wells is technically our original Eobard Thawne face, though not chronologically so. XD"
Bobby Kennedy for President,Thinking of Eddie brings back a lot of nostalgia. I haven’t watched The Flash in years but if there’s a big fan service episode with all these cameos I’ll check it out.
Bobby Kennedy for President,I'ts Eobarding Time.
Bobby Kennedy for President,"I thought she is like 25, she looks great."
Bobby Kennedy for President,She's five years older than Grant Gustin!
Bobby Kennedy for President,You should watch her in _Black Sails_
Bobby Kennedy for President,She’s like Bianca Lawson who I think is still booking teen roles in her 40s
Bobby Kennedy for President,Way to ruin my day. Thought she was like twenties
Bobby Kennedy for President,This is the final season.
Bobby Kennedy for President,It is wrapping soon. They are getting close to the end of filming the final season (which I believe premieres in ~2 weeks).
Bobby Kennedy for President,should check out Black Sails then
Bobby Kennedy for President,I mean he was in an episode last season too.
Bobby Kennedy for President,"Unless they bring back Dibney (rubber man), it’s a hard pass…"
Bobby Kennedy for President,The last thing I saw from this show was a bunch of speedsters fighting speedforce light that they were swinging like lightsabers.
Bobby Kennedy for President,It didn’t.
Bobby Kennedy for President,"It only got more worse and mediocre, which is weird because Legends of tomorrow got better and they got cancelled in a shitty way."
Bobby Kennedy for President,This will be it's final season.
Bobby Kennedy for President,You disparaged The Flash for an objectively more shoddy and inferior show; amazing.
Bobby Kennedy for President,"At the same time, I always felt as though Letscher’s performance was truer to the character than Cavanagh’s had been."
Bobby Kennedy for President,"Right? Gotta admit, this might actually bring me back in. I haven't watched since sometime in Season 3/4, but seeing Eddie again definitely scratched my nostalgia itch."
Bobby Kennedy for President,"Seriously, holy shit. She’s a few years older than me, and while I definitely look young for my age, I don’t look *that* young. Kudos to her genetics."
Bobby Kennedy for President,Already have twice lol hence the comment lmao.
Bobby Kennedy for President,Oops. I'll be honest I haven't watched any of the shows since Crisis concluded. Felt like a good enough time to check out.
Bobby Kennedy for President,That’s a bummer. So many good storylines already exist and they did a great job the first two seasons.
Bobby Kennedy for President,"Bruh riverdale didnt get as bad as the flash did, at least riverdale knows it’s a crazy soap, what is the flash’s excuse"
Bobby Kennedy for President,The Flash can run to every Earth in the multiverse and he will never find one where Riverdale is worse than his show
Bobby Kennedy for President,When? He didnt when I was still watching it
Bobby Kennedy for President,Second season is overrated. Trash action and Zoom was laughable. Season 3 was better.
Bobby Kennedy for President,So it’s about a dead lawyer?
Bobby Kennedy for President,It'll be good to have a character who can look others in the eye.
Bobby Kennedy for President,They should’ve casted that redhead girl who played the recurring autistic elite lawyer in the good wife. Her character was so fun.
Bobby Kennedy for President,I really liked the first season of Nancy Drew. And then.... And then... And then it went off the rails :(
Bobby Kennedy for President,This isn’t Attorney Woo is it?
Bobby Kennedy for President,"Felicity Huffman.

okay!"
Bobby Kennedy for President,"So reading the article…this isn’t a spin-off? 

It’s just a backdoor pilot that they’re hoping gets made into a spin-off? Am I reading that right?"
Bobby Kennedy for President,"I actually thought season 2 of ND was stronger than its first season. I LOVED season 2 a lot. It's the season that I've recommended to my friends to watch and it has one of my favourite plot twist reveals for television.

Season 3, on the other hand, was a massive step down for me."
Bobby Kennedy for President,"I think it’s the rare example of a CW show that has maintained a decent quality throughout. Each season has had its ups and downs, but they’ve all been pretty solid. Not great by any stretch of the imagination, but above average. 

I have no interest in whatever this new role for her is."
Bobby Kennedy for President,"I don’t think it went off the rails.

It just got seriously off-track with the Aglaeca subplot, then course corrected."
Bobby Kennedy for President,I can't remember how many back door pilots I've seen but it's pretty high and they all seemed to have failed bar a couple exceptions

Bobby Kennedy for President,Is that Bono behind Clooney or Riff Raff?
Bobby Kennedy for President,I always enjoy watching this show every year.  I still get goosebumps when I think of Adam Lambert’s cover of Cher’s Belive.
Bobby Kennedy for President,r/titlegore
Bobby Kennedy for President,"That’s disappointing, I want CBS to fail"
Bobby Kennedy for President,Bono.
Bobby Kennedy for President,"Agree - not just your example of Lambert but so many other musical performances. Too many to truly list (but I highly recommend the Sting, Springsteen, and Earth, Wind and Fire tributes) but I suggest to any music fan that they should check out the YouTube for Kennedy Centre performances. Special shoutout to Bettye Laverne for her wonderful version of Love Reign O’er Me."

Bobby Kennedy for President,Disney is woke trash. You are just dumb trash.
Bobby Kennedy for President,Yes Disney is 🗑️
Bobby Kennedy for President,That means that Eleven isn't going crazy in the final season and Mike is forced to kill her?
Bobby Kennedy for President,It doesn’t even seem like he’s responding to Brown. Her comments about people needing to die were very tongue in cheek.
Bobby Kennedy for President,"Matt Duffer:

>“Believe us, we’ve explored all options in the writing room, but we aren’t Game of Thrones. This is Hawkins, it’s not Westeros.”
  
>“When Barb dies \[in Season 1\], it’s two seasons’ worth of grappling with that. Every death has impact.”
  
>“As we’re moving into the final season, more of that is on the table. There is logic behind it, and has nothing to do with my sensitivity.”

Brown's Original Comment:

>“They need to kill off some people… [The cast is] way too big. Last night we couldn’t even take one group picture, there were like 50 of us.""

>“I was like, ‘You need to start killing people off,'” the actress added, somewhat jokingly echoing Schnapp’s call for “one huge massacre scene.”"
Bobby Kennedy for President,"I know it isn't the context, but the Duffers are literally on record calling season 4 the ""game of thrones season.""

edit: to those explaining the context of the quote, please read the first 6 words of my comment."
Bobby Kennedy for President,"My only complaint is that they should have either Killed max for real or not got her to where she needs to be brought back. Her death hit harder than any other in the series, IMO, and it felt cheap when it was un-done.

Edit: to be clear, I think that Max not dying at all would have been just fine. 'not dying' isn't the problem. The problem is dying and then deus ex eleven reversing it."
Bobby Kennedy for President,"""It's season 4; everything can happen, no one is safe""

Proceeds to kill the new character again."
Bobby Kennedy for President,"He’s free to do whatever he wants, but the formula of introducing new and charismatic characters only to have them killed, as well as putting characters in situations where they clearly should’ve died while not having the guts to do it is getting old. It really bothers me this season, because Eddie’s death just felt like they had a quota to fill (and that they wanted to make up for not having the courage to kill Max)."
Bobby Kennedy for President,"At the same time, the plot armor in this show has become borderline ridiculous. And the Duffer Brothers keep using the same gimmick where they introduce a new character at the start of the season and kill them off at the end of the season. They've done it 3 times in a row now. Anything to avoid touching the main cast (which is like a dozen characters at this point)."
Bobby Kennedy for President,"I love imagining that she's not talking about the show, and just in general.

**Breaking:** *Millie Bobby Brown Calls for More Blood for the Blood God, Skulls for the Skull Throne*

Today the Duffer Brothers announced that they hope to placate the *Stranger Things* star by increasing the volume of animal sacrifice.

Photo: A cow being lowered into Brown's enclosure

Co-stars, however, are dubious as to the effectiveness of this plan.

Winona Ryder is quoted as saying: ""Millie Bobby Brown doesn't want to be fed. Millie Bobby Brown wants to *hunt*."""
Bobby Kennedy for President,Season 5: Bran rolls into Hawkins.
Bobby Kennedy for President,"i dont want anyone to die but i would love the series to end with them all becoming amway or herbalife distributors

real annoying like always trying to pressure their friends into buying shit

maybe eleven gets into selling timeshares

upset everyone

but this is why no one makes me a showrunner"
Bobby Kennedy for President,"I mean, the Duffers waffled on Max’s fate and Millie isn’t an idiot. I wouldn’t be surprised if she was talking specifically about how Max ended up honestly. Her surviving seemed very tacked on and it came off like a last minute decision."
Bobby Kennedy for President,Hopper dying would've carried more weight than having him moved to Russia. Also wills haircut needs to die.
Bobby Kennedy for President,"I see this all the time in Stranger Things fandom: every season is the ""darkest yet"" and everyone places bets on which fan favorite staples are going to die.

My take is that if you think that Stranger Things is a show that isn't heading toward a big happy ending, you haven't been paying attention. The show either creates lovable or interesting one season characters for the sole purpose of killing them off in effective ways or they kill off their villains. The main cast of heroes is basically untouchable.

Which makes sense: imagine if after everything that has happened in the series, they turn around and kill Will. It would undo the entirety of everything that Season 1 was about. It's the whole reason they >!didn't kill Max either, because ultimately it would have undone the effect of ""Dear Billy"". On that note, people are upset about Eddie not making it but when you think about it: if you take all of his scenes in the finale minus the guitar that is very likely what a Steve death sequence would have looked like. But they would never kill Steve, so luckily they have Eddie to die for him.!<

Stranger Things doesn't kill its main characters. It creates notable side-characters to kill in order to give the illusion that it does. Mark my words these kids are all going to college with minimal trauma.

Edit: I'm getting replies with guesses on which of the kids is going to kick it in S5. I'm telling you guys: this isn't that kind of show! If it's going to be anybody it's going to be >!Dr. Owens, because that's something that would make Eleven feel bad but not bad enough to ruin her life.!<"
Bobby Kennedy for President,But at the same time you can’t really take Vecna seriously if he’s just suddenly really bad at killing any of the main characters.
Bobby Kennedy for President,"I mean, >!the ground literally opened spitting hellfire and swallowed half the town, killing dozens of people!< yet >!no one other than one of the new kids!< dies, I think there's territory to reconcile there where it's still Hawkins and not Westeros and you can kill off a couple more people realistically. Or at least don't keep adding people exponentially to the cast. 

That being said I think it's super funny how they just keep Cara Buono around ostensibly for B-roll footage of what people in Hawkins are up to at any given moment lol.

I actually really liked this season but clearly pacing was the biggest problem it had when you can go 45 minutes+ in a given episode without actually hearing from certain characters, and the entire season without some characters interacting. And it's clearly because they have too many characters. Major characters feel like they get nothing to do most of the season. I feel like you could have probably cut Mike and Dustin from this season with only minor changes to the plot, and you can tell because the show is constantly reminding you of how important Mike is as the ""heart"" of the group even though the kids back in Hawkins never think of him or Will the entire season. 

There were probably interesting ways to fix this by doing like, tie-in movies with some of the subplots. Instead of being a thread throughout the season maybe the Hopper/Joyce Russia adventure is a tie-in movie that airs between the first episode dump and the finale. Maybe El getting her powers back and Will/Mike on the road too, air those weekly as 90 min/2 hour movies that fill in the gaps."
Bobby Kennedy for President,They killed one character this season for no reason. His death was absolutely pointless.
Bobby Kennedy for President,"She is right though. The writers watched the characters (and actors) grow up and are now afraid to actually hurt them. 

A story can be thrilling and great with no character death; but not when that story focuses so hard on overwhelming odds, horror, and action. The show is set up like a seedy Stephen King novel, but it's afraid to embrace to go all the way with it. Without stakes, the seasons get less impactful. And the patterns of ""introduce new character, make audience fall in love with them, kill them"" is becoming too noticeable."
Bobby Kennedy for President,Because you either have to kill half the cast or spare all the main characters. There's clearly no in-between.
Bobby Kennedy for President,"But I do agree with Brown is saying. For such great villains how just nobody dies dies make the show less intense. I mean we have examples of Harry Potter where all the main cast somehow survived but even there Dumbledore, Snape, Fred and many more died. Here even Joyce and Hopper go to Russian barracks and survive. The plot armor just keeps on getting thicker. The show is entertaining no doubt but without major deaths, won’t be memorable for long"

Maho Girls PreCure!,Not gonna lie. I laughed out loud at that Mr. Clean commercial. 
Maho Girls PreCure!,You know what? I really want Budweiser to just have their adds with just a ghost Spudz causing hijinks and teaching life lessons. That was my favorite commercial to be honest. 
Maho Girls PreCure!,Baywatch. Wtf
Maho Girls PreCure!,"Man, the T-Mobile ad with Beiber was horrible.  It's like watching a company flush money down the toilet.  

The Honda ad was a bit unique, but otherwise the non-movie trailers are junk.  

Edits: Tide was good because Jeff Tambor.  

Transformers - either Anthony Hopkins is getting desperate for money or maybe the Transformers will be the first decent one?

And finally, a decent adaptation of the Handmaiden's Tale?  

Squarespace was good - I should watch Being John Malkovich again."
Maho Girls PreCure!,The Guardians trailer was really well done! Enjoying the color grading of the film.

Maho Girls PreCure!,"Non US here, couple of days ago i read some article about superbowl ads.   
In the article, one of the fact is very interesting to me. It is said many viewers were not watching the superbowl, but only to watch the ads.  

ninja edit :  
certain age group, not the whole population.   
>18-to-30-year-olds were the only age group polled that preferred Super Bowl commercials (26 percent) to the game itself (24 percent).

Seeing this threads pop-up is becoming another confirmation (for me) that (edit:some) viewers actually interested to watch ads than the game itself..  

My question is, why ? What makes superbowl ad (to US viewers) is interesting to watch ? 
I mean it's an ads, just like any other ads? Or is it not ?   
Most of the time we either skip it (change channel), even blocked it (on internet).  

Btw, Thanks OP for compiling the ad into one list, this is very interesting to me.  "

Happy!,This is exactly the plot of the SNL skit with Chance the Rapper playing Lazlo Holmes.
Happy!,"Here the video is on YouTube

https://youtu.be/lEriXBInRlY"
Happy!,"I’ve never understood why news stations feel the need to have their reporters out in poor weather conditions while reporting about them. Just show us footage of the blizzard. It makes no difference whether the guy is actually there or not, so why put him through that?"
Happy!,"From Twitter user to Mark: ""Perhaps sadly for you, you have now become far and away my favorite weather reporter.""

LOL"
Happy!,"I’m Bruce Nolan for Eyewitness News. Back to you, F***ers!"
Happy!,Honestly if this dude was covering all the storms I’d probably tune in.  Man he’s great.
Happy!,LOL. As an Iowan I caught early wind of this and knew it was going to go viral. So glad. Poor guy deserves it.
Happy!,"The irony is that this has created publicity and rating a for the network, which will undoubtedly push his bosses to throw him out there every time there’s a storm"
Happy!,“I’m just here so I don’t get fined.”
Happy!,"This is our local sports reporter in Waterloo, he’s pretty cool at sporting events.  I’d probably feel the same way if I had to go out in last night’s blizzard."
Happy!,This is malicious compliance to a T and I'm all for it.
Happy!,So bizarre to see the local TV channel I grew up watching go viral. Delightful though.
Happy!,"I work at a rival station, and I gotta say, I love this. Fucking hilarious. Iowa represent!"
Happy!,It’s a great TV clip. Everyone can relate.
Happy!,*This guy is my Spirit Animal. Game recognizes Game.*
Happy!,Got to be careful. That guy just did his job too well. He is going to get many more of those assignments. If the news director doesn’t have an ego and sees the possibilities.
Happy!,They have found the anti-Jim Cantore.
Happy!,"His agent has to be the happiest person on the planet right now.

He might become a start off of this"

Happy!,">""I have good news and bad news. The good news is that I can still feel my face right now. The bad news is that I really wish I couldn't.""

Oh my god, that is probably the funniest thing I have heard any newscaster say about anything."
Happy!,">Iowa Sports Reporter For KWWL-TV Lets Viewers Know He’s Not Happy About Being Sent To Cover A Blizzard at 3:30 a.m.

I don't blame him.

I used to work at a news station just as a PA guy and I had to get up at 4 AM every single night. And as a young college kid who was a natural night owl, that was tough!  And since you're at a news station, you go to work no matter what the weather is like. Huge winter storm and the roads are super icy? Doesn't matter, you're going to work and you better be on time because if you're not, the show will suffer. I only lasted 9 months on the job.

Old people would probably handle the very early morning hours better, because old people tend to get up really early anyways, so getting up at 4:30 AM isn't too extreme for someone who's 60. The problem is that most PA jobs pay minimum wage so most older people aren't going to take those kind of jobs.

And if you're a reporter, meteorologist, or reporter working the night shift? You're at work by 3 AM usually. And from what I've heard, unless you're the chief meteorologist, the pay is kind of shit.

In other news, unless you're really passionate about reporting, don't become a news anchor."
Happy!,I didn't realize there was a 3:30 also in the morning until today
Happy!,"News stations really need to stop this practice, putting people out therein dangerous conditions just to tell a story."
Happy!,"This dude just worked himself into a terrible job with a stellar performance. Same time, same place, same reporter when the next storm blows through."
Happy!,"I actually live in Waterloo, this is legendary."
Happy!,He honestly shouldn't have been this good at his job.   His commentary is dripping in sarcasm and I'm loving every damn moment of it.  They just might force him to do it over and over again. Lol
Happy!,"He’s right, there’s no need to do these kinds of reports during blizzards, hurricanes, severe storms, etc. it’s just for show and puts those reporting in dangerous situations needlessly."
Happy!,I miss News Be Funny on YouTube from before they had to delete all their old stuff and ruin the new videos with some lameass commentary nobody wanted so they could stay monetized.
Happy!,"I’m constantly confused as to why tv reporters are sent out into horrible conditions to report on something they could easily do from the newsroom or another part of the set. Even watching a reporter introduce a story on a city council thing from the night before, but be standing, live, I front of City Hall at 6 AM is ridiculous. There’s no one there to talk to and it’s something that could easily be done from inside. I realize producers want the appearance on “Johnny-on-the-spot” news, but I just wind up feeling sorry for the Junior reporter who isn’t getting paid enough to deal with that crap…"
Happy!,“the good news is i can still feel my face. the bad news is i wish i couldn’t” Ahahaaaaaaaaa
Happy!,"This has always pissed me off. I don't need a mews station to put a human life at risk to talk about the severe weather that we are both being threatened by. I know there is a hurricane outside. I know there is a tornado outside. I know there are 50 mph winds with 2 feet of snow and a windchill of -50. Even if the reporter wanted to do it, fuck you for trying to be cool and edgy lmao"
Happy!,Why does every news channel do this stupid performative thing for every storm or weather event?  I agree with the sports guy here. WTF
Happy!,At least black ice didn't try to rob him of his balance
Happy!,"This is the most ridiculous thing that news companies do. It won’t stop until one of them dies, and probably on camera."
Happy!,"“I didn’t realize there was another 3:30… in the morning… until today.
The good news is that I can still feel my face right now.”

Lmao"
Happy!,"He's there because broadcast companies are cheap fuckers who run stations at anorexic staff levels. And over the holidays, even the greenest of staffers can wind up anchoring a show or two. There's just nobody else to work now. I don't know much about Allen Media, their parent company but one major one, Nexstar Broadcasting, gave annual raises averaging 1.0-1.5% this year despite making a couple BILLION the last quarter. And from what I've heard from people who have had conversations with their CEO, he is Satan himself."
Happy!,"I'd say he might get fired for his on-air comments, but Byron Allen is his boss (Allen's company owns the station), a former comedian, so if he found it funny, bet he keeps his job!  


Now, if this guy went to school for communications and broadcasting, doesn't matter if he's the sports guy - he's perfectly trained to do remotes."
Happy!,This guy could have co starred in office space.
Happy!,I never understood this. You have cameras mounted around the city you constantly show anyway. Why does some poor schmuck have to stand out there getting his balls frozen off?
Happy!,"Read the twitter comments, dude is loved for his commentary!!! This should have been an ""r/tifu by being funny in a blizzard and now it's my new job""!!!!!"
Happy!,"We don't really need reporters out in the field during snow,rain,etc. We  believe you I can look outside and see"
Happy!,"Well done. Hey kids. It’s 3:30AM. If you’re watching TV, you’re someplace safe and warm. You don’t need me to tell you it sucks to be outside. Unless…. Of course this means you will push your elected leaders for comprehensive reform on how we help those who don’t have this luxury."
Happy!,"Remote reporting in general is beyond stupid and pointless. Remote weather reporting is even dumber, to the point of idiocy.  It's like the ultimate Dog and Pony show, watching the weatherman endure that shit for NO reason."
Happy!,Lmao this was the funniest crowd work stand up I've seen thia year. Entire 8 or whatever minutes was hilarious.  Thanks for sharing
Happy!,"Now, he’s gonna be sent to cover hurricanes, tornados, tsunamis, etc…"
Happy!,Some say he's still out there...
Happy!,“I didn’t realize that there was a 3:30 also in the morning until today” 😂🤣
Happy!,"This really highlights the absurdity and uselessness of modern news and journalism. 

*24 hour news cycle, yeeeeaaaah!!!*"
Happy!,"Well to be fair, it is the dumbest effing thing in the world to have reporters out on streets in strokes, hurricanes etc… it serves no useful purpose. Just stick a damn camera out the window"
Happy!,What a waste of his talents.  He could have been pestering some coach for a meaningless soundbite and instead he's out there talking about the weather.
Happy!,reporting a front of zero craps given from the west on the weather radar here
Happy!,Passive agression!  This guy is my spirit animal...
Happy!,"See guys,  there is a blizzard. The meteorologist wasn’t lying. Can I go home now?"
Happy!,He might lose his job but he’s about to make more money than ever before.
Happy!,I feel like I would see this on an episode of The Newsroom. That was good stuff.
Happy!,"This is the new weather guy. he combines his skills as a sports reporter by covering snowball fights and sled races. 

hilarious, laughed my ass off watching it 3-4 times"
Happy!,Dude should consider a career in stand-up.
Happy!,oooo that made my morning 😝
Happy!,"For context, it’s -40 in parts of Iowa right now."
Happy!,Yeh i feel that shit. Not his job description
Happy!,"Shout out to Theresa Mannion's ""weather report from the end of the world"".

https://youtu.be/e0MMAFKVw-g

""Don't make unnecessary journeys! Don't take risks on treacherous roads!!!"""
Happy!,This guy is funny. I will tune in to watch him be placed in terrible weather and I live in Maine.
Happy!,"I have never understood at all why they make weather people go do that shit anyway, it’s even more absurd to send the sports guy (though admittedly hilarious)"
Happy!,Awesome job my man
Happy!,Why is this a link to a deadline article?
Happy!,"„This is what the set of The Revenant must‘ve felt like. Well, I‘m Leonardo DiCaprio in this scenario, while the unknown camera guy… well, I see a waffle-house right over there; wasn‘t the Yukon all about finding some gold? Only three more hours and I‘m gonna sit there, sip coffee and be right in my domain should a fight break out.“"
Happy!,Please please give him more money and have him do this periodically
Happy!,"I want him to do all the weather, please"
Happy!,Because it is just as stupid and useless as standing out in a hurricane.
Happy!,"Hey Mark, HR is on the phone…"
Happy!,I feel about the same when you asked me 8 minutes ago.
Happy!,Shout out to Iowa my home state
Happy!,"Pure gold!!!!!   I NEVER watch these idiots doing “on the scene” reporting, especially the weather once, but THIS guy right here id pay to watch every night….👍👍👍"
Happy!,This is actually messed up they had him out there for that long. I live in the general area and it was -36 degrees windchill yesterday. I would have been pissed too!
Happy!,This guy is going to be sent to report on the absolute worst weather from now on. Never excel at a job you don’t want
Happy!,"Link:

https://twitter.com/MarkWoodleyTV/status/1605961457337712640?s=20&t=KDpkIpMu9FMUpfIuzyMo3w"
Happy!,"I don’t understand this in general. Weather Channel folks standing in hurricane winds, barely upright. Anderson Cooper or Ali Velshi or any cable folks standing in flood ravaged streets or in the streets after a mass shooting. Do they think we won’t believe these things happened unless they are on the scene? With technology today it could probably be faked anyway."
Happy!,"Breaking News: it’s cold, I’m wet, very pissed, AND I’m having an affair with your wife. Back you to in the studio Thom."
Happy!,The station may have a reasonable argument. Their normal weather guy has to hit the higher volume shows with energy so they are right to pull someone out of bed for the lower rated ones.
Happy!,OP header is perfect for an future segment on John Oliver’s LWT show … And Now This…
Happy!,"And like every sports reporter ever, he's a miserable fucking bastard about it. Always the loudest ones in the room."
Happy!,"Currently -35 in the area, can’t I blame him"
Happy!,This always has to be the shit assignment. Nobody wants to be sent out into a miserable storm.
Happy!,Now all we need is for him to go to Buffalo and stand on a boat under Niagra Falls and do a report
Happy!,well that's a shitty boss to make someone go out to show that it's snowing. Like anyone is awake at 4am watching the news to tell them it's snowing
Happy!,I never understood why news stations sent people to cover blizzards and storms etc. Pretty sure people know how shitty/insane/dangerous it is in the area when bad weather happens. And then to have them tell everyone: “Don’t go out if you don’t have to folks…” is asinine.
Happy!,Give this man control of the entire sports department at KWWL-TV
Happy!,"There was a reason they sent him, and his reporting proved they were right."
Happy!,This is comedy
Happy!,He was great.  He’s definitely going to be sent out to cover more of these weather events.
Happy!,"Wait, why does anyone need to be sent to cover a blizzard at any time of the day? What does that add that they can't get out of weather forecasts etc.?

I honestly thought this was just a thing that happens in cartoons because it's so stupid no one would actually do it."
Happy!,Dude was ready to explode the entire time. Nothing like sarcastic contempt on live TV.
Happy!,"“I’m here with Katherine Hepburn’s mom… tell me, why did you throw the blue heart of the ocean jewel over the railing of the titanic?”"
Happy!,"This is stupid anyways, why do we need someone to go stand in shitty weather and talk about it?"
Luis Miguel - The Series,"I do it as a basis of scheduling.

If I find out a show is cancelled without closure, I don’t bother watching."
Luis Miguel - The Series,"What's difficult for me about this is that the show's that are in their first or second season who inevitably get cancelled, didn't have the viewership to begin with *because* people were waiting for like season 3 or 4 so they can binge it when they have the time and interest in a longer show to enjoy.  


It's a snake eating its own tail. The network/streamer cancels the show that doesn't get ratings vs viewers not watching it as it comes out because they've been burned before by cancelled shows they wait for more content to watch it lol"
Luis Miguel - The Series,"The real abomination is cliffhanger endings. 

When I commit myself to a season of television, I want closure at the end. 

A contrived cliffhanger ending is a cheap and unnecessary trick."
Luis Miguel - The Series,"Finally, some data to hear what I've heard anecdotally A LOT over the last couple of years."
Luis Miguel - The Series,The Babysitters Club was cancelled?! Nooooo! That was such a cute shot of nostalgia
Luis Miguel - The Series,"As someone in the UK, I hate when a show is cancelled with the excuse of poor viewing figures, but it's neither advertised or not available till 6 months after airing in the US if made available at all"
Luis Miguel - The Series,"Well, yeah.

Paper Girls. Good show, didn't deserve to be cancelled. I think we were five episodes in when it was announced, and then just gave up because we just didn't see the point.

The kicker is that it, and hundreds of cancelled shows just like it, are littering streaming services. With every show we choose to watch we have to look up whether it's been cancelled, or if it's popular so we can gauge if it will be cancelled."
Luis Miguel - The Series,"Yeah it depends on the show.  But I will do this for some shows.


My wife is really like this tho, she almost always waits until is finished before watching.  We’ve been burned so many times before especially with Network tv before streaming was big and they’d cancel them mid season smh"
Luis Miguel - The Series,I just wait for 2 seasons before I start watching most shows.
Luis Miguel - The Series,"In reading all of these comments, I find that there is a critical component of the problem that only a few point out: the market is oversaturated. There are too many shows. It's impossible to watch everything all at once. But the studio execs seem to maintain this mentality of making as many large budget shows as possible, in the hopes that a handful will become megahits. 

It's unsustainable."
Luis Miguel - The Series,"\*gasp\*

well imagine that.

constantly cancelling shows after one season becuase they didnt break the ratings in 5 secs has affected viewership.

who could have possibly seen that coming?

im not sure how many /s's to append to this, so just assume infinite sarcasm please."
Luis Miguel - The Series,">A quarter of U.S. adults wait for streaming originals’ finale before starting, citing fears over the show’s potential cancellation with an unresolved ending (27%) or because they do not want to wait for the next season after a cliffhanger (24%). Nearly half (48%) of the participants who said they prefer to wait until the series ends before starting it cited a preference for binge-watching shows."
Luis Miguel - The Series,I've started listening to audio books instead. Considerably less likely just stop before the story is over.
Luis Miguel - The Series,Netflix: I didn’t do fuckin shit. I didn’t rig shit.
Luis Miguel - The Series,"Still mad about OA. And recently, 1899. Fucking hell

And yeah, Mindhunter"
Luis Miguel - The Series,I’m still so mad Dark Crystal Age of Resistance was cancelled.
Luis Miguel - The Series,"I'm looking at you, Netflix!"
Luis Miguel - The Series,"I know it's been going on for decades, but I really wish they would stop making the season finale of a show a cliffhanger. Thankfully not all of them do it. 

There's other ways to wrap story beats up without leaving the viewers hanging with no resolution due to a cancellation. 

This is partly why I don't watch things until I know they have an ending."
Luis Miguel - The Series,"There's  TV Tropes entry for this: [The Firefly Effect](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFireflyEffect). It's been happening for a while, not just with streaming.

I *still* think that streaming doesn't cancel shows any more or less than broadcast TV has ever done or does now, so I don't really feel like it's that big of a deal. 

I strongly suspect that most people in this sub don't understand that there are viewers-per-cost metrics people look very closely at, and chances are your favorite show didn't make the cut. I *do* think they probably wait too short of a time before they make the decision--streaming habits *are* different--but I also think they *know* this. They have more metrics than we every will."
Luis Miguel - The Series,"This is mostly me. If there is a show I am interested on, but it didn't pop off, I won't be watching. However stuff like Rings of Power, Last of Us, Yellowjackets and more are on my list because I know their future is safe. 

Which basically means I watch the mainstream shows and ignore smaller, interesting and maybe even better projects.

And yes, The OA changed my watching habbits."
Luis Miguel - The Series,Only a quarter? That seems a little low
Luis Miguel - The Series,"Yeah cliffhangers at the end of seasons have the exact opposite intended effect... instead of making me drool with
anticipation, i think about the year+ i'll have to wait and i get annoyed. GET TO THE FUCKING POINT

Every season finale should behave as if its a series finale"
Luis Miguel - The Series,Streaming services have spoiled us.  TV shows on networks get canceled all the time.  One of my favorite shows growing up was canceled in the middle of the 2nd season lol.   But what did we do?  We found another show.
Luis Miguel - The Series,Who the hell wants to invest 10+ hours into something with no ending? My time is valuable. Either the networks need to see a show through or they need to tell the writers to make every season completely self-contained.  No cliffhangers and no open ended bullshit.
Luis Miguel - The Series,Especially if that show is on Netflix.  Apple TV on the other hand does a great job of sticking with their titles.
Luis Miguel - The Series,"That’s me, 100%; I’m looking forward to starting Carnival Row this weekend when the last episodes come out. I’ve been burned too many times and I HATE cliffhangers. Finish your story while I am paying attention. Don’t leave me hanging so you can assure I’ll come back next year. Tell a good story and I’ll be counting down the days while telling everyone how great the show is. Drop a cliffhanger and I’m out, and trashing your crap storytelling every chance I get."
Luis Miguel - The Series,"I hate that some shows I love were cancelled after ending with HUGE cliffhangers, but at the same time I don't really regret watching those shows!

Cancelled shows are part of the life cycle of TV, and even though I have a hard time letting go, I can always rewatch things and just be glad that those episodes got made and are available"
Luis Miguel - The Series,"I'd bet  long-arc shows are more at risk of this cancellation phenomena than an old-style ""monster of the week"" show.

If I was a showrunner with a netflix commission I'd get rid of my fancy long arc and switch to an old style show where every episode can stand alone.

With the long arcs viewers want to sit down and digest in big chunks, so they wait until there's an arc completion to get to.  Unfortunately by the time the arc completion is broadcast those ""wait until it's fully baked"" viewers habits have sealed the shows fate by staying away.

This is just some stupid theory I've concocted based on nothing but guesses."
Luis Miguel - The Series,"I feel like everyone forgot the good old days where they would randomly change the time a show aired without warning and then would cancel it mid-season, never to be seen again🤣"
Luis Miguel - The Series,It's funny I made a post about this about a month ago and I was told it wasn't happening.
Luis Miguel - The Series,Unpopular Opinion: most of the stuff that streaming services canceled `early` deserved to be canceled.
Luis Miguel - The Series,"I don’t get this sub sometimes. People complaining about cliffhanger season finales, and yet Severance gets praised, which has a HUGE cliffhanger"
Luis Miguel - The Series,"I've been saying this (not that it's never been said) for a longgggggggggggggg time. It's a toxic relation that dates back to network TV shows. Pilot season starts and network TV shows beg you, with all of their promotional ads, to watch their shows. Give them a chance. Be a loyal viewer. Then when the viewership isn't good enough, which sometimes is based on realistic needs but often seems to be a desire for their show to be the next big hit, they cancel it. Each time it damages the relationship between content producer and viewer. After long enough I was done. I wasn't watching first seasons or even second seasons of shows, I was waiting. 

Then came streaming, it was great at first, but now so many shows get one season or two and then cancelled that I don't start watching. It is even more damaging for streaming because a large part of the value of their subscription service is tied to their library of content. Well, Netflix's library of content is a freaking grave yard of uncompleted series. Who the F\*\*\* wants to start a series that doesn't have any conclusion? It's like libraries only stocking book series that are missing the last 1-3 books of the series and they will never be released. 

So, now I say if streaming wants to survive or thrive they must change their way of business. There's the HBO model: being very picky with what is greenlit for maximum odds of success, investing heavily in the shows so their quality is as high as possible and having a relatively low amount of original programming. HBO pumps out S-tier quality shows but they pump them out slowly because they only put so much on their plate at a time. 

Or, the other option is to overwhelmingly prefer anthologies, mini series, and series that end in 1-3 seasons. From the start, no matter how successful the series, keep series its pre-planned length. [All these shows](https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/coming-soon/new-netflix-series-coming-in-2023-and-beyond/)? 80% or more should be 1-3 seasons long from the planning stage. Increase quality by reducing quantity of episodes. Make each series jam packed with story, character development and reduce fluff, filler and stretching out stories beyond their natural length. Netflix already cancels so many shows after S2 anyways, just make most shows 2 seasons long so their library starts to fill with easily binge-able series that have tight beginning, middles and most importantly; endings.

This would also encourage writers and creators to come to the table with Netflix with more than just a pitch for a pilot and a very loose, general outline and barely an ending. No, come to Netflix with at least most of the first season written and a strong outline for the second season and an even stronger outline for what the ending of the series is going to be. Reducing the ""up in the air, we'll write it as we go along, we'll make changes based on focus group testing's and how the viewers are reacting"" should help increase quality of series as well. 

I would also mention I imagine Netflix would all of a sudden become a very desirable place for writers and showrunners to want to work again. Instead of never knowing their shows numbers and being on edge expecting cancellation after their second season, they would know Netflix is the place to bring your mini series, 1-3 season long story or anthology story and get to make it, completely."
Luis Miguel - The Series,I do this. Too many shows have burned me
Luis Miguel - The Series,I haven't started a new show in my favorite genre since the OA was cancelled. Just realized it actually
Luis Miguel - The Series,I'm more and more in this boat. I'm not going to take the limited time I have to invest in a series that's going to end prematurely and without a real ending.
Luis Miguel - The Series,"I'm a weirdo


I usually watch 1-2 episodes to see if I like it, then I will wait until the season is over so I know it actually had a finale"
Luis Miguel - The Series,I’m still pissed about Last Man on Earth
Luis Miguel - The Series,I love how the algorithm introduced me to Tuca and Bertie’s existence AFTER it got cancelled. Thank goodness for Adult Swim. The only animation that’s safe on Netflix these days is freaking Big Mouth.
Luis Miguel - The Series,"More shows need to be like Dark. 3 seasons, complete story, satisfying ending."
Luis Miguel - The Series,i wont watch attack on titan until it is done
Luis Miguel - The Series,here's to 22 more seasons of stargate
Luis Miguel - The Series,Last man on earth 😭😢😭
Luis Miguel - The Series,This is the way.
Luis Miguel - The Series,"I don’t even start watching a show until there is like 3 to 5 episodes out, so I can spread them out until the final. 

I blame the writers and how they write. You 10 episodes season but you only have enough material for 6 episodes. So you come up with a bunch bullshit filler. So you will have like 6 episodes really good and 4 bullshit filler episodes."
Luis Miguel - The Series,Sad about Pantheon never getting marketed properly or at all and getting cancelled. It supposedly had a second season that was already produced but might never get released.
Luis Miguel - The Series,I actually started this practice way before streaming was a thing. #Firefly
Luis Miguel - The Series,"I mean lately it seems like I find out shows exist when I see an article about them being axed. These companies aren’t giving things enough of a chance at all. If it’s good, people will find it, but not every show is going to be number 1 and go totally viral the first week."
Luis Miguel - The Series,The whole point of Netflix was always binge watching. It is what sets streaming apart from cable TV.
Luis Miguel - The Series,And people said that this wouldn't happen.
Luis Miguel - The Series,"I used to disagree with this idea of waiting, but the cancellation of Reboot (Hulu) was the last straw for me. Give me a real finale, and I’ll watch the whole show start to finish. Otherwise I’m not getting invested"
Luis Miguel - The Series,"Why are smaller streamers not buying rights to these shows and making follow-up seasons?

Surely ratings/viewings that are ""too low"" for Netflix or HBO would work fine for others."
Luis Miguel - The Series,Show runners who write cliffhanger season endings should be fucking fired
Luis Miguel - The Series,"Frankly, it strikes me as that so many people still watch stuff week to week."
Luis Miguel - The Series,My cousin's been doing this for years after Netflix cancelled a show he liked.
Luis Miguel - The Series,"Lmao yeah it’s not hard to understand. People in US like to act like we’re the only people who exist, but other countries still do the classic broadcasting format and get good ratings. UK (BBC specifically I believe) have like at least 3 prime time drama series that get good consistent ratings cause they’ve been on for like 20+ years. Why do you think the highest rated US series are NCIS, Law and Order, CSI, Greys Anatomy, etc.? Cause all those shows came out during a time where networks weren’t trigger happy to cancel everything, and are still going. Why do you think most modern network series get canceled today? Because that’s the expectation they set"
Luis Miguel - The Series,"Yes Netflix, I am not watching your shows anymore until I know they aren't going to be cancelled. And then you cancel them because no one is watching because they are waiting to see if you cancel the show. Nice little problem you've created for yourself by over green lighting things in an effort to stay on top."
Luis Miguel - The Series,"Right it's not exec bros that don't know what they're doing, it's the viewrship's fault."
Luis Miguel - The Series,"This just in - ""Show business execs are detached from reality, and don't give a fuck about what the viewers want."""
Luis Miguel - The Series,/#SaveTheOA
Luis Miguel - The Series,"This is them reaping what they sow by ending each season on a cliffhanger.

Stop doing that so at least we can feel GOOD when we've watched that one season of a show."
Luis Miguel - The Series,"Yeah, the whole “release an episode a week” just stops me from watching a show. I cancel the service and forget. Then remember a year later, and watch the whole in a week or whatever."
Luis Miguel - The Series,"I just don’t like having to wait week to week for that shit, and prefer to wait until all episodes are available so I can binge at my leisure. Sorry but Netflix spoiled me, so F your “watercooler talk” BS argument."
Luis Miguel - The Series,Looking at Netflix mainly
Luis Miguel - The Series,Television exists to sell ads.  Period.  The shows are mindless fodder.  Networks give zero fecks about YOUR entertainment.  Toss the TV remote and go fly a kite.  Or take walk.
Luis Miguel - The Series,That’s me.
Luis Miguel - The Series,"Yeah you dumb dorks at Netflix. That's why your views hip is shrinking, you're untrustworthy"
Luis Miguel - The Series,"Yeah, I won't start most shows. Unless I know its going to atleast given a chance. Been burned too many times."
Luis Miguel - The Series,"Wow, what a shocking news story. They could’ve titled this “The thing everyone has been saying for years is true.”"
Luis Miguel - The Series,I don’t start any new show until at least season 2
Luis Miguel - The Series,I wait years to watch anything now. I’m not going to get into something just to never have it finished.
Luis Miguel - The Series,If a show doesn’t have two seasons I don’t bother anymore. I don’t have Netflix for this exact reason. They either cancel or take two years for a new season.
Luis Miguel - The Series,"If you told people that tv used to be 22-26 episodes a season and a wait of a few months for the next season it’ll blow their mind.

Now it’s 10 episodes or less and several years to wait for the next season."
Luis Miguel - The Series,[deleted]
Luis Miguel - The Series,That’s a heck of a last sentence. Big twist ending there.
Luis Miguel - The Series,I’ve gotten really good at giving up on bad series or waiting until multiple seasons are out.
Luis Miguel - The Series,"I also love a good binge…

Edit: Except for mandalorian. I watch every episode and can’t wait for the next one. Same with the lord of the rings series, so good! Can’t wait to the end."
Luis Miguel - The Series,I do this with a lot of science fiction type shows on major networks. Too many times I have gotten invested in a show only for it to be cancelled season 1.
Luis Miguel - The Series,This is half of it. I also don't waste time watching anything that gets poor reviews.
Luis Miguel - The Series,I often wait for a full season to be out to start watching a new show.
Luis Miguel - The Series,I can't dedicate enough time to TV shows to bother with something that I either won't get closure on or have to wait months or years at a time for the next step.
Luis Miguel - The Series,"I guess I am one of those who wait as I am not a ""diehard"" viewer of most shows, ""hot"" or not.   I can just sit it out, wait for the ruckus to die down, then catch it later. As dedicated viewers breathlessly wait for each episode of The Last of Us. or whatever is hot at the moment,  I am one of those who simply add the show to my queue, to be watched at some future date. 

I never realized my viewing habits had life or death ramifications for at risk series. Goodness!"
Luis Miguel - The Series,"I usually watch as the episodes come out, sometimes I’ll wait a few weeks. It depends on how much time I have. I spend all of it looking for work now."
Luis Miguel - The Series,I’m not afraid of cancellation. I’m afraid that I’ll start watching a show tomorrow and it will continue for ten years with a lackluster resolution.
Luis Miguel - The Series,"I typically don't watch new shoes until they are old shows now. If it REALLY popular, I'll catch up to watch the last season live (Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones to name a few)"
Luis Miguel - The Series,"I've been doing this for years. I wait for whole seasons at a time to finish with animes i want to watch. like My Hero Academia and Attack on Titan. I watched the first seasons of these but now i'm waiting and will them all over again.

same with Demon Slayer and Shield Hero. 

SO MANY animes will start and literally never finish. There are so many 1-3 season shows that just stop without a proper end. There's literally no point in watching them. It really sucks. no I don't want to read about what happens next.

then occassionally some will end up getting a new season after 5-15 freaking years...and then end on a cliffhanger again.

Some will have over 100 episodes and and just stop without a proper end. It's annoying as hell. Same with old shows that ended in the 90's. Sliders just stops and ends on a horrible cliff hanger. Moeisha ends with her little brother being kidnapped by lil Kim or something and it's never concluded.

There should be a law that canceled and airing shows should be allowed to have at the very least 5 episodes to try and conclude. And if it's canceled after a season is over, they get 10 episodes."
Luis Miguel - The Series,Very few shows do I watch week by week. Mostly I wait for the season to end and watch at my leisure. Because screw cliffhangers and waiting for a show.
Luis Miguel - The Series,Yep. Stopped watching plenty in the middle of a season because it was cancelled. Not worth it to me and it’s a dumb thing to include in if you continue to produce a show.
Luis Miguel - The Series,"I’m the same way when it comes to books in a series. Thank you, George RR Martin and Patrick Rothfuss."
Luis Miguel - The Series,"Same behavior here.  I usually wait until the next season starts before I'll watch the previous season.  Some days, I want to watch a couple of episodes.

When it gets canceled, I end up losing interest."
Luis Miguel - The Series,"For me, if I have to wait a whole week for the next episode it increases the chances that I may not get around to watching it. And if I miss a week, I probably won't bother to watch anymore. I have to REALLY be into a show to schedule time to watch it, and I can't think of more than two or three shows in my whole life that I ever watched all of."
Luis Miguel - The Series,"Streaming services are just graveyards now for shows cancelled after 1/2 seasons, especially Netflix."
Luis Miguel - The Series,netflix in particular gave everyone severe trust issues
Luis Miguel - The Series,I just procrastinate and rewatch the same cartoons over and over again while I browse Reddit and tiktok.
Luis Miguel - The Series,This tracks with me. I'm no longer willing to commit my time to incomplete projects. I'll wait to hear whether or not the series was given a final season to close the story.
Luis Miguel - The Series,I definitely think twice about starting a show simply because so many get cancelled...so many good ones too.
Luis Miguel - The Series,I’m kinda leaning towards doing this because I’ve been burnt more than I’ve liked lately. I’ll still tune in for bigger shows that I know won’t be cancelled like House of the Dragon or TLOU.
Luis Miguel - The Series,"I've been doing this for ages.

If shows would actually wrap up a season I'd be willing to get into them while they are ongoing. Even if I'd like more, and there's some threads dangling, I could be OK with things mostly wrapped up at the end of the season. But no, the networks seem obsessed with cliffhanger endings. Which then go unresolved when the show is cancelled.

I stopped watching current shows as soon as the cliffhanger endings became common."
Luis Miguel - The Series,"I watch anime. True, many anime don't get a second season, and that's based on them being long ads for the manga/light novel source material."
Luis Miguel - The Series,"Duh, there is no reason to trust streaming services to finish a show, not even finish it well if they finish it at all. I’ll wait for years before watching a show I want to see. If almost everyone says it ends poorly I’ll just read all the plot points and skip watching it."
The Letdown,"In couldn't read the article.  Clicking ""continue reading"" did nothing for me.

Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed the second season.  It expanded the lore of everything while keeping the mystery Android unknown elements of the monsters.  

There were definitely weaker moments, and the story was a bit more disjointed.  It was not distracting to me at all.  Outside of Eleven's road trip, everything tired into the main story and had consequences.

I felt closer to the characters this time around, and I think that pulled me in more.  The first season killed it with Winona Ryder, but this second season have more characters emotional moments making them feel more likely real people.

This is just my take.  I liked it.  "
The Letdown,5 Episodes in and Eleven still hasn't meet up with the gang. Sure it'll be a grand entrance but kinda bummed they'll have limited screen time together
The Letdown,The only thing I didn’t really like was Nancy suddenly deciding that she didn’t love Steve but other than that I feel the good far far far out ways the bad
The Letdown,"I agree that certain things disappointed me, I can hardly say the bad outweighed the good. A lot of stuff was handled really well and emotions were so high this season. "
The Letdown,I just finished season 2 and I thought it was boring :(
The Letdown,"I get the feeling that either a lot of editors are telling their reviewers to find something negative to say about Stranger Things 2.  Either that, or a lot of writers are stretching to find a hot take.  

Like, from this article: 

> the heroes are able to save the day thanks to Dustin’s bond with the monster. How many damn movies have that exact premise?

I don't know, how many?  I'm honestly trying to think of one that fits."
The Letdown,"> Outside of Eleven's road trip, everything tired into the main story and had consequences.

I mean, Eleven's road trip didn't go overboard tying itself in to the *plot*, but it was pretty important for El's character development.  There was a GQ article where the author described it as ""maybe one of the worst episodes in television history,"" which is just ridiculous."
The Letdown,Fans of Twin Peaks: The Return should feel right at home with ST2 then.
The Letdown,No proof but I think her lack of screentime with the rest of the cast might have something to do with her father becoming her agent and demanding a bunch of batshit crazy shit.  She was almost not back at all because of the contract disputes he started.
The Letdown,"Yeah pretty sure it was just because the actress is dating a different actor on the show. Would have been better if it wasn't so forced and sudden, really just poorly done.  "
The Letdown,That critique is definitely overboard.  It was far from terrible.  I don't think it was particularly bad.  It was just a change in tone and plot from the rest of the show.
The Letdown,Janey-e Hopper
The Letdown,"If this is the case, then kudos to the writers because, not knowing any of this, I never even suspected it wasn't an intentional creative decision"
The Letdown,the pilot episode was hilarious. i should go back and watch the rest
The Letdown,Never heard of this but it looks hilarious- thanks for the recommendation!
The Letdown,[removed]
The Letdown,Watergate would have been a scandal for 5 minutes in 2022 because far worse shit happens on a daily basis.
The Letdown,"In another universe Hollywood execs would cast Julia as Harriet Tubman 

https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/20/entertainment/julia-roberts-harriet-tubman-trnd/index.html"
The Letdown,"No wonder so many celebrities drink and use drugs, when they have to open their morning papers to headlines like that."
The Letdown,It sucks if this show sucks.  The Martha Mitchell story is truly one of the most incredible and insane stories in Washington history and deserves a good movie made about it.
The Letdown,They said the same about pam and tommy though and I thought that was amazing and great acting.
The Letdown,I'm enjoying it. 🤷
The Letdown,"FYI: this is the ONLY bad review for the show. 

The show currently at 73 on metacritic with 17 positive reviews, 2 mixed and 1 negative"
The Letdown,"I think Julia Roberts was one of the more overrated actors of her era, personally.  I never really got the buzz about her."
The Letdown,Watergate seems so quaint these days.
The Letdown,"Looks like this review is something of an outlier and other are more positive. Still excited to check out the show.
https://www.metacritic.com/tv/gaslit/season-1"
The Letdown,"I think Julia Roberts is hit and miss.
In some she is fenomenaal, others (mostly where humor or romance is involved ) she does not deliver."
The Letdown,"Julia Roberts sounding like she's in Gone With The wind sucks- Bad acting, ridiculous dialogue

&#x200B;

Bad casting- Unwatchable tripe"
The Letdown,How come the young woman that opens the film with John Dean in bed isn’t credited on IMDB? She had several lines. And 144 other actors are credited?
The Letdown,[deleted]
The Letdown,There was a story a long time ago about Sean Penn being furious about people on set being unvaccinated and I said he was just gaslighting everyone because he was unvaccinated and it still gets on my nerves today that people downvoted it angrily and didn't get it. Just had to share.
The Letdown,Julia Roberts isn’t capable of being a letdown. Best of our time.
The Letdown,I guess the audience didn't like being.....ass tit
The Letdown,Going by the trailers I thought this was a comedy. Lmao.
The Letdown,"What would be a show you’d recommend? Pit of all her acting I thought she did very nicely in the show. But I know people who share your opinion about her acting, especially about romcoms too 😅"
The Letdown,Cool shades at least.
The Letdown,Has he melted his Oscar yet?
The Letdown,Never go full Julia Roberts
The Letdown,"If you havent already, find  The 6 part watergate documentary 'Slow Burn' and check out the [Martha Mitchell segment](https://www.epix.com/series/slow-burn/season/1/episode/1/slow-burn-s1-e1). I was lucky enough to have a mom who actually took me to a day of the Watergate hearings when i was between 5th & 6th grade, so i have a high level of interest in the topic."
The Letdown,"I have to wonder if its 'bad' on purpose. A lot of the players are long dead but but a few of the Nixon circle like Dick Cheney are still alive, and todays' GOP power players like Trump revered Nixon."
The Letdown,And you thought right!
The Letdown,"Considering Early reviewers seem to be hand picked by studios to deliver favorable reviews, that really isn't that impressive.  The way the studios have manipulated the process, it really is no wonder people often are more interested in the negative reviews, because they do seem much more rare.

Gaslit won't be released until tomorrow, and then we'll start getting real reviews I imagine."
The Letdown,"> 73 on metacritic

doesn't equal ""I should watch this"" in my book."
The Letdown,She was great In Erin Brockovich and Stepmom
The Letdown,Have you seen Notting Hill and/or Pretty Woman? Can you not see the charisma shooting out the screen?
The Letdown,Notting Hill
The Letdown,Just watched ep1. She’s playing the exact character from Charlie Wilson’s War
The Letdown,"As with Keanu, her appeal is not about the acting.

Few Hollywood megastars are actually about the acting, really. Some people have the IT factor, the ability to uncannily appeal to a broad audience simply for being THEM. And a lot of actual great actors don't necessarily have IT either (in fact most do not), while some who are not great, do. Julia balanced that tightrope perfectly in the 90s. Women of a certain age just found her really easy to relate to during that decade."
The Letdown,They didn't like eric being the better actor
The Letdown,"She was more of a movie star than an actor, and she was a great one."
The Letdown,Phenomenal
The Letdown,I think she's usually a decent actress. Almost certainly miscast in this role though.
The Letdown,"Her work has been too sparse in recent years for her to get back into a groove  as a performer. I still see the charisma now and then, but it isn't there as much as in her prime."
The Letdown,"Good acting, not so good Arkansas accent."
The Letdown,"Allie Marie Evans as Francesca, she is credited on IMDb for the first episode. Maybe they updated it"
The Letdown,"What I thought was interesting is that this review is coming from the Washington Post.  Mind you, Nixon resigned because he knew what he had done, but this paper arguably forced him to do it.  

If WaPo wants to weigh in on a Watergate recreation, there's no better paper to do it.  They have the institutional memory still there."
The Letdown,"Penn helped organize a drive-by vaccine clinic at Dodger Stadium during the height of the pandemic.  I get that often he's in the headlines for all the wrong reasons, but I also respect that he's one of the few celebrities who isn't a ""limousine liberal"" and actually sticks his neck out to fight for what he believes in."
The Letdown,"If what you're saying is true that seems more like virtue signalling or hypocrisy than gaslighting, which isn't good either, but trying to get people to get vaccinated is still a positive thing even if he isn't vaccinated himself. It doesn't really matter what his reasons are"
The Letdown,"It is, partly"
The Letdown,"If the GOP had that kind of power over Hollywood, they would have stopped the thing from getting made at all.  There's enough bad Hollywood for organic reasons that make it difficult to assume that any bad Hollywood production is due to GOP influence.

As a sidenote, you're absolutely right about Trump's reverence for Nixon.  The goon who was tasked with abducting and holding Martha Mitchell against her will went on to be appointed as Ambassador to the Czech Republic by Trump."
The Letdown,It’s kind of ironic how the OP is trying to gaslight you into think that a show named gaslit is amazing
The Letdown,you mean she stole Oscar from Ellen burystyn for her performance in requiem for a dream
The Letdown,"I'd like to share some of her acting from Stepmom. 

Granted, she's working with Susan Sarandon but this scene gets me choked up every time I see it. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0st_flVPeg)"
The Letdown,"loved her top rom coms--mystic pizza, my best friend's wedding, pretty woman (notting hill sucks tho)."
The Letdown,"I saw Pretty Woman, and she was good in that, but I didn't see more Charisma than other big female actresses of her era.  Maybe I'm just not a big Rom-Com fan, and that appears to be her wheelhouse."
The Letdown,I guess I just never saw the IT factor with Julia Roberts the way I see it with other stars.
The Letdown,Keanu is such a great and wholesome guy...he deserves everything he's gotten and more.
The Letdown,"Julia roberts should have played the titular character in IT.  She does it all; African American folk heroes, homicidal Clown monsters, other things…"
The Letdown,"To each their own I guess.  To me she was always a big horse faced bag of meh, and someone whose movies I generally avoided unless there was another compelling reason to watch."
The Letdown,"Notice the two As as well, he reverted to Dutch for that one word only, lol."
The Letdown,"Probably,
But I think she should do drama or thriller.
At least serious stuff.
She's imho not comedymaterial"
The Letdown,Thanks. She stole the show.
The Letdown,"To be fair, though this story is about Watergate, it's also about how WaPo got scooped on Watergate by Helen Thomas of UPI, but no one believed it.

WaPo has been eating free for years on the reputation that they were the ones who broke Watergate.  There's incentive for them to not have the historical record updated about that."
The Letdown,So he was vaccinated or not? Idk
The Letdown,"As someone who works for producers I can tell you they’re very enthusiastic GOP supporters.
They hate our union and paying taxes"
The Letdown,"> If the GOP had that kind of power over Hollywood, they would have stopped the thing from getting made at all. 

Oh, they have a lot more clout in Hollywood than you may think."
The Letdown,"Yes, damn auto-correct
Usually it does it job."
The Letdown,"People don’t realize how many GOP and Trump-cult folks are making a fortune in Hollywood.  I know a couple of them.  People like Ben S. we’re essentially created and bank rolled by LA showbiz producer types.  Aggressively pro-cop shows (Blue Bloods, etc.) and Authoritarian things like “24” are created and written by right-wingers."
The Letdown,Don't disrespect Scooby Doo like that.
The Letdown,"The last episode, for me, undermined everything the show had built up to.

Not only was Meyer not actually Meyer, but fucking Adolf is still alive and The Colonel is Eva fucking Braun. 

And weirdly, even knowing that ""the hunt"" is not, in fact, a ""Jewish tradition"" as ""Meyer"" told Jonah, but Jonah still takes up the mantle. The whole show was playing with this idea that Meyer was going farther and farther (even if I think the moral lines of the shows characters shifted from nearly scene-to-scene). 

It was leading you to question the intentions of the Hunters. Whether The Hunt made them like the Nazis they were hunting. But then it just ignores that question entirely, Meyer is the Boogeyman, but it doesn't really matter or lead anyone to question what they've been doing and Jonah just decides to lead them anyway."
The Letdown,"I just want to know one thing, does Josh Radnor play a big part on the show ?"
The Letdown,"Hunters Plot Cycle:

1. Everyone says Jonah doesn't belong because he's just a kid.
2. Everyone lets Jonah on a mission.
3. Jonah makes a mission critical mistake/or gets his ass beat like a drum because he's a kid. 
4. Flashback.
5. Jonah solves a puzzle.
6. Repeat."
The Letdown,"So disappointed with this show, I've been watching it in the background because my mom likes it, but the writing is terrible, the protagonist is unlikeable, and it just feels like a knock off inglorious bastards with the shitty ugly  yellow netflix filter on it. What a waste of a cast, thought this was going to be like mindhunter with Nazi hunters and instead we get pulp violence and Scooby doo cast of characters."
The Letdown,Haven’t seen the show but that’s got to be the most scooby doo thing ever.
The Letdown,What’s wrong with scooby doo?
The Letdown,"I actually loved the ending, but hey thats just me"
The Letdown,A waste of some of the best collection of character actors I have ever seen assembled.  This COULD have been a masterpiece. All the talent was there. There is so much bad showrunning ruining entertainment right now.
The Letdown,"I found the show too comic book 

I would like to see a show about the real-life Avengers (Nakam): a group of 50 concentration camp survivors whose stated aim was to kill 6 million Germans as retribution for the Holocaust.  They tried to poison the Nuremburg water supply"
The Letdown,"Couldn't get through the first episode. Bailed at the sadistic and unnecessary ""chess match"" scene. Reassuring to know that I'm not the only person who felt it isn't great episodic TV ..."
The Letdown,"legit thank you for posting this, if I'd watched this entire show only for that to be the twist ending I'd be kind of furious."
The Letdown,"Anyone else confused about the timeline?

Safta gets knocked up after the war presumably, 1945 at the earliest.

To make Jonah 19 in 1977, he had to be born in 1958ish, right? That would make his mom pregnant at 13? Really?"
The Letdown,"I haven't watched the series as I hated the tone of the trailers and also the reviews were awful. But my curiosity peaked after your post and decided to read about the finale. It's so bad!!! Face transplant, Hitler alive with aryan clones as children in Argentina? 

What a mess."
The Letdown,I've only watched the first episode but you're saying that How I Met your Nazi has a bad ending.  hmmmmmm
The Letdown,"as soon as you realize that they were going for a pure camp, Hunters becomes a very enjoyable and fun show tbh"
The Letdown,"I watched with my cousin. In the middle of the second episode when the main character once against make the same exact mistake he made in the first episode, we looked at each other and had to stop it. What a waste of time. One of the biggest disappointment I've ever had."
The Letdown,Well you just saved me several hours of free time.
The Letdown,"The reviews are disappointing, I had high hopes for the show. Logan Lerman is a cutie, even though I feel like a Mary Kay for saying that."
The Letdown,"My problem with the series is one that has been iterated by columnists and critics. It doesn't know what it wants to be. It struggles to juggle between a fun revenge-style flick like ""Inglorious Basterds"" and a somber homage like ""Schindler's List"" and ""Munich"". It doesn't have an identity that is consistent. The asinine twist ending was clearly a symptom of the inconsistent characterization and writing, and also a bit of a bummer since we won't be seeing Al again. Furthermore, some of the moral implications the show deals with are so banal and cliche. The vengeful acts committed by a ragtag band of Holocaust avengers are incomparable to the henious atrocities of the Nazis. And that whole scene where Jonah is talked down from killing Travis falls flat, because the whole ""doing these things makes you as bad as the people you're against"" isn't even relevant when all you've done are some vigilante actions in comparison to people who have the blood of millions on their hands. Any attempts at moral equivalency the show makes are insipid. As a Jew myself, I must say that Jewish philosophy is portrayed well, but the struggles in the plot aren't. I'm frankly disappointed because it had a lot of promise in the beginning."
The Letdown,"Totally agree w/ OP. I was stoked on this show until they just flopped into an absurd amount of intrigue at the end. They really jumped the shark with the Meyer/Wolf twist. I mean, it was hard getting through the central conceit to begin with, but the original formula was working well enough until they decided to abandon all respect for the audience entirely. I won’t be watching any season 2 if there is one"
The Letdown,I too felt the 2nd season to be both cringeworthy & laughable. Hitler? Really That old trope hasn't been done to death yet? Eva turns? All of it so horrible as to be almost unwatchable. The prison army was legit scarey tho. Sad to see the 2nd season is such a let down.
Aggretsuko,Season 5 will be the show's final season.
Aggretsuko,The show was better when it was about an office worker not some pop idol or billionaire dating drama.
Aggretsuko,"Also feels like there's less metal growling now. Oh well, I'm still gonna watch it"
Aggretsuko,"Yeah... It's a shame, the show *really* went off the rails fast. Now in season 4 they're doing literal mission impossible style heists to try to put their corrupt CEO in jail? Aggretsuko attacks him with a literal laser and they both fall out the window of a skyscraper?? Like WTF???"
Aggretsuko,"Yeah, that was the cool premise. A quiet office lady who takes her rage out at a dingy karaoke bar. As soon as the story became about all the other stuff, the core premise fell to the side."
Aggretsuko,I am ready for the [best girl with best laugh](https://youtu.be/sxGzm8UV57w) to return.
Aggretsuko,Hope we get more Fenneko
Aggretsuko,Hopefully Haida gets over retsuko and find himself a nice boyfriend
Aggretsuko,[deleted]
Aggretsuko,🤘
Aggretsuko,"It’s not prestige by any means, but I love this show. It’s so easy to watch, relatable, and well written."
Aggretsuko,Perfection.
Aggretsuko,"The dub is surprisingly good for a show so mired in Japanese culture, it captures the spirit of the original Japanese voice acting pretty well."
Aggretsuko,I think they are both about equal.
Aggretsuko,Personal preference is what I'd say.  I'm usually a sub guy for anime but found the dub for this quite good.
Aggretsuko,Both
Aggretsuko,"I just want the red panda to be happy, is that too much to ask?"
Aggretsuko,"Aggretsuko's so far turned out to be a pretty compelling adult drama, I think if more people gave it a chance they'd find that even non-anime fans would find it relatable.  Looking forward to season 3!"
Aggretsuko,"Guess they're not even giving a taste of the music until the shoe comes out. Either way, can't wait."
Aggretsuko,"It’s not about the socks, mom!!!!"
Aggretsuko,Finally
Aggretsuko,[Here is the Japanese language trailer with English subtitles for anyone who would prefer it.](https://youtu.be/Ak9plYM15cw)
Aggretsuko,I have no idea why I tried to watch the first season there is nothing about it from the outside as a 37year old man that seems it would be for me but I think its brilliant.
Aggretsuko,I'm three episodes in and I'm already addicted.
Aggretsuko,"I like the workplace comedy, but the songs are the absolute best part of this show.

There’s something awesome about a cartoon panda growling out “choke on my rage!”

Overall, the show is kind of crazy.

It’s like Sanrio figured out that this was a sizable demographic of their superfans and created a Sanrio-style cartoon that speaks to them directly.

My only complaint is that the English subtitles don’t match the English dub, and if you turn the subtitles off, you won’t understand some of the signs and songs. "
Aggretsuko,Just finished episode work color me intrigued. Love the bad bitch stride part
Aggretsuko,"> tfw no yandere red panda gf

Why even live?"
Aggretsuko,The english dub is really good.
Aggretsuko,Just binged all the episodes now I got to wait till season 2 ;\(
Aggretsuko,Love that catchy goofy tune it plays throughout the show that sounds like kazoos.
Aggretsuko,Did you know that protein yoga teacher is a female!? 
Aggretsuko,I'm not sure if it's intentional but I love nod to system of a down at the end of the intro theme [They're trying to build a prison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yndfqN1VKhY)
Aggretsuko,"Binged this whole show in one sitting. Really enjoyed it, it felt light hearted and warm yet genuine. I'm really holding out for a second season now."
Aggretsuko,just saw the english trailer and it had some dogshit hardcore song going instead of this 
Aggretsuko,">new

I was watching this on youtube like two years ago..."
Aggretsuko,This might be my new favorite Netflix series.
Aggretsuko,For a show with such a simple animation style it's amazing how much deeper it goes into life as a 20-something and the disappointments of that follow.
Aggretsuko,There was a series before this one (100 * 1 minutes episodes or something like that) but I can't seem to find it.
Aggretsuko,Sooooo...  It's a Detroit Metal City rip-off for furries.  Okay...
Aggretsuko,"I just finished binging the entire thing.

It got even stronger as it went.

Hope Netflix renews it!"
Aggretsuko,.....Protein?
Aggretsuko,"I'm actually glad that if I watch in Japanese, I won't get dubtitles.

They should really have separate dub and sub English subtitle tracks at this point tho."
Aggretsuko,">It’s like Sanrio figured out that this was a sizable demographic of their superfans and created a Sanrio-style cartoon that speaks to them directly.

This struck me as well and I really appreciated it. 29, work in an office, have been thinking recently that it's too hard to find shows I personally relate to."
Aggretsuko,"I’ve watched it with dub and sub simultaneously and honesty the English dub dialogue seems better, just funnier lines overall and makes more sense.  "
Aggretsuko,"If you turn the subs off and only listen to dub, the signs and such are still subbed. They translated some of the realities and puns from japanese to an western lifestyle and I enjoyed the dub more."
Aggretsuko,It’s better than the subs easily and I’m watching it with both.  
Aggretsuko,"Hipster.

Just kidding. But the Netflix series is new.

Those were video shorts and these are 15 minutes episodes with a 10 episode story arc."
Aggretsuko,I bet that just makes you furrious.
Aggretsuko,everything with death metal in it is a dmc rip-off
Aggretsuko,"I hope so too! When Resasuke steps into his room and says, “I’m home.” my heart broke. I need to know how his story plays out in the grand scheme of things. 

Are the one minute shorts streaming anywhere?"
Aggretsuko,Protein!
Aggretsuko,"Ah okay, good to know!"
Aggretsuko,"I almost felt like that was a good ending to his character as far as the show goes. He clearly doesn't have enough in common with Retsuko to hang out with her, but the plant thing shows that everyone, even bland space cadet Resasuke, has quirks and individualities that might not be apparent from the outside. So, while I certainly wish him the best in life and hope he finds happiness (then again who's to say he isn't happy? He seemed to take the breakup really well) he's kinda fulfilled his purpose in the story."
Aggretsuko,"Forget bland Resasuke, I want more of Fenneko! Absolutely loved her ""selfie, dessert, latte art"" bit holyyy cow"

Aggretsuko,"This may have been the perspective I needed. I liked him so much, despite his being a poor fit for Retsuko. I just want him to be happy and I’m not sure why that scene stabbed me in the heart. Thank you. Your comment was wicked helpful to me ❤️"
Aggretsuko,Glad I could help! I liked him too because really he's the character that I identify with the most.

Aggretsuko,"After Devilman Crybaby, I want Netflix to push for more anime. "
Aggretsuko,It looks like that Ultraman series is based on the manga reboot. Nice. 
Aggretsuko,"Wait, wait, wait... Ultraman isn't a live action show? Besides lacking his iconic egg-shaped eyes, the poster makes it look like he's not giant-sized. Is he still going to fight kaiju? What is going on here?"
Aggretsuko,The new shows don't sound like something I want to watch; but I enjoyed Aggretsuko. 
Aggretsuko,"Reading up on Kengan it sounds less like it was ""ordered"" and more like it was already getting made and Netflix picked up the licensing rights.

Pretty much sounds like Killing Bites without the fanservice or the fun facts about honey badgers."
Aggretsuko,netflix animes have been absolute garbage (except devilman crybaby) 
Aggretsuko,Aggretsuko is terrible

Spy Kids: Mission Critical,I miss George Carlin. I would love to hear his take
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,Didn't he end the Chappelle show in part because he realized he was telling jokes so that affluent white people could laugh at poor black people?
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"This dude’s whole act has turned into an argument with the comments section. 

“I don’t give a shit what they say on twitter. Twitter isn’t real!”

*thunderous applause*

“Now let me spend the next ten years arguing with shit people said on twitter that made me mad.”"
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,He's free to make the jokes. He just shouldn't expect to not be criticised. Same with any joke regarding any topic.
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"For a comedian, Chappelle takes himself awfully seriously."
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"Am I out of touch?    

No, it's the children who are wrong."
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"It's weird to me that Dave left his show in large part because he wasn't sure if the comedy he was doing was good or bad for his community.

""He started to feel like the show sometimes reinforced racial stereotypes instead of satirizing them, and he felt ashamed since some of his jokes were having an effect he did not intend.""

And here he is just being a prick against a marginalized group for no reason."
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,How is criticism “oppression”? That is some thin skin.
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,[deleted]
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"I thought this guy was a victim of ""cancel culture"", yet his voice is louder and his pockets are deeper than ever????"
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"As Kevin Brennan said to Chapelle, Dave sure it a bit of a bitch for someone who has a special called Sticks and Stones."
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,He's sure picked an odd hill
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"FTA: “But at the same time, he declares The Closer a “masterpiece,” adding, unironically, “I challenge all my peers to make its equal. They cannot, I am sure. It will be decades before you ever see someone in my genre as proficient as me. I am maybe a once-in-a-lifetime talent.”

…is he seriously saying that with a straight face? That is some Kanye West level delusion.

Like, that statement reads like a Chapelle *parody* of something Kanye would say.

Also FTA: “He then extends that challenge to the students themselves. “If you have a better idea, then express it, and you can beat me,” Chappelle says. “It’s that easy. If you have more talent than me, then display it, and you can beat me.”

Literally challenging children to a contest of “talent”, while casually dropping “talent” as the end-all-be-all deciding factor in who “wins”. Not hard work, not chance or circumstance. Just pure talent.

What an absolute tool."
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"Why are rich comedians so easily offended? I thought they were supposed to ""tell it like it is & don't care how you feel"" meanwhile they whine about it"
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,I’m so tired of this guy jerking himself off all the time like he’s *soooooooo* important.
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,I’m beginning to think Dave is just an asshole.
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"Good lord, I’m struggling to think of an entertainer that I once held in such high regard that I nowadays I just grown anytime I see him in the news."
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"To the privileged, equality feels like oppression"
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,If he was cancelled why do I keep hearing about him??
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"How would Chapelle react to a white comedian making a special about black stereotyping

Then labeling critics the tools of oppression and saying that was his job

The fact the hypothetical white comedian is not being promoted by Netflix and would probably have no mainstream career suggests Dave Chappelle has not really challenged anything"
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"'Member when Chapelle threatened to pull financial investments to prevent a proposed affordable housing complex? 

Sounds like he used his standing to become an actual instrument of oppression. Like bruh."
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,I love [Bo Burnham’s take](https://youtu.be/D52TF1OtgSE) on political correctness in comedy.
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,Is Dave Chappelle even a comedian anymore? All of his specials since his comeback have been so lackluster and I’m saying that as someone who was a huge fan. Even Carlin’s more philosophical stuff was still funny.
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,Chappelle has become the very thing he criticizes. Just a professional victim now. All he talks about is how mean everyone is to him. It's not funny and it's so boring and old now. He's on the line of destroying his legacy at his point. He's more known for causing controversy and being viewed as a bigot now than being a good comedian like he used to be.
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"I always loved Chappelle, but he's become so pompous and arrogant lately. Leaning into the ""I'm the greatest of all time"" stuff way too much.

  


The dude is brilliant for sure, but his comedy isn't what it used to be. It's a lot meaner and self aggrandizing. So much self righteousness. I dunno man, Chappelle is still funny and he can still make a great point, but he's also become so smug. His lack of humility makes him hard to cheer for St times."
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"It's the old 'I should be able to say whatever I want to say without consequences, because if other people exercise their right to free speech and criticize me, they hurt my feelings and that is just mean' argument.

But his argument is better, because he changed 'they hurt my feelings' to 'they oppressed me'.

Hey Dave Chappelle, we are around the same age.

And I get it.

Getting old is no fun.

It sucks that we get older and those damn kids have the confidence of youth.

It sucks that we got to that age where nobody believes you shaved your head and the grey in my hair can no longer be ignored.

It sucks that when we tell jokes, our jokes are dad jokes in the eyes of those annoying teenagers.

You are more successful than me.

But still I feel sorry for you. Because we both got old. And you have a midlife crisis."
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,Cancel culture = you’re criticizing me and it hurts my money
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"""dared criticize him""

Jeez"
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,This dude is so thin skinned.
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"They **DARED** to criticize him!  OMG!!

Uh, anybody who was worried about criticizing a *comedian* is either paranoid or histrionic."
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,Honestly he’s fallen off so hard.
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"Instruments you say? That’s rich, coming from a tool."
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,the guy enjoys the smell of his own flatulence entirely too much
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,Modern Chappelle is such a whiny victim bitch.
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,I guess Chapelle got really thin skin
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,Dave chapelle is rapidly becoming a one joke comedian
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"You know what’s crazy ? I won’t be lining up to watch any of his new specials mainly because this shit is tired and not funny. If his viewer numbers drop he will be the first to say “they are trying to cancel me !”

Nah man, you did this all by yourself."
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"Wow, that's some Kanye-level delusional self-worship, there. ""My art transcends concerns of the time and world that we live in and your criticisms are just evidence of your inability to recognize the absolute Truth that my genius offers the world."" The sad irony for Chappelle is that the same people he's calling out as ""woke"" who are criticizing him for punching down right now would have been the same people criticizing racist comedians in the past, and who helped clear a path for Black comedians like him to have the enormous, mainstream and lucrative platform he takes for granted today."
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,Here’s the thing about Dave. He’s extremely clever at interpreting the societal problems that he encounters into comedy. But he doesn’t care about anyone else. He’s always been that way. His outrage is only for his issues.
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,Somebody better call a wambulance
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"Right. It’s only other people who are the “instruments of oppression,” says the transphobe"
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"Man, this dude really sucks now."
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"Well. He said it in the context of their criticisms mirroring Twitter ones word for word. They weren't originally conceived and constructed, i.e, they are parroting concerns and not critically thinking."
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,Someone who bitches everyone is too sensitive is also sensitive and can't take criticism. Comedians are the real snowflakes.
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"People know that he’s actively trying to stop an affordable-housing development from being made in his city, because he doesn’t want something like that so close to his house…. Right?


I’m from Ohio, and I can tell you 100%:
Ohio’s affordable-housing units are given out to the homeless, underprivileged, and those with special needs. 

In one of the poorest regions of Ohio, where homelessness is an all-too-common reality, he’s essentially using his power to increase the amount of people/families who won’t have a bed at night. 

And he’s claiming he’s the victim there, too. 

That’s a real thing. 

(He’s basically becoming Mr. Burns.)

But yeah. These kids are the oppressive ones."
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,Surprising to see a veteran standup comedian have such thin skin.  Do you think it's the money that does it?
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"Dave went from comedy king to drama queen, and it's a shame. 

Something snapped when he was working for Comedy Central... the money and fame blew up his ego, I guess"
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"Aside from the controversy over his trans ""jokes"" (which legit weren't even jokes so much as mean spirited observations, if you're gonna defend offensive material at least make sure it's quality) he hasn't really been relevant in something like 16 or 17 years.  Back when I was in college he was huge, was right before he lost his shit and ran away from his career, and he had at least some humility.  He legit thought he was empowering negative black stereotypes hence him quitting at the height of his fame.  Was a fair and insightful point yet these days he has no problem ignoring that to basically insult a minority group he doesn't happen to be part of.  Dude needs to get back to his roots and remember how he felt all those years ago instead of screaming ""Cancel Culture!  The youth today must be wrong!"".  Have some fucking accountability, you can't regain respect by writing a fucking check."
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"Just watched his special. Wasn't as funny as his usual material, but wasn't bad either and 90% of it was just stories from his life. Nothing really worth being outraged about.

I swear the top comments whining on here haven't seen it, despite several of them claiming to be fans, and have just paid for reddit upvotes & downvotes, lol (Yes, that's a thing now). It seems odd that opinions about Dave on here would suddenly flip this much overnight because of this special."
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"The man has a right to express himself.  

But he sure is a huge whiny bitch about anyone else doing the same."
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"Hes been a comedian for decades, why is he upset now? How did he handle criticism before?"
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"Chapelle said they didn't understand they were acting as instruments of oppression. These fucking articles are ridiculous. He was implying the hypocrisy of demanding his silence are ironically the tools of oppression they seek to abolish. And to validate that point he chose to leave his name off the building as a gesture to show that he did not want to oppress their right to express themselves even if that means being critical of him. Did anyone actually watch the damn speech?

Edit: People are just mad that he won't self immolate in an apologetic media tour...and let's be honest. People aren't interested in his apology even if he meant it. They want him humiliated and exiled. He's invited that community to discuss his ideals openly after they've watched his special and I've yet to see anyone accept that invitation."
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"It’s not that deep, Dave."
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,“stop listening to celebrities” - dave chappelle
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"I am not sure if he is being serious or sarcastic here:

But at the same time, he declares The Closer a “masterpiece,” adding, unironically, “I challenge all my peers to make its equal. They cannot, I am sure. It will be decades before you ever see someone in my genre as proficient as me. I am maybe a once-in-a-lifetime talent.”"
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"I didn't realize the daily beast was doing that kind of fox news stuff now.  ""Dared?"""
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"Casualty of Yes men and too much praise = “Yes I am the man!” mentality. Which isn’t necessarily bad, but don’t make it your identity. That’s not why people liked you to begin with."
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,Pretty funny to take a quote out of contest from a speech about the dangers of taking quotes out of context
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"Has anyone here actually listened to the jokes he made? When i take the entire piece in its context,  i come away with a bit about the common humanity we all share,  that hinges upon his articulation of how uninformed he was and how a trans woman helped put him in his place and remind him that the things that make him appreciate people have nothing to do with their gender or sexuality. It seems like the point of the piece gets lost in the fact that it has anything at all to do with trans issues. Can anyone help clear up what the controversy is all about?"
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,Nobody who watched his latest special would agree with this sensationalist click bait take.
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,Damn even as a fan of some of this bits he’s acting like a child. Make jokes and stop trying to be some philosophical leader.
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"How would this be any different from criticizing those kids?

Loads of young people I know feel oppressed when someone merely disagrees with what they “know”. 

Not all young people mind you. But plenty enough."
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"He didn’t even say shit about trans in the speech. Have any of you even watched it?

He literally spoke about some of his experiences at the college, and then, at the end, declined the offer to name the theatre after himself and decided instead to name it something along the lines of theatre for the something thing free arts idk.

Y’all are off the charts. 

On one hand, we’re supposed to fully support trans people to have the freedom to choose their sexuality and gender, but on the other, a FUCKING COMEDIAN doesn’t get to choose his jokes or art style.

Get lost and long live Dave Chappelle is the goat."
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"The guy makes fun of everyone. Black, white, Asian, trans, straight, gay.... This only became a problem when he made a joke about a trans person. If he still had his show, and made it into a sketch instead of a comedy bit, everyone would be laughing their asses off just like they did with the black white Supremecist or the ""white people love electric guitar"" skit. No one said shit when he was making fun of his own race or white people or Asians... But poke the bear with trans and its all of a sudden cancel worthy. Get off your fucking high horse and maybe laugh once in a while. It will do you and the world a hell of a lot of good.
Why wasn't anyone up in arms when he was making fun of black people? Why choose now to spark outrage? Is it because trans are being marginalized? Can't be since black people have been marginalized for hundreds of years lol. Is it because you are just more comfortable laughing at one marginalized people than another? Why is that?  The hypocrisy is astonishing."
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,Does this dude ever stop crying?
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"Aww poor Dave, what a coward"
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,Didn’t realize Reddit was so anti Dave Chappelle.
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,“Kids who dared criticize him” you mean people that are going overboard on a joke and calling him a bigot when he’s clearly not? What a shitty headline
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"Man, with that attitude I’ll oppress Dave Chapelle every day. 

The only thing worse than a comedian that can’t take criticism is a political comedian that can’t take criticism. 

Saying something controversial then crying oppression is embarrassing behavior from an adult."
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,So again no one watched his special or listened to the actual words that came out of his mouth. It's gotta be tiring bitching about comedians so much. It's hilarious though like who is watching a Dave Chappelle stand-up and then subsequently committing hate crimes against trans people? I'd really like to know
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"The fact that so many hate him despite never actually engaging with his material on any substantive level, show exactly why he is criticizing the culture that he is. 

It's not about trans people, it's about people who can't let words be words and have to make material harm to people's real lives when they're offended. 

I empathize with trans people and understand that jokes on top of broader culture that is generally not very accepting of trans people can really hurt, but when People respond to this offense by trying to take away people's voices, careers, and money, you got to understand that you are setting a dangerous precedent creating a culture that is detrimental to a functioning democracy. That is why he talks about this shit so much."
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,Oh no the poor multi millionaire. He must be so oppressed...
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,That’s not what he said. I watched it.
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"I am not a regular reader of ""The Daily Beast"" but after reading this opinion piece I went and watched Dave Chappelle's speech.

This is a sloppy, borderline hit piece that neatly omits all nuance and a lot of great things in that speech.

Do people even watch the things that they are trying to cancel or just read headlines and rage bait opinion articles?"
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"""If you have a better idea, express it"" he says, during the speech in which he calls people expressing their ideas ""instruments of oppression."""
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"Freedom of speech for me, but not for thee."
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,I cannot imagine being a 50-something year old man caring what kids think about me.
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,He's not wrong. Fucking society sucks now.
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"My response from another post to Chappelle calling those teenagers ""instruments of oppression"":

>Yo. Fuck that. He can be pissed with those kids all he wants, but that condescending bullshit is just pathetic. Their words were their own, but rather than reckon with that he just dismisses them as unwitting tools in the endeavor to tear down a successful Black man.

>He really seems bound and determined to make this stuff his entire public legacy. It's wild.

For anyone questioning that the students' words were, in fact, their own, those kids have talked about what they said to him. More importantly, they spoke those words with their own mouths. From another comment I left in that earlier thread:

>Dismissing them like that denies their agency. They said what they wanted to say. It's fine for him to disagree and even be annoyed by them, but he's effectively discounting *their* freedom of expression in defending his own."
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,Dave Chapelle can oppress these nuts to his forehead
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,CONTEXT. That’s all there is to say. CONTEXT.
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,Chappell is a shit show…
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,You have to be a real peace of shit to pick on children.
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"Dave Chappelle has really turned into one of those “I started from the bottom but now that I’m on top and rich, fuck everyone else” types."
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"Didn't think I'd see Chapelle get so soft, but it's been a weird existence for everyone I guess."
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,People should be allowed to say whatever the fuck they want and if it pisses you off leave it’s fucking sinple
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,Old rich asshole whines young people hate comedy claims they could not have come to that conclusion on there own must be instruments of oppression
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,Oof. It’s like he fast-forwarded to cranky old boomer comedian before he even became washed up.
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"Man, Chappelle has really become a piece of human garbage"
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,People still watch chappelle? Dudes been trying to piss everyone off in a desperate attempt to remain relevant
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,Unpopular opinion but Dave Chappelle is full of himself and it shows.
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,Where is r/persecutionfetish when you need them?
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"God, remember when Chapelle was talking about crack babies and laughing on stage.

Now he's like someone's weird dad who won't stop talking politics. What a fucking mook."
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"Jesus Christ this comment section. It wasn’t a stand up set, he was accepting an honor of a theater being named after him. He’s a good speaker so Netflix posted it. Watch the fucking thing first"
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"I wonder how Dave Chappelle feels about racist cartoons. Regardless of how he feels about it though it doesn’t really matter because we’re still not publicly broadcasting racism in cartoons & for very good reasons. And Disney cleaning the old content isn’t a bad thing.

If Christians can get upset & outraged over legitimately benign things in their cartoons then I think it’s ok that Disney responds to legitimate concerns of racism & exclusionary practices that actually have some impact on society as a whole & not just a religious group."
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"The fuck happened to dave, he’s such a pussy now"
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"Not sure that people read the article. Which in itself wouldn't be unusual.

Dave wasn't just randomly pointing out some kids. It was a specific correlation with a specific event, and a movement that he knows comes from elsewhere, not the minds of youngsters. 

Thus, he says, they are manipulated into expressing someone else's position instead of having reached those conclusions on their own."
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"Every comic that uses race, gender and sexuality as punchlines uses the Free Speech card when they get called out, totally forgetting that Free Speech goes both ways. They can make the jokes if they want, they are free to do so, but the targets of the jokes are equally as free to call him out and express their dislike of the jokes. So is THAT form of Free Speech not allowed, therefore removing the concept of Free Speech? 

Also imagine getting this pissy cus a new generation of kids are learning that being a prick to people that are different in the name of comedy isn't funny at all"
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,How very culture wars of him
Spy Kids: Mission Critical,"I guess as a disability support worker I'm totally down to oppress, because I don't find Chapelle funny. Never have. You win, Dave. Those who disagree with you and don't worship thr ground you walk on are terrible people. Should probably not talk about Amy Shumer anymore, cause these two have a lot in common."
A Bride for Rip Van Winkle,"Dramatic writing major/ screenwriter and big twilight zone fan here-
IMO the limited use of technology serves the twilight zone well.  The twilight zone (besides the fourth season) was a twenty five minute show.  And one of the biggest hang ups about sci-fi when ,especially writing for the screen, is that it usually needs a lot of exposition.  And when you are working in a twenty five minute time frame, you really cannot afford to waist pages on what will end up being rushed exposition anyway.  That's why the majority of the tz episodes, seem to function in a reality that is slightly tweaked.  FOr the most part I would consider them morality plays told through the lens of science fiction, often leaving the ""amazing technology"" (or whatever supernatural tweak to reality is happening) almost as a jumping off point, and the meat of the episode is usually  in the aftermath, the human side of dealing with whatever has transpired.

Never watched to much star trek and I'm getting into the outer Limits so I can't really comment on the robot thing.

Hormones,"I don't think Alex was originally envisioned as the star though was he? He was just a breakout, so the show quickly re-aligned around him. It's like what happened with Family Matters becoming the Urkel show."
Hormones,"I watched Family Ties first run when it aired on Thursday nights. But now I can't stand to watch the reruns. Something about it makes me uneasy.  Maybe all the orange juice they drank, or the fact that every guest knew exactly if the family was in the kitchen or living room, so they entered through the correct door."
Hormones,"Meridith Baxter was the biggest name when this show was produced. It was originally created as a show centered on her, with the rest of the cast supporting."
Hormones,Where were you when I needed to know this 40 years ago?
Hormones,"""hot take?"" /s"
Hormones,"I was in high school when Family Ties came out.

MBB and MG, the parents were supposed to be the focus of the show. Them dealing with their Reagan-loving teen son, their dippy fashion-loving teen daughter and their grammar school daughter They were former 60's hippies reacting to their 80's kids.

The first year ratings weren't great, IIRC; it also was a bit more serious in tone. But in the second season they started focusing more on Alex and Mallory. Then, it started to get big ratings. Two years later, in 1984, it was the Michael J. Fox/Alex P. Keaton and everyone else show.

And rightly so, he was a phenomenal talent."
Hormones,"I think the parents are being underrated. They both have pretty strong performances even when working against Alex.

A show that would just be about him would not be as good but he was certainly the star."
Hormones,"Alex definitely and quickly became the central character and star of the show for sure.

I'd say Mallory became equal with the parents for star power on the show.

And yes, Mallory's boyfriend was an obnoxious loser."
Hormones,"Just did a rewatch of this show this past summer.  In retrospect, the worst season was probably season 1 where the focus was on the parents/entire family.  The show started to become better once it focused on Alex and Mallory.  Even some of the Jen episodes weren't too bad (excluding the ones about the Rain Forest/Book Banning)."
Hormones,Isn’t this the case of Steve Urkel? The show was originally suppose to focus on the Carl and the kids and it pretty much became about Steve because of his popularity. Same goes for Family Ties. Parents got side lined because of Alex’s popularity
Hormones,"Justine Bateman was so good in the more serious episodes. Like when aunt Trudy died and she had a meltdown at the funeral. She played it so great! There’s a Family Ties channel on Pluto and I watch it before bed every night, haha."
Hormones,"There's a path you take and a path not taken. The choice is up to you, my friend."
Hormones,"the parents were great but once MJF got star status it was pretty much over for anyone who wasn't him. A bit like that cockroach looking guy from Family Matters, only a billion times more likeable"
Hormones,Wasn't it urkel?
Hormones,"Nick Moore had a heart of gold and was an amazing artist. Shoulda had his own spinoff. 

/S"
Hormones,"Yes, we know"
Hormones,I always thought of it as an ensemble cast but most of the plots revolved around the kids
Hormones,That’s a hot take!
Hormones,Not one mention of Skippy? He was a pretty big part of the show. Was often used as the comic foil.
Hormones,Or happy days becoming the Fonzie show. Or West Wing becoming the president Bartlet show.
Hormones,"Alex P Keaton drank a ton of orange juice and Sam Malone peeled a ton of lemons.

Actors just need some business to do."
Hormones,"I believe both parents were supposed to be the stars, but the hook of the show was supposed to be their 60s liberal viewpoint versus the kids' conservative view"
Hormones,Or when Jen decided to be a Pop Star. Cringe.
Hormones,Same with Good Times. Dynoooo-mite!!!!
Hormones,Isn't that from Who's The Boss?
Hormones,"And while his decision to stay was seen as noble, not many TV actors would continue to be on a sictom while being a movie star back then, it definitely made it obligatory that he had to be the star. I remember how even when it was a Jen episode or a Elyse episode, Alex always showed up to insert himself and steal the spotlight. The only one whom he couldn't overshadow was Mallory and probably because Mallory was the clown of the show and both worked well together."
Hormones,He married a friend of mine from college.
Hormones,It took six seasons for me to realize Skippy was a boy.
Hormones,"When the show started Baxter had been in the very successful Bridget Loves Bernie (A huge hit that got cancelled because of religious controversy.....it's a great story if you want to read about it.) And Family....another big show.  She had been a famous tv star for about a decade before Family Ties.    Michael Gross was an almost complete unknown at the time. (He had appeared in small parts in a couple of TV movies).  

Baxter was the star of the show when it first started."
Hormones,"Holy shit, I just realized the dad wasn’t Alan Alda. Memory is a weird thing."
Hormones,October 5
Hormones,The Seinfeld gags in The Head Push were amazing. I was already loving the show up until that point though.
Hormones,"I really loved season one, but I have to say, even as a guy, the girl stuff was better. 

The red bra subplot was maybe my favorite storyline of the season. It was hilarious, while still being a fairly realistic depiction of something that a lot of girls go through that you rarely see on TV. 

I feel like that’s the target they’re always aiming for, and even if they only hit 50% of the time, it’s still often enough to make it a great show. "
Hormones,"The show is funny but I just want Nick and John to do another Oh, Hello"
Hormones,"This is interesting and all, but where is my BoJack Horseman Season 5 Trailer?!?!?!?!"
Hormones,"I was pleasantly surprised by Big Mouth, the cast is great together and it’s an accurate portrayal of how messed up and confusing puberty can be.

Also, it’s funny. It does Family Guy humor but about ten times better than Family Guy."
Hormones,Well this is some great news! Season 1 is so fucking funny. Super talented cast and some really out there humor. This and Bojack are what I’m most looking forward to from Netflix 
Hormones,"I tried to watch a couple of episodes, but everything is either over the top or 1000% cringe... 

I guess its a niche audience thing. "
Hormones,Oh man I’m super excited about this. I went into the first episode not expecting much but all of a sudden it’s been rewatched about 7 or 8 times. 
Hormones,"So what about this was funny? I'm all for adult animation, but this show just never did it for me."
Hormones,"This show is really great, I can’t wait for more. "
Hormones,This was the best animation surprise of 2017. I'm looking forward to season 2!
Hormones,[deleted]
Hormones,Maury and I have Using a Squatty Potty in common. 
Hormones,I think they should use this show for grade 8 sex ed in schools.
Hormones,Hell yeah. Love this show!
Hormones,Awesome!
Hormones,"“HAHAHAHA BONER!”


-Big Mouth"
Hormones,"Damnit Netflix, couldn't you have funded a better show? Like literally anything else?"
Hormones,"I watched half an episode of this and wanted to fucking kill myself. Every setup *and* every punchline is in the form of an erection, and the ""hormone monster"" is such a one-dimensional, surface level, lazy way to characterize puberty that I'm unconvinced the writers experienced it for themselves. Not because they're *misinformed* necessarily, but because I can't imagine being any older than 11 and thinking that these ideas are worth their space on scrap paper. I can't even celebrate whatever sex-positive message this show might have for young adolescents, because exposing oneself to its garbage-tier animation and art direction for even the length of one full episode is certain to induce lifelong erectile dysfunction anyway. "
Hormones,"Is there a review for this show that isn't ""I expected to hate it, but I loved it!"" or ""Ew, it's like kiddie porn?"" 

For the record, I'm in the former camp. I expected to hate it, *but I loved it!*"
Hormones,Couldn't stand more than 2 minutes of this schlock. Convince me this is actually good.
Hormones,Why must this show exist...
Hormones,"Netflix should really add more quality adult animation. Bojack is its best show by a country mile, but this, Disenchanted and F is for Family were really disappointing."
Hormones,Western animation is terrible. It is so full of perversions and fantasies that theres even a show centered on sexual thoughts of minors. This is whats so great about anime. It's beautiful art that is also mature and thought-provoking.
Hormones,My man
Hormones,*nod*
Hormones,"That is absolutely my favorite episode. All the stuff with drunk Jay and Jessie was nice, too. Plus, Mae Whitman and Zach Woods!"
Hormones,"Telling her to call her mother by her first name is still one of the funniest moments of any show in recent memory. 

Also a guy, but I think in general girls just have a much worse time with puberty, so it’s inherently funnier to joke about. As great as it is to see guys go through the “I wanna fuck everything” phase, there’s something primal about a first period that we can’t compete with. As always - I’m glad I never had to deal with it, but I’m more than happy to laugh about it. "
Hormones,Aziz I'msorry?
Hormones,"RAVIIIIIII! Will you go to every pizza shop and bring me back the most sun-faded photo of Danny Aiello?

RAVIIIIII! Will you go to Just Salads, get in line, and be like “Okay now how does this work?”

RAVIIIIII! Will you go to Long Island City, because I won’t."
Hormones,That guy has to streak first.
Hormones,Why you need a trailer when you know what date it's coming out?
Hormones,"What is this, a crossover episode?"
Hormones,I mean that’s what happens when you have John Mulaney and Nick Kroll. 
Hormones,Wish I could like it too... I couldn't get past the ugly character design and the constant screaming.
Hormones,"1000x better than Disenchanted, that's for sure.  "
Hormones,"I don't know what you expect when you ask people to explain why they laugh about something. Either you find it funny or you don't.

But I didn't like the show for the laughs, mainly. It's a very accurate and, while often gross, heartfelt depiction of puberty. My puberty was 20 years ago but I can still remember how awful and confusing it was. The show handles a lot of those things and has a surprising range (male and female puberty, alcoholism, homosexuality, etc).

Perhaps it's just refreshing to think ""Jesus, so it wasn't just me""."
Hormones,its really meant for teenagers i feel like. I really enjoy the immature humor and its super accurate and relatable as a 15 year old.
Hormones,"basically the hormone monster carries the show, especially when the female version shows up. it isnt great but it is good enough to exist even if i personally dislike nick kroll a little"
Hormones,"For this show, that has multiple meanings."
Hormones,"i genuinely hate looking at this show's characters. i would pay more monthly for netflix if they offered a ""you never have to look at big mouth"" plan"
Hormones,It isn't everyones type of humor. Especially not with that party pooper attitude.
Hormones,No. Who TF are you? Lmao
Hormones,"I haven't seen it either but 2 minutes is awfully quick to make your judgement about a series with a whole season of content.

Like ok you don't need to watch literally all of it to only say in the end ""yeah maybe this wasn't that good"" but 2 minutes? damn."
Hormones,"Names Shlock

Address is 22122b2221b


Afternoon *clicking*"
Hormones,Because season 1 was really good.
Hormones,Why must this comment?
Hormones,"You do realize anime is the worst offender for sexualizing minors right?

Where do you think the people who identity as lolicons came from?"
Hormones,“Everyone loves a guy who’s always on” made me lose me shit super hard. Everyone knows that guy
Hormones,"Honestly, I think dealing with characters who are constantly teetering between primal rage, extreme horniness, and wailing despair is just inherently funny. It terrifies me for when my kids hit puberty, but I can laugh about it for now. "
Hormones,But Ravi is the master of FUN
Hormones,Because I need some more hype. 
Hormones,"Completely understandable, the character designs are all REALLY ugly. I didn't want to watch it at first because of the designs. It turned out to be a pretty entertaining show, though. But I get you. "
Hormones,I think the ugly character design adds to the insecurity of being an adolescent. Most kids feel awkward and ugly at that age. 
Hormones,I had the same reaction to Rick and Morty. Just takes some adjusting.
Hormones,"imagine not watching such a brilliant a show for such inane reasons

may the merciful Lord have pity on your wretchedness "
Hormones,"I agree. I definitely got a ""trying to hard"" vibe"
Hormones,"Nah, I think it's the show tbh. I'm all for filthy/juvenile humor, big mouth just doesn't do it that well. I watched the first couple of episodes, and really it just seemed to be ""haha look it's a vagina"", except *that's the entire joke*. Haha the main character just talked about masturbating, isn't that funny. Roflmao wasn't it like so totally awkward being a teenager???? XD

.....and that's the entire show. 

Filthy humour can be and often is hilarious, but when the joke starts and ends with ""lol the word penis is funny"" then it needs some work. "
Hormones,No
Hormones,"I'd say r/Woooosh , but it's a shitty joke that's clearly trolling for downvotes, so fuck it. "
Hormones,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zszD_-xM2w

all i got for ya"
Hormones,"That was me, i saw the avatar on Netflix and I was like nope, no thank you. But I love John Mulaney probably an unhealthy amount and when I realized he was one of the main voices that got me to watch. I got over the animation style pretty quickly - except the armpit hair erupting out of the male hormone monster still squicks me out, I try not to look at it "
Hormones, Sorry if I can't stand characters who won't stop screaming every 3 minutes.
Hormones,"You're definitely missing something. The heart of the show is kids being told by society, and their bodies, that life is changing, but they're not really ready for it. If all you saw in the singing vagina gag was a singing vagina, bare minimum, you missed the other 23 minutes of the show about a girl suffering through her first period on a school trip to the Statue of Liberty. Most of the humor from the show is being derived from the anxiety of not being ready for this shit. "
Hormones,"I don't think you watched much of the show, and it's kind of silly to only point out some dick jokes. The other guy who commented explains it better than I could."
Hormones,Thanks. That's exactly what it looked like. John Mulaney and Nick Kroll are at the top of Reddit's overrated white guy list.
Hormones,What did you dislike about it?
Hormones,"No, I watched too much of the show, I almost got halfway through the season"
Hormones,Why do you like it?
The Alienist,Oh. I thought this was a miniseries.
The Alienist,YES that first season was so good!
The Alienist,The 1st season was so good. Very excited.
The Alienist,I can't recommend season 1 enough. I've also read the book and can't recommend that enough. One of the few times both were outstanding.
The Alienist,Loved S1 and can't wait for this. Daniel Bruhl is so good.
The Alienist,I loved this book so I’m excited to see it adapted to the screen.  Will do a reread prior to watching.
The Alienist,can't wait for this and season 2 of taboo.
The Alienist,"Season one was great, can't wait to see the second one."
The Alienist,Fuck ya i didnt even know this was in production lets go! This show deserves so much more attention its so good!
The Alienist,"is it a graphic or super depressing show? 

or more like sherlock holmes ?"
The Alienist,IIRC that was the original plan but it turned out to be very popular for TNT (highest streaming numbers they'd ever had). They also invested a lot in sets (the city it takes place in is actually one massive set they built in Budapest) and there are several books so it makes sense.
The Alienist,"It’s based on the sequel novel, so it’s not like The Terror where they tried to come up with new base material. I actually liked this story a little better so I’m excited about seeing what they do with this."
The Alienist,What’s it about?
The Alienist,Check out the novel of Angel Of Darkness! It’s the same characters and a really great mystery
The Alienist,[deleted]
The Alienist,[deleted]
The Alienist,Is it supernatural?
The Alienist,Probably because you are too use to American tv where somethings needs to happen all the time for it to be exciting which feels like getting whiplash honestly.
The Alienist,"Ok so you obviously don't like this kind of series. ""failed to adapt the book""??? It based it off the book, which means they changed parts to suit tv better.  Tv series are never going to be like the books they're based on-it would be impossible."
The Alienist,"You didn't watch the same show, I guess."
The Alienist,"You got downvoted but I totally agree with you.  I really enjoyed the book, but there was a certain something this show really seemed to lack.  I find it a common theme with most of TNT's originals; there was a noirish miniseries with Chris Pine that aired last year on it, I thought the pilot was really outstanding, but the story just really seemed to sputter and run out of steam, just like I felt the Alienist did.  It says a lot when it's a miniseries, I'm already through most of the episodes, and I still can't find the wherewithal to stick with it."
The Alienist,No it’s like the first one but chasing someone they call the angel of darkness
The Alienist,How doe sit compare to Sherlock?
The Alienist,"I didn't watch it, but I'm glad the $600 billion they spent on advertising this show for the past 6 months paid off for them."
The Alienist,Is it good?
The Alienist,"The first episode was very good. AND, I appreciate the normal commercial breaks because TNT usually will show 20 minutes with no commercials, then ads every five minutes toward the end - even cutting into scenes in the middle. "
The Alienist,The first two episodes were pretty good. I'll definitely keep watching.
The Alienist,"I liked episode 2 much better. But, they still are playing Roosevelt all wrong."
The Alienist,">That would make it the network’s most successful launch since 2012, of eight new dramas that have already premiered this season.

I feel like maybe the headline is being a little boastful than it should be."
The Alienist,Does TNT put episodes on hulu? 
The Alienist,"The article mentions that its a limited series. Is this confirmed?
I find it hard to believe that they won't continue if it is successful.

Watched the Pilot a few days ago and it was better than expected. Crazy good production values and the plot looks interesting enough."
The Alienist,"I read the books back in college and loved them. But I wonder why a nearly 25 year old book suddenly is having an adaptation made of it. It made the NY times bestseller list, but I don't think it really held any large following. 

It looks good, though. "
The Alienist,That first episode was very intriguing. Very excited for this show.
The Alienist,Saw this advertised every commercial during Inside the NBA (only NBA I watch)
The Alienist,I liked the first episode but the 2nd episode just creeped me out. Felt like it was directed by Bryan Singer or another hollywood pedo. I hope they tone down all the boy prostitute scenes. 
The Alienist,So here’s what’s not necessary: action chase scenes 
The Alienist,"But it was boring as fuck.

I was so looking forward to it. Hopefully it’s one of those show which gets better."
The Alienist,They must be paying good because DF looks like she is higher than a kite. https://imgur.com/0tBqT13
The Alienist,My mom didnt like the alienist. She loves British drama detective cop judge stuff. She watches father brown all the time and similar shows.
The Alienist,I wonder how much of the show was sped up to add a few more commercials.
The Alienist,I refuse to watch simply because of the advertising they rammed down my throat.
The Alienist,They managed to slip one of those commercials between my dreams a few nights ago. They really went all out.
The Alienist,First time I've ever heard of it is this post so I guess they didn't get to everyone.
The Alienist,And apparently they're not done https://imgur.com/a/o20TV
The Alienist,"I even got a free copy of the book from folks doing a promo thing a few weeks ago, and a t-shirt at comic con last October. "
The Alienist,"Not bad, definitely promising. Production value is great and the cast is good. Dakota Fanning's acting was a little off IMO but the plot is interesting and I'm sure it'll develop into a quality murder mystery."
The Alienist,"the bar I set for it is to be better than TNT's last big budget production - an origin story for Shakespeare with Baz Luhrman aesthetics, spoken word rap battles, and a poster tagline [""Before He was Shakespeare...He was...*Will*""](https://i1.wp.com/thepopbreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/will-tnt-poster.jpg?ssl=1)

and well, it was definitely better than Will. so that's my endorsement."
The Alienist,"We'll see. I am not sure what they are doing with the protagonist just yet. The police commissioner character ( no, I won't name him - you'd recognize the name) seems underdeveloped and does not fit my vision of that particular character at all. 

 The overall ""Victorian New York po-lice show"" thing seems okay. It is historically an interesting time. You can all but smell the streets. 

It could easily end up being a procedural with excellent costuming. 

A couple of key characters are pretty fresh, tho. The character played by Dakota Fanning has an amazing amount of potential - that's an unmined vein of narrative right there. Both my grandmothers were cut from that bolt of cloth 10-20ish years later ( except she appears to be a person to never marry and rather a misanthrope w.r.t male persons - misan*d*thrope? ) . 

But the protagonist is right now just a fish out of water. I have no earthly idea how any of the theories the guy speaks could have existed then. SFAIK, no 19th century person anywhere ever used the word ""trauma"" except to refer to the sort of thing surgeons dealt with. "
The Alienist,The book it is based on is very good.
The Alienist,[deleted]
The Alienist,"I mean, you could watch it and decide whether or not you like it and want to watch more."
The Alienist,"I've read the book, watched the first episode last night and thought it was decent but really Disliked that portrayal. Like... why is he so soft spoken? Even when he's annoyed and yelling he's barely above a whisper."
The Alienist,"I don't know about Hulu, but they put them on their app for free. It has ads though. "
The Alienist,"it's actually a netflix show and once it's done on tnt it will be on netflix.
"
The Alienist,"Just watched them on Hulu last night. Though I have hulu tv, so not sure if its the same on regular hulu"
The Alienist,"> The article mentions that its a limited series.

I've seen a number of shows marketed this way recently. I think it's a bit of a hedge on their part: if it flops, ""oh well it was only a limited series no big deal investors we good fam""; if it's successful, it gets an extension to a full-blown series"
The Alienist,"Because the writer as of 2016 decided to write two more books. Paramount had the rights all along, but like many what was written was never good enough to equal the kind of budget it would need. Now they'll have more material if it works. *Previous attempts were for a movie, not a series. I just hope viewers don't point out what is ""wrong"" with the historical side of it, & remember it is for tv."
The Alienist,"But I think that's what they were going for? It's a dark, seedy brothel made more awful by the fact that they're all being targeted for murder and mutilation and absolutely no one seems to care (outside of our protagonists). "
The Alienist,"That's all from the book, if anything they toned it down for the TV show."
The Alienist,Yeah I get the mystery and how the whole thing is gonna revolve around this topic but it felt too trashy for its own good. It has better tone it down in the next episode or it'll be too overbearing to continue watching just on the presentation of the subject matter alone. 
The Alienist,I thought the second episode was much more interesting than the first. Hoping it will get even better as it goes on.
The Alienist,Father Brown and the Alienist aren't really on the same level of grittiness...
The Alienist,I watched the first episode wearing nothing but my Lightspeed Briefs.
The Alienist,"I'm guessing you are a cord cutter who doesn't watch TV?

Have you gone to movies?

I definitely saw twice as much adfare for this show as I did for this year's Star Wars movie (and their ad campaigns started about the same time, which is ridiculous for a show on TNT)."
The Alienist,Me too! (But am cord cutter.)  I was reading the plot and realized I have read this book. Now to find it somewhere...
The Alienist,"I felt I understood exactly what Dakota Fanning was getting at. She was holding a poker face. Can you imagine being a woman trying to go head-to-head in that man's world? You saw the ""naked rat"" scene, right? 

Handled right, she could be the best thing in the show. "
The Alienist,[deleted]
The Alienist,"Another one yes.  He has worked exclusively with young people and/or children in particular and he is angry and guilt ridden about what has happened to children under his care.  What does an angry, guilt ridden, educated man do?  He develops an agenda.

Forensics in its infancy is being introduced to the U.S. during this time period.  The word trauma was used by the greeks for wounds and in psychology used in the late 1800's.

I'm glad to have stopped by ArkyBeagle because you posed some legitimate questions and observations.  I had to delve into history to find out if the information we were being fed was real.  So far so good.  I'm staying on for another episode before I run out and buy the book.

Thank. you!!

"
The Alienist,I was surprised to see that the Police Comissioner actually was the Police Comissioner in NYC at that time 
The Alienist,It's not directed by him. He dropped out a while ago because of scheduling conflicts. He's just an executive producer. 
The Alienist,But then where would you reply pointlessly?
The Alienist,"Roosevelt is much too timid compared to all descriptions of the real TR I have ever seen. 

Michael Ironsides is playing JP Morgan and seems like a good choice for the role but, they have chosen not to depict Morgan with the terribly disfigured nose he had from rosacea and rhinophyma."
The Alienist,"I don't know if that's completely accurate? Netflix has the international rights, but it's still produced by TNT."
The Alienist,Not necessarily. Dirk Gently was coproduced by Netflix but Hulu still ended up with second window rights in the US.
The Alienist,It is a TNT show that Netflix has the international rights for.
The Alienist,"Yeah, that's what I thought. "
The Alienist,"Yeah, ""Good Behavior"" was a limited series until it was a TNT level hit. Now it's just a ""hit series"""
The Alienist,Interesting. I do hope it's a hit. Daniel Bruhl is a great pick for the main character. 
The Alienist,I 100% agree with you I just found it a bit over the top. 
The Alienist,All I can say is I am now intrigued enough to look up the actual history. Were there really brothels like the ones depicted during this time period?? That's all news to me! Now I have to know.
The Alienist,I saw a lot of these ads on Instagram.
The Alienist,This show advertised on a lot of the podcasts I listen to as well.
The Alienist,"I obviously understand the point of her character. But there was something off for her performance IMO. Her delivery was weird and only came across as bad acting for me. Hopefully it’ll get better in fhe future. FWIW I saw a lot of other people saying the same thing in the discussion thread. And while we’re at it, the mayor’s acting was a little off to me as well."
The Alienist,"She's a feminist.  I get it.  She is a fish outside of water.  You could never let your guard down in a world of men (especially those freakoids).  Even socially, within that particular work environment, she is outside of her element with the exception of those who are educated/professional.  It doesn't register in any facial expression but it does in her eyes.  She is wearing a mask.

Yes, I'm excited to see her work with a group of professionals, I'm excited to see her show her intelligence and for it to be appreciated."
The Alienist,Ohhh because the name of the show has the word Alien in it. Very clever.
The Alienist,"> The word trauma was used by the greeks for wounds and in psychology used in the late 1800's.

Awesome! Thanks for that. I wonder if it bled into the English-speaking world or not? "
The Alienist,Without your pointless questions? Not sure.
The Alienist,"Is it that she seemed... mechanical, somehow? 

I just realized what she reminded me of - Evan Rachel Wood as Dolores on Westworld. 

I appreciate your thoughts - I'll have to rewatch now. "
The Alienist,I agree. Seemed forced and too rehearsed. Bad acting 
The Alienist,A lot of her dialogue in the first episode sounds like it was made to be read in a book rather than spoken out loud by an actor. I agree her delivery wasn't convincing. I have the book and I'll go through it to see if some of the lines are directly lifted from it. But GoT is an example where things are taken from the book but it's delivered convincingly.  
The Alienist,"Yeah, asking about the quality of a show in a post about it is pointless. Everyone should just watch everything that exists instead."
The Alienist,"Here's the types of responses you'll get from asking ""Is it good?"" in a thread like this:

- Yes, you should check it out

- No, don't bother

How does that help? Nobody here knows what you like, everyone has different tastes. The only person who knows if you'll like it is you after you watch some of it."
The Alienist,Have a look at the responses I actually got. 
The Alienist,**What the hell is with TNT showing previews for future episodes while we are watching the first episode?! Massive spoilers!!**
The Alienist,"Watched this yesterday and thought it was solid.  I think it can only get better from here.

Did Roosevelt have a big presence in the book?  Whoever is playing him seems bland to me.  Only thing that kinda bothered me. Everyone else was great."
The Alienist,"The actors all are ones I like, seems like a good show so far. "
The Alienist,Ok the shots early in the episode when the boy gives him a ride to the bridge. Man that was fucking incredible. Seeing the city and the overhead shots. Feeling like the kid was all over the road. The raised rail. God I love that shit. The bridge set and the lighting. There just seemed to be a focus on showing the city and really putting you in it. It wasn’t just flying by in the background. 
The Alienist,"Although it makes sense as a hook/tease for what will happen in the rest of the season, Kreizler's ""I must become him"" speech at the end seemed way too early.  It seems like it should have come after several of his (initial) efforts to understand the killer failed rather than when he's still very early in the information gathering stage.  Even if he's been dwelling on the murder of his student for the past few years and been trying (unsuccessfully) to penetrate the killer's psyche, we haven't seen enough of that quest to understand why he needs to become/think like a killer himself rather than use the techniques he displayed at Bellevue.

In general, I thought things felt formulaic and over the top: almost every police officer hates/sneers at Kreizler; Moore's concern with delicacy/decency in between trips to a brothel where his ""date"" regularly acts out the same roleplay; Howard smoking because she's not delicate and dealing with boors at the station; the ""it's all your fault"" Zweig mother; the two bit mobsters; some of the dialogue/speeches, etc.

Visuals were impressive.  Acting was OK, but I didn't feel a ton of chemistry.  The mystery didn't hook me enough to hang around, despite watching the pilot after seeing what felt like months worth of commercials."
The Alienist,Really enjoying this so far
The Alienist,It's Dakota fanning! Her character is pulling a sleep away camp! 
Steins;Gate 0,"I’d highly recommend skipping this series; it pales in comparison to the excellent original *Steins;Gate* show that came out in 2011, which is an arguable contender for the best time travel show ever made."
Steins;Gate 0,"Could never get into this show, the time travel stuff was really interesting and I really wanted to know how it all turned out but 90% of each episode was filled with soap opera like drama and it was just incredibly boring getting to the 10% of the episode where something actually happened. 

By the time I got to the second half of the show where things start to kick off, I felt a bit lost, wasn't so invested in the characters and frustrated every time they spent a third of an episode eating lunch and talking about anime again, so I just dropped it."
Steins;Gate 0,"I guess it's the kind of thing that if you're happy to see the characters do normal shit then it works, but if not then you're a little bored. 

I loved it all, and I reckon the way it all unravels is worth any dodginess in the rest of it."
Steins;Gate 0,"> soap opera like drama

In Steins:Gate first season or in Steins:Gate 0? I don't think there were any soap opera like drama in the original? There was some in Steins:gate 0, which I didn't like it at all unlike the almost perfect first season."
Steins;Gate 0,"I just finished the visual novel a few days ago, and I agree.  The time travel stuff is great, but they spent way too much time just doing silly stuff that doesn't matter to the plot at all.  "
Steins;Gate 0,What is this?
Steins;Gate 0,Steins;Gate 0 is an anime series and sequel to another anime series both of which are based off a visual novel game. This looks like changes between the the blu ray version and stream version. 
Steins;Gate 0,"Id add Jojo's Bizarre Adventure to the mix.

Monster is amazing but I cannot find it anywhere.  Not even for DVD purchase. "
Steins;Gate 0,"I think Psycho Pass,Fate Zero & Violet Evergarden will also appeal to most "
Steins;Gate 0,"I'd definitely recommend Paranoia Agent. It's similar to Twin Peaks, following a series of random assaults that cause paranoia and morbid fascination in the people of Tokyo.   
  
I'd also suggest people watch Twelve Kingdoms, an excellent high fantasy show where basically the entire world is dictated by a literal Mandate of Heaven.  
  
Also people should watch From the New World. I'm honestly not sure how to describe it, I went in completely blind and loved it so that's what I'd recommend. "
Steins;Gate 0,"Death Note: 37 episodes, and is an amazing thriller from start to finish. Episode 2 is where I got hooked. IT’S SO GOOD!"
Steins;Gate 0,"Code Geass

Gurren Lagann"
Steins;Gate 0,"Darker than black, season 1."
Steins;Gate 0,"You've recommended some of the most serious and can be seen as boring or too slow anime.  Not saying they are bad, but for a new viewer it would imo be awful to start with these.  I would rather recommend some light-hearted ones like One Punch Man, Konosuba, or Hinamatsuri."
Steins;Gate 0,"Steins;Gate is so good, Okabe speaking with the american dude gets me everytime"
Steins;Gate 0,[deleted]
Steins;Gate 0,Does no one like Death Note?!? Faak epic cat and mouse with wicked characters and writing. So so good. 
Steins;Gate 0,"I can wholeheartedly recommend Mob Psycho. Very funny, incredible art style, subverting expectations left and right... it's probably my favorite thing ever.

Nice shoutout to Mushishi by the way, [the soundtrack is one of my all-time favorites.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkpT3eS001M)"
Steins;Gate 0,no psycho pass or hunter x hunter? 
Steins;Gate 0,"I would recommend Berserk and Parasyte, as a former lover of anime that doesnt really like the medium anymore, I liked these. Technolyze and Lain are great too, more akin to horror japanese movies than to anime (Ergo Proxy is good but too much of a mess). Most anime I cant stand anymore cause it seems too silly to me, too infantile, and their approach to sexuality and love is frankly stupid most of time. Id also recommend Welcome to the Nhk."
Steins;Gate 0,"See the problem with all the anime I love is that they aren't very friendly to newcomers.

If you can stomach the ethical discussion in the first seasons on raising farm animals from birth only to eat them, I highly recommend ""Silver Spoon."" The characters are likable, the setting is interesting (protagonist goes to a high school that teaches you how to farm & he's the only one that doesn't come from a farming family) & Hachiken's dilemma at what he wants to do with his life after high school is relatable."
Steins;Gate 0,"I'm not an Anime guy at all, but I watched Made in Abyss on Amazon Prime and LOVED it. Highly recommend it."
Steins;Gate 0,"I mean there's a lot I could list and there's some other great suggestions in this thread (although there are a few I'd consider a bit too *anime-y* for first timers), so here's a lesser known slightly niche suggestion for you: **Beck: Mongolian Chop Squad.**


It's a relatively realistic anime about a teen who through a chance meeting is drawn into the world of Japanese rock music, and it follows him as he learns to play guitar and eventually form a band.


Not a mind-blowing synopsis but it's a great show with some great relatable characters and it's just an amazing journey overall. One small caveat is there is some *really* bad Engrish in the original sub, but I would recommend the sub over the dub due to the musical nature of the show, especially concerning a song near the end which the dub couldn't get rights to.


The main reason I'm suggesting this is because an old friend of mine recommended this show to another friend of ours who hated anime, but was a big music-head. This show was the one that changed his mind. He didn't turn into a giant weeb or anything, but it showed him they're not all Pokemon and Naruto."
Steins;Gate 0,Ghost in the Shell? Evangelion?
Steins;Gate 0,"Baccano is my favourite anime.

Big cast if great characters with brilliantly interrelated stories spanning various time frames. Amazing underscore, over the top violence and a great 1920s New York back drop."
Steins;Gate 0,"Kudos for mentioning MIA and Mushi-shi.

Just watched MIA, disturbingly beautiful anime and can't wait for the sequel and seeing the deeper layers of the abyss. "
Steins;Gate 0,"I do not understand why Steins Gate is so well regarded. I pushed through it because it is at the top of so many best anime lists, but I just don’t get it. The first 12 episodes (out of 24!) are just setup for the premise. Then it suddenly picks up the pace and has some payoff but nothing that made it worth the time for me. Maybe I’m missing something. "
Steins;Gate 0,Log Horizon. Go watch it now
Steins;Gate 0,"I would add, 

Ping pong (might be on Netflix) has a very off-putting anime style, but the show is one of my favourites and has only 13 episodes so not too much of a commitment. More of a reflection on passion, skill and love for the game than about the game itself. To this day, I think it's one of the best shows I've ever seen, not just anime, like it's there with stuff like Fargo and true detective as miniseries.

Kuroko no Basuke - this is more mainstream anime about elite Basketball players playing in a tournament. It has no grounding in reality, but if you've ever played basketball this show is the tits. Lots of crazy things happen and there's a lot of subtext about what it's like to be elite at a sport.

One punch man - one of my favourite shows, just due to the sheer hilarity of it and the excellent character design and physical comedy. Follows Saitama, a hero who can defeat anyone with one punch and the various hijinks of his world. Some really great animation for the fight scenes.

Samurai champloo & cowboy bebop - famous anime, and bebop, despite being from 1999 or so, feels very modern. Heavily stylized too, with jazz for bebop and rap for champloo. Mostly one shot episodes with occasional season long plots.

Hunter X Hunter - it's a very long anime, but it's absolutely fantastic. Follows Gon a kid trying to find his dad by becoming a Hunter and has very memorable characters, but above all, very memorable villains and fantastic world building and arcs. 

dragon Ball z abridged (available on YouTube) - it's a fantastic recreation of the beloved anime series with more humour and less filler. Also available for free.

Sword Art Online Abridged - also YouTube, the original had a cool concept that was made horrendously boring and the abridged series fixes a lot of that"
Steins;Gate 0,"I wouldn't recommend anyone watch Monster honestly. I read it and liked it a lot. I tried watching the show and couldn't get through two episodes because as far as I could tell it was a 100 percent accurate remake of the manga with okay animation and was really slow paced.

If you're interested, just read the manga."
Steins;Gate 0,"RahXephon

Evangelion (obligatory)

"
Steins;Gate 0,Any recommendations for high school comedy like fmp:fumoffu?
Steins;Gate 0,"Made in Abyss is pretty hard to recommend to any non-Anime fan due to its art style alone. I like it, but it's also a very anime story that I don't know would resonate too well with non-fans.

I thought Cross Ange was pretty amazing. It starts off a little cringey with it's rapey, girl jail thing, and I even put it down for a bit, but its story gets pretty awesome and there's a lot of character grown too. It's hard to go into any detail of the story without spoilers, but it opens in a world where most people have magic and want for nothing. But some don't and those people are not considered human and exiled from society."
Steins;Gate 0,"If you're into fun sci-fi, you may like Oban Star Racers. "
Steins;Gate 0,So you're saying *Mushi-Shi: Next Passage* got a dub?  Or do you just mean the original show?
Steins;Gate 0,Monster has the potential to be made by HBO or someone into a top award winning show.  Would be great source material for loose/tight adaption.  
Steins;Gate 0,I watch a lot of anime but everytime I try to watch the first episode of steins gate I lose interest but im really trying to watch it.
Steins;Gate 0,"Is there a good source to legally stream these anime? I'm in the US, I have Netflix and Prime, are there any other good sources?"
Steins;Gate 0,"I second Steins;Gate, so damn good. I'd add One Punch Man, it's the perfect anime for a non anime watcher. HxH is king of the crop as far as shonen jumps goes, but you can't go wrong with My Hero Academia either. If you like crime/murder mysteries Death Note is right up your alley. "
Steins;Gate 0,I'll add Planetes to the list
Steins;Gate 0,Can confirm Mushishi & Monster are insanely underrated animes
Steins;Gate 0,"Everyone I've shown *Shirokuma Cafe* loves it. It's about a lazy panda who gets a part-time job at a zoo as a panda. Also he hangs out a cafe ran by a Polar Bear. And there's a George Costanza-style Penguin who frequents the shop.

It's hilarious and adorable."
Steins;Gate 0,"I think you should define what an OVA is. Even as an anime fan myself I still don’t know how to define what it’s supposed to be, so people who are entirely new to anime might not know for sure."
Steins;Gate 0,There has been a blow up in discussions about anime?
Steins;Gate 0,Apart from Monster and Mushishi those are some creepy otaku pandering shows
Steins;Gate 0,[deleted]
Steins;Gate 0,"Part 3 of Jojo’s anime is a massive drag, though. It’s twice as long as it should be. Lots of iconic moments sprinkled in those episodes, but the villain of the week trope gets pushed to its limits. Everything else is golden though. 

Speaking of which, Golden Wind is this October so it’s a perfect time to catch up with the series. "
Steins;Gate 0,"Care to elaborate why that is? I still haven't finished fate/zero and Violet Evergarden and I haven't watched Psycho Pass yet because I hear the 2nd season is trash, so I can't add them to the list without a good reason why they're as good as shows such as Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, The Sopranos etc."
Steins;Gate 0,I've been stuck on episode 12 of Shinsekai Yori for months now. Is this where the good part of the show kicks in?
Steins;Gate 0,"Like I said in the disclaimer I'm not gonna mention shows everybody knows about (Code Geass). 

I know everybody loves Gurren Lagann but i just think that the Mecha genre just isn't for me. I was promised the most hype anime out there and there was only one hype moment that hyped me even a little (i've only watched through the first 13 episodes so maybe that's the reason why)"
Steins;Gate 0,Pionts for Code... waiting for season 3
Steins;Gate 0,"One Punch Man is probably one of the best shows I've ever seen but IMO it's less funny/brilliant when you're less aware of anime/manga tropes. 

I think the more someone's been exposed to anime, the more they'd appreciate it."
Steins;Gate 0,I never said that these are beginner friendly. I just listed off the ones that i think are as good as the best of the best that Western TV has to offer.
Steins;Gate 0,I know it's kinda cliche but [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYvhhMjW32k) made me laugh even more
Steins;Gate 0,"SPOILERS FOR S3 - i cried so much when they won. When Tsukishima and Hinata were pinned to ground by Ushijima pressing on their heads with his hands (figuretivly ofcourse) to show how much pressure they were on and their teammates lifting him off of them one by one got to me also. I also cried when Tsukishima finally got ""that"" moment  in his life to have him hooked on volleyball. I did not expect him to become one of my favorite character in the anime, in fact he was my least favorite up until season 3.

Which season was your favorite? I guess you can tell which one is mine."
Steins;Gate 0,I think OP was recommending anime most casual viewers may not have heard of. Death Note is on the same tier of popularity as FMA and Attack on Titan.
Steins;Gate 0,It went from being overrated to underrated
Steins;Gate 0,Turns to shite after a certain episode where [spoilers] happens
Steins;Gate 0,"HxH is amazing but it strikes me a bit as advanced watching. Like I don't think i would start anyone new to anime out on it. Shounen is already gonna be kiddie seeming to a lot of people, and even though HxH rapidly evolves into something greater than the sum of its parts, newer fans might not give it the chance it deserves. Plus there are just an offputtingly large number of episodes. "
Steins;Gate 0,Psycho-pass rocks!!!
Steins;Gate 0,"Haven't watched Psycho Pass yet because I'm afraid I'll love the 1st season and then I'd have to skip out on season 2 because I hear it's crap and I really don't want that to happen.

Regarding Hunter X Hunter like I said to /u/tylerhockey12 it's super mainstream. It's on Toonami, I knew about it before I even started watching anime and my friend from school knew about it even though he only watches mainstream stuff so you know where I'm getting at. I did like it a lot and I would put it on this list if it wasn't so well known"
Steins;Gate 0,"Don't you dare disrespect Beck's dub. It's easily the the best English dubbed anime. Most of the music is the same. I do agree with that one episode towards the end, flip to the Japanese version for the song then switch back."
Steins;Gate 0,How are people still seeing this post?
Steins;Gate 0,I've only heard it's good but nothing special. Care to explain why you think it's better than other isekai series? I might add it if you can explain why it's a masterpiece in your eyes.
Steins;Gate 0,.hack//Sign was better.
Steins;Gate 0,"If you loved One Punch Man I would suggest watching Mob Psycho 100. It's made by the same mangaka, but the anime is made by a different studio than One Punch Man (Studio Bones, which has adapted shows like FMA:B, My Hero Academia, Soul Eater, Noragami etc.)

A lot of people say it's better than One Punch Man"
Steins;Gate 0,"+1 Ping Pong. Great soundtrack, the art style meshes nicely with the show, even if it does seem a bit quirky at first. It captures a nice, upbeat melancholy."
Steins;Gate 0,"For dragon ball z I recommend watching the actual series before the abridged version. It kind of ruins some of the jokes if you haven’t seen the show. The kai version is available on adult swims website. However it’s the last third of the series the parts dnd abridged don’t have. I’m sure you can find it or the original somewhere. 

I agree with you on sword art online though. "
Steins;Gate 0,We are trying to get people to watch basically starter anime here. No one who reads manga needs to be told about Steins Gate or Monster. 
Steins;Gate 0,I haven't read the manga yet so i didn't know this. Maybe i should've read the manga first.
Steins;Gate 0,Scaflowne
Steins;Gate 0,Evangelion and Akira are quintessential anime classics and I recommend them to anyone who wants a little more substance to pick through.
Steins;Gate 0,Great Teacher Onizuka
Steins;Gate 0,School Rumble. Lots of pop culture references and Japanese humor. This is my go to anime comedy. Fumoffu is great just too short for me
Steins;Gate 0,"Haven't watched FMP so i don't know what kind of humor it has, but i love Nichijou. It uses slapstick humor so I don't know if that's your thing, but if it is i would definitely give that a watch.  "
Steins;Gate 0,Disastrous Life of Saiki K is one of the best comedy animes I've watched recently. 
Steins;Gate 0,No only the first season sadly
Steins;Gate 0,Apparently Guillermo del Toro was in talks with HBO to make a live action adaptation of Monster with del Toro directing a few years back. But sadly HBO passed on the project and there's been no news since. 
Steins;Gate 0,It took me like a third of the series to get into it. The beginning's really slow.
Steins;Gate 0,Crunchyroll 
Steins;Gate 0,"A lot of them are on Hulu, some of them may be on Netflix. Crunchyroll should have almost all of them."
Steins;Gate 0,Wow it's got grade A voice actors. I did not expect that from an anime I never heard of before.
Steins;Gate 0,How many of them have you watched?
Steins;Gate 0,Cringe for recommending shows? Fuck off.
Steins;Gate 0,"Part 3 almost made me drop JoJo, but the last few episodes brought me back in, and Part 4 made me fall back in love with the franchise."
Steins;Gate 0,"i haven't seen steins gate but why is it considered a masterpiece if literally, half the episodes are boring? (according to most fans) "
Steins;Gate 0,"Violet Evergarden is a journey, each episode makes you feel volumes for the main character and the side characters story.   It is basically about a girl without emotions due to trauma regaining her humanity after a lot of loss.  It is an emotional roller coaster. 

Psycho Pass is basically a futuristic cop show but it is pretty unique.   Humanity has created a machine to judge your sanity and if you reach a certain threshold then you are arrested.  It is designed to stop murder and other crime but it doesn’t stop it.  It just creates a different type of villain.  

Fate/zero is set in a world where magic exists butt hey keep it secret from most of the world.  There is a secret battle where magicians call upon heroic spirits to battle it out.  The last one standing wins the holy grail that will grant you one wish.   I can’t do this series justice.  The battles are amazing, characters are really fleshed out well and at the end what you win might not be exactly what you think it is. "
Steins;Gate 0,I don't think I've ever watched any anime series that would stand up to shows like those.
Steins;Gate 0,"> and I haven't watched Psycho Pass yet because I hear the 2nd season is trash

Not as good as the first? I can give the critics that.

But trash? The people saying that are being babies.

I myself enjoyed the second season of *Psycho-Pass*. While of course it doesn't live up to the fantastic first season there's enough there to get a kick out of. For example it seems like a lot of the main plot is tied into questions people might have after seeing the first season."
Steins;Gate 0,"Fate/Zero is a hard one to recommend immediately to people new to anime just because they at least should likely be familiar with the basics of the Holy Grail War, which are better spelled out over Fate/Stay Night.  

I mean I love that show a ton, but trying to tell them about the crazy rules that universe has might be a bit initially demanding. "
Steins;Gate 0,wut about HUNTER X HUNTER? 
Steins;Gate 0,And you think fucking Clannad is as good as Breaking Bad? bruh
Steins;Gate 0,"I think Psycho Pass is probably worth it just for the 1st season, it's a pretty neat sci-fi premise. And you basically can't add anything if it needs to be on BB,GoT or Sopranos level."
Steins;Gate 0,"I'd say it probably goes into high-gear around episode 17, though the arc from episode 12 and episode 16 is interesting in its own right and gives you an idea of what comes next. It's definitely a slow show, but the last 8 episodes deliver such a great payoff that it more than makes up for all the setup (which in hindsight may have been something I should've mentioned in my original recommendation). "
Steins;Gate 0,"Oh cool, well thanks for those suggestions up there. I'm going to watch at least two of them."
Steins;Gate 0,"Gurren Lagan is an exception.  It is an anime with me ha in it, the mecha is just a part of the anime.  "
Steins;Gate 0,Thats the one i was talking about lol
Steins;Gate 0,"I'll go against this a bit. I've showed it to two people and they both really liked it; my girlfriend who has seen a couple animes but not a lot, and my sister who has only seen DBZ and Attack On Titan. It seems to play well anyway right."
Steins;Gate 0,I don't think I'll ever watch Hunter X Hunter. I read up until the chimera arc and tried watching some of the anime but it moves so slow compared to the manga.
Steins;Gate 0,this is very true 
Charité,"We've gone mainstream, initiate protocol omega"
Charité,"Useless facts: Peaky Blinders series became popular in Brazil (who gets most of the portuguese viewers) this year because of a guy from Big Brother Brazil who cut his hair like Thomas Shelby and said it was because of show, which is one of his favorites."
Charité,Better call saul nailed it with the latest season.
Charité,Good for Community.
Charité,"""Money Heist"" was always such a stupid translation. What was wrong with just calling it ""House of Paper""? It would lose the 0.2% of potential viewers who didn't realise what it was about?"
Charité,/u/wikirank please do this every month
Charité,Japan dgaf about foreign shows lol
Charité,"Money Heist has got to be the most average show to his this level of popularity. 

Every single episode follows the same exact formula. Issue happens —> Characters talk about feelings or flashbacks —> Professor says something —> More talks about feelings —> Show an outside authority and how corrupt they are —> The episodes conflict is resolved in a second —> Put a cheesy cliffhanger for next episodes. 

Rinse and repeat. 

And then all seasons are the carbon copy of the ones before. Seriously.

This show’s success always amazes me. Such incredibly low quality writing and boring events outside of S1."
Charité,"With all the walking dead hate I see all the time here, how did it make it to top 10? Lol"
Charité,Ozark is so damn good!
Charité,Prison Break and Suits are kind of surprising.
Charité,You’d definitely see this list dominated by Game of Thrones if it ended better. I’m surprised to even see it in the bottom 5
Charité,"Koh-Lanta isn't a TV series, it's the French version of the Survivor reality show."
Charité,The world of the married is pretty good and a complete clusterfuck. It is based after the BBC’s Dr Foster
Charité,I never even heard of Money Heist - is this actually any good or just trash?
Charité,So I guess I need to go see what money heist is... Never even heard of it till now
Charité,"The top 3 in Spanish wiki is exactly what I was expecting, but totally didn't expect The Good Doctor at #4."
Charité,TIL there’s a Japanese version of *Suits*.
Charité,"Money Heist is a such a USA series like Burn Notice,Suits etc. Extremely predictable but fun fluff"
Charité,*Supernatural* is truly large in Russia lol. The only country where it cracked the top 10.
Charité,Star Trek Picard being on any popular list is laughable.
Charité,Damn
Charité,"i've heard there is a cult of the show there, a fandom seems more likely though."
Charité,Prior?
Charité,First time they've had a season with any kind of pace to it. I love the show but the pacing is glacial.
Charité,Good news for a potential movie too.
Charité,Is the show any good after S3?
Charité,[deleted]
Charité,I suppose they thought people would confuse it with House of Cards
Charité,Wow is Money Heist that good though? I didn’t realize it was THIS popular. May need to check it out.
Charité,"It's not translated in France so everyone knows it as ""la casa de papel"". And they sometimes translate series or movies name. I don't know when they choose to do so or not. Probably depends if the name is easy to say or to understand.

They did translate it in Québec though but kept the ""House of Paper"" meaning."
Charité,"I actively put off watching it for the longest time because of the title. Also, the clunkiness of the phrase 'Money Heist' (like what else are you going to steal in  a heist but money? - although it makes sense when watching the show) made me presume the quality of any translation would be poor, which isn't actually the case."
Charité,"in Germany its called The House of Money, which is okay I guess"
Charité,Wouldn't Paperhouse also work?
Charité,It’s a dumb translation but doesn’t take anything away from the show itself
Charité,Maybe English copyright issues.
Charité,"""House of Paper"" makes it sound like either a spinoff or rip-off of House of Cards, *or* some contemplative, slow, period drama about upper class women dreading their place in society in early Edwardian England."
Charité,"If it wasn't called Money Heist, I probably would never have watched it."
Charité,Cause you try to translate it into the most eye-grabbing name that tells you what the show is about.
Charité,they're in their own world over there
Charité,"I absolutely agree with you but it's interesting to see that it somehow has a very international appeal. I find their formula boring too, but I wonder if it's something else that is making it universally appealing."
Charité,I think it's just another case of reddit living in it's own reality
Charité,Sunk cost fallacy
Charité,The last season of prison break takes place in the middle east...I wonder if thats why?
Charité,"Prison Break just came onto Australian Netflix, was number 7 in Australia all last week. I imagine it's the same for a few other countries."
Charité,And it's a year old now!
Charité,Survivor is a TV series though
Charité,The first two seasons are good imo. Entertaining even if a lot of things don't make any sense at all. But I think is never boring.
Charité,"No, it's legit pretty good, not gonna win emmys, but its not trash"
Charité,Shit yourself.
Charité,Sim
Charité,Depends on what you know you're getting into. I found it slow but not glacial. It's one of the few shows where I just love people talking.
Charité,#sixseasonsandamovie
Charité,S4 is rough but I enjoy S5 and 6 quite a bit. And the finale is really great.
Charité,"Mindlessly browsing Netflix is a whole lot easier than Pirating. No ads, no risk of virus, just one click and you’re watching the show."
Charité,Forget pirating..it has been on Hulu for years!
Charité,"Pirating is when you have no money and a lot of time. When you have enough money and not enough time, you just subscribe to Netflix."
Charité,"I would think it's a rip-off probably, if I was just scrolling through"
Charité,"How about ""The Paper House""?

Or maybe even ""La Casa de Papel"", which I believe was actually its Netflix title for like the first week it was available."
Charité,"I don’t think so. It’s not bad, it’s alright. But this is just measuring popularity, it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s *uhmayzing*."
Charité,"First 2 seasons were good.3rd was average and the 4th was a dissaster.

You can watch the first 2 seasons and stop there since  the series was supposed to be only 2 seasons.Maybe thats the reason why the writing started to get bad."
Charité,"You won't get a good answer in /r/television

It is good/great TV, there's a reason its so popular. Its engaging and doesn't require much thinking on your part. Not every show needs to be a Westworld/Better Call Saul."
Charité,"Going against almost every comment here and say that I like this show a lot more than Reddit’s favorites such as Better Call Saul. Besides What We Do In The Shadows it’s probably the only thing I have genuinely enjoyed watching while in quarantine. Last season of West World was fairly disappointing. Granted I am biased, I have been to Spain a lot and am myself Spanish. Yeah it’s not The Wire (and neither is Better Call Saul/Breaking Bad) but it is very good."
Charité,"Season 4 was straight trash.Writing,acting,music everything.They should have stopped at 2 seasons."
Charité,Rude
Charité,Kkkkkkkkk percebi que ela ficou muito popular do nada aqui mas não sabia que era por isso
Charité,"Fun fact: he said this in reference to the one-season The Cape.  I liked that show, but perhaps maybe not as much."
Charité,If you know what youre doing there are no ads and no risk of virus also but that said I still enjoy having netflix to find new stuff I wouldnt have sought out.
Charité,[deleted]
Charité,"I have a private site with none of those features and everything comes on there about half an hour after it airs.

I still barely pirate stuff.

Cable costs me a dollar, Netflix and Disney plus aren’t expensive."
Charité,In the US. Netflix added Community globally.
Charité,[deleted]
Charité,"I feel the same. Saw first season, and it was quite predictable. Didn't get why it was so overhyped."
Charité,[deleted]
Charité,Already the 2nd one was already disappointing
Charité,">You won't get a good answer in /r/television

Proceeds to give good enough answer"
Charité,But Westworld is garbage.
Charité,Apparently I'm the only one that liked season 4 of Money Heist.  AMA
Charité,#NeckbeardRage
Charité,"I think it's moreso that it would be easier for me to obtain the actual legal rights to something I want to watch, than it would be to teach somebody like my mother how to pirate a movie."
Charité,"Its not about being lazy, a lot of people  maybe have an interest in watching something but dont care enough to seek it out and are happy to just wait for it to come to a streaming service and just have a look at whats available at the present."
Charité,"Almost everything is easily available though (generally speaking, I don't know about your specific country). Anything not on Netflix will be on Prime Video, HBO or on any other streaming platforms, or on iTunes, Google Play, Amazon Prime Store, Youtube movies, you name it.  So we're back to the money question.

Except in rare cases, it's not about availability, not anymore. That was true 10 years ago."
Charité,Being predictable isn't a bad thing
Charité,I could go into specifics but i dont wanna give spoilers.
Charité,"To each his own,but if you already dislike 2nd season you should definitely not waste your time on the 3rd and 4th."
Charité,Why is it garbage? I completely disagree
Charité,"SPOILERS! DONT GO AHEAD IF YOU DIDNT WATCH SEASON 4.



1.How could Tokyo(not a surgeon) save Nairobi from a sniper shot even with an surgeon guiding her? beside the fact that the they lost the connection with the surgeon and Tokyo had to do it alone.No matter how much the proffesor trained her 6ou do not go from a normal person to a surgeon that does high risk surgeries.

2.Why go thru all this fuss to save Nairobi for in the end to kill her? If you let her die when she was shot the first time,she died with a purpose,Nairobi wanting to see how her child looks but instead she died cowardly getting shot by that special agent.

3.All those scenes with the special agents were like an action movie in which the main character will not die no matter what.And yeah i understand that he was a renown agent but if they wanted to make him powerful they could have done it by making him take smart decisions(tactics)instead of him surving 500 shots.How did that dude not get shot in that scene when he was in the middle and was shot at by both sides,one from the elevator one from the other side? and it wasnt just 3 bullets or 10,it was like 300.Yeah he had a bulletprof vest and helmet but still.

Another Rambo scene is with Nairobi when she died.The special agent tells her that she gonna get shot and the crew just stand by and watches him shot here.After that the crew shot at him but it appears out of 7 people with assault rifles nobody could shot him.

4.Music and sound effects were trash.

5.They could have ended the show in this season but they decided to do another for $$$ and because of this the season felt so slow that i was doing something else while watching it.

6.The development in relationships sucked too.

7.I get it that Berlin was one of the best character in the first 2 seasons,but they have to let him go.Its cool to get 1 or 2 scenes with him after he died but having 35% flashes of the past just straight sucks.

8.There was so more things to talk about but i forget about them since i watched the season a month and a half ago.This season felt like a combination of soap opera and a blockbuster action movie.The only ones who will like this type of season are the ones who are under 15 and like watching series like Riverdale,Arrow, etc.If you are 18+ and watched lots of series like The wire,The Sopranos,Dark,Mr.Robot etc that actually has good writing you will find this series garbage."
Charité,What you described is a lazy attitude.
Charité,It kills suspense and feels pointless to watch if it's not done right imo
Charité,Completely agree. S2 was so bad that I didn't keep watching and wish I hadn't even begun watching
Charité,"> felt like a combination of soap opera and a blockbuster action movie

I think you've figured out why Money Heist is so popular"
Charité,"No its not. Not everyone cares about tv shows that much. Saying ""I'm interested in watching community so I'll wait for it to come to netflix"" doesnt mean someone is lazy, it means they're not desperate to watch it right now. Believe it or not, people can enjoy tv shows but also its not something they spend a ton of their time doing, so watching if its there vs actively spending time seeking it out on a feasible viewing platform is a decisions based on interests and not laziness. Im an example of that, I love iasip but I spend my time doing other things generally and watch tv shows during dinner etc... so it works better for me to wait for it because I'm not in any rush to see new episodes when they're released."
Charité,"That is *so* fucking weird man. You can download new episodes an hour after they air in like 5m max depending on internet speed, then stream them to your smart TV and watch them. It's the definition of lazy, especially on good shows like IASIP."
Charité,How is it hard to understand that tv shows aren't a priority to everyone? Like how is it not clear that I don't care about watching new episodes of a tv show an hour after they air? I enjoy tv shows but they're not at the top of my list of activities. The definition of lazy would be if I was absolutely desperate watch new episodes but couldn't be bothered to look for them. Thats completely different to where tv fits into my life.
Charité,"Agree to disagree. I only want to watch (what I consider) the best of the best. And I do that searching online, reading certain critics lists, etc. Then I actively seek it out. If I'm just browsing Netflix I would settle for mediocrity most of the time. Which doesn't seem to be a problem for many people, but it is to me. Like Tiger King, basically a documentary, but lots of people gushing about this great new show that was out on Netflix. It's not. It's a mediocre documentary from mediocre filmmakers that, while probably slightly entertaining, is not worth 8 hours of my life. But hey, it's convenient, and it's on Netflix! So that's an easy watch for all the sheep."
Charité,"We're not agreeing to disagree here though, you're literally not understanding that 1) not everyone cares about tv shows as much as you and 2) ""the best of the best"" is entirely subjective. I love iasip but if someone else thinks its trash then they're entitled to their opinion. They might love tiger king and not iasip but it doesn't mean they've ""settled for mediocrity"" it just means they have different tastes.

Im normally all for agreeing to disagree but you're trying to call people lazy and your definition of lazy is wrong."
Charité,"A lot of people also think 5G causes coronavirus or Trump is a good president. They're also wrong. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but that doesn't make them less wrong in certain cases. There are shows just objectively better than others. If someone tells me they like Friends better than The Leftovers, or The Vampire Diaries over Better Call Saul, they invalidate their entire vision on the medium."
Charité,"What a ridiculous comment mate. There's objective facts to discredit the first two ""opinions"". What someone enjoys watching on tv is completely subjective. You could write a thesis on why one show is objectively ""better"" than another. But it makes zero difference if someone simply doesn't enjoy watching it. It doesn't make them lazy. 

Again, its all down to why you watch tv, different tv shows exist for different reasons and to be watched in different ways. Your view is just so elitist. Your opinion is worth as much or as little as anyone else's."
Charité,"Sure, man. A guitar player that has experience playing for 10 years knows way more about the instrument than a beginner that played a week. Just like someone that has watched way more TV and seeks out the best knows way more about TV than a casual ""I'll watch whatever's on"" type character. Characters and their development, cinematography, acting, dialogue, pacing, symbolism; all kinds of objective standards you can measure. Most casual watchers don't even think about dialogue and character development, they just take it at face value. Which is fine, some people want to just be entertained. But it is an actual art form, and people with background in film that have more of a grasp on how to grade TV shows definitely know more than casual watchers. Why do you think the job of TV critic exists? Stop blurting nonsense and accept that how good a show is is not the same as people's enjoyment of it. Lots of people enjoy watching Friends, but is it a great show? Definitely not."
Charité,"Stop blurting out completely unrelated and nonsensical comparisons that don't work. The point is on taste, it doesn't matter how much tv you've watched, or how ""educated"" you think your taste is, your initial point was that people settle for mediocrity and are lazy because they don't seek out ""better"" shows. In entertainment, it doesn't matter how much ""better"" a tv show is, if someone simply doesn't enjoy it then they're not ""settling for mediocrity"" or ""lazy"" by watching something that you wouldn't perceive as being on the same level. 

An example for me would be Hannibal, I can tell its an amazingly well written, acted, shot show. Everything about it is fantastic, but it was only okay in my personal viewing experience. I enjoyed it but despite how technically impressive it is, I only enjoyed it and that's it. I'm probably more likely to watch friends over Hannibal. That doesn't invalidate my opinion and it lends credence to the fact that shows serve different purposes.

To your pointless guitar playing point, I've played guitar for over 10 years and I'm objectively better techincally than someone thats played for 6 months. But if someone enjoys listening to the other person play more than me then it's nothing to do with them being lazy or whatever, its just naturally what they enjoy hearing."
The Dragon Dentist,"Another way to write this headline 
“HBO had the biggest hits on TV for 2nd consecutive year”"
The Dragon Dentist,"HBO needs to teach their movie counterparts (WB) the importance of screenwriters, because they’re the ones responsible for delivering quality! HOTD and TLOU are so damn good!"
The Dragon Dentist,Maybe this will make execs notice you should be hiring writers who love your ip and not writers who hate it/just use it as a vehicle for their own shit ideas.
The Dragon Dentist,"Sony to Neil be like ""please make part 3, we have consoles to sell & more money to make!"""
The Dragon Dentist,"I knew it!

&#x200B;

Second season, just like Dragon, is gonna be huge, man HBO just doesn't miss."
The Dragon Dentist,"Well deserved.

I for one am so happy they didn't mess with the story.  Too many adaptations just do lip service to the source material and end up being completely different.  This just upsets the existing fanbase, especially when the adaptation is bad to boot.    Here they had a stellar story and didn't mess with it often recreating scenes that were near identical to the game.    It was so awesome seeing it come to life without significant changes other than cutting things for brevity.    

Here's hoping they do the second game similar justice as it's story is just as worthy of being adaptated straight up though I can see how they might tinker with way they tell the story in that they'll show the stories of the dual protagonists at the same time rather than separately."
The Dragon Dentist,"Discovery really underestimated HBO, I hope this means that they aren't going to try and control more in the merger and still take risks on shows."
The Dragon Dentist,"You know what's the best feeling in the world after every good news about this show? 

It's knowing that the salt mine that is The Last of Us 2 subreddit are seething with hate. Absolutely love it. 

Good news. Can't wait for season 2."
The Dragon Dentist,"HBO needs to pick up the Witcher man, which they won’t do because they have Westeros, but I still dream of what could have been"
The Dragon Dentist,"TLOU is a rare example of a big production team having respect and understanding for the source material. Most of the time, Hollywood follows the business model of  taking a generic script and sticking a known IP in it to gain publicity (see- Halo TV)."
The Dragon Dentist,"I played the game a couple times. Once on ps3 and then ps4. But I didn’t it so long ago I was able to watch the show and not know exactly what was going to happen scene to scene or what was change or the same. The game definitely has you feeling more attached to Ellie and Joel together as you play as Joel and it’s your job to keep Ellie safe. So some of the stuff in the show didn’t hit the same. Also, I found when I played the game I sided with Joel almost fully. Like he was doing the the wrong thing for the right reasons. But being removed from controlling him and watching it play out on a tv show, I feel I got the intended effect. And it definitely makes Last of Us part II more obvious how that plays out."
The Dragon Dentist,"Damn. This is impressive.

Imagine how Halo show could’ve been if they actually respected the lore."
The Dragon Dentist,The writing has been superb.
The Dragon Dentist,"I liked TLOU wayyy more than HOTD and I’m saying this as someone who loves GOT and who didn’t play the TLOU game.

TLOU felt way more streamlined and easier to follow. Maybe it’s like not really comparable as they’re different thematically and stylistically, but I remember numerous times during HOTD being like “who’s that guy again?” Or “why are they doing this again?”

TLOU is solid storytelling and great acting. Coming into it with no background, my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed ourselves far more."
The Dragon Dentist,It’s a copycat industry so be on the lookout next year for the newest video game adaptation series: Turok Dinosaur Hunter on Showtime
The Dragon Dentist,Praise Druckmann. Well deserved achievement. It goes without saying that TLOU Season 1 has probably surpassed viewership records for Game of Thrones Season 1 when it first aired as well
The Dragon Dentist,"It’s a good show. The ending felt rushed and a bit of a flop for my wife who didn’t play the games. I think they could have done better with Joel thinking about everything, slap in a ton of flash backs and actually show the action more. 10 more minutes would have been great."
The Dragon Dentist,This is the way.
The Dragon Dentist,It’s because House of the Dragon didn’t cast Pedro Pascal
The Dragon Dentist,So for the fifth straight year some very vocal people who told me a show or a movie was going to bomb for being too woke were wrong? Say it ain't so....
The Dragon Dentist,"They really have to stretch. HOTD still had more peak viewers, but to make TLOU look better they have to go to ""full season viewers"".

Isn't it enough that TLOU did good? HOTD had almost 2 million more viewers on air date."
The Dragon Dentist,"I must applaud the show's comittement to the source material, but the execution left me wanting. I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as HotD.

Ellie not being able to swin paid off with her nearly drowning while trying to reach the hospital near the end of the game, but that was cut from the story. Instead we got a flashback, which explains why Ellie is immune, which undermines why it has to be Ellie that needs to die in order to produce a cure. 

Action setpiece, tense sequences where you sneak past Clickers, or move through spore-filled underground tunnels (which wouldn't work anyway, given how they changed the cordiceps), the show could have used more of those."
The Dragon Dentist,House of the Dragon season 2 and Last of Us season 2 are going to pull huge numbers is what you're telling me. HBO wins on both counts.
The Dragon Dentist,"While the show has been strong I feel like they’re making changes to make part 2 make more sense. So much deconstructing of Joel as a strong survivalist. Too much Ellie making jabs at Joel and not enough of Ellie and Joel bonding. It took 6+ episodes before we got any survival bonding. This show feels rushed and it feels like Druckman is changing so much just to make part 1 make part 2 make sense. Part 2 made so little sense vs part 1. 

I haven’t hated this but as I went through this show it got worse and worse imo. I am not looking forward to the less well received part of the Last of Us getting more love. This first season has felt rushed in ways."
The Dragon Dentist,"Great HBO, now do oryx and crake!"
The Dragon Dentist,HoTD > TLoU
The Dragon Dentist,"Don’t care, HOT D still better 👍

TLOU was pretty good but it didn’t really blow me away. A nice 7/10 show, maybe 8. Was never gripped like I was watching my Targ friends weekly"
The Dragon Dentist,"Kid asked me why did Marlene task a single man to deliver Ellie across the country when she managed to teleport there before them with a big armed crew?

I didn't know what to say"
The Dragon Dentist,"Man, I really hope HBO picks up a good Sci Fi IP. That would be the ultimate trio.

Bring back FIREFLY please"
The Dragon Dentist,"Its almost like HOTD becoming popular brought in more viewers for this show to do even better  🤔

This is why making well written content matters."
The Dragon Dentist,Bring back WestWorld!
The Dragon Dentist,"I never played the game or seen anyone do it.
So i didnt know what to expect when i started watching this series.
After the 2 first episodes i pre-ordered the PC release for the las of us, after 5 episodes i jumped on youtube and watched jacksepticeyes playtrough of the last of us 2.

I don't know why i never bothered earlier, but goddamn this is some good shit."
The Dragon Dentist,God I Hope so
The Dragon Dentist,Well deserved. The Last of Us is the better show with better source material and audiences clearly agree with that sentiment
The Dragon Dentist,How the hell?
The Dragon Dentist,"Unpopular opinion but to me this show was way overrated. Boring, characters making dumb decisions, like walking around unattentive. I enjoyed Raised by Wolves and From much more."
The Dragon Dentist,"As an experiment in turning a video game into a show, I thought The last of us was really great sometimes. The last episode however, did not work for me at all."
The Dragon Dentist,Pascal Power.
The Dragon Dentist,Now get the rights to Red Dead Redemption. Adapt the 2nd game first and then the 1st.
The Dragon Dentist,"The most overhyped tv show I've ever seen. Just wait, it's not even going to be close to House of the Dragon in terms of award nominations"
The Dragon Dentist,I'm happy these two shows got made but at the same time it makes it hurt even more seeing things like Wheel of Time and The Witcher with c tier writers with no respect for the source material.
The Dragon Dentist,"And people try to say that hbo is the worst streaming platform. HBO is by far the highest standard when it comes to making quality content, it’s not even close."
The Dragon Dentist,Is the season over yet? Can I pay for one month of HBO and watch it all at once?
The Dragon Dentist,if only they did halo correctly.
The Dragon Dentist,"hey, i didn’t have time to follow the show this last month, was it good?  did it feel like a video game movie addaptation?"
The Dragon Dentist,[deleted]
The Dragon Dentist,It was pretty lame compared to HOTD.
The Dragon Dentist,Its a much better show so thats great
The Dragon Dentist,Good
The Dragon Dentist,"Excellent, TLOU was so much better."
The Dragon Dentist,"Why does anyone care about this kind of thing? If it’s good it’s good, do we really need to know who’s watching which more?"
The Dragon Dentist,"It's a bit like comparing the heights of new NBA players to Minut Bol.  They are all frigging giants.

I'm just impressed that HBO has managed to keep its quality > quantity in an era that seems to be all going the latter (at least in terms of it's original scripted content, not so much the streaming service licensed content)."
The Dragon Dentist,The nice part about The Last of Us compared to House of the Dragon is that you can see things on your TV screen when you watch it.
The Dragon Dentist,Good. It was better.
The Dragon Dentist,"Well deserved. 

Craig Mazen does it again"
The Dragon Dentist,"Well deserved. Great casting, even greater writers."
The Dragon Dentist,Deserved. It's a better show.
The Dragon Dentist,"That’s crazy, as HotD was loads better, imo. It even came from the public falling out that was Got season 8."
The Dragon Dentist,"No surprise. HOTD was a pretentious, often boring disappointment. TLOU wasn't perfect but at least met my high expectations."
The Dragon Dentist,I honestly didn’t like house of the dragon but loved TLOU but that’s just my opinion
The Dragon Dentist,Was it really THAT good???
The Dragon Dentist,"Hype is a powerful thing.

I watched it all and thought it was okay. The game is superior."
The Dragon Dentist,"Almost as if respecting the source material has its pay offs. While HOTG’s been doing great job at sticking near the source material, the fuck up that was Game of Thrones season 8, has tarnished the brand’s reputation. IMHO."
The Dragon Dentist,My favorite thing about The Last of Us is that there were no late night misunderstandings that dropped the entire European country into a bloody war and made a family slowly kill each other over the course of decades which resulted in one of their descendants losing it 270 years down the line and burning a city down :)
The Dragon Dentist,"That's because ""The Last of Us"" wasn't a mediocre show trying its damnedest to ride the hype of a show that came out ten years ago."
The Dragon Dentist,Now let's get them to do an Uncharted series on HBO. Can Craig do comedy?
The Dragon Dentist,Good. Screw Game of Thrones and everything that spawned from it in the cinematic spectrum. They did us so freaking dirty with that last season.
The Dragon Dentist,"I couldn't finish HotD, got to episode 5 dragging my feet. I watched TloU every Sunday night, it was a better show for me personally, but I think my opinion is from a biased perspective, I played the game, but never read the story about HotD so felt less invested"
The Dragon Dentist,It's a vastly better show
The Dragon Dentist,Not surprised.  House of the Dragon was awful
The Dragon Dentist,I dropped off hard with House of Dragons. I got to episode 8 and just forgot about it.
The Dragon Dentist,"This season felt so rushed

Episode 3 spent too much time away from Joel and Ellie. That episode being longer than the finale is a shame

The lack of infected is a damn shame

Walking dead season 1 was much better"
The Dragon Dentist,"HoD sucks donkey balls.
That’s why."
The Dragon Dentist,"I didn't care for house of the dragon. Just didn't grab me. I feel like the only one. On the other hand, I loved TLOU."
The Dragon Dentist,Not watching any gOt spin-offs as revenge for season 8
The Dragon Dentist,I couldn’t get into either show. I think I’m over GOT and zombie type shit. I’d like to see more dramas about real life again. Plus that girl in The Last of Us just makes me want to turn of my television.
The Dragon Dentist,It was better.
The Dragon Dentist,It's worth pointing out that HotD went up head to head with NFL football
The Dragon Dentist,"fuck that game of thrones lite boring ass bullshit

this isnt even close"
The Dragon Dentist,HotD is the definition of mid and I'm tired of holding my tongue
The Dragon Dentist,This always ends each episode with a “OH NO!’ It’s always a long week until the next episode!
The Dragon Dentist,"Loved both.  HBO is back, baby."
The Dragon Dentist,"I can't watch shows like these. I have the attention span of a gnat and I get bored, really bored."
The Dragon Dentist,"Yeah, because house of the dragon sucked in comparison"
The Dragon Dentist,"If it keeps sticking close to the games, it’s going to jump from Game of Thrones Season 1 to Season 8, in only two seasons. I am a fan of the games, but The Last of Us Part 2 is a narrative dumpster fire."
The Dragon Dentist,What’s the appeal of the shitty incest show? Are people really that degenerate?
The Dragon Dentist,…. Because it is FUCKING AWESOME
The Dragon Dentist,Can’t wait for season 2
The Dragon Dentist,Fucking Obviously
The Dragon Dentist,"I’m still not really healed from how the last few seasons of GoT went, and House of the Dragon seemed played out by the time it started. I needed more substance than watching a show that uses soft core porn as it’s backbone. The Last of Us was one of the best shows I’ve seen in a while."
The Dragon Dentist,"Of course it did. It's a much better quality show. 

George RR Martin is done. Dont care about that man and his little universe anymore."
The Dragon Dentist,It was better than house of the dragon but doesn’t even compare to the game.
The Dragon Dentist,HOTD was awful. Just a politics show for the casual viewer.
The Dragon Dentist,Not bad for a show that is so boring.
The Dragon Dentist,…because it’s a much better show
The Dragon Dentist,"Yea bc house of dragons sucked
I’m surprised white lotus didn’t beat house of dragons"
The Dragon Dentist,They both have horribly unlikable main characters.
The Dragon Dentist,"If any HBO producer is reading this

Do you see what happens when you put effort and hire good writers?

But that doesn't mean we want a pletora of bad/mediocre zombies shows now, ok?"
The Dragon Dentist,"Yeah, It's still winter outside. House of the Dragon ran through the summer. Not very fair numbers."
The Dragon Dentist,"Fungos \&gt; dragões, simples."
